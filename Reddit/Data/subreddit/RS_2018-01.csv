I am in the my fourth year of schooling with three semesters left, and I feel like I barely scratched the surface. It took me three years to get my associates and I didn’t do anything related to CS in those three years. I transferred to what is essentially a no name university to try to get my CS degree in two years. This a sample final exam of Programming 1 that is close to the one I just took a couple of weeks ago. [This is the basis of what my knowledge consists of when it comes to CS.](https://goo.gl/vD75co) I will be taking Programming II next semester. I know I have to learn more languages, create a portfolio, and get into some internships. My current plan is to work(because of bills) and go to school until the summer, then get a summer internship and be very hopeful for a winter internship(if they exist) and finally graduate in Spring 2019. Problem is I don’t know where to start to make all of that happen(internship wise). When it comes to what I want to do when I graduate, I am up for anything that pays enough to support me and my family, but if I had to pick a job title it would be software engineer. I feel overwhelmed, and don’t think I have a lot of time left. Any help/tips is appreciated. 


TLDR: I know the basics of Java(half of it anyway,) and only have 3 semesters left with no internships or any other knowledge under my belt. Need help in where to get started to be fully employable when I graduate.

One of these labs was quite esteemed, and I have the opportunity to return. The kicker is that I have to email the lab PI in a few days if I want in. The problem is, right now I plan on majoring in computer engineering (I'm currently undeclared), so I kinda feel like this would be a waste of my time. I'm currently looking for internships, but since I'm a freshman I don't think it's that likely that I'll get one, especially since I don't have a ton of coding experience. I think the best thing for me to do right now is to wait a year and see what major I choose, and if I decide on BME/Pre-med or something of the sort I can return to the lab then. However, just like me my parents are worried that I won't land an internship. so they want me to return to the lab this summer. Any advice would be appreciated."

Right now I'm a senior Computer Science and Math double major that has just been hit by a family issue. My mother has been fired from her job and it looks like me and my brother are going to have to work to keep the place afloat. I've been working at a Math tutoring center over the last two weeks but the pay is really bad. I'd normally finish my CS degree next semester, but with how much time I spend at the tutoring center each week there's no way to be a full-time (or maybe even a part time) student at my uni and my degree would be stalled.

I have two questions. Is it too late to find a co-op for the Spring 2018 semester? I live in Washington DC if that helps. Also, would employers be willing to hire me for 20-30 hours per week? I've been reading online that employers highly prefer full time employees and don't trust part timers.

As for my experience, up until now I've been more on the research side of robotics. I have a research internship at an army laboratory, a decent GPA (3.3) and a publication at a robotics conference. Which means none of my experience may be industry-applicable. I don't really care what kind of job I can get, I just want something better than what I'm doing now."

7nfabj,212,2018-01-01,My New Year's Resolution has Changed Last Minute,Hayong,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7nfabj/my_new_years_resolution_has_changed_last_minute/,"Twenty-five minutes and I have to go. An odd amount of time, I know, but it’s honestly all I have before I have to head out and get away as far as I can.

I fucked up. No, that’s an understatement. I have not only ruined my life but five thousand other people as well.

It started at work this morning. I work for a company that develops app games. They started recently. About three months ago, a buddy of mine, Jimmy, was recruited by one of the owners and he heard about an easy job that would allow me to make double of what I make in sales. I’m not one of the developers, designers, or even an intern. I’m the janitor, but they still paid me well. My wife, Dani, was a little disappointed when she heard I would clean for a living, but her mood changed for the better as soon as I told her I would be making a little over $4500 a month.

The job was easy. I would come into work at around eight in the morning, and by two in the afternoon I would be done. It’s amazing how much closer I have gotten with my family because of this job. When I worked in sales, I would work thirteen-hour shifts, and I pretty much missed the first two years of my son’s life. Now, with my new lighter work schedule, I have been able to get closer to Dani and my son, Ryan, has become attached to me wherever I went. Hell, my boss even lets me bring my Ryan to work on some days. He had fun hanging out with Jimmy and playing a couple of the games Jimmy was working on.

Life was good up until today.

It started off like any other day.

I woke up, took a shower, ate a light breakfast, and got to work at 7:45.

Around 2:30 I was finishing up when I saw Jimmy standing behind me. He was swaying a bit. Like he had a little too much to drink before coming into work. With a chuckle, I asked him if he was feeling alright. He shook his head slowly and asked, **”Where’s Ryan? I haven’t seen him in a long time, and I have a new game I thought he would like to play.”**

Thrown off a bit, I nervously replied. *”Shit, Jimmy. He was with me the other day. You sure you’re alright, man? Didn’t get enough sleep last night?”*

He just stared at me for a couple of seconds before getting on his knees. He stretched his arms out dramatically before latching on to my legs and pleading, **”Don’t fucking go home. Don’t leave work. Please. Promise me, dude. Don’t fucking leave.”** I shook him off and quietly muttered, *”I gotta finish cleaning these floors. We’ll talk later.”*

I left around 3:20, and I managed to avoid Jimmy while I was leaving. I did manage to get a quick look at him without him noticing. He was softly banging his head against the desk. His lips were moving, but I couldn’t hear what he was saying. I started to walk out the door when I heard a blood-curdling scream. By the time I managed to turn back around towards Jimmy, I saw him lying on the ground. He was stabbing himself repeatedly in the midsection. Bits of intestines started to leak out of the bigger gashes. A couple of guys tried to run up to him, but before anyone could stop him, he let out a loud sob and started to rip the insides out of his body.

I don’t know why, but I ran out to my car as quickly as I could and drove back home.

I should have listened to his warning, but I refused to believe that my family was in any type of dangerous situation.

I ran into the house to find that no one was home. I called out my Dani’s name, but I was only met with silence. My phone started to vibrate. Without looking at who was calling, my finger accepted the call and I heard a muffled voice in the background. I knew it was Dani. Before I could say anything, a gruff voice on the other end asked, “Why didn’t you listen to Jimmy? If you just stayed at work I wouldn’t have had to do any of this. Since you were the first to leave, you will be our second experiment. It’s for a new game. We want to make it as **immersive** as possible, so we figured, hell, using real people in real situations will probably give us the best insight. Are you”

I cut him off and begged him to let me have my family back. I told him to take me instead, but he just laughed before saying, “No. You already know that’s not going to happen. Get ready. Go into your closet. You will see a backpack with plenty of resources. Of course, the more accomplishments you achieve, the better the prizes get. Don’t fail, or all three of you will die. You have three hours to get ready. Once the three hours is up, we will send you another call. Get in your car and drive as far away from home as you can. That way the chances of you getting caught are less.”

I tried asking him why I would need to be concerned about getting caught, but he hung up. The last thing I heard before he hung up was Ryan asking where I was.

That’s why I only have 25 minutes. I spent an hour running through my house trying to find everything that could help me with whatever the fuck I needed to do. The next hour was spent going to the bank and taking out all the money in my account. ($324) I suck at saving money. Thirty-five minutes was getting the bag out of the closet and getting everything in my car. The bag was pretty much shit. There was $8, two granola bars with the word “health” written on it, and three bottles of water.

Alright, I just got the warning call. Time for me to go.

It’s a new year. I guess I don’t really have a choice. Time for a new me.

7nfkdn,2,2018-01-01,Advice for a college senior,FF2701,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/7nfkdn/advice_for_a_college_senior/,"Greetings and salutations, fellow humans. Happy New Year to everyone. Hope you are all having great days and your lives are going well.

First, some info about me: I am a 21 years old, african descent, homosexual man. I live in Panama and I currently attend the Technological University of Panama (The best one in the country) and I'm majoring in Food Engineering (Basically, Chemical Engineering, but focused on foods). Being suffering from Major Depression (Severe level of gravity, according to the psychological tests) for 7 years since diagnose.

As the title says, I am going to start my senior year in March and, as you could probably guess, I am quite freaked out about this.

I want to ask for a loan to continue my studies abroad (whether it be a master's or another undergrad, remains to be determined). Besides studying, I would also like to stay in whatever country I go to. This is because, as I mentioned, I am gay and would one day like to get married, have a family, etc. and, sadly, Panama is very... conservative, to put it gently.

With all of that said, I have the following questions:

1) What countries would you recommend to study at? Preferibly, if you know of any countries with Co-Op careers (That means, study and work at the same time as part of the whole program).

2) In what countries would it be easier to get a job and a permanent residence? I know in any country that would be hard, but you get my point.

3) In order to graduate my current university, I have to make a ""graduation test"". This can be a scientific research thesis, an internship in a food industry or taking two post-grad classes for a semester either here or in another country. Which one would you recommend if I aspire to get a scholarship anywhere?

I think that's all. Any other advice, experiences or anything related, is truly welcomed. Also, if you have any further questions or clarification, I would gladly answer any doubts. 

So for now, thank you beforehand and hope you all keep having beautiful days. Bye."

[I made a post on here 2 years ago about my thoughts after 6 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/3x3hkn/i_moved_to_switzerland_here_are_a_few_thoughts_on/), so this post is kind of a redo/update of that (and this is also heavily focused on the German speaking part of the country).

In short it has been a fantastic experience: I moved into a flat in the old town of an absurdly pretty town, got the chance to fully explore the country, made friends and feel I have integrated and understand the country very well. The move itself was very easy for me. But the language has been the slow and hard part.

Partly I wrote this for myself to help clear up my thoughts and memories, but hopefully it will be interesting and helpful to others.
[For info on travel, hiking and other things see this previous series of posts I put on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5nkv4j/switzerland_my_faq_thoughts_hints_and_tips_after/). This is just about my experience moving and living here (ok it is mostly to bitch about the language, but shhh).

**Serious bits**

There are plenty of blogs ([eg: the German Way](https://www.german-way.com/)), forums (englishforum.ch](https://www.englishforum.ch/)), and books (Living and working in Switzerland by David Hampshire) out there dealing with the matter. Blogs from other expats are sometimes wonderfully accurate, but sometimes they seem to describe another country altogether. I am mostly going to avoid serious bits as they are covered well elsewhere.

One thing I will say is transfer your driving licence to a Swiss one right away. Not expecting to stay this long, and only planning to use the trains I didn’t bother as it just seemed a waste of time and money. Now having been here more than 1 year, and planning to stay longer, as I understand it I can’t drive here until I retake the whole bloody test - not that I ever want to, but it would be useful to have the option still.

**Why / How**

Basically I just ended up here slightly by chance. I (at the time M/28/UK) was doing a PhD in Biomaterials and had been wanting to do a Post-doc outside of the UK (adventure, travel, and experience), but had been focused on Germany or Australia and had never really considered Switzerland. Then a job with the right requirements popped up through contacts as I was writing up my PhD. I applied, got the position, and suddenly found myself about to move to a country which I didn’t really know a whole lot about and to a town I had never heard of.

There were two major aids here: the culture and highly specific skills of academia makes it very easy to find a job in another country, and as an EU citizen (for now) I get equal rights and easy access to Switzerland. So it was just a case of entering the country normally and telling them I was here once I set myself up.

**Pre-move research**

I had been to Switzerland twice before during my studies, but only to Geneva and most of that time was spent at CERN on or over the border with France. Now I was moving all by myself to a different part of the country and the closest person I knew was in the north of Germany. So I was really going in blind and alone.

I was spending 2 months travelling elsewhere in the run up to the start date so didn’t really have much time for any serious preparation beyond checking what I needed to do to make sure I entered and set myself up legally.

What I did do was read Swiss Watching by Diccon Bewes. [He also has a long but quite good TedX talk, similar to the Swiss Watching book but quicker for some of the basic facts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7u--e31oOc). He tends to overdo some points, but generally gives a very good overview of the country and the people.

Otherwise I just bought tickets for the closest airport and packed as much as I could into the biggest bag I had: laptop, clothes, a frying pan, and hiking boots. 

**The move**

All things considered this went surprisingly smooth.

Entering the country I just walked through customs just like any holiday maker with a big bag. I then left the airport by the wrong country - a problem which is possibly unique to Basel/Mülhausen - before correctly entering Switzerland and meeting my new boss for the first time in arrivals. He escorted me to our town and informed about various things work and life related on the way (99% of which I forgot pretty much instantly as my mind was overwhelmed with so much to take in).

I had been expecting to use the flat my new workplace rented for visitors, but I found out late on that it was already taken by some interns, and so I had to find my own place at very short notice. Browsing the standard property websites I quickly realised that my original idea of finding myself a furnished flat was not going to happen - such properties are very limited in number and absurdly expensive. I got very lucky and found a room to sublet almost instantly though the flatmate finding website [wgzimmer](https://www.wgzimmer.ch/en/wgzimmer.html) (though be warned flat sharing is not a common thing here like it is in the UK). Not only did I get a mostly furnished flat to live in, but it was in the historic old town, and I had a Swiss housemate which made starting so much easier as I had both an instant friend and a local guide / information source.

(Having since searched for a proper flat 2 years later I have found it is a rather slow process. You typically have to arrange with the current tenant to see the flat, rather than just getting an agent to take you around a selection. Often the tenant feeds back to the company which means appearing in a smart(ish) outfit and being friend helps, certainly the quickest and most positive responses I got were when I had a good chatty tour with the current tenant. Applying then takes ages as you have a to fill out a form for each flat, and the answer can take anything from a few hours to a few weeks. On the plus side you legally get a day off from work to move house which is nice.)

I moved into the flat without a rental contract at first as it took time for the landlord to approve me as a sub-tenant. Whilst slightly chaotic (I took most of my first months wages in a large pile of cash), this made the whole chicken-egg process of getting setup in a new country vastly easier. Once the rental contract came through it was simple to just go to the Kanton with my passport and work/rental contracts and register as a resident, followed by a quick trip to the bank to get myself a bank account. And just like that life fell into place.

For the mandatory health insurance (you have 3 months, but start early as it takes at least a month for it to actually be processed) I just went on Helsana and figured out a reasonably cheap package. I haven’t changed it since, but many Swiss take it very seriously and constantly swap to keep the cost down.

I didn’t really have to spend much time on official matters, and didn’t really come across any serious problems or delays (other than sleeping on the floor for a few weeks as Ikea delivery takes ages). Even setting up a bank account with no common language went surprisingly smooth and quickly.

**Adjustment and life**

I went in with a 1 year contract and a mentality that I would jump in, make the most of the time to see everything I could, and then hop out again to move on elsewhere afterwards (or stay if possible, but I was very open to whatever).

During the early days keeping yourself busy is probably the best thing you can do.
On which point the first few “honeymoon” months are a magical time when everything is different and exciting - make the most of them. Especially for me as I turned up at the end of May which is possibly the best time of year - warm weather, snowy peaks, and green meadows. During my first summer I constantly bought new and novel things in the supermarket, and went on trips almost every weekend. My coworkers started to become quite amused as I turned up every Friday with hiking boots and a backpack to head off directly into the mountains after work.

It of course isn’t all rustic cabins and mountains. Most people moving into Switzerland will go to the Flatland: which can be wonderfully charming with rustic villages and rolling forested hills, but can also be ugly industry and forgettable charmless towns. From October to February the Flatland suffers from a dense low fog which swallows the light and leaves you in a depressing world of grey for weeks or months at a time. [You can escape above it to a world of beautiful clear views and sunshine](https://i.imgur.com/SKmNWwt.jpg) at the weekend (some people go up armed with deckchairs and newspapers), but during the working week you are rather stuck with it.

My past experience made dealing with the move quite easy: having moved to Australia as a kid, and a few times in the UK for uni I had gotten used to new places and new people. I also suspect I have it very easy as an outsider here: I am white, speak English as my mother language, and am skilled (ie: I look like I fit in, I can almost always communicate, and I arguably add something to the country). I don’t mean that in a “the Swiss are horribly racist” way, but a just “the closer you are to the culture you move to then the easier it is” way.

With my housemate and friends I made at work I found myself with a social life fairly early on. Partly due to that, and partly due to not wanting to fall into the expat-trap, I didn’t get around to meeting my local English speaking society until almost 2 years after I arrived. In retrospect it would have been better to join them early on for advice and tips.

Moving from one western country to another isn’t too big a challenge. But the differences can pile up:

* If you come from anywhere but Norway then converting the prices back to your home currency will give you a heart attack each time you go to the shops here. It is best to stop doing that ASAP. Prices are high, but pay is good.

* Getting used to the way things work takes time. I was utterly shocked on arrival to find the shops here close at 6:30pm during the week. 

* One of the curious bits of adjustments was the steady stream of small differences that I became aware of as time passed. For example after months of spending at least part of every day in the countryside I finally realised what it was that seemed off to me - there were no fences or hedges and so it all felt strangely open compared to the English countryside.

**Language**

This is the one thing that gets to me the most about living abroad. It can really isolate you or give you the feeling of being isolated even when you are being socially accommodated (I feel guilty about it and hate having to drag the conversation back to English). Being near the Röstigraben I sometimes end up in a French dominated group (of which I speak almost nothing beyond ordering a coffee) so the effect is somewhat doubled. 

You can survive here without German - I have met plenty of people working at big companies like Novartis that do. English is kind of the common language here - far less people speak multiple Swiss languages fluently than you would expect. Still, when someone in Switzerland says they “only speak a little French” it tends to me they can only converse for an hour or two (as opposed to “a little French” in the UK which means you can count to 5). Once you are setup and enter the rhythm of everyday life then (other than the odd official letter) it is easy to just coast along in English. This is understandable in some ways: coming home after work it can be hard to find the motivation or time to sit down and study something serious (especially with a family), and learning by immersion is often about as much fun as learning to swim by being thrown into a tsunami. 

I wanted to learn the language regardless, but I also happened to move to a very Swiss company in a small town that is almost unknown internationally. As such I was always immersed (drowning) in Swiss-German and had plenty of motivation to learn. 

I would sum up the experience of learning a language as you move to a new country as three stages:

- **1 - The initial novelty.** You have just arrived and everything is exciting and new. You don’t understand anything but that is fine: you are armed with a range of apps, you are confident that immersion in the language will make sound like a native in a few months, and you can even identify some of the items in your kitchen in German already.

- **2- The frustration stage.** You have completed Duolingo and other such things, politely smiled through hours of German, and learnt your dative/genitive/etc - but you don’t understand a fucking thing beyond the fact that the important looking sign in the train station says something about platform 4.

- **3 - Starting to click.** You might still mix up words and your grammar makes the language less of an art and more of a frontal assault. But you understand what is said and get the message across. Conversational level has been reached, and the long road to fluency begins.

- **4 - Bonus Swiss-German stage.** You read, listen, and talk High-German without trouble. Then you pop into Migro and the cashier asks you a simple question in Swiss-German, but you don’t understand a bloody word. You sigh and lower your head in shame/frustration.

I had 3 years of German at school in the UK which was something but not amazing (I showed an example GCSE exam to Swiss colleagues and they literally laughed). Still at least that gave me some words and installed a basic appreciation of the language which helped me restart 10 years later. Having recently started learning French from nothing I actually do appreciate that my school German was a helpful foundation, though I think 3 years of “bare minimum because I had to” at school translates to about 3 months of part-time “because I want to” later on.

I didn’t have much time before moving out so I just played with some game/apps on my phone, which taught me one or two words but were mostly useless. On getting into Switzerland I hit Duolingo and worked my way through it. It is certainly attractive being easy, free, and full of happy binging sounds. But overall I would say it is really limited. You are so far from everyday understanding at the end. Some people claim to watch TV shows or hold full conversations based purely on Duolingo, fuck knows what they watch or talk about but I was nowhere near that. It is useful as something to play with, but as a supplement to other methods. I found Memrise after completing Duolingo, but at this point I could not be bothered with more repetitive filling in the blanks - so I didn’t really bother with it. Instead I moved onto youtube, games, newspapers, classes, and whatever interaction occurred in my daily life.

My German has come quite a way and generally impresses most people I talk to here given the amount of time I have learnt it in (and sometimes that I have bothered to learn it at all, though I feel I could be so much further with less time “wasted” on other things):

* On arrival I would say I was A1. I could introduce myself and say that I had a cat (which was a lie), count, and identify a few objects and animals. But that was about it.

* Now after 2.5 years I can understand most High-German and join in on most topics, so would put myself at B2. Though my grammar is still far from pretty, and a long German session can still burn me out. I can barely remember any genders for nouns and mostly just pick whatever sounds best in my head. Whether I fully understand Swiss-German is very hit or miss.

I must say that I really like Swiss-German. I like how it sounds and it is so much more interesting and full of character than High-German. However….

Learning German in Switzerland can be absurdly frustrating (more so than usual). Swiss-German makes it so much more complicated. You can reach total fluency in High-German, but then get utterly floored by the simplest question from a Swiss person. The Swiss like to laugh when people ask them if “Swiss” is a language, but I would argue that Swiss-German is basically a whole other language. The pronunciation, grammar, and even basic words are often very different. It isn’t so much that the goalposts have been moved, but that the whole fucking game has changed. The idea of trying to play football whilst the other team are playing Gaelic football is about on the right lines. [This video makes the point rather well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz2S9iggdzM). And on the point of [a whole different game….](https://youtu.be/ThwG88SFIQc).

Still there is no ß in Swiss-German (you just use ss instead) which saves some faffing around at least. It also helps to know that Swiss-German gives most normal Germans a hard time too (German TV often gives Swiss speakers subtitles).

This is infinitely more frustrating as a native English speaker: people often hear my accent and switch straight to English - and usually keep going in English even when I keep responding in German. Sometimes in a shop the salesperson will run off to find an English speaking worker (and sometimes they will then run off to find another worker that speaks better English). Even the middle aged butcher in my little town speaks perfect bloody English. On the flip side having a Swiss address means people often assume I am Swiss and hit me with the hardest dialect they can muster. Going to check into a B&amp;B as the only guests that night the host greeted me with a barrage of Swiss-German only to get a deer-in-the-headlights response from me (much to the amusement of my Swiss girlfriend).

Technically you can learn Swiss-German, but unless you are already fluent in High-German that would be insane. Every Swiss-German speaker understands and talks High-German so you would be pointlessly over specialising with a language that most German speakers can’t understand. Especially so as Swiss-German varies drastically by region (yes even in this tiny place), and it isn’t a defined language so if you write it out you just write it as it sounds to you in your dialekt. I have been told that any structured class on it is just a waste of time. Just learn the Swiss part by exposure - you are never going to easily pass for a local with the dialect anyway.

For putting the language to use it is much easier for me to talk German with strangers, or with people I know speak no English. When you start speaking English with people it is far too hard to then switch language years down the line when your German is good enough to function properly. I live with my Swiss girlfriend but we almost always talk in English when it is just us as German feels so strange.

While it is endless frustration, it really does payoff and feel good. For example when checking into a hotel in Graubünden the receptionist was delighted that I spoke in German rather than just shouting at her in English and I got very friendly treatment for the rest of the time. Also we had regular internal presentations that are given in German, at the start I was filling sheets of paper with scribbled words and translations from my phone as I tried to keep up, but at the end I only needed to do so for one or two words which was rather nice. And of course being able to fully function and communicate with people in daily life is rather a good payoff too.

The downside of this is that when I return to the UK it takes me a few days to stop talking German to strangers (especially if I have had a few beers).

For learning in Switzerland I found these tools very useful:

* The free commuter newspaper [20 minutes](http://www.20min.ch/) is the best tool for learning German in Switzerland (probably also French and Italian too). It is not going to win any journalism awards. But it has short, simple, neutral articles - grab a copy each day and scribble all over it. The odd Swiss-German word is included which helps build up the local lingo. Some of it (ie: the people/community section) is invented bollocks, but it mostly helps give you an idea what is important in the country and how Switzerland works.

* Dict.cc has a number of Swiss words which makes it my mobile/internet dictionary of choice for Switzerland.

* [There is an Allmanisch German wiki if you want to pick up a feeling for the way the dialect feels](https://als.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Houptsyte).

* [SRFplay](https://www.srf.ch/play). TV and radio on demand in High and Swiss-German. You paid for this with your Billag, so abuse the hell out of it.

* SRF4. The news radio station in mostly nice clear High-German. Typically they seem to have 2-3 hours of reports each day that they just repeat, slightly dull but great for someone trying to learn. I like to listen to this when I am working in the lab. 

* Youtube has some useful resources. Swiss-German channels like [Ask Switzerland](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCndi9zHvIDYa1Tp6vXJqHxA) provide plenty to listen to. It also has some SRF stuff which might help if you are not already in Switzerland. Search “bi de lüt” for shows focused on Swiss life with some strong Swiss-German accents. 

* [The australian/swiss comedy of Rob Spence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mifm_FMFLM&amp;t=4s). Not so easy to understanding but somehow reassuring.

For German in general I would also suggest:

* /r/German and the resources on their [wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/index).

* There is so much on youtube. [Easy German](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3936178A38BB5F87) is a favourite.

* Dive in - to hell with how stupid you might sound.

* Joining a class. The learning process is much more fun when you have some people at your level to share the frustration. I spent almost a year trying to decide what level to join - online tests kept putting me as A1, but the overall meaning of each level made me think B1, in the end I went B1 and it was perfect (so bollocks to yes/no online tests).

* Duolingo provide a nice way to get started and keep steadily learning. The simple focused nature of the tree and short time requirements of the stages mean you don’t get overwhelmed and don’t need to worry about setting more than a few minutes aside for it. But overall it is really limited in what it actually teaches you of the language, so you need to heavily use other medium instead. Think of Duolingo as a snack: quick, convenient and easy to keep you going, but it isn’t going to properly fill you up. Complete the tree and practice if you find it useful, but don’t bother aiming for the highest level or for a 1000 day streak.   

* I am not a massive gamer but I swear by video games as the best way to learn. The mix of interaction, language, and fun makes for a very effective learning environment (that and being able to attack someone with a sword when you get sick of them speaking German to you is rather satisfying…..). The trick is to find something story based with a good separation of language and action: RPGs like Skyrim is perfect for this (especially using console to pause and quick save/load to repeat bits), whereas something action based like COD is too distracting. This worked especially well playing games which I completed in English years ago, where I could just about recall the gist of the story to help me along but had forgotten many aspects and details.

* Music. I built a playlist when I first arrived. It started out as random sounds, but through 2 years of steady listening and learning I can now make sense of it.

* Read out loud (though maybe not on the bus).

* [Emon publishing](https://www.emons-verlag.de/) do local Krimis with one probably set where you live or are interested in. Not exactly the best books in the world but entertaining enough.

**The Swiss**

Sometimes I feel I understand the Swiss, other times they are complex enigmas. The nature of the country often feels very contradictory at times (often liberal and conservative at once). And of course the urban/rural, and language divides only make this more complex. 

Take anything you read pre-2000 with a big pinch of salt. The country seems to have changed significantly since then: going from a dull but practical country to a much more fun and outgoing one. The summer months especially are very lively as people head outdoors to drink at bars, go to festival, and jump in the lakes/rivers. Younger Swiss are very open and there is less of the formality that you get with the older generations.

The Swiss tend to operate in two modes in public: city and mountain. In urban areas the Swiss are along the lines of the quiet closed society of stereotypes, but get them into the countryside and they can become super loud and chatty. I have been on Post buses where the entire bus was interacting and best friends by the end of the trip, and if you get on a train to the mountains with a group of retirees you will know about it. 

I am a fairly private person but the Swiss sometimes really beat me there. Once a coworker who I spoke with most days casually mentioned that he wouldn’t be in the next day, I assumed he had to wait for a delivery or something - turns out he was getting married. This has happened twice now. Most other coworkers got this treatment too, so it isn't (just) that I am insufferable. 

I have however always felt very welcomed here. On one of my first days I went walking in the Jura mountains near my town. As I sat on a peak to eat lunch an elderly local man started talking to me. My German was almost non-existent then but I managed to get the idea across that I had just moved there to start work. On finding out that this foreigner who barely spoke a word of German (let alone the local dialect) was moving in to work he wished me well and gave me a Ricola. A small gesture, but one that really stuck with me. Having improved my German I have only felt more welcome since then.

On which point the Swiss are very tolerant with language. Absurdly so really. In my early days I only once or twice got very gentle remarks that I needed to improve my German (buying curtains was one notable early occasion where my few words in German really failed to get me far) but generally they did everything to accommodate me and then as my skills picked up they started to throw praise at even my crude German. Whether that is just being polite or they are just genuinely impressed that an English speaker learnt German I am not sure.

The Swiss are almost always very considerate. Dog walkers will stop to hold their dog in place whilst bikers go past. Even the bored teens drinking on the street at night don’t bother anyone walking past. The main exception is the growing number of wankers who think they are special and can just walk around with their music blasting out of some powerful speaker (though that is probably more common elsewhere).

Some habits of talking took a while to get used to. The British habit of saying sorry to express sympathy (or anything) rather confuses the Swiss who take it to just mean guilt. Understatement isn’t really a thing here which either leads to confusion or hilarity - one day at work I was being shown a process with a sample being taken out of the oven at 1400C, on being warned that it was very hot I replied that it was indeed a wee bit toasty, the poor worker taking the sample out was almost collapsing with laughter from what I thought was just a standard comment.  

The absolute worst thing about the Swiss is their obsession with putting their bag on the seat beside them on the train (the overhead racks are apparently only there for aesthetics). They will move it if you ask, but not until you do so (no matter how obviously busy the train might be) which can create a passive aggressive awkwardness about it. Some talented people have even mastered the art of taking up 4 spaces by themselves, and then manage not to notice that there are other people on the train. 

A few odd thoughts:

* [Stereotypes exist for each region in the country](http://i.imgur.com/Gq72cwL.jpg). Generally they are fairly mature. Coming from the UK and Australia where anyone more rural than you is having sex with their sheep (and/or incest) this was quite a surprise.

* One thing I find curious is that the image of sport (TV adverts etc) here is more of families and normal people doing it as opposed to super-athletes. And most people are quite outgoing with sport and such-like. 

* Shaking hands is a big thing here. Get used to that in situations where a hello or just polite nod would do in English speaking lands.

**The long-term**

Having started with a mentality of in-and-out (with as many mountains as possible in the meantime) I have found myself getting somewhat more established here. I got extended several times to 2.5 years, met a Swiss girl, moved in with her, and am now looking for further work.

For me adapting and getting used to life here was fairly easy. I made friends via work, and my housemate. I explored every part of the country (far more than most of my Swiss acquaintances). Through watching and reading the news I now understand much better how the country works and the variations in who votes and thinks what. I can’t name the president or most of the politicians, but they are not so influential here and having no say myself in the politics I have an excuse there.

There has been some frustration and feeling of being useless and/or isolated. I sometimes get a desire for home, without actually knowing what home even is to me anymore. But generally it has been very positive. 

I only really miss a few things:

* Food. Swiss food tends to be a little less exotic than the options in the UK. I really miss the omnipresent cheap curry-houses. Likewise standard food in the supermarkets (whilst almost always good) is less exotic.

* Spicy food. Food listed as hot/spicy here tends to have all the power of slightly tangy ketchup. But this might just be a result of years of idiotic English competitive curry culture on my behalf.

* Culture. You can talk English with locals but it just isn’t the same. Hanging out with fellow expats helps abit there, but they are often from all over the world so you often still miss out on a proper connection.

* Opening hours. I dream of shops that open on Sunday and/or beyond the early evening. 

The main downside has been that the longer you spend somewhere the more mundane it becomes. A few days spent in Grindelwald or somewhere like that might leave you with the memory of the country as a magical place. But when you stay somewhere for longer then it becomes normal and less special with every passing day. I still love it here, but had I only stayed for the first summer than it would have stayed far more wonderful in my memory. Of course then I would just be yearning to come back.

**What would I do differently?**

If I were to repeat it again knowing what I do now (though they are all of course easier said than down):

* Allow more time for finding a flat. I got lucky on arrival, but now realise how long this process can be.

* Hit the language harder and faster. This was partly delayed by finishing up corrections and work for my PhD, but I really should have joined a class early on, and also have picked up French sooner once I started to get conversational with German.

* Make more effort to be social. I feel I integrated well, but could have done more to join a local club or been more socially outgoing on arrival.

**How to be Swiss**

* have some Aromat on your table (even if it is made by Unilever). 

* Swim in a lake/river during the summer.

**Things to try:**

- If you are here more than a few weeks then try to get into every language region at least once. If you are here for a number of months then try and visit every little area. For a tiny country there is so much variation in landscape and culture.

- Wine. You can’t find it outside of the country, but Swiss wine is actually pretty good.

- Beer. [There are loads of small Breweries all over the country](https://bov.ch/beer/swissmaps.html), Switzerland apparently has the most breweries per capita in the world. Feldschlossen is the “standard” mass produced beer you find everywhere. Compared to the standards in other countries it isn’t too bad, but try and find something more interesting.

- Cheese. More than just Emmental. Try everything you can.

- Vermicelle. A desert made out of minced chestnut. Best in autumn.

**Useful quickfire points:**

- Swiss plugs are like (but not identical to) standard European ones. Standard European ones do not always fit here, come prepared with at least 1 Swiss specific plug.

- Kantons have lots of power and the way they are run can vary quite a bit. The Kanton and place you live in can have rather a large effect on the taxes, health insurance, and various quality of life factors.

- Catholics kantons have far more official holidays (on such days the shops in protestant kantons will fill up with shoppers from the surrounding kantons). Swiss holidays fall on a date, not day of the week, and many firms make bridge days for holidays on a Tuesday or Thursday. This means that year to year the number of official holidays you have can vary from almost none, to having what feels like the the whole of May off work. The absolute worst is holidays on a Saturday when you miss the day off, and all the bloody shops are closed.

- Look into at least getting the Half-Tax train pass even if you don’t plan to take public transport too often - it applies to most cable cars and ships too. Combined with supersaver tickets on the SBB app you can buy tickets for specific trains at quieter times for 25% of the normal cost. If you live with someone else who has it then you get a discount. Same with the GA: my girlfriend is a student, and I live with her, so we both save about a third off the GA.

- Name is last name, not first name (vorname), in German. I ruined countless forms until I got used to that.

- The Swiss 1 looks like an upside down V at times. That caused some confusion too.

- Look into [Reka money](https://reka.ch/en/rekamoney/seiten/reka-money.aspx). It is basically “voucher” money that is usable for leisure and travel in Switzerland (accommodation, food, transport, activities). You can’t use it everywhere, but you can get it at as little as 80% of the cost in CHF. Saving 20% off travel inside Switzerland is very nice. For best results see if your company has an account in place to help you get the checks or a savings account (mine gave it out as a summer holiday bonus). If you do use the banknote like checks bear in mind that you often don’t get change from them, so prepare a mix of the checks and coins to cover the full cost.

- Charity shops are not a thing like they are in the UK. So cheap and easy 2nd hand things are not always so easy to find.

- Asterix and Obelix is rather popular here. Brush up on that for Switzerland and your country to understand the references.

- If you are swapping the side of the road you drive on, then try and cycle rather than drive as much as possible at first. It is much easier to quickly dash onto the pavement when you go wrong on a bike than with a car (maybe best if you stick to simple quiet roads). Cycling on the right helped me clear my left-sided instincts out so when I finally drove on the right it was natural.

**Not so useful points:**

- You will spend the first few months with a Swiss kezboard mixing up the z and y kezs.

What are my options to reach my goal?,qoskymotto0,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7ngfgo/screwed_up_late_teensearly_20s_what_are_my/,"After getting a 2.95 in high school, my parents made me to go to college in Las Vegas (my hometown). I spent a little over 4 years there, and changed my major 4-5 times throughout. I didn't care (same as high school) and ended with a 2.4 college GPA with somewhere between 40-50 credits.

I was able to stop applying for classes and just focused on working for a while. Fast forward a few years, I am now 24 (nearing 25) years old, married (no kids), living in Salt Lake City, and have a much more solid grasp on what my purpose is in this world. I will go to the University of Utah to graduate with a BS in Computer Engineering. Eventually an MS in CE, but that's for another time.

The minimum GPA to get accepted into UofU is 2.6, but the minimum to get accepted into the Engineering College is a 2.8. I didn't realize the 2.8 requirement and re-took a class via online from the College in Las Vegas that I didn't so well in to get myself up to 2.62. I applied for UofU and inevitably was rejected due to the 2.8 requirement.

Here is where I'm asking for help, the way I see it I have 2 options: 

-Stick with the local community college which has an Associate's Degree for Pre-Computer Engineering. This degree can be adjusted if I work with a counselor that allows me to be 2 classes shy of a junior at the UofU for my goal. In my mind's eye, having an Associate's Degree on the resume would be a good way to help me get internships in the field I want while I continue the rest of my college days.

-Continue to retake some of my classes or take new classes to help prep for Engineering and to get my GPA to an acceptable level and head straight into the UofU. This allows for a better quality education with additional resources. I honestly don't care about money. My wife works (doesn't bring in a ton, but works full-time) and I'm willing to take out whatever loans I need and apply to billions of scholarships/grants to get myself through school. I'm still working full-time now, but as I gradually take on more classes I'll move to part-time work and depending on my situation maybe even move to just full-time student and applying for internships.

These are the options that I see from my perspective. What do you guys think? Is there something else I'm not seeing? What are your opinions on these available options. Please let me know if I'm missing any information that might help you guys."

If I get a return offer for full time I want other offers from tech companies to talk about to them. I also graduate next fall so I don't have much time to find offers if I wait till after the internship (is that really enough time?). 

So how do I find other offers to compete with what microsoft can give me? I got the Microsoft job because I applied through a special  program which kinda got me through the resume screen, but I still had to go through the whole coding interview circuit, which I had basically nothing other than some small personal projects to put on. I have an internship that I worked at, and am now working remotely at that I can also put on. Now this resume won't get me through the screens of any other companies virtually guaranteed. And I've applied to a decent number of them.  

So do I just wait till the internship actually happens and start applying? Do I just put that I'm *going* to be working there so that I can get through an initial ""Well he at least made it past the Microsoft interview"" or something? "

I wasn't able to find an internship for the holidays this year which leaves me with 2 months of time to fill. I was wondering what you guys think I should do to improve my resume.

I was thinking that it would be good to learn a new programming language and CAD software, and maybe combine that with doing a small project to substantiate my learning. However I've got a couple of questions regarding this:

1. Do you think it would be a better use of time if I just learned the language/software by itself without doing a project/doing minimal projects? 
2. What programming language and CAD packages would you recommend I learn? 
    (I know MATLAB, Solidworks and NX)
3. Are there any projects that you found looked really good? I have a pretty small budget unfortunately but am open to ideas. (&lt;$200)

My degree has involved a ton of problem solving and maths obviously but not a lot of statistics, plus besides intro and data analysis classes in Python I haven't got a ton of coding experience, although I did do a couple of weeks as an intern at my hometown university's data analytics department last summer, working on a project with Python (pandas, matplotlib, bit of scikitlearn).

Basically my dilemma is, I can't decide whether to spend next year doing an MS in Data Science at said university, or applying for a year long paid internship (~£15k tax free) at the same department I interned at over summer. The internship gets a fair few applicants but they have an intake of around 10 people and my supervisor I worked with said with my grades and the fact I'd spent time in the department already, I had a good shot of getting on the program. 

In any case, I can feasibly apply for both and then use the MS as a backup if I don't get the internship, but I'm just unsure as to which is going to help me the most going forward and wondered if you guys could shed any light? Thanks for taking the time to read! "
7nkpx2,7,2018-01-02,Loneliness,GuilinSunrise,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/7nkpx2/loneliness/,"Hi.
I'm a computer Science undergraduate at UCF.
I've faced a lot of challenges to get where I am today.
I can't see well, and was dependent on my alcoholic parents for a long time.
After years of self-destructive habits living with them, I became independent and moved in with friends near UCF.
I found out late last year, after a lifetime of being told by my parents that I could never drive, that with my glasses, I can see just well enough for a license. I have a learner's permit now.
I was accepted back into UCF this past fall after being academically disqualified; I got a medical withdrawal due to my alcohol abuse. 
If I had kept drinking at the rate that I was, I would be dead by now.
I am now almost one year and one month sober.
I am in a polyamorous relationship.
I should be happy.
I am not.

My life has always been very isolated; I grew up being told what to do out of fear of the unregulated ""outside world"" due to my visual disability, and the knowledge that if I followed my parents' directions exactly, I would be ""okay"".
I do not know how to live a fulfilling life, and it shows.

In my everyday life, with disturbingly long commutes using the paratransit service, Access Lynx, rigid scheduling required because of it, and resulting lack of spontaneity and continued isolation that comes of that, I am numbed to the point of unfeeling.
In my academics, my financial aid has been canceled due to my withdrawing from 2 classes last semester as the federal requirement is a 70%&lt; completion rate; I got a 3.5GPA anyway.
I have a guaranteed technical internship with a known defense and aerospace company if I maintain a high GPA; they ""liked"" my ""life's story"" and the challenges that I've ""overcome""; I'm just another statistical diversity posterboy.
In my relationship, I am alienated by the fact that I am a secondary partner to the woman whom I love. That is all I ever will be.

I cannot share my true feelings - the logical, terminal progression of this melancholy - with my special treatment therapist at UCF, or my friends, for fear of the implications it would certainly have on my future.

This is not a phase, but the culmination of social and emotional dysphoria that, due to my upbringing, has been a long time coming.

I am analytical, and have no real emotional outlets. I never thought I needed them; I was wrong.

I've traveled China and Japan and seen what interests me in the world. I can't stand being back here, in Florida, and I know that I will not be happy wherever I go. No matter how much wealth I acquire, how many organizations I create and grow, or romantic connections I create, I will not be happy; I am not happy.

I am beyond loneliness."

Part of the program is doing research. The research is notoriously hard because you're reading state of the art papers and trying to make sense of it all as an undergraduate. However, you have to do this if you want the honors degree.

I'm curious if I should take the potential hit to my GPA which is currently _very_ good to have the honors degree, or ditch the honors degree to keep my GPA great.

I don't think I'll tank the research course, but I don't think I'll do absolutely amazing either, especially because the professor I'd be mentored by is known to be very stingy with high grades.

Any advice?

I'm currently a college senior trying to figure out what I want to do. I am majoring in a liberal arts visual design program and minoring in computer science. Outside of school I have run a business club. I've done internships in an analyst role in consulting and in product management in tech.

Initially when I started school I thought I would do something completely traditional in business or law but along the way I discovered my interest in design and technology. In terms of my own work preferences, I'm finding the idea of working at a traditional corporation less and less appealing. I think it's because I have an itch to explore a very specific emerging industry within technology (AR/VR if you're wondering). However I'm not sure if I want to work more on creating the product or if I want to do something that's more in line with my interest in business, such as a product management type role or a business analyst. The problem is is that this industry is riddled with startups that usually don't have the runway for business people, and for product roles they aren't looking to hire fresh college grads unless they already have built up significant skill sets which I don't have yet.

How do I figure out if I should do something that's more on the product side or on the business side? (If it's product, should I try to learn technical skills on my own?) Should I pursue a job in the specific industry I'm most excited about, or should I try to start out in any industry that I'm interested in? Thanks!

If you do a great job on that first step, you’ll probably be asked to meet with recruiters for an interview.

An interview is your chance to prove that you are the right candidate for the company. Also, at the interview, you can find out more about the company culture and decide whether you will be happy working in that position and company or not.

Here are some things you should know about an interview:

Why you’ve been invited to interview:
The short answer: because the recruiter was impressed by your resume and wants to meet you in person to have a conversation regarding your abilities, skills, and experience. The interview is often the last step before being hired, so it’s your best opportunity to sell yourself.  This is the time to show off your best assets and convince the hiring manager that you’re the right fit for the role.

You should focus on the conversation and answer each question carefully and thoughtfully. The interviewer will not only find out more about you and your experience but also about your personality and skills. And during this conversation, you should figure out what the employer needs from you and be ready to explain how you can help them. This is your chance to get that job!

Failing to prepare is preparing to fail:
Preparation is the key to an interview, whether it is your 1st or 10th interview. One of the main goals of the interview is for the company to try to find out some other things about you that weren’t included in your application. Show them that you have leadership skills, and are a very good communicator. If you cannot anticipate specific questions, then prepare your answers for those most commonly asked.

Research the company and learn more details about the position. This will help your recruiter see that your skills are the ones required. And you have a chance to see what kind of challenges you may face in the role.

The recruiter is going to take special note of your attitude about the position, so make sure you’re showing your enthusiasm for both the company and the job.  Don’t be afraid to ask the recruiter some questions, and it will help you to see if you will fit in the position long-term.  Think of an interview as a conversation where both parties are seeing if there is a natural fit.

It’s ok to be nervous, and natural considering that perhaps you have no experience with interviews before – and even if you have, interviews can be nerve-wracking! With the right preparation and some research regarding the company and job, you will handle the situation perfectly. Be calm and have confidence in your skills and abilities – we know that you can convince the person sitting across from you that you’re the right person for the job!"

Brief background: I got a BS in civil in 2014, and senior year I had an internship at a structural firm that told me to get my MS so I went to school while interning. Then after 1.5 years of that MS I decided I liked the math and mechanics stuff more so I pursued an MS in Computational and Applied Math, and I should be done in May. 

A lot of students in my program go on to work in government research labs or similar environments, and as much as I'd like to do the same I don't feel nearly as qualified. So any job suggestions would be nice as well.

I am currently a second-year CS student and by the end of April the CS courses I will have finished are:
CSC108 
CSC148 
CSC165 
CSC207
CSC209
CSC236

(I'm gonna take CSC258 and CSC263 later due to personal reasons)

Now, I REALLY need to get a summer internship but I don't think I have a good chance of getting one. I've looked on the CLN job board and many other external job boards and I've found maybe about 20 companies that are looking for summer interns. However, out of those 20 job postings, for only maybe 3 jobs I meet almost every requirement the companies are looking for. For the other 17 or so job postings, they have like 6 requirements and I meet only 1 or 2. 

For those remaining 3 jobs, there are probably hundreds of applicants each and the chances of me getting a job are slim to none I feel. 

I'm REALLY desperate to get a job this summer and I was wondering if anybody here could tell me if it is possible for me to get a job with the courses I've listed and where in the world I'm supposed to find job postings as I've only found like 20 when I expected there to be hundreds, especially when I've been told by practically everyone that CS is in ""high demand and [I] should have no trouble finding a job"".

Thanks for reading this. I appreciate any help you can give me during this stressful time for me.

Also, if anybody here doesn't want to say where to look for jobs publicly, feel free to PM me. I promise I won't tell anyone. :)"

I'm afraid I'll be left with no job or internship.

One of my dream internships is the Pixar Undergraduate Program. 

Here is my dilemma, Pixar recruits so late in the game! The application wasn’t up until about a month ago and the deadline for he application isn’t until February! To put things in perspective I accepted an offer for an internship this summer in late October and most of my other targeted internships have similar deadlines. (Blizzard and Apple)

I don’t know what to do with this because its almost like I would have to risk not having an internship if I want to even apply to Pixar. Pixar doesn’t open up their application until much after most other internship experiences give feedback so I would have to not apply/potentially pass on offers to wait for Pixars to open up. 

Why this worries me is that I have NO CLUE how competitive my portfolio would be for the Pixar internship. I have no idea how competitive it is or roughly what my odds are.

How do I play this game? Would it be ok to apply even though I have accepted a position already to hopefully get the email of a recruiter (perhaps I can apply early) and see if I can even make it to the first stage? This is probably crazy but Is it possible to ask them to consider me for 2019 internship? "

Are they even considered and allowed? Should I stick to whatever I am doing now?

**My profile:**I am a 25yo male from India.I did my Bachelors in Physics.Then,I finished my masters in CS from a reputed university with 6.9/10 Cgpa. Then,worked in a company for about an year(Jan 2016-May,2017 including 6 months internship). Now ,I am doing a Research internship(since June,2017) under a well-known Prof. and a reputed university.

Mine is a development project and I didn't like it at all and I could not change it. 
**What happened in the Last 7 months**:
*First 2 months spent on learning the technology, understanding the code base and making smaller changes, attended summer schools organised by the Lab.
*Next two months, my PhD guide was absent and I was not working on anything. I was stuck up on something, but didn't move forward.
Went through some of my personal issues--handling social media addiction, porn addiction,dealing with crushes,low self-esteem and a few more.
Basically, I didn't write a single line of code after that.
*Later: It's continuing even now. In all these days, I used to look at Twitter profiles of different faculties, their research work and all.
Sometimes,got updated with the latest trend on Computer Vision/ML.
Mailed a few profs. asking for any PhD position--didn't get any reply so far.
Used reddit a lot to understand myself,about being gay, being less attractive and so on.

*My Prof. doesn't know about all these.He believes that I am making progress. I asked him for a different project.He told that I can work on a govt. funded project, but it seems like it's not gonna start anytime soon.And I have asked him two times so far.Further asking might lead to unwanted issues.He might ask me to drop the internship/say something else*

**What am I planning now? and My Questions**

*One CV startup has approached me today.If they are confident about me,I am planning to leave the Lab and join full time.In this case, if my employer gives a LOR, will that be eligible??

*Facebook has approached me for a contractor position, for a data analyst profile. Should I go there if selected? And postpone my PhD target a little more? Will their recommendation work if I plan to go for a Ph.D?

*Stay in the Lab.Focus only on the coding project(forget about all the personal issues &amp; social media distractions) and finish it off soon with some good level of quality. 
Do some side projects on CV/learn latest tech whenever I get time.
Network with like minded people and learn a lot of stuff.
Maintain the good name I have got so far.
Show more effort &amp; spend more time in finishing up the project rather than postponing it or saying I don't like it.(Is this even possible? If I go and work for a company,I will again be involved in some amount of development.Won't I get bored of it? Ughh..At 25,it's so much of decision making.Whom should I discuss with?)
Get a good LOR from the faculty and go for PhD.

Which option should I choose?
The last one looks quite good.If I spend some more time and be focussed, I can pull it off. This little bit of hard work is worth the LOR,which I will be getting later.

My current goal is to try and get an internship this summer (Software or Hardware) so I would like to keep a good GPA.

Note: I have transfer credit for CSE 5A which is why I am able to enroll in CSE 100 without having already taken CSE 30.

Professors:
CSE 30   - Ord
CSE 100 - Porter
ECE 45   -  Lugannani 
ECE 65   - Baghadachi

Plan 1:
CSE 30 , CSE 100, ECE 45, braindead-easy GE

- my reasoning with this is that I want to have CSE 100 done so it allows me more options for next quarter for upper-div CSE classes and because Porter is good from what I have heard (plz correct me if I am wrong). Main question here is how plausible/intense is CSE 30 and 100 done concurrently?

Plan 2:
CSE 30, ECE 45, ECE 65, braindead-easy GE

- I feel this might be easier as there would only be one programming class. Also, counselors and professors keep saying that ""students who take CSE 30 prior to CSE 100 do substantially better"". Main question here is how bad is ECE 65 and how is Baghadachi as a professor?

Your responses would be greatly appreciated."

1) Graduate in May 2019 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science 2) Graduate in May 2020 with a BS in both Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science

Part of me wants to take option 1 because it would mean an extra year of income to invest, and an extra year of experience. The other part of me thinks that I may be best served by choosing option 2 (stretching myself to 5 years of college), because it would open up more opportunities fresh out of college as well as allow me an extra year of saving, investing (albeit less than working full time), an extra internship, and the ability to travel more before graduating.

So I graduated from my university mid-last year. I was on an internship on a small company (think 10 people or less) until mid december, when my contract ended.

I've never had a job, so I was pretty excited to hear that they were interested in hiring me full time - but that there wouldn't be some benefits and the pay wouldn't be great due to their lack of money (still twice as much as I used to make, at least). Employer did make some suggestions on things I needed to improve, etc.

Anyway, so they asked me to meet them jan 2, in order to hear their offer. Jan 01, I contacted them asking at what time they wanted to meet. I was told they couldn't settle a value yet, and that we'd meet jan 03 (tomorrow), mid day. That meeting will happen, already confirmed it.

However! I have quite a few medical issues, and doctors usually don't take appointments in the last 10 or so days of december (I know mine didn't), so I had to schedule them for this month. I managed to schedule some for this week, and two of them 2 weeks from now. Now, I'm pretty sure they're going to ask me to start tomorrow right away.

With all that in mind (and the fact I've never had a job - just internships - and thus am not quite sure how it works), here's my questions:

1 - Is it reasonable for me to ask for some time (read 1 day or so) to think about whether or not I want to take whatever value they offer me? I think there won't be benefits save transportation and food. I love the people there and I do want to continue, especially as I'm pretty sure I won't really be able to find any other jobs anytime soon. But my mom offered to pay for me to move to another country by myself (first world country that I have dual nationality on). Furthermore, a family friend offered to host me in his house somewhere in the US for a few months till I manage to get a job (and all the documents required to work/live there so that's another possibility). Truth is there are many options that are making my head spin, and while I'm pretty sure I'd like to keep working on this company for now and save up in order to maybe do some of the other things later, having the exact offer would help. I guess. Is it reasonable for me to ask for a day or so to think about it despite the fact I have had 2-3 weeks off?

2 - One more thing. Since I did schedule some doctors this week; if I do take the job, is it unreasonable of me to ask to start on monday instead of ASAP? Again, they did already ""give"" me (I simply had no contract) some 2 or so weeks off in these holidays, but I couldn't schedule any of my medical appointments in that time. Furthermore, I'm actually really anxious about this whole thing and having a set start date (since all I have right now is a set date for the formal offer), and some time for myself (even if 2 or so days only) before this start date would really help me out. Again, I know I did have 2 or so weeks off, but I didn't know when I would start. Still don't, actually - I'll only find that out tomorrow.

Sorry about the questions. I just really wouldn't like to screw any of it up for myself. Plus, intentionally left some of it vague because I'm kinda paranoid someone somehow sees this. If there's anything that needs clarifying or if I screwed up explaining something let me know and I'll do my best to clarify.

Thanks in advance for any advice you people can offer me!

I appreciate any input. Btw, this is only my second post on Reddit so far.. Woohoo!

So I'm trying to figure out whether I should pursue being a network administrator or jumping into the programming field.
Ever since I was five, I've been tinkering, repairing, building computers and networks in my free time. My first idea was to open my own computer repair shop but then I thought no it will be impossible. Many years have passed since that idea and now I want to get serious with my life and study hard to pursue a career that I'm passionate about. Therein lies the problem -- choosing a career I'm passionate about. I'm very confident that pursuing a networking degree would be fulfilling to me as I currently and have in the past enjoyed working on computers/networks in general. However, from what I understand it requires a person attend college for 4+ years and then gain experience through internships. Also, the idea of having to be work dependent in the form of physically being there is a major negative to me. Yes, I realize most careers require that a person work at a particular location but I dream of being able to work anywhere in the world. Here's where programming comes in to save the day =) ! 


From what I've collected, programming allows a person to work independently so say if you want to travel and work go right ahead good sir :D Great. So here I am thinking of investing all my time into programming but wait where to start?? Holy smokes are there a gazillion different paths ??!! Yup! Woah, duuude. It's like I just entered the matrix and swallowed the blue pill. Ok so let me get back on track. Great. 

So recently I had lunch with some great web developers and I asked them as many questions as I could within an hour but to be honest I'm still confused and unsure about programming. I've tried some basic tutorials for html/css/javascript/ruby/php/python and it was quite fun however will I really love this type of work.... I don't know. I think its worth a shot. Is it possible to become a developer without college? Without spending years studying? I'm looking for the most cost effective route. What about being a web developer versus software development versus etc... If pursuing the web developer field what are good resources to use? What sites should I use to study with? Please share your thoughts and THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!! :))))))"
7nr4ed,5,2018-01-02,Is the Academic Internship Program worth it for CS students?,kelflo1120,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/7nr4ed/is_the_academic_internship_program_worth_it_for/,"Hi, I am a transfer student majoring in CS who had just spent a quarter at UCSD. I had been trying to find internship and I had turned in a few copies of my resume at the career fair, but none of them have responded to me. I know it's too late to find internship since most of the deadlines pass. I don't aim to intern at big companies, but finding a small company already seems hard.

I am wondering whether the Academic Internship Program is worth it for CS student? How is the experience when you work for the companies for free? Is it too late to apply for the program now? Because they require UC GPA and I have just completed my first quarter. I am willing to work for free, as long as the stuff that I work can enhance my resume and I have something to talk about at career fairs."

During fall I struggled to get interviews with companies and I feel like it’s largely due to zero experience. Since this time last year I was not in the business school yet (competitive admission) I struggled then too.

However! Later in the fall semester I was elected Vice President of Finance for my fraternity. So I can put that on my resume to start covering the experience portion since I’ve already done quite a bit of work.

I have a back up internship near my hometown for $16/hr but it leans more towards sales. Nothing is committed yet as it’s with my brothers work and they’re letting me explore options before committing.

So my question is, is there any advice anyone can give me on how to tailor my resume to be more attractive? Tips for interviews or how I should go about looking now that recruiting season is slowing down?

Any advice at all will be appreciated!"

I can speak English,German and Turkish. My toefl IBT score was 103 and i have a German certificate from a German university.

Since my GPAs are low i can't apply for masters in Germany/EU and i do not want to study further anyway.
No work experience apart from internships that i wouldn't put in my resume

Where and how can i find a job abroad? Should i just go to a bootcamp and build up a web developer portfolio,apply jobs online in EU and use my degrees to land a blue card(as far as i know with engineering degree i can get blue card even if i get a web development job)? 

I am also considering places like Dubai or Saudi arabia but i have heard employers take your passaport and force you to work overtime without paying etc. I just want to move to a country where i can earn good amount of money.

my parents can give me around 10000$ for a new beginning so thats my budget

I’ve applied to the few internships that are/were available in my city, but haven’t received a response (not even a note of rejection) and it’s been weeks. Perhaps it’s due to me being under qualified and not having too many things to go on my resume. Outside of school, I haven’t done much in relation to engineering. My work history only consists of working as a general laborer at various warehouses over the summer to earn cash to pay for school. I haven’t done many projects thus far in school, besides a very minimal one in my CAD course.  The only decent thing on my resume is my GPA which is about 3.48.  I don’t go to a big state school, so I don’t get to mess around too much and work on side projects or do research, since there’s only 3-4 professors per department. The biggest project we get to take part in is our senior project, but that’s in a 1/2 year for me.

I’ve already taken my resume to get it tuned up with schools advising department multiple times, so I don’t know if that’s the problem. 

Do you guys have any tips as to what I could do to improve my chances in hopes that I can land an internship?

I am expecting to get a lot hate for this because I know how hard people work to get an internship these days.

Anyways, I landed a 1 month internship with a defense technology company. I stated both on my CV and my cover letter that I was majoring in electrical engineering, they accepted me and I traveled back to my home country from where I was studying university. I was really excited because this was my first internship, I thought I could get a lot of work experience as well as learning more technical knowledge related to my major that would contribute to my studies.

 My first day, my supervisor wanted to introduce me to the department I was assigned. He assigned me to the computer science department, where people work on the software development/coding. I don’t have much knowledge of CS, I am an EE major I work more with VHDL, MATLAB or AuotCAD. I told him that on the spot. I said I am an EE major, I stated that on my cover letter, I don’t have much knowledge on CS, I don’t have solid coding knowledge, I won’t be any good use in a department I am not related to, and I would appreciate If he can change it to EE department in which they work on the IC/card designs/embedded systems etc and I said I would get more experience related to my studies. What he told me after this was exactly, “you will get used to it, you won’t make a real engineer without any coding knowledge anyways” and he left me there. For days they didn’t assign me anything at all, they gave me a desk with a computer and just left me there to “study Java, there is a pdf fine on desktop”. Noone would come to check up on me, ask me how I am doing or assign me anything. They forgot I existed so I went up to them, told them what I have learned so far about Java, and asked if there is anything else I can do every. single. day. They kept giving me relatively hard projects like TCP client/server connection with Java so that it would take my time. I want to emphasize that I had tiny bit of Java knowledge when I started, and I am really not a coding fan and the fact that I told them this, I told them I wasn’t fully grasping it and it would be better if I can get a EE job they kept telling me how I “wouldn’t make a real engineer without coding knowledge”. They would be annoyed at me and would have a sexist approach and I heard them saying “that is why females can’t make good engineers because they refuse to learn” I know that learning code is important, it is just not something I expected from this internship, I expected work experience, I expected to learn more about MY field. Because honestly I don’t have to go to work everyday, I can study Java at home, they didn’t even answer my questions on Java, they would just say “you will figure it out” whenever I asked to clear something up on the code. I felt like they weren’t happy with my presence, didn’t offer me any guidance even though I accepted to do something that wasn’t even related to my field and I had an approach of “okay just learn something new, you won’t lose anything” and they refused to help me. 

I was invisible for them, and they haven’t checked up on me for and it has been 2 weeks since I started, all I was doing was to rewrite my CVs to apply for new internships/study my next semester courses and to procrastinate during work hours. I am just so disappointed, discouraged and upset. I talked with my parents, they agreed with me and I quit today because I can’t take it anymore. Also they weren’t paying me, if that matters.

Thanks for taking your time to read this. I am sorry if there is anyone out there struggling to get an internship, while I am here wasting one.

To give a little bit of background about me, I have graduated from medical school in India and have been living on a non working visa in US for past four years. Meanwhile, I was preparing for US medical licensing exams which is necessary to apply for medical residency.

Unfortunately, I was unable to secure any Internal medical residency position this and have decided to choose a different career path.

I enjoy my degree course however ultimately I want to work as a software engineer or working in the technology environment.

Unfortunately my course doesn't have much programming modules at the moment (it will have some modules in 4th year). I'm proficient in matlab as we have used it quite a bit. I've also taken some classes in python outside of my degree to try and learn a new language. I found it quite interesting and took to it pretty quick even though it was a basic 6 week intro course. I would particularly liked to get involved in machine learning (I've read a couple of books on it and I find it fascinating!)

So the problem is I don't really have time to develop and continue to improve my programming skills because I have to dedicate a significant amount of time to my mechanical engineering modules.

I would love to get an internship somewhere over the summer and learn what it's like to work in the software development field and learn on the job. However without the experience with different languages every job I apply to usually goes to a CS student or someone who has experience in the field.

So should I just continue on with my studies and do an occasional class on the side? Or should I even bother given the fact I probably won't have enough time to learn it in detail without sacrificing my grades?

Any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated!!"

7nx0as,2,2018-01-03,Advertising Senior: Delaying May 2018 graduation to summer (forgo required internship &amp; focus on doing well in my last semester?) Any advice helps!,alaskaeyes,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/7nx0as/advertising_senior_delaying_may_2018_graduation/,"Hi everyone, sorry for the novel.
I'm a senior semi-on track to graduate in May. I need 5 classes to graduate. In addition to these, all advertising majors are required to complete a credit-bearing internship in order to graduate. All internships must be approved by the ADV department by 1/26/18. This process includes submitting an internship application form with information detailing your position, responsibilities, hours worked, etc. There are specific guidelines companies must follow to qualify and PAID internships in my field are very hard to come by especially in Austin.
Full details: https://advertising.utexas.edu/internships/undergraduate-internship-information

I am meeting with my advisor tomorrow to discuss putting off an internship to the summer, and ""walking"" in May. For anyone who has been in a similar situation whether it was due to lack of an internship or needing 1-2 summer classes to finish, what are some factors that helped you determine what was best for you?

Pros: more time to focus on my classes &amp; do well (full schedule: 15 hours + part-time job), more availability to work (get paid), more time to get involved in other things, protect my well-being and mental health
Cons: not graduate ""on-time,"" spread myself too thin, not being able to work at my job because I have to intern 15-20 hours/week &amp; I desperately need to have a source of income, not having enough time to join or try out a few new orgs, not having time for myself to do things that make me happy (painting, exercising, reading, going to concerts, spending time with friends)

For context: I have a part-time job, shifts are 12-4 or 4-8 M-Sat. It would be difficult to get hours with my current class schedule AND an internship. I don't get help from my parents for rent &amp; living. Single mom &amp; dad isn't really in the picture. My rent is way too much $1300 (that's another story but i'm stuck...) I've only really been involved with one org since my first semester but I want to explore new things &amp; meet more people because I regret not making the most of college. 
I've struggled immensely with depression this past year, I started getting medical treatment and seeing a doctor at the end of October but I've suffered since high school. It has definitely impacted me and my time here at UT.
Last semester was really bad. I failed one of the classes I need to graduate &amp; I have to retake my capstone for a C grade or better and I want to be successful in my last semester of college.

I've had 3 internships; 2 in Austin at the largest music promotion companies in Texas (they didn't qualify) and my first big-time corporate internship at Turner Broadcasting this past summer in NYC. I didn't apply for this internship to be approved despite the fact it qualified simply because I couldn't afford to be enrolled in the 3-hour internship class which is the only way to get credit (summer tuition $1864, you need 6 hours to get loans) on top of paying my sublet deposits in May ($1900), my ATX+NYC combined rent for May-Aug(~$1400), living expenses (food, subway $32/week, etc.) and $11/hour pay.
I got my New York internship through an internship program for minorities in the media industry: http://www.t-howard.org/ (good people &amp; opportunities, unfortunately no stipends/financial assistance hence my struggles above)
I applied for another post-grad internship program for minorities &amp; unfortunately wasn't selected so this is my backup, you can still intern as a recent grad. I really don't like corporate but if I'm being completely honest with myself, I don't think I have enough experience to get a full-time job anywhere where I'll have the opportunity to learn &amp; grow. I don't have any full-time offers lined up as most media/ad entry-level jobs don't hire until February/March.

TLDR
Focus on myself and do better in school, get involved, work for money, then intern in the summer to officially graduate. Or suck it up, do my best to manage my mental health &amp; time, possibly sacrifice having a steady income.
I'm a hard worker, I enjoy learning, I love school. Because of my upbringing &amp; the struggles I've faced, I truly value relationships with other people, being a good person &amp; giving back is important to me. But depression, worrying about money, having to work since I moved out during my last semester of high school at 17 and providing for myself really fucked me up. 

P.S.
I'm not from Texas, I'm from a small ass town in Michigan. I don't really see myself growing professionally here in Austin. I've felt stuck since junior year. I've done and seen what I wanted to in Austin's music industry in Austin. I'd only stay here if I got a job at Facebook. I'm still figuring out if advertising is something I want to go into. Thought NY was my dream but it wasn't for me. The media/advertising/music industries can be very toxic. My dream is to travel to many places, I studied abroad in Hong Kong and loved it. I've travelled to NY, LA, San Fran, Denver &amp; Chicago. I'd love to live/work in Chicago or San Francisco, maybe Colorado. I've got big dreams. My life hasn't been easy but I'm determined to do what makes me happy and make a difference in the world."

How would my job outlook be, considering I did fairly well in MicroP, if I wanted to obtain a position, intern or full-time, at a hardware company (with only have taken MicroP)? Or should I just stick to CIS design and perhaps choose tech electives in the ECE department (DSP, microP2), or ones that doesn't have too many prerequisite attached to them? I have to take into account about my living expenses for this year, as I am tight on finances as well. I'm looking at 3 semesters currently, if I stay with CEN track.

Thanks! "

This company is a vendor for FedEx and many other companies. One question on FedEx's application process is: ""Are you or have you ever worked as a vendor of FedEx?"" or something to that extent. Does the answer matter?

**Do they want to hire former/current vendors sooner than other people, or do they avoid hiring vendors as their own full-time employees?**

There are some other companies around here, but they do not offer what FedEx offers as far as I've seen thus far.

- I graduated at a university with B.S. in Software Engineering on December 2016. So one year has passed since my graduation.

I haven't been passionate about coding and solving problems throughout the college years and didn't try very hard because I hated most of my professors and the way they taught. But if I look back on it now it's just my excuse, I should have studied/tried harder , and I feel pathetic. My overall GPA is 3.2 and major GPA is probably quite lower. I didn't put my GPA on my resume.

The only experiences I have on my resume are:
- three course projects that weren't very big or serious and I feel at least decent about them
- general manager experience I have had while working at a sushi restaurant
- a temporary hire experience making a Garry's Mod custom game mode for a social psychology research at a university.

- I remember learning most of the basic data structures &amp; algorithms that I would have to re-study in order to be able to use any of.
- I have no personal projects, internships, or contribution to open source projects to show off.
- I tried to learn web development through FreeCodeCamp but stopped because it will take too long before I would be done and I need to find a job soon.
- I just finished learning how to use Git and Github including how to collaborate with others.
- about 30 applications have been ignored or rejected so far.

I feel lost and I feel inadequate. I'm willing to keep studying and learning but I just want to get started, get my foot in the door. I know once I get started, with a little bit of help, I can grow fast. My savings are getting dry and I have to bills to pay. I don't know what to do. I don't want to just keep applying when I know nobody will look at me and close all the doors that could be open for me if I can do something to get their attention.

tl;dr - It has been over a year since my graduation with a B.S. in software engineering and I have no proud work or experience to showcase. I'm living with my girlfriend who has a job here in San Francisco but I need to find a job soon. I know I can grow fast and have the intelligence to do the work in this field, but have nothing to show and am not getting noticed. What should my next step be?"

I have held a lot of jobs in retail and in food service, as well as an internship in high school at a small distributing company in their accounting department (all I did there was sort files for 2 weeks), and recently worked under a financial advisor as his assistant (again, mostly just sorting files).

My school really puts an emphasis on how important it is to have an internship, and I'm worried if I don't get one I won't be able to have the career that I want.

I graduated college about 2.5 years ago with an engineering degree, and a little bit after college I was lucky enough to get a job with a below average GPA, no internships, and all that extracurricular stuff people did. I think I landed the job because not many people wanted to work in that area or the business. I started with let’s say 55k at a manufacturing plant, and was very excited. 

A little time passed and I started getting really un-interested or motivated to do any work. I did the bare minimum to just not get fired, and I spent a whole year browsing the internet, doing minor projects and all. However, my work apparently was very much appreciated by a lot of people (I know, baffling).I also had such an awesome relationship with almost everyone at work. By the time I wanted to leave (1 full year of employment), I was approached by 2 high level HQ people (think VP of a 10,000 employee company) and was asked to stay. I was offered other jobs within the company in more interesting locations, with hikes in pay, but I thought it was that I didn’t believe in the product or vision was pulling me down, so I left.

I quit at about the year mark, got another job in another state paying me around 65K, which was like a promotion and nice title. It was with a midsize manufacturing company, about 700 employees overall. I felt so good in the interview process, especially since I was interviewed by the CEO and was selected by him personally. I also worked there for less than a year. It started well, I was excited and eager to make lots of changes, but that quickly dwindled away, and I became as demotivated as ever. Having my own big personal office made it easier to waste time and not do work. Except the bare minimum again.  Same story as before, when I was trying to leave because I just didn’t feel it, the company was moving heaven and earth to keep me (I really do not understand why, they still tell me that, as we keep in touch). I was told I did an amazing job, which I do not feel like it is true whatsoever. 

I quickly got another job as contractor, manager with no direct reports in another company, paying me roughly 80K (that was about 5 months ago). Within a freaking week, I was looking for a way out. This current job is with a fortune 500 company, where I work as a manager in their global HQ. There were some layoffs recently, which included half of the department and the manager that hired me. However, again, I was told I have been recommended for an internal position even higher than my current one. Surprise, surprise, and this whole time I wasn’t really working again. Just doing whatever is necessary to keep a job. However, I actually know for a fact that I do not like the culture in this place, not even close to my 2 previous jobs.

Right now, I am offered another position with a company that is consistently ranked among the top 100 companies to work for in the world. A lower position in rank, around the same pay, and I am really thinking about it. 

However I am scared that me changing all these jobs is indicating something seriously wrong with my work ethic or something? I can’t be motivated at all in all of the 3 jobs I took. I don’t really believe in what they do, but I feel like I will with the next company. Also, at every job I literally did the bare minimum, yet I am still praised like a superstar performer, which is not true, that also is just baffling me, and making me extremely confused.

Please, I am seeking your advice &amp; opinion, and I apologize if this was too long

So  I figured I'd post it here as well in case there are people interested in this.

**Introduction**

College is a big decision for people.  To narrow down a school based on career prospects and location is a daunting task, and it isn't made any easier if you consider other factors as well.  I can't really offer you any insight on how to decide which school has the best food, but I can help you look at equestrian opportunities of various schools.  These ultimately boil down to 3 separate types: school run equestrian programs, student run programs, and private barns.  They all have their pros and cons which I've listed below.





**School Run Equestrian Programs**

These programs are run by the college or university at facilities that are often owned by the college/university.  Competitive riding teams are often coached by college faculty.  Many of these schools have much smaller student communities that may only number in the hundreds to a few thousands

*Pros*

* Equestrian centers are a part of campus, thus there is usually easy transportation or access by the students to them.

* Many schools will use their equestrian centers as classrooms and provide majors related to the equine industry.

* Many schools and programs have easy access to the equine industry through personal networks of the faculty.  Can make finding an equine job very easy.

* Some schools have a very good reputation for their equine programs and can make getting an internship or job much easier.

* Horse show competitions can be held on campus, definitely beats getting up at 4AM for a 3 hour drive to another school (You'll probably still have to get up at 4AM to care for the horses though).

*Cons*

* Can be quite competitive. If you aren't riding that frequently, you might not make it onto the competition teams.  Some of the riders who are applying for these schools ride daily and compete regularly within organizations like USEF and AQHA. If you do make it to the team, then showing is usually mandatory.

* Many schools running their own equine programs will not have nearly as much variety in choice of majors for other fields.  Also, the programs they do have may not be as highly ranked.

* Can be rather expensive.  An equestrian center with a couple dozen horses usually isn't cheap.

**Student Run Organizations**


These kind of programs are run by the students, for the students with support from the college/university.  They will often hire a nearby horse trainer/barn owner to be the coach for the team.  Different colleges offer differing amounts of support to the team and some schools cover all travel expenses for collegiate competitions.

*Pros*

* Excellent leadership opportunities if you're interested. Lead the team as captain, or manage the finances.  Be in charge of membership or team events.  Any of these positions give valuable experience for any career.

* Can be very economical, depending on school support.  It will almost always be cheaper than riding at a school run program.

* Can be found almost anywhere in the country.  Schools you might not associate with horses very likely do have a team.

* Will usually be much more laid back and open to anyone.  Usually more beginner friendly than other programs, competitions are usually optional, and will usually have a larger variety of rider backgrounds.

* Larger schools will often have very good programs and a wide variety of majors to choose from (Engineering might not have a lot to do with horses but at least you'll have the money for a horse! Time is another issue entirely)

*Cons*

* Programs are often unknown.  You may have to look for the program.  (Ohio State has an equestrian team?!?! Yes. Yes they do.)

* The teams will usually not attract the best riding talent from high school, though it would be unwise to dismiss them for it.

* Many of these teams need to fundraise or participate in community service.


**Private Barns**

If the school doesn't have a student equestrian team or an equestrian program of their own, odds are there is a local private barn with riding lessons available to you.  These are going to be local trainers or horse owners that are horse crazy and proud of it!

*Pros*

* You can find one just about anywhere in the continental USA, Canada, and even Alaska! I can't speak for Hawaii but they probably exist there too.

* Usually very flexible with lessons. Only constraint is YOUR schedule.

* Small barn families make for great stories and adventures.  The dorm won't be your home, the barn is!

* Working student positions are more likely to exist

* There is rarely only just one barn nearby, enabling you to compare lesson prices if you wish.

*Cons*

* Very limited, if any, competition opportunities.

* Getting rides to and from the barn without a car can prove challenging

* Local barn owners may not have enough experience to teach beyond a certain level


Though these are 3 basic categories, every program is different and there will be advantages and disadvantages that might not be listed above.  I encourage you to look at each program individually.  Next, I'm going to discuss competition organizations.





**Collegiate Competitions**

At the collegiate level, there are multiple organizations that oversee the competitive riding teams across the country.  Some are specific to schools, while others cater to a specific discipline.  Some of the main programs in the United States are the NCEA (National Collegiate Equestrian Association), the IHSA (Intercollegiate Horse Show Association), IDA (Intercollegiate Dressage Association), and the American National Riding Commission (ANRC).


*NCEA*

A part of the NCAA, this organization oversees women's equestrian teams across 23 United States schools.  This is the only one of the 4 that is exclusively for women.  The NCEA offers competitions in Equitation on the Flat, Equitation over Fences, Horsemanship, and Reining (in other words, both hunt seat and western riding).  For more information, check out their website at http://www.collegiateequestrian.com/


*IHSA*

Founded by Bob Cacchione (I have a mug signed by him) in 1967, this organization has grown to serve almost 400 schools across the continental United States and Canada.  The organization has approximately 8400 riders participating in horse shows all across the country.  The IHSA offers competitions in Equitation on the Flat, Equitation over Fences, Horsemanship, and Reining.  The main difference between the IHSA and NCEA, besides member schools, is the IHSA does not have any gender restrictions.  Also, while they both offer the same assortmant of riding diciplines, the scoring system between them are different.  The IHSA offers competition classes suitable for all levels of riding.  For more information, check out their website at http://www.ihsainc.com/        For a listing of current teams, check out https://members.ihsainc.com/publicteaminfo/currentteams.aspx


*IDA*

Founded as an informal competition between northeastern United States schools in 1995, the IDA now has more than 50+ member schools across the country.  The organization provides competitions for Dressage, possibly the most ""artsy"" form of riding (I don’t mean this in a dismissive way, I have the greatest respect to those who make dressage look easy).  They offer competition classes suitable for all levels of riding.  For more information, check out their website at http://www.teamdressage.com/home


*ANRC*

Founded in 2006 and an affiliate of the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) and the United States Hunter Jumper Association (USHJA), the ANRC has served 80 schools through the ANRC Intercollegiate Equitation Championship.  Riders may compete in one of two levels: a National level at 3’ and a Novice level at 2’6”.  Teams and riders are judged in their performance through 4 phases of competition.  For more information, check out their website at http://anrc.org/





**Conclusion and Author's Note**

There is a lot of information out there for prospective collegiate riders, and trust me when I say that you don't have to give up your riding just to go to school.  So many opportunities exist for almost every interest, and I can practically guarantee that you will find a school and a riding program that is right for you.  Some schools even have multiple teams, which can give you the opportunity to compete in multiple collegiate organizations.  

My own experience with collegiate riding has been through a student run organization (Semi Varsity Club Sport) and I have primarily competed within the IHSA.  My knowledge of the other competitions are limited to what I could gather from their own websites and Google so I encourage you to do your own research into those organizations or contact them and ask directly.  If you have questions specific to the IHSA or student run equestrian teams, my own experience can probably answer your question or at least point you in the right direction.  

Lastly, many teams (student run and school run) have websites with information about their team.  Some of these teams offer programs like a ""Test Ride"" where high school students can get a tour of campus and of equestrian facilities, a lesson or introduction with the team coach, and a day as a ""member"" of the team.  Take advantage of these and see what a day in the life of a collegiate equestrian is like.  For the IHSA specifically, their member list that I provided has links to many of these websites.  Take a look at what is out there, you'll find something.

Long time lurker but first time poster. I need your guys help with something I was just asked to do by my boss. So apologies if this is a tad long or in the wrong spot mods. Let me know if I need to change anything. 

*Short backstory:* 
I have been the sole IT Admin for my small-ish company (~100 total users) for about 6 months now. However I am still in Uni for Comp Sci and technically I am only an intern. I was brought on to help share the load with the previous Admin and do some Software Programming (which is my major). However he left a few months after I was brought on and I was asked to take on the full time role of IT Admin with the occasional help from contractors when we do a big project (New Server, Server Failure, etc). I am still learning as quickly as I can, but as the only Admin its hard most days. 

*So the problem:*
My boss just asked me a few hours ago to give him a full Performance Audit on all of our servers (2 Physical with around 5 VM's each, and 2 NAS Servers) from the past month by tomorrow afternoon. The problem is, we don't really have any performance monitoring and logging software in place. I have set up a small Spice-Works server to track tickets and devices, but the Spice-Works Network Monitor only displays performance metrics in real time, with no logging capabilities. I have been wanting to set up a Grafana Monitoring and Logging Database for some time now, I just have never had the time to do so. 

From what I have been reading online, and from the tools and systems I have researched in the past, it seems like I can only gather the kind of information he is requesting from *after* I set the systems up and get them configured properly. Two of our servers do have User Defined Performance Counters set in place, however they are only for CPU metrics, and I am not sure as how to interpret the data aside from *""Meh, it looks normal?""*.

Any help or advice you guys can give me is hugely appreciated. I will try my best to answer any questions to the best of my ability, but please bear with the stupid questions since Server work is hardly a skill I possess. 

**TL;DR:** Boss asked for server performance from the past month; don't have systems to log performance in place (only real time). Plz help. 

Thanks,

I’ve been working at my first internship at a small company writing a small web-service. As some background, I pretty much have full ownership of the project and have built it from the ground up.

I’m at a point where I’m finishing up a tool that’s going to be used during my team’s transition into the web-service, but I’m running into some issues with my workflow.

I’ve been reading through Clean Code as well as reviewing code smells and common refactoring patterns these past few months, and I’m trying to apply them to the codebase I’ve already created. I’ve had some success with smaller, more isolated changes, but whenever I’m attempting to overhaul an interface, I get stuck in this overwhelming change pattern.

Abstractly, I’ll go to change an interface, but then I’ll realize that I want to refactor another interface to work with it and so on and so forth until I’ve introduced a ton of changes, none of which are complete, and  I get overwhelmed to the point where I just revert to previous commit.

This seems to me to be indicative, perhaps, of tight-coupling in my system, but it seems more like that changing an interface naturally causes issues for members using those interfaces, regardless of implementation. Moreover, I’ve got a pretty good test suite that I’ve built up alongside the project, so I can check if my changes work, at least.

That being said, I feel as if I haven’t been taking advantage of Code Reviews as much as I should have, and I often struggle to write tests before production code, so a lot of refactoring that I do has to do with making my code more testable in the first place.

So, my question is: How do you guys go about avoiding getting overwhelmed like this? Is there a common term for what I’m describing? Or does it just come down to experience?

Thanks for any and all advice, guys!"

As for Bloomberg, I've heard generally better sentiment about work culture/not wanting to shoot yourself during full time work, including that the intern program is better organized and there's a mentorship program and everything. The projects they said interns were working on were features to their internal chat or email or scheduling systems, which is not the most engaging work, but maybe as an intern that's asking for too much.

I came from a very poor high school. When I started college at our small state university, I met a LOT of people that made me realize just how poor my high school was. Even still, I've managed to work hard and keep at the top of the pack (not #1 or anything but I think I'm up there).  I've managed to secure one internship in software engineering because of a previous professor that put in a good word for me, but I don't REALLY want to be a software developer.

I've applied to every internship that I am both interested in and qualified. Still, I've only heard from my boss at my previous internship about continuing at that company for another summer. Meanwhile, I have friends that are get interviews left and right. Some are even hearing back from huge companies like Google, Amazon, and Qualcomm to name a few. Many of these people (not to sound proud), seem at least a little less qualified than me. I suppose I could be wrong, but I really don't think so. I've looked at their resumes and portfolios/websites and GitHub accounts and none of it seems much different or better than mine.

I just don't see what I could possibly be doing wrong. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated. I can post a resume if anyone would like to take a look.

TLDR: I'm having absolutely no luck finding an internship for the summer. How do I just get an interview?"

My issue is I am unsure how best to position myself for an internship considering large percentage of companies don’t offer internships aimed at a freshman, I don’t have the most amazing side projects or outside knowledge to compensate, being new to the field, etc. 

Sowhagis the most appropriate way to cold-contact a person with hiring authority in a company (that doesn’t explicitly offer / have internships) about the possibility of a internship with said company? Especially in the context of a freshman student who lacks the experience and knowledge of upperclassman?

My thinking is to send a cover-letter style email explaining who I am (school, major, name, etc.), why I am interested in said company (specifics about the company I admire, why I would like an internship with them), what I can offer (passionate about the field, willing and eager to learn, passion &gt; experience, etc.), and finally a note of thanks and statement saying when I will be following up with them. Then attatfhibg what resume I do have to the message.

I intend to do this to specific people so I am figuring LinkedIn would be my best bet, if not then email.

Anyone have any suggestions? "

My primary reason for joining the military was so I can be able to go back to school and get a CS degree to become a Software Engineer.

It’s been a while since I have started learning to code so I would assume I would be starting from scratch since I am still a beginner. I also only have 17 college credits which were only general classes anyways. After I finish testing for my job related courses I will have more free time during my afternoons. I don’t know what should my priority be at that point. Learning how to code or taking classes. I am a bit weary about taking college level math since it has always been my weak point and I feel like I should brush up on my math before taking actual courses. I probably won’t be able to do any internships until after I leave the military so I should have at-least a few projects under my belt by that time.

I don’t want to separate unless I have a certain amount of money saved up since I have no idea what my living arrangement would be when I get out. I will be able to get a housing allowance while I’m in school but i am not sure about the summer and winter months. Would getting an internship during the summer help or should I get a part time job while in school?

Any advice would help.

I know I have plenty of time before my contract is up but I have this bad habit of thinking ahead instead of being present.

I thought back then that C++ is more suitable for me - useful in competitive programming and It is a richer language  - and now I am reading Bjarne stroustrup's book "" Programming: principles and practice using C++"" but I am not quite sure if am on the right path. When, I have started learning C++, because I read that is  a very efficient and powerful language and how it gives you more power than Java or Python and how C and C++ are useful to understand what is happening under the hood and as a CS student and as I am interested in learning advanced CS topics,I have chosen to learn it. But, now after nearly 6 months, I still struggle doing any useful project, to make something very small like  getting data from a Web API I have searched a lot trying to figure how to do it and I still can't do it. Also, I started noticing that a lot of big programmers emphasize on that programming languages are just tools and programming is not only coding. Also,  I read that C and C++ are powerful for professional programmers not newbies who will make crappy designs with them and it is better to learn safer language like Java or Python like in this [article](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) by Peter Norvig. Furthermore and what makes me more doubtful that I have noticed a lot of colleagues doing great things using Python or Java after learning them in a short time and if I apply for an internship now what I will be hired for! C++ is used in advanced things that are above my knowledge now. I am sorry if this post is quite long but I am really confused now, and I don't know what should do ? Thank you for your help and sorry for my bad English.

PS: I don't have any problem in understanding C++ and learning it alone.

The flow state I get into when I'm doing it at home is incredible, almost addictive. But in the work place, I just hate the agendas, the politics.

I graduated college last May and went straight into a job. My mistake. The company was so incompetent and I was lied to a lot. A digital marketing agency that didn't even have a website, go figure.

I ended up quitting there after three months and moving into an internship role instead at a much bigger, much more reputable company, which was advertised to me as a learning experience where I would shadow a more experienced developer. I haven't spoken to my ""mentor"" in about two weeks, my messages are always ignored and he brushes me off when I attempt to shadow him. A full time junior role opened up at the company and I found out about it from my email subscription to new job openings on job websites, nobody from the company has told me to apply or notified me of the opening, so I guess that's a bad sign.

I just feel like I work so hard at this and I'm going nowhere. It's been 7 months since I've finished college and I don't feel like I've progressed at all. These work environments make me unhappy and as much as I complain about other people, I know that I am the common denominator here. It's a shame because I really love what I do, I just seem to hate working with it. Rationally I know I should power on and eat shit at this stage of my career, but at the cost of my fucking mental health? What if I go somewhere else and it's the same? That will be three companies I'm unhappy at. So that's why I'm thinking this career might not be for me. Thoughts?"

• My school requires freshman to live on campus their first year, however, I might fall within the exemption requirements since my parents are trying to move within 30 miles of my college (they're moving just for my college).

So I work in transit, as an electronics/comms technician. I have an A.S. in electrical and electronics, and I'm moving on to my bachelor's in EE.

Here's the thing. I already make $100k, plus overtime. The job is decent. I'm not hard up for advancing my career. But besides the intermittent trouble calls, the scheduled maintenance is extremely repetitive and pretty unfulfilling. I live in the S.F. bay area, and even at my wage buying a home is a daunting task. So a change will definitely be welcome. I also want a better work schedule, and at least slightly less time outside.

I know that at my previous employer (also a transit agency) had in-house engineers topping out at close to $200k, and starting at the same rate as what I make now. My current employer is a brand new system, and they just hired a ""manager of train control systems"" at ~$180k, and I'm sure they would also be looking to hire in-house engineers in the near future.

My concern is how well my experience as a technician will translate to getting an engineering job. I have been going to school while working full-time for the last couple years, and will continue to do so. I honestly can't afford to quit work and take an internship, due to my day-to-day financial obligations. These transit agency jobs in train control engineering usually require a couple years of relevant experience and I'm worried that if I bother to get my B.S.E.E. it won't be quite enough to make the jump.

So I'm wondering, is there anyone here that works in the industry that might be able to fill me in? Or are there any hiring managers that might have some advice as to whether technician experience has any value?

Thanks in advance."
7oi76y,32,2018-01-06,Why do so many companies appear to not want to hire entry level/Junior engineers?,JunSYooGSukJ,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7oi76y/why_do_so_many_companies_appear_to_not_want_to/,"The titles for job posting in this industry are really odd .

Over these past few months I have been job searching in addition to my internship search. I’ve noticed that most jobs use the title Software Engineer or Senior Software Engineer. Software Engineer alone with out a level listed is ambiguous when it comes to experience. That leaves Entry level engineers and Software engineers with at least 2+ years under their belt fighting for the same jobs.

.

Now I’ve always thought that “New Grad”, “Entry Level” and “Junior” for the most part was the same thing. Just that a junior software engineer would’ve at least had 2 or 3 internships. 

But companies will list Junior SE expecting the experience of someone who has been an engineer for 5yrs. Junior Software Engineer &amp; Software Engineer job posts will often have the same requirements. 

I also feel that there aren’t many SE job postings with New Grad or Entry Level in the title. 

Do companies not want to hire noobs. 

I’m always hearing about how there aren’t enough people to fill all these programming jobs. Which is usually followed by “there aren’t enough qualified engineers to fill these jobs”. I find it crazy that some people on this reddit couldn’t land a job 1-2yrs after graduating. 

.

If companies put in the effort to train and mentor fresh engineers the whole ecosystem would benefit and there would be more qualified engineers in the pool of applicants. 

**What do you guys think qualifies as New Grad, Entry Level and Junior?**

For those working full time **does your company appear to be interested in hiring and mentoring people with little to no experience** or does your company stare clear of nooby engineers?"
7oi7g4,3,2018-01-06,Need help on choosing between two offers,10boogies,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7oi7g4/need_help_on_choosing_between_two_offers/,"This is a huge first-world problem and I hope no one gets too upset at me for this.

Just got an offer at both Amazon and Salesforce for a summer internship, and though I'm beyond excited that I was fortunate enough to have this opportunity, I'm torn trying to choose one over the other and wanted to hear what others had to say from their own past experiences or what they've heard of from companies from colleagues.

The pros of Amazon from what I can tell is that I find Amazon's work really interesting. I have a huge interest in cybersecurity and somewhat of an interest in data science which draws me to Amazon with their work in AWS and Alexa. I'd love to be in Seattle and find the thought of living in a new city for the summer to be really interesting, and think that Amazon's 'name' would be impressive and would help me in the future.

The issues I have with Amazon is the apocalyptic stories of their company culture, work-life balance, and expectations from their employees. Though I'm sure these stories are somewhat exaggerated for media attention, I have lingering fears that Amazon could be working their employees to the bone with little concern for their work-life balance especially when I contrasted it with Salesforce's ""Ohana"" culture. I have heard that any of these issues are few and far between when I asked my friends who worked at Amazon last summer and are largely team dependent, but I heard many complaints about the AWS team and that was something that I was interested in working on.

I don't have an immediate interest in Salesforce's work but was really impressed with how well it seems like they treat their employees. They offered me a very large housing stipends which I could just keep since I live in the area and tons of cool perks that go beyond Amazon's free bananas and dog parks. My concern with Salesforce is that the location I was extended an offer from is not their headquarters in the Bay Area and am somewhat concerned that the office might not be what I expect. Salesforce pays less hourly but with the stipends would give me a few thousand more at the end of the summer, especially since I live in near the area so I could eat at/commute from home.

If it means anything I thought the Salesforce interview was really easy, the technical question I was given would have taken anyone less than 2-3 minutes to solve. Amazon had a few rounds of many design-oriented questions where my interviewer would have cool conversations with me and created hypothetical situations to make me rethink what I was doing, even when it was 'right'. I'm not sure if that would reflect in the interns if one company was more selective than the other, but it's just something to note.

TLDR Salesforce seems nicer and overall would pay more, Amazon has some scary stories but I'm more interested in their work.

Any personal stories/opinions about these two companies' internship programs? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

I'm majoring in CS and I'm in my third year (Junior year) now. I am fortunate to have received an internship offer with Dell for this summer in America. I have heard great things about it from my seniors who have interned there, and I hear Dell hires largely from its intern pool, so the chances of getting a full time offer is high.

I really like it in America. I have many friends here, the weather is decent, the quality of life is great, etc. I would like to stay here if I can, but of course that's easier said than done. During my 3 year OPT, I have about a 25% chance of getting an H1-B visa with Dell (they said they would sponsor me) every year. I have calculated the chance of getting the visa at least once in these three years to be around 58%, and I don't like those odds. I will, of course, try, because at the very least I will be earning quite a bit with Dell (I live in a low COL area + I am being paid a good amount for an intern relative to where I would work, which will of course rise if I get a full time position).

So those of you who have had to deal with the H1-B process, how was it? Did you guys get the visa? If not, where are you now? Is there anything I can do to make the odds better (guessing not)? If I do get a return offer for full time, I would be in my fourth year after this summer; can I ask the company to apply for me again in this year so I have another year's worth of chance (not sure if you guys would know this, I'll ask HR there)? Assuming I do get the visa, it's only a 6 year period. With Trump's new laws, it looks bleaker than ever, and the backlog for us Indians is about a decade.

My plan so far is this: try getting a return offer for full time employment (or in career fair in 4th year get offer with another company), apply for visa. If I do get it, apply for green card. If I don't get it by the end of the OPT, I'll apply for MBA (which I was planning on doing sooner or later), and then use that OPT to try again.

What do you guys think? Any advice or stuff I should know about?

Thanks, guys!"

He is least interested in searching a job elsewhere.

The founder held a Q/A session and answered a few of questions. But I am still skeptical. Their website (pucho.co) isn't functioning and some of the things he says in the Q/A don't feel that believable. There is no mention of them or about their potential investors on the internet. There is a high chance that I might be wrong, but I don't my friend to be completely obsessed with the potential chance of getting an internship only to find out that its a sham.

Problem is, his parents (his mom specifically) are - and this is just my impression here - insane. They refuse to let him take opportunities that he's earned, won't sign the things that would allow him to travel to the amazing summer internships he's being offered, and I get the impression anyway that even if he could start capitalizing on his potential, they would be horrible at managing his income, etc.

My friend (his aunt) seems like the only person he can really confide in about this stuff. We've talked a lot about the situation and it seems pretty obvious to me that it's in his best legal interest to get emancipated ASAP so that he can start doing his work and not be beholden to the whims of his mother. 

His aunt has done some research about this on his behalf, but they live in Virginia and, according to her, ""in VA you essentially have to be pregnant, married, or abandoned to get emancipated.""

This is not my family and I'm not here to make moral judgements about anyone (other than, yeah, it sounds like his mom is crazy) or start a witch hunt. Nor do I have any financial stake in this kid's career. I just want the cold hard legal facts and access to any kind of information that could help him."

When I got out of college I wasn't confident in my development skills and had no internships.  I ended up getting a position doing application support.

Thankfully the position did require lots of use of sql, and basic use of html/css/javascript.  After about a year of this, I was promoted to Level 2 support.  This was basically a bug fixing role, if level 1 couldn't figure it out and it needed a code fix, my team would do it.  I did this for another year, but I really wanted new feature development.

Company kept giving me the runaround and wouldn't give me the opportunity for proper dev work so I left.  I was also underpaid.

In company 2, I was a software engineer, but the environment was so hectic and disorganized that I never knew what was going on. Commute was also very bad.  I ended up leaving after 3 months.

Company 3 seemed like it would be perfect.  20 minute commute, small tight knit team.  Relaxed environment.  Manager seemed cool on the phone.  After I joined the manager showed who he really was.  Very micromanaging, snarky to everyone, had this attitude of ""you work for me now, you are my bitch.""  Very bad at planning.  Would dump more work on us a few days before the sprint ended and expected us to get it done, even though it was over capacity.  Many late nights staying til 2am, 4am, etc.

I stayed there for close to 2 years. My time there ended when after working till 10pm one night, I got home and fell asleep.  Next day I was grilled on why I didn't go home and log back in to keep working.  I was fired.

That brings us to my current company.  Large bank.  During the interview it seemed like I would be doing software development.  After joining, I realized it's all production/tech support.  I work on a very small team where no one talks to each other, I have no one to turn to for help, and the applications are in horrible state.  I was told there might be development this year, but I'd still be on the hook for production support.  I expressed concern that developers need to focus on code, and if they are getting distracted by end users, it's no good.  I was basically told that this is the job and to deal with it.

I haven't done any coding for the last 6 months.  I can count the number of lines of code I have written at this job on 1 hand.  It's getting to the point where I'm forgetting how to do stuff.

I looped around 360 to the same job I had out of college, just with more pay.

I've been trying to find a new job with no luck.  the .NET market here seems to be the same 3-4 companies hiring.  Most with old school dress codes, etc.  Most of these jobs are in the city, whereas I'm in the burbs. I am currently commuting to the city, but it is a 1 hour commute.  I have no interest in moving closer because I hate the city environment.

Switching stacks will just cause me to have to take a pay cut.

I have a pretty fundamental grasp of python (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and NLTK). I have no formal CS education and have not taken any bootcamp courses. My question is, how can I make the shift towards this career path this late in the game? Should I go back to school and get a degree (will take 2 years and another 15,000 in student lone debt). Or should I search for some internship, or low paying gigs where someone could potentially show me the ropes. Does that sort of thing exist for someone in my position?

7onq7g,1,2018-01-06,[Student Loans / Alberta] I am about to graduate and only have one course left in my degree (so I am not a full time student). There are a few issues.,embarassedAndScared_,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/7onq7g/student_loans_alberta_i_am_about_to_graduate_and/,"I don't even know what to do or how to begin to do this. I'm so stressed out I can barely piece words together so I apologize for how frantic / poorly structured this is in advance.

I am currently absolutely seeking employment and am really terrified of the prospects of how long it might take me to get a job. 

Since I am only going to be considered a part time student as I have 1 mandatory course left for my degree. (I had no choice in this and it was unfortunately NOT due to negligence on my part, I realize this is a horrific position to be in. I really wish I could have avoided it.) 

Meaning, student loans I can prettymuch expect in less than 6 months to come knocking. *If, and only if I took 2 more courses I DO NOT need for my degree could I be considered a full time student*. Full time student status means 3 courses / ""9 credits"". While at the same time this is going to set me back financially as well as I am paying for those courses and need to pay attention to those courses which could be used to try and market myself / prepare for interviews / apply out. Which depresses me to say because I realize that there is surely not an infinite number of positions out there.

But, if I am considered a full time student for 4 more months then that offsets the student loans for a bit longer. 

To be frank, they will crush me. I can literally not pay them. It is actually impossible for me to do. I'd need to take out a loan to pay this loan.

And I don't want to default because up until this point my credit is extremely good mostly in thanks to my parents helping where they can (and even where they can't, we're a middle class family that's struggling with a lot of job issues right now aside from myself personally.).

I don't have a job right now. I am not able to even afford my own shelter (rent/mortgage) so I have had to move in with my parents. I don't even have the luxury or privilege of owning a car, I simply can't even afford the gas let alone the vehicle itself. Like I am literally making 0 dollars right now, and I know I would be homeless if it wasn't for my parents at this point. Flat out I would be homeless.

I had an internship where I made a small amount of money but being absolutely honest, even saving my pennies during that time, I am a very far cry away from even being remotely close to paying off my student loan amounts. (It's estimated around $650 a month from provincial and federal).

To say I am scared is prettymuch an understatement. 

I want to pay them back, but with no job I literally don't have the means to even begin to try. I will of course be applying out, and my degree has been well argued to be highly employable, but I'm freaking out to the point I am actually having ulcers as a diagnosis as I am voiding blood in my stool every day lately."

I don't want to alienate the Defense contractor by asking them to hold off for a while, because I don't know exactly when the Agency is gonna get back to me with a final offer.

Should I just say yes to the Defense contractor so I'm at least guaranteed a job if the Agency doesn't work out for some reason? Or should I just be upfront and tell them I waiting on another offer and see if they will give me more time?

I am not quite 40 ( 35) but thinking of going back to school, but not sure for what, but I would likely be forty once I got out. People keep telling me not to go back to school because no company is gonna hire a 40 year old entry level worker with no experience. Plus I would find it hard to keep my full time job, go to school, plus find an internship, which would likely be unpaid/not enough to live on, that would work around my FT job and school schedule so then I would graduate with no experience. I feel this and my advanced age would be working against me. 

I have a bachelors degree in marketing (had a low gpa due to working full time and going to school full time) but have never worked in marketing, but I would consider going back to school for these fields:

-some type of trade 
-IT
-Healthcare (MRI tech, nursing, or some other field)
-Physical therapist assistant
-Mechanical or electrical engineering 
-Education "
7op2c8,6,2018-01-07,"What should I know before buying a car? (Vancouver, BC)",coocoo99,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/7op2c8/what_should_i_know_before_buying_a_car_vancouver/,"**Background &amp; Considerations**

I'm a university student in my junior year of undergrad and I received a 4 month summer internship offer (May-Aug). The hope would be to do well and get a full-time return offer upon graduation in 2019. Public transit is not possible given my work hours (work starts at 5-5:30 am which is before buses/trains are operational). My options are to either rent a car for those 4 months, lease a car, buy a car, or rent a place downtown closer to where I'll be working. 
* Renting car from Avis for those 4 months: $3,756 (includes insurance) + $25x120 days (young drivers fee as I'm under 25) = $6,756. Enterprise is slightly cheaper at around $6,500. 
* Leasing a car: Not really compelling given I'm a student and I don't see the need in spending $20,000+ on a new car. 
* Buying a car: I would look for older, used cars (likely at least 4-5 years old). Upon a quick search on autotrader/craigslist, it seems like I can find basic model sedans for up to $10,000. 
* Renting a place downtown for 4 months: I've looked at a few studios and on average I should expect to pay ~$9,000 in rent. 

**My Current Decision**

Upon weighing my options, renting a place downtown is the most expensive, but the trade-off is that I would be able to walk to/from work in ~30 minutes one-way. However, the ~$9,000 over 4 months only accounts for rent. Including food costs, this could easily go up to $11,000. Another option is to find another summer intern in a similar type of demanding work, where our work hours would be similar, and thus splitting rent that way to be about $4,800 over the 4 months. 

Buying a car would mean longer commute of approximately 30-45 minutes in the morning (no traffic at 4:30 am), but 1+ hr with rush hour at 6 pm. Another concern I have is that given the early start and demanding nature of the internship, I'm not 100% sure if I'm comfortable driving at 4:30 am given I will likely be tired/fatigued. However, at this point, buying a car seems to be the best option (I have enough in my bank account given I have been working for the past few years to buy with cash) and I would not have to worry about food costs as I would be living with my parents. Also, I would be able to use the car even after the summer internship ends. 

**Questions**

* Should I buy a used or certified pre-owned car?
* If it is better to buy used, should I buy from a private seller or a dealer?
* If it is better to buy from a dealer, what are some red flags I should know when talking to salesman?
* What are some reliable brands/models I should look into? I am considering Honda Civics as I've read they are quite reliable and good quality. 
* The person I talked to at Avis said a general rule of thumb is 20,000 km/year is acceptable for mileage. Is that correct? 
* Are Autotrader/Craigslist/Kijiji the best sources to find cars for sale? Any other places to check out?
* How much mileage is too much for a car?
* What are other considerations I may have missed thinking of (financially, personally, professionally)?
* What are other general rules of thumb when evaluating whether a car is good quality for me to purchase?
* What are some red flags when finding a good car mechanic?

Thanks for taking time to read this long post. I don't really have anyone to ask irl unfortunately. 

**TL;DR** Landed a summer internship and need to decide between buying a used/certified pre-owned car and renting a place downtown. Buying a car seems to be the best option given what I have considered. What are red flags/rules of thumb I should know about before making a car purchase?

Should I focus on getting an internship or boosting my GPA this summer. As I checked already and can retake about 5 classes this summer and confidently boost my overall GPA to about a 3.1-3.3 if everything goes right. Will boosting my GPA to this be better off with my time or hopefully trying to get an internship. I know its a stretch but I wanna take my shot at grad school and think I can do well on the GRE in the summer when I plan on taking it. Any help would be great. 
Also the classes that I would be retaking are classes like Calc 2,3 Diff Eq, Fluid mechanics 
just so you get the idea that they are important, so thats why I am leaning more towards boosting my GPA than anything right now. "
7optky,74,2018-01-07,My advice to others about how to get the most out of an internship when you’re extremely depressed,msb132,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7optky/my_advice_to_others_about_how_to_get_the_most_out/,"I’m a computer science student who interned at a small but busy company last summer, while I was extremely depressed. It was my first time interning and my first time being depressed, and it could’ve been so much better had I known certain things in advance.

And even if you aren’t depressed when you start your internship, the DSM 5 defines depression as feeling low for at least 2 weeks. So by the time the orientation and adjustment period are done, we could all very well be clinically depressed. You can proactively start to think about some of the things on this list and how to decrease your stress levels so you don’t become depressed, which surprisingly happens to a lot of people.


1. Don’t talk about personal issues over slack or email, even with other interns who you consider friends. The company maintains a record of all conversations, so it’s better to keep all correspondence professional. Use text or Facebook messenger for personal stuff.

2. Avoid drugs/alcohol. Alcohol is a chemical depressant, and I would get really sad when I drank. Stay sober at intern parties or company events. This includes any recruiting events at other companies. I said I wasn’t drinking because I was on a low calorie diet. You can also take a bottle of Gatorade with you to parties and people will assume there’s alcohol mixed in. I said I had asthma so people wouldn’t ask me to smoke with them. I also cut out coffee and energy drinks, but that’s not necessary.

3. If you’re living away from home, try to room with other interns from your company. It’s very easy to isolate yourself when you’re depressed, and with a roommate who you see often you’ll have more social interaction and opportunities to do fun things on the weekend.

4. Keep readymade food at home and eat meals at work if you can. You won’t have the motivation to cook some days. Pedialyte (a meal replacement) helped me because it was easy to drink and had electrolytes. I also had a lot of microwave oatmeal, protein shakes, carrots with ranch, popcorn, and easy mac cups.

5. Drink lots of water. This may seem weird, but it’ll help you focus and feel better. Some days I would cry a lot and was super dehydrated. It’s recommended that you drink .75 to 1 oz of water per day per pound you weigh, and I’m a 130ish pound girl, so I would keep my 40oz water bottle with me at all times and try to drink 3 bottles worth per day (more if you have your period).

6. Take breaks to recharge your batteries. A pee break can be used as a quick crying break if you need one. At 3ish PM each day I would go into one of the private bathrooms, call my mom and cry, watch a cute puppy video to calm down, then put in eye drops and wash my face. I would also go take walks, stop by other interns’ desks to see what they were doing, or go to the break room for snacks.

7. Stop working once you leave the office. Depression makes you feel worthless and that can sometimes make you work really hard to “prove yourself,” which burns you out. If you sit around doing nothing, you start to fixate on your issues, so find something productive to do. Hit the gym, go sightseeing, play overwatch, learn to play the harmonica, do a coloring page, go salsa dancing, paint your nails... really just anything you can do to relax. You might also make some new friends.

8. Go to bed early. In engineering it’s easy to stay up late and sleep in the next day. I would use that as an excuse to stay up until 2am crying and wallowing in self pity and listening to Green Day on repeat. Calm yourself down for a while before bed, turn off your phone, and sleep as peacefully as possible.

9. Don’t push yourself on really bad days. One night I had a dream which fed off of almost all my insecurities, and ended with me hallucinating someone coming into my apartment and murdering me. The next morning I was a complete wreck and couldn’t pull myself together enough to go to work. I called in sick and nobody questioned it.

10. Take advantage of company wellness resources. If gym membership, massages, nutrition consultation, therapy dogs, etc are available, absolutely use them while you can.


Hopefully following these guidelines will make your experience enjoyable and allow you to get the most out of it. Getting an internship is a big deal and you should be proud of yourself, no matter how small your mental illness makes you feel at times. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk or have more questions about my trainwreck of a summer."

Here is the link to the position in question: [IT ASSOCIATE!](https://jobsearch.keysight.com/job/Colorado-Springs-IT-Associate-CO-80840/440733300/) .

A little background about me: I am a Senior finishing my Computer Engineering degree. I have a decent GPA and have completed 2 internships thus far. Both involved programming. I will be starting my 3rd internship soon. It will end when I graduate. My career goal is to become a Software Engineer- maybe developing Web Apps or Mobile Apps.

My main concerns about the IT Associate position with Keysight are:
*I will be rotating through different departments during the 2 year entry program which probably means I will not gain deep expertise in any of the departments
* After the 2 year entry program the company might feel comfortable with me and offer me low pay for my chosen position.
* IT Associate job title is not really eye catching, might make it difficult to obtain a job as a Software Engineer.

I am expecting my starting salary to be 65-80k which is similar to what my friends have gotten in the Colorado Springs area. I worry that the IT Associate title might lead them to want to low-ball the position since it is somewhat of a ""training program"" and some companies really base their pay-rate on job titles.

The different departments I will be rotating through the first 2 years are:
* analytics
* cloud solutions
* mobile apps
* computer &amp; network engineering
* cyber security and web development

7oroz8,2,2018-01-07,20 M CS Student. Don't know what to focus on,hashtagbeast,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7oroz8/20_m_cs_student_dont_know_what_to_focus_on/,"Hello, I'm a 20 year old romanian studying computer science. While in highschool, everyone around me told me about this unviersity of computer science that is supposed to be the best in the country and top whatever in the world, everyone gets out with a job and a huge salary and so on. On top of that, I liked computers, I was writing little scripts and programs since I was like 10 years old, so I thought I should go to this university, it sounds like the best idea.

Oh boy, was I wrong. I'm second year ( out of 4) and I hate it. I feel like I learned nothing altough Im busy all the time, there is barely any free time, with alot of 10-12 hours homeworks, and I feel like they are all for nothing. In 2 years, the best ""program"" I wrote was a process scheduler. I can't do anything that is practical or useful.

On the other hand, I'm passionate about games(who isn't) and feel like I'm pretty smart and creative( sometimes I feel like the dubmest person on earth ) and so I thought maybe I should start focusing less on studying and start working on a project on my own, took some courses on udemy and feel, yet again, stuck. Starting to work on a game right now would probably take 3 years to finish, and I'm afraid I can't stay motivated to finish it for that long. Also I tried but nobody I know seems to want to work on it with me. Maybe instead of working on a game I should learn how to make an engine first, start with java and OpenGL and build up from there, but then I'm afraid I will get behind everybody else and get just a bad job after the university. And then there are tons of other subjects that interest me but I just can't do all of them, like AI , machine learning and neural networks, security, so on.

Also, I tried applying for interships early november to the top companies abroad but most of them rejected me, probably because my lack of experience. I will try to apply to internships in my country aswell when applications open up, but I'm afraid they will reject me aswell."

I just wanted to get some opinions on my goals and plans for 2018 / 2019 because I am worried for my future.

My first 2 years of College I was a fool, and didn't spend my spare time wisely. I got myself in gear starting in Junior year (Fall 2017) and managed to land an internship. I was hoping that having completed an internship, I would have a much easier time getting interviewed for others, but that is not the case.

I am in Florida and go to UCF. I notice many of the job hunting sites and school emails are just the same few companies (Lockheed, Northrop, Universal). Should I be applying to internships out of state for my Summer term? Perhaps I will have better luck.

I am working on building up my resume, and until I find some more work, I am pursuing some side projects.

Here are some of the things I have on my list:

-Create a portfolio / website 

-Create an App

-Do some open source work

-Improve upon old homework assignments and turn them into legitimate projects

-Get some certifications (They are so expensive!)

Other things I plan to work on during my spare time in order to gain knowledge:

-Read some coding books

-Do some online courses to learn languages not taught in school (Codeacademy?)

-Go to the university's Career Fairs and force my introvert self to start networking

I have 4 semesters left in College, so I will knock some stuff off my list every semester. Hopefully I will manage to land another internship before I graduate.

Anyways, please let me know your thoughts. Are some things I have planned pointless? Are there important things I should be doing instead?

One final question... there are so many branches in computers.. is it better to specialize, or be a jack of all trades? Currently I am going jack of all trades route, as I felt that would allow for more options.

I have some maybes at some small companies that would look decent on a resume, but I'd rather do this summer program to make my course load more manageable for sophomore and junior year.

What scenario would be best for a full-time job offer after I graduate?

1. First summer did full business minor/ professional development then next summer had a decently well-known actual internship on my resume.

2. First summer did an internship at a small company that will probably give me busy work but may look good getting a better internship the second summer. And on the second summer I get an internship with a well-known company doing actual work.

I'm afraid even a good internship my freshman summer wont mean much because I'd be useless to a company.

Or should I be finding companies I like and be applying to them directly? How important is LinkedIn? I have a page but don’t use it and should probably put more detail on it. 

I’m also worried I don’t have enough actual programming experience. I didn’t do as much coding at my internships as I would have hoped and I don’t have any impressive projects to show off to employers. Also what percentage of companies to technical interviews? Should I be studying more for those?

Sorry if this is a bit disorganized, that’s how my thoughts have been. Any advice at all is appreciated. "
7ovz72,4,2018-01-07,MS/PhD Student Considering Taking a Break?,strugglingcsgradstud,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ovz72/msphd_student_considering_taking_a_break/,"Hello,

I posted here a few months ago during my first semester that I was having doubts about being in a top ten PhD program in Machine Learning straight from undergrad.

After my first semester I think I've pretty much decided its not for me, I don't have much of a desire to become a professor and even though sometimes the projects are interesting on a high level, the day-to-day theoretical grind is not for me. I also do not think I want to do Data Science anymore, I like building things more than doing analysis and data processing. 

However, I still have the opportunity to get my Master's in Software Engineering for essentially free. In my research I've found that an MS doesn't really seem to help if one already has a BS in CS (especially with good internships) so I'm questioning whether that is worthwhile. Would not look forward to retaking what are just more difficult versions of undergraduate courses (Graduate algorithms is some shit lads).

So my question is: does it make sense to take a semester break to attempt to find a job, see what options there are, maybe try it working full time, and make a decision on whether to pursue the MS? Quite frankly, it is very mentally and physically taxing for me to be constantly second guessing myself while pursuing graduate studies if I simply want to do Software Engineering.

Any input on this decision on getting an MS vs not when considering future job transitions (re: MBA) would be helpful.

**Background:** 2nd semester PhD student in ML. Graduated from mid-tier uni with Google + strong startup internships, 3.92 GPA, awards for success (dean's list, departmental), 2 research publications, club leadership experience

**Pros of MS as far as I know**

* $5-10k pay bump initially

* Would help for future graduate school applications (MBA, PhD)

**Cons of MS**

* Taking harder versions of undergraduate courses isn't particularly useful and are difficult

* 1.5 year salary opportunity cost

* Pretty much going to be suffering for another 1.5 years

7owozg,5,2018-01-08,Wrong career move.,Timber10,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7owozg/wrong_career_move/,"Hi everyone,

Last september, I graduated with a degree in CS engineering with a decent GPA. My desire was to work with someone like Google or Amazon and so, I never took any interviews elsewhere and spent that time preparing for my dream interviews. But, as a slacker, my preparation wasn't anywhere near good enough and by November, I was referred by one of my relatives for a position in a company she used to work for. She and everyone else had high praises for the company and the work culture. So I decided to give a shot and had my first ever interview there. They first contacted me regarding a 6 month internship on their development team and I agreed for the face to face. Next day, they called me back and asked if I would be interested in a permanent role as a ""Systems Engineer Trainee"". They gave me a rough idea about the role and it being a permanent role, I said yes. I didn't know anything about servers or system engineering, but they saw something in me and I passed the interview and got the job. The first few days were exciting but it gradually became more and more miserable. I am basically spending entire time on ""Application Support"" grinding through computer logs in hope of finding the issue. The biggest joke is that my team do not have access to the code because the dev team does not allow us to. We are basically searching in darkness to find out the issues. This is not giving me any sort of satisfaction at all. I am an extremely passionate developer and I used to consistently pull off 14-16 hour days for grinding and making the code work. But here, I am seeing no end result. I do not feel like building anything. I do not see any growth here. I had a heart-to-heart talk with some guys in our team who have been there for 4 years, and they regret not jumping ship on the first chance. Their experience is in supporting the application built by the company. This has no value for another company. We do have infrastructure maintenance, but most of it is automated meaning I don't get to learn anything. I have only been there for 40 odd days. I dread every morning. I drag myself towards the weekends. My dilemma is,they hired me because they were having very tight schedules. Now me leaving this fast will be a blow to the company right ? But, I cant handle the stress either. Even back from work, I am thinking about work and the issues that may arise tomorrow. What should I do ??"

getting asked this question has prompted me to research careers in political science/law. and, for the first time in my life, i feel like i really know what i want to be when i grow up. 

i love to read and write. i would have no problem with that part of being a paralegal. i love doing research. plus, paralegals are currently in demand and predicted to see an overall salary increase within the next couple of years. money doesn’t mean that much to me, but i do not want to live paycheck to paycheck. money problems have plagued my parents and i don’t wanna raise my future family in that environment. 

i guess i won’t know if this is the career for me until i get more deeply involved in getting certified and then begin an internship. does anyone really ever know what their perfect career is? ideally, i would not want to work in an office environment. but that’s what paralegals do. i feel like i would be willing to sacrifice this though. 

are there any paralegals here on reddit? any advice is appreciated. i want to talk to people who are currently paralegals to learn more about the career in general.

The benefit for the company - free worker, in return  at the end of those few months or a year or whatever time it takes  I need to have a full time IT engineering position.
The problemI have with this plan is that I can not directly apply for position through recruiters because  I can not show required experience - how do  I source and approach potential IT employers?

7oxzw5,1,2018-01-08,"[Sydney, Australia] Booked for an Airbnb and paid some cash to landlord but due to the place being dirty we left in 4 days",InternLifeIsGreat,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7oxzw5/sydney_australia_booked_for_an_airbnb_and_paid/,"Hi this is my first time posting, sorry for any issues with the post. This is a long post, tl;dr at the bottom.

I am 19, from Singapore and had a last minute internship in Sydney for 3 months. From the time I was told about my internship to the time I had to fly off was about 2 weeks. So, me and a friend needed a place to stay as we were not given an accomodation. This happened last year in November and I hope I can do something about it now.

Early November last year, I found an apartment on Airbnb which was quite cheap by James (Not his real name). James was chinese and his English was not very good, we had some language barriers but luckily i know abit of Mandarin.

We discussed the prices and the rooms, we were told that he had a bedroom with two beds but one of the bed already had an occupant so he suggested one of us to stay with the occupant and the other person would get a single bed-room. Another issue was, I would reach Sydney on 13 November but James kept sending requests for 15 November, I told him to cancel and I would send a request but he said it did not matter and I could stay earlier. I agreed and paid 1 month rental (about 1.8k SGD) as required on Airbnb.

On 13 November, I reached Sydney and got an Australian sim card and saw that James messaged me a few times. I opened it up and it said that he wanted me to pay and additional 1880 and 250 AUD. I was shocked but I ignored it first and made my way to the apartment. I was greeted by another tenant and when I walked in, I realised the place was filthy. I mean on the kitchen the floor had a bit of carrots, cabbages and onion. Hair on the floor everywhere. Dust on every surface. Smelt very musty. My bedroom did not have bed sheets, nothing like advertised on his Airbnb.

In the afternoon, James contacted me and told me what the additional costs were. He said 1880 (For 3 months) was extra for the single room that we had as it was more expensive than the bedroom with two beds. And 250 was for a deposit for the keys and if I broke anything.

Now I was unsure about what to do, I did not want to stay there anymore but it was a cheap location, so I discussed the issue with the help of my mother. After further negotiation, we agreed on 1600 and 250 AUD deposit in CASH. It was a stupid mistake to pay in cash. As James was not in Sydney at the time, I paid the money to the tenant that opened the door for me.

My friend who took a later flight arrived on 15 November and also had to pay 250 AUD deposit for his own key as well. He told me he did not like the place and it was too dusty as he had a very sensitive nose for dust. Next thing I know, I had a cold. My nose was running 24/7 I couldn’t breathe, I was very sure it was the dust in the apartment. So we decided, that this house was a health hazard for the both of us and we had to find a new location. We searched on Airbnb and found a new location that was more expensive but had a good rating.

I had to tell James I was not staying anymore. Obviously, James was pissed that we would be leaving, saying we are trying to leave as we found a cheaper option. Which was untrue. I explained to him, I was leaving and wanted some of our money (1500AUD and deposit) back and the rest would be his for the 4 days we stayed in the apartment. But James wouldn’t talk to me, he kept saying he was in a meeting and that he was busy, tired, eating.

The morning that we left, we approached the tenant that i passed the money to, we asked him to return us the money but he said he can’t and it was in his bank. I understand his position as he would definitely be in trouble with James for paying us. He advised us to keep the keys as we were not given back our deposit. As we had to leave for our internship, we left with the keys till this day.

If anyone would direct us on what we should do, please do comment.

Tl;Dr: Landlord asked to pay extra the day I landed in Sydney, I paid the money as I had no where else to go. Me and friend decided to leave as the place was very dirty and not as advertised in Airbnb. We stayed 4 days, 13 November to 16 November 2017. I am out 1850 AUD and my friend 250AUD. Landlord does not want to communicate and stopped talking to me.

EDIT: I forgot to mention I was refunded back my Airbnb 1st month rent. Im inquiring about the money that i paid in cash."

Then I try to prove to other people that I have friends. The pressure and overthinking is making me really depressed because I can't just enjoy myself. I go out when I don't want to because I feel like I have to. It's making me go crazy and I'm here as a last resort. 

Any help appreciated &lt;3 and thanks for reading this mountain of text lol

---------------

Back in high school, I didn't want to have friends because all I wanted was to get good grades and I only needed my family (although I still had quite a few because in school everyone has friends), so I never tried to keep in touch with old friends. By the first year of college, i noticed that I hardly went out with people since I never tried to maintain friendships.

From them on, I became obsessed with making new friends and keeping in touch with old ones and proving to people I had friends. Like literally obsessed. 

Everyone else joins clubs for their resumes and for the academic side of it. I join clubs to get new friends. I apply for competitions and internships not because it's good for my work, but to make friends. I got a job to make friends with coworkers, not even for the money 

And I don't even think that I actually want these friends. I'm an introvert and going out frequently tires me. I usually go out 3 times a week in addition to work. I've gone out with people just for the sake of making friends even when I don't actually want to. i don't even enjoy it half the time (with close friends I do, but I feel like I NEED to have many different friends).

Then, I have to prove to others that I have friends. I snap pics of me and my friends to prove that I have friends. I love when ppl tag me on Facebook because it shows that I go out with friends. I get jealous and depressed when people go out more than me, even though I don't actually like going out too often. 

It's ridiculous and it's putting so much pressure and anxiety on to me.

When I didn't care about having friends, I was so much happier than I am now. I laugh about myself being stupid, poor and other shit because it's not true and I don't feel insecure about it, but I don't like joking about having no friends because I feel like I have to compensate

I'm a finance major at a well-respected university and have held two internships over the past two summers, in addition to a rigorous analyst program I completed my junior year. My resume is strong, but I've been struggling to find a job in my hometown after I graduate - (keep in mind, all of the positions I've been applying to are in my hometown, and I'd rather not relocate if I can help it).

So far, the only offer I've received is from this company AXA Advisors, and I've heard nothing but terrible things about them on Glassdoor and other job review sites. I'm really worried that this will be my only option after I graduate, and I would honestly rather be unemployed than work for them, especially since there is a lot of pre-employment work I have to do to be hired, such as licensing.

I've been looking non-stop for jobs in my area on Indeed and LinkedIn, but have had little luck. Last semester, I received several phone interviews, but most of them were from idiots from the various firms' HR departments who had a hard time understanding that I wouldn't be able to start until AFTER I graduate college. Also, it seems like the ""entry level"" position in finance doesn't even exist anymore; practically every single job opening I've found online demands 3+ years of experience, which I obviously don't have as a current college student. I'm really worried I won't find a good job now, and I'm already having to lower my standards in my job search.

Anyways, time is running out, and I would welcome any suggestions anyone has on A) Finding a specific website/place to look for jobs, and B) Any advice on my job search in general. Also, if you suggest I relocate, could you please give me a good idea of what specific kinds of areas I should look for beyond just ""a place that's hiring recent finance grads"". Thank you"

I have also applied and been accepted as a transfer to other institutions. I have both worked for a time during university, and have also had scholarships support me fully for other years. 

I have changed my path of study slightly two times, one at the end of my first year and the other midway through my third (and final) year. 

I also dormed for the first 1.5 years before moving into a shared apartment, and did undergraduate research that resulted in publications. 

I'm now studying theoretical/computational astrophysics in the area of AGN, which are active supermassive black holes found at the centres of approx. 16% (very much up for debate) of galaxies and which display large polar jets of relativistic e/e+ plasma.

This all happened between late December 2016 and March 2017. My mental health took a huge hit. I failed a class at the end of December and had to withdraw from two the following semester. I have four classes in the CS track to left graduate but I had to take a leave of absence from my university because I was no longer eligible for financial aid after the 8th semester. 

I am low income and I am trying to take classes at local state schools, but even with the resident rate at a state school its still incredibly expensive as a nondegree student.  

I'm in a real bind. I can't afford not to have a degree (I already had to start paying off my loans) and I can't afford to finish my degree(its about $415 per credit and an extra $800+ in students fees per semester). 

From my experience, big tech companies aren't interested in non-conventional students (they want you to have you graduated in four years or less, only hire you if you have a degree, won't give you an internship if you're not a full time student at your uni, etc). But does anyone know of smaller (or big!) companies that (if hired) would help me pay for the rest of my degree? I'm based out of NYC but would be willing to relocate, as I don't have much of a choice right now. 

Thank you!"

7p11ga,4,2018-01-08,College related issues,Digons,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7p11ga/college_related_issues/,"TL;DR at the end

Hi, all. Brief summary: I'm 21 years old male and I study in a public college. To enter a public college, you have to work really hard. The competition is INSANE and those that want the hardest of courses have to study in an asian level. Anyway, I got into one and was quite happy.

I always heard public colleges were a little bad in the structure side of things, but mine is just terrible. In my course, we frequently don't have classes, teachers don't go to work because of ''personal problems'' all the time and this goes on. I didn't care (much) at first, until I got an internship ready for me because of my grades. Then a girl at my class just decided to have sex with the teacher so that she could have the internship and she got it.

This was the turning point in my faith in public colleges. It was said since high schools that public colleges were like this, that it ''prepares'' you ''better'' for the work market and I just decided to swallow it. But when things like that happens, the perspective changes.

First of all, I NEVER liked my course (Railroad engineering). i never liked the subjects. Never. But ''for money'', I could endure thos terrible classes (when I had then). 

The thing is, the classes were so few and far between that I decided to start Production Engineering in a private college. And maybe I should regret this decision, since I don't feel like going to my public college at all. Besides having classes EVERY DAY (this may sound mundane to you, but to me?), I already got an internship to me and I'm doing tons and tons of outside courses to improve my curriculum, all of those provided by the so called ''bad'' private college.

With that said, the easy course of action was to drop out of the public college for good, but I can't do that. I still don't pay my bills, so I'm not the owner of my life. Mother (who I love very much) don't want me to leave. But I talked to her and we decided to just press the ''pause buttom''.

But here comes the real problem that motivated me to ask this sub for advice. She told me that I should complete this semester first. And I can't. I intentionally missed some classes that I just couldn't care about (my will to study is the complete opposite in the private college). For those, I'm done. But there 2 or 3 that I can complete, but I also don't feel like doing this. I thought I was just lazy (or maybe I am?), but why do I feel like studying for the other college and not this one? 

You know the feeling of ''I just want to GET OUT of here''? That's what I'm feeling right now. But I also don't feel like just dropping it like this. But at the same time I just want to get away from all that crap. Do you see what I mean here?

Many things block my way of going there to finish those subjects, like someone mugging me with a gun INSIDE the building (funny story, we have supreme gun control in this country), getting there and the teachers just decide to not work because of ''personal problems'' (in fact, I was supposed to be there right now, but the teacher had to ''do'' something and was ''busy'' today)...

I'm sorry, do you see what I mean?

TL;DR: Have the option to leave a shitty college to focus on the good one. But at the same time, I don't wan't to simply leave. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I feel like just throwing everything through the window because I just can't stand that place.

If you have any questions or want me to clarify something (this has 99% chance of happening lol), just ask!"

In the first year of my school we had a little bit of scripting with python and we still curently have and it got me into learning more advanced stuff because we study the very basic codes. Also it led me into the wanting to learn more and other languages, i still work hard on my python and i am starting to learn other languages to do other tasks. I am into many domains, machine learning, web, apps. I always learn more even tho i know i should focus hard on one thing but here is the problem.

I am very uncertain about my current degree if i want to land a job into the IT domain.. Maybe software engineering or something related, something that lead me to code, think about its structure and solve problems. I like maths, physics and the very few computer courses i get at my school. But will a generalist engineer degree be a benefit or a waste of time if in the end I want to land a job in IT/software engineer/... ? I still have 3 and a half year to get my degree and in that period i can still do a lot of stuff, get a lot of projects done in that period (especially because the last year is an internship).

Sorry for Beeing a little messy about my ideas and maybe doing a lot of mistakes in my writing. 

What should i do ? Thanks a lot in advance for your answers."

I know it's late to find a job or internship for the summer but what can I do or where can I go to learn about the different careers in computer science during my time so that I can try things and not waste my time. 

I understand that I can't ever learn everything in a particular line of work and that real world experience is likely my best bet but I just feel so overwhelmed with all of the different lines of work and number of courses online and I just want to know where to start. "

However, no matter what pep talk I give myself, I feel like I'm reaching. I'd like to explain my position. 

When I was a kid, I had dropped out of middle school due to severe issues with bullying. Taking care of my sick grandmother gave me further motivation; her husband passed away a few years ago and who had took care of her grew tired of her many health issues.  When they sent her to us, I spent most of my time taking care of her because my mother worked days at a time before coming home and my dad also worked late nights. That left the responsibility to me, and I was already motivated to drop out due to the bullying and my asocial tendencies.

My parents have always been just above the poverty line, and spent most of their time working; they never had freedom to take me many places. It didn’t help my situation when large portions of my extended family disowned me when my desire to start transitioning to appear male didn't fade away. This cut off a lot of my opportunities to go places like libraries, clubs, and parks living in such an isolated area, so I spent most of the day inside playing, talking, and surfing around online. I watched a show of a group of kids who were having a competition and their knowledge inspired me to go back to school. I became passionate about this goal very quickly. 

When my grandmother passed away and I got my medication (I have had a number of illnesses since I was 6) my parents managed to get the money to supply to me, I studied five years worth of education material in three months and crossed my fingers when I took the tests to test into 10th grade. I managed to pass everything and started school with an online school that ships you free materials. Even with my parents being gone constantly, this allowed me to do school work at home and begin to get caught up. 

I did excellent in 10th grade, but my mom was diagnosed shortly after with an illness that’s expected to kill her in 4 years. The medication needed to treat her was expensive and without enough aid, I fell into the same situation that I used to be in with my grandmother. My dad picked up extra hours, and my school suffered as I took time to care for my mom and attend her appointments. I would frequently miss unit tests and homework that were worth a significant amount of points, and my grades dropped. Although I had made up the few bad grades I received in 10th grade, I failed more classes in the 11th. However, I’m in the process of correcting those mistakes now in the 12th grade and my first semester was extremely successful. 

Through 10th grade to 12th grade, I've taken a total of 17 college classes, 3 AP classes, and 18 honor classes (one semester is composed of 2 classes); my current GPA is 3.9. I expressed to my parents not long before I got back into school that I wanted to take a chance and try to get into a prestigious university; they were both really excited and put almost all their savings to paying for my college classes because I didn't meet the requirements for any type of financial aid. 

I've gotten great grades on all of them, although I've had to make up a few mistakes. I think I'll get some cool recommendations from my neuroscience and nanoscience teachers. I may also have the chance to join the honors national society before I graduate. Soon, I’ll be completing a fair amount of community service hours that are required for high school and and I'll be doing community service after high school as well before I apply. 

I got accepted into a STEM robotics program at a university here in Colorado that I attended in 11th grade and I'm taking a couple interesting out-of-high school classes such as honors neuroscience and nanoscience. I'm learning two languages (Japanese and Korean) and two instruments (sax and piano); I'll have 3-4 years of experience with both the instruments and languages by the time I apply. I've been in the debate, videoing, and science club for three years. Though, even if I got solid scores on my SAT subjects and ACT, I don't really think any of it will be impressive enough for where I want to apply (Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Princeton).

There are kids from 3rd world countries that have their own business, speak 16 languages, and have more rewards and won more competitions than I can count of my fingers. Sure, I managed to pick myself up fairly well and have a sad backstory, but when I look at what they've accomplished, I'm not sure if I compete. 

I plan to do some internships and research programs once I'm out of high school before I apply to college. I intend to apply when I'm 20-21 because I don't have what I need to apply to the universities I'm interested in, but I was wondering if that's all I can do to increase my chances?

I can't join the Science Bowl, I wasn't invited to the White House, and I've never signed up for a fair or a spelling bee. I'm not a AIME Qualifier, USABO Semifinalist, or a National Merit finalist; I don't have any awards. A lot of the big things that a lot of these prestigious university students have done are no longer options for me; I'm looking for alternatives.

So far, I've come up with the idea to try to do some interesting community service work and join internships or research programs that would make me ""stand out,"" but that's all I have. Any ideas or should I drop this dream altogether?

7p2w8q,143,2018-01-08,Inappropriate behavior from Gynecologist,sweetlemon12,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7p2w8q/inappropriate_behavior_from_gynecologist/,"This is sort of a sensitive subject, so I’ll give as much detail as needed without getting too personal.

I just recently moved to Southern California from Texas, and while in Texas, I got the Nexplanon implant. It caused issues that my previous Gyno was trying to fix with hormones and birth control packets. That didn’t work, and I moved before she could remove it. 

Coming to Southern California, there were few places I could find that were able to remove the Nexplanon implant, so I was happy to find this current Gyno. Upon my first visit, the following things occurred:

•Nurse insisted my Insurance was different than what it was, getting attitude with me, and refusing to let me be seen, trying to cancel the appointment because I didn’t have a referral. (I waited a month to be seen, with uncomfortable symptoms. I understand mix ups happen, so I called and confirmed with them that everything was good and I could be seen.) Nurse didn’t apologize, and briskly handed me paperwork to sign.

• Nurse refused me access to the bathroom.

•Doctor didn’t introduce herself, and stated that a student (intern?) would be watching and learning. I didn’t really mind, but was bothered that she didn’t ask if it was okay, just stated it was going to happen.

•Doctor made several inappropriate jokes about my sex life, and “normal people’s” general behavior, insinuating that I cheat on my husband and that I don’t use proper protection.

•Doctor insisted on doing an PAP and STD kit, even though I said I preferred not to have one done.

•Doctor let student perform the PAP, and after several failed and painful attempts from the student to get the speculum into place, the doctor jerked it into position painfully.

•Nurse walked in while I was being examined, left the door wide open with another patient in plain sight in the hall, said she would be “just a minute” while talking to the doctor and grabbing supplies.

•Doctor didn’t talk to me about the symptoms I was having on Nexplanon, or what I planned to use afterwards. I had to bring it up with her multiple times, as she was rambling and joking. (I should note she did ask why I wanted off it, but interrupted me with jokes about going “bare back”, and never heard why I wanted the implant out early.)


At this point, I know that’s not how they are suppose to behave, but I’m not sure what legal steps I can take against them, if any. I don’t feel comfortable going back, but I also don’t want to wait another month for an appointment with a new office having the symptoms I’m having. I’m a very non-confrontational person, so I didn’t freak out on them in the office, but I did make a few comments that made it clear I was uncomfortable. The student seemed to understand and see that, but no one else acknowledged me.

What actions should I take next?"

I haven't told anyone about this. I don't know who to tell. I didn't even tell anyone when I got put on probation. My parents will literally disown me if they knew. I have plane tickets to come back here for spring semester.

They had such high expectations for me. Until last semester, I planned to get a PhD. Now I don't know what to do with my life. Do I still want a college degree? Of course. I'm a disorganized person which led to my shit grades, I'm not dumb. I've won several coding competitions and hackathons. I won national competitions when I was in highschool. I know I can do this. 

**What led to my drop:** distractions. I'm a very disorganized person. Too many distractions in college. I can do all the assignments, my  grades on tests have been great, but I don't keep track of deadlines.

In HS, I had my parents nagging me to do everything, I didn't have to try and keep track of things. They managed my whole life. In college I was free of that. I thought I could just ignore all the deadlines.

What do I do with my life now? I don't have a college degree, and don't know what I can do. I want a CS degree still. Is it even possible to get readmitted into CS? I don't know who to talk to. I talked to my advisor and she said it was possible, but is it realistic? Should I make it my goal for the next year to get readmitted into CS? CS is my one and only passion. 

**My plans:** Planning on seeing if I can enroll in Parkland and re-apply next spring. But, I don't even know what classes I can take at parkland. I came in with a ton of AP credit, so I only have like 1 or 2 gen eds to take. I could only come up with a schedule for 1 semester at parkland. But, what to do for the next semester? What do I do if I don't get readmitted.?

 I don't have too much money, my parents were paying my tuition for UIUC. But they don't know about the drop. Even if I tell them, there's absolutely no way they will support me. I have to do this on my own. I have around 8k left in my bank account from my internship I did last summer. I also have an internship at Google lined up for this summer. But, if they find out that I've been dropped, they might rescind that offer.

 Please help. I need a plan for my future. "

Need desperate help.,F-ck_up,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7p39lg/dropped_from_university_need_desperate_help/,"So, I've fucked up bad. Ive officially been dropped from UIUC as a CS student. I'm a sophomore and an out of state student. You can read more about my situation in the post I made on /r/UIUC

I haven't told anyone about my situation, not even my parents. They would disown me if they found out. I lied to them about my grades for the past year. 

I know I'm not dumb. My drop wasn't because of me not understanding material, I know that. Ive won several hackathons, and participated in and won programming competitions. I know CS is the right field for me. Just, maybe, not university. 

I don't know what to do now. Is it even possible to get a career in CS without a degree? It's the only thing I am passionate about, and I am *good* at it. I passed Google intern interviews, and have an internship for 8k/month lined up with them for this summer. But, that might change if I notify them that I was dropped. I need desperate help and a plan for my future. I've let everyone I know down. 

I currently plan to re-apply for admission in a year. But, what do I do in the meantime? I plan on enrolling in a community college this week and taking some classes which would contribute towards graduation requirements. But, the semester after that, I have nothing that I could take at CC anymore. Please help me, feeling depressed and suicidal.

Sorry for the emotional post. If you know of more appropriate places I can get help, please let me know."

I'm a recent graduate and I got my first programming job last December. My company uses a combination of c# and VB6 in their same project, I've used both VB.Net and VB6 before in my internship but never C# yet they still gave me the chance to work for them and basically learn the program through my personal time and some plural sight courses.

It's been a month now and I feel useless. My job is basically adding functionality, modifying some code and bug fixing. But the project/app is so huge and there's barely (if any) documentation that trying to find something can take hours, and then when I find it I have to try to understand the code (which I usually barely understand it and end up resorting to mess with the code to see what and how my changes affect the app). 

After many hours or maybe even a days of trying to do a task by myself,  I just ask my team leader to help me with my task since sometimes even with his suggestions I get stuck and I end up just being hand holded during my whole assignment.

I probably haven't finished a task by myself yet, and being hand holded through the whole process suck, it doesn't give me any personal satisfaction and I personally hate when other co-workers say that I 'finished a task' since I know I was just doing what my team leader told me to do.

The job makes me feel depressed since I know I'm underperforming, and compared to the other rookie who started at same time as me and already had some C# experience plus she picks up things super fast while I take too long to learn things, it makes no sense to keep me over her. I'm already looking for another job since I know I might get fired for underperforming sooner than later.

I'm starting to question my career choice and I don't know if programming is for me, right now the only other that I like is working with data bases but I haven't been able to find any job in that area.

7p47rk,1,2018-01-08,What to expect from undergraduate research in my last semester?,cscqthrowaway314,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7p47rk/what_to_expect_from_undergraduate_research_in_my/,"Hopefully this is the right place to ask, as I looked for a CS education questions subreddit(CSEducation didn't seem to be the place) but didn't have any luck, and I also saw some internship questions here. 

Little bit of background: I'm a math major that is minoring in CS, currently finished with my math courses and only need one more CS class aside from random mumbo jumbo this upcoming semester. I took a course in Operating Systems this previous Fall, and the professor advised me to apply for one of his paid research positions funded by the NSF. I did so, and after our interview he sent me some papers he worked on to read through, and a book on Queueing Theory to go through(as it's one of my interests, along with data analytics). 

Now, I just heard back from him today confirming that I got the position(yay!). I knew going in that this research was focused on Real-Time Systems, to quote my professor's e-mail: ""to perform exciting research in real-time, embedded, cyber-physical, and functional reactive systems (FRS's).  One key objective is to prepare papers for publication"". This is slightly intimidating to me, as he also advised me to enroll in his graduate course on Real-Time Systems to assist in the research, which I don't need for graduation but will probably enroll in anyway. 

My current plans are to attend graduate school for a Master's in Math with emphasis in Statistics, and eventually end up in some sort of data analysis field(though I'm not entirely against ending up elsewhere). So with all of this out of the way, how can I relate my goals to this research position and blend the two together? What can I expect from this research and what are some good benchmarks to make sure I'm progressing? I've never done any research nor had an internship as I realized how important this all was a bit too late. With the topics above, what can I do to be better prepared going in? Obviously I don't want to disappoint, so I want to put in some meaningful work. 

Any help/guidance/advice/etc would be *more* than welcome, as I'm pretty inexperienced with this. Also note that this is only a half-time position, expecting about 20 hours per week from me. Thanks in advance!"

7p73wf,1,2018-01-09,I don't think I have the qualities to be a good engineer.,xandrew245x,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7p73wf/i_dont_think_i_have_the_qualities_to_be_a_good/,"Hello everyone, just want to start off by saying this is probably going to be a long post. I'm a 26 year old male who is tired of the day to day grind in my dead end job trying to make ends meet. I want to make a change in my life and actually finish school. The only degree that really interests me is engineering.



Let me tell you a little about myself. I tend to be a very over analytical person, who will scrutinize the smallest details. I've been told that i'm a perfectionist, and honestly if something isn't right, it will bother me. I have worked on a good many projects around my house including designing and installing my own hvac system. My projects usually contain a high degree of planning, designing the layout, estimating materials, doing some CAD drawings to get a good 3-D look at what i'm going to be making. Overall I love to see my projects come together from start to finish. I think i'm a pretty intuitive person, and pretty decent at problem solving. Growing up I often played with lincoln logs, kinex and erector sets, I was fascinated with building, and seeing how things worked. For example I built quite a few mechanical projects out of kinexs like a ferris wheel, car, and a crane, all with moving parts. I've taken a couple of classes that involved using CAD software to design, then build projects. These were my favorite classes. I took a class called structural design, one project was to build a bridge out of a set list of materials following a strict set of rules. The goal was for your bridge to hold the most weight. I thought outside the box and designed a bridge that held the most weight out of the whole class.

I know all of those traits would be good for engineering, but I also have a lot of negative traits that make me worry. I tend to be unorganized, well to me, I have a certain way of keeping my items in order, but someone else looking at my cluttered desk would believe I was very unorganized. I do like to work on projects, but I tend to at time get off track or lose interest, or lose my way with a project. I don't feel like i'm a very creative person and would lack the ability to really come up with outside the box solutions to problems. In high school I did bad in most of my classes due to complete lack of interest, I just hated school with a passion. I was a C student in most of my classes. I have been taking classes at my community college and I have a much better gpa now. I think it was more about being immature and just not taking school seriously. I never had much interest in math, but I do like science.

I feel like i'm not even going to be able to get through the classes for engineering due to not being smart enough. I know they are difficult, and I find myself getting discouraged pretty easily. If I did somehow graduate, I feel like I wouldn't make much contribution to my job. When I have a problem, I often go to google to find answer or do research instead of trying to solve the problem on my own. I feel like I am seriously lacking the knack that make an engineer good.

I honestly feel like even if I passed my math classes I would still struggle with math on the job and it would just put me behind everyone else working there. I also feel like I don't fit the normal profile of people who end up being engineers, for example people who tinker with things all the time, or are always wondering or questioning how things work. I don't feel like I have that passion like others do.

Overall I just feel like I would end up being a terrible engineer who would have to rely on google or others to answer questions and get my work done. Do you think i'm being over analytical and to hard on myself? Do you think I actually have the capability of being an engineer? Maybe I just have the wrong idea about engineers and am just discouraging myself from even trying.

Edit: I wanted to add that unfortunately I suffer from mental illnesses too including depression, anxiety and adhd. This also concerns me majorly because the depression makes me very unmotivated, the anxiety makes me afraid of everything and over think everything. For example I'm already worried about not being able to find a job or get internships because of my conditions. And obviously the adhd makes it hard to focus and keep on track. 

Please give me your honest opinion. Thanks and sorry for the long post."

I've been an intern at a company for 4 months and it's not going so great. I've found it difficult to blend in with my coworkers and the culture here. I'm mostly the aloof outsider guy who doesn't say much, cuz I don't feel comfortable (I try but it's not easy for me).

My supervisor is not happy about it, and I'm trying to improve, but it's not going great. Like, today, we recently moved to a new location with the whole departement (aroun 13 of us) and there's not enough rooms for me and my coworkers to work in at the new location. So because of this, I've been working without a room (and thus a computer) for 3 days. 50% of the work is done on computer (writing reports mostly) so I can't finish my chores.

During a meeting we hold each week we were discussing the problems people have and basically it is a bit of a mess with everyone scrambling for rooms because the managers plan ahead right and now there's too few rooms. During the meeting I mentioned that I don't have a room and really need a pc and we discussed it for a while, but then people started talking about something else and my problem wasn't solved.

I will end it all after a week from now on, I've chosen a spot and is committed to it. This way, I will at least be a footnote on a newspaper print and raise awareness this way.

My parents divorced each other when I was at an early age, I've lived with my mother however, we continuously moved around the world so I never had anytime to develop any social skills. In addition to this, she has remarried numerous time with different men, all however end up in divorces due to fighting between them, thus leading to us moving and me having no friends at all in my entire life.

I have wasted so much time doing absolutely nothing due to this mental illness, I highly suspect that I have schizophrenia at an early age and it is only getting worst as i grow older. My mother refused to get me treatment and diagnosis due to her thinking that I am simply making it up and mental illness does not exist. Thus, she constantly berates me and call me stupid when I mess up simple things

I've managed to enter university but I am simply unable to keep up with the pressure and due to mental illness. It has been already spring but I have not managed to obtain an internship with any company whatsoever, I have applied at over 50 places but not a single one called back, I dropped my standard to the lowest point but nothing has changed. Working a minimum wage job will mean my mother will begin to belittle me again.

I have tried everything, from steeling my mind and trying to become a stoic, not giving a damn about people opinion, understanding the scale of things and how I should live only for myself or help others. However, these all failed due to the constant bickering of my subconscious and I always fail, even at realizing myself. 

This is the end for me, there is no turning back from this. I am a kissless, hugless, hand holdingless, eye contactless, virgin who is in his early 20s with a goddamn 4 inch dick. People look at me in disgust and stay away from me as if I am going to shoot up the school. The closest time I've experienced friendship was due to my middle school giving an outreach to other student to prevent mass shooting. How sad is that?

I have tried taking conversational classes, meditation, self help and finding a hobby (writing). I have no friends in real life, heck, or even acquaintances. Most of my online friends have ghosted me, I cant no longer enjoy video games anymore or my hobby. 

My mother is currently struggling with her job and my tuition fees. The only other option for me is to leave my family behind forever but I am most likely going to die homeless painfully or be locked up in jail due to potentially harming others or getting into crime. 

Suicide right now seem to be the safest option and least painful for everyone involved. I do not drink, smoke cigarettes or do drugs, I rather have this little strength that I still have before I end it all. I must end this monster that lies deep in me before it can consume anything, at all. Thank you for reading.

7p9bgo,1,2018-01-09,I got accepted to UT Dallas for software engineering! Questions about the program,[deleted],utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/7p9bgo/i_got_accepted_to_ut_dallas_for_software/,"1. I've heard that UT Dallas is has a well-known computer science and software engineering program. Is this true?

2. What are the professors like? Are they helpful and open during office hours?

3. How does UT Dallas's software engineering / CS program compare to a UC / CSU? I am in-state in California and don't want to spend extra money going to an OOS university unless going to UT Dallas will provide me opportunities that going to a UC or CSU won't provide me. I know Berkeley and UCLA are much better than UT Dallas, but how would UT Dallas's software engineering / CS program compare to a mid-low tier UC / CSU? I am ready to travel back to the silicon valley (where I currently live) for summer internships if you think location might be an issue. My family lives there and will continue to live there (at least until my sister completes her secondary education) and I'm sure they'd be happy to let me stay with them during any potential internships.


4. What are the pros and cons of the major at UT Dallas? What do you like / dislike about it?

5. What are job / internship prospects like?

6. Feel free to comment on general campus life or include any other information about the program or university.

Thanks! I'm so glad I got accepted to what is hopefully a great university for software engineering / CS. This was my first college acceptance, so I'm super stoked about it!

Here's proof that I got accepted :D

So my question is, do companies need interns during the off season? All the postings I see are about summer positions, and I'd like to start as soon as possible. Should I start reaching out to companies and asking them? If so, who would I contact?

Problem is I don't know how bad it looks to recruiters if I apply AFTER I graduated? 

All the successful people in my network with jobs applied during their senior year and not AFTER they graduated. So I don't really have any reference point. The people I know that are still applying after they graduated are because they couldn't find a job.

I don't know if recruiter thinks kids that apply after they already graduate must be not good enough to get a job lined up before graduation...

My resume isn't bad I interned at 1 notable tech company before and couple other mid-size place (I don't plan to go back to any of them tho). I also have a small collection of demo-able projects on my GitHub and I add more all the time too. So I'm not worried about no project/ internship/ experience.

In need of advice.,Lord_Mop,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/7pbi5j/soon_to_have_my_bachelors_and_ready_to_try_and/,"So I will be graduating from my (BA) Computer Games Design course this year and think I've made a mistake.

I keep seeing others in the labs who never leave the room until early morning hours, doing insane amounts of work on their portfolios in hopes of getting an internship or grad job. And it makes me uncomfortable, I know this kind of work in the industry is the norm and I can handle it, but seeing all these guys putting themselves through this just for a chance.

Thats not to say I have not done my own fair share of hard work. I like to think that my portfolio at the moment is decent, and I have been applying for every single work experiance/projects the University is putting on.

I have had discussions with my professors who are mostly ex-industry themselves about my concerns, with one suggesting QA as a good way in and the other basically saying that QA was a waste of time and that I would never be given a chance to move up the ladder. 

The general concessius was that I really should be looking for jobs now, but I am taking a year to myself after graduating to travel.

During the start of my degree we were told that our degrees would be useful in multiple industries. And now that our final modules have begun we were told that was basically a lie to keep us enrolled (the exact words)... 

So now I think Ill be sat here with a degree I will possibly never get a job with. I'm only 20 and I could always do another course and try to get a BA in something else but I already have the student debt with me.

I love games design and it is my dream career, but the design students have been given almost no help in terms of recruitment advice or agencies like programmers and animators have. 

I asked about this in a lecture and was told that design as a general role is so hard to get into, that the University does not bother basically. Which was a real eye opener but now I am feeling trapped.

I plan to take a well deserved break to go travelling after graduating as I never had the choice to before starting Uni, but I fear doing so will put me at such a disadvantage that getting a graduate or junior job would be impossible."

Hello everyone, here is the situation: I am curently a French student in second year for a generalist engineer degree.

In the first year of my school we had a little bit of scripting with python and we still curently have and it got me into learning more advanced stuff because we study the very basic codes. Also it led me into the wanting to learn more and other languages, i still work hard on my python and i am starting to learn other languages to do other tasks. I am into many domains, machine learning, web, apps. I always learn more even tho i know i should focus hard on one thing but here is the problem.

I am very uncertain about my current degree if i want to land a job into the IT domain.. Maybe software engineering, computer scientist or something related, something that lead me to code, think about its structure and solve problems. I like maths, physics and the very few computer courses i get at my school. But will a generalist engineer degree be a benefit or a waste of time if in the end I want to land a job in IT/software engineer/computer science... ? I still have 3 and a half year to get my degree and in that period i can still do a lot of stuff, get a lot of projects done in that period (especially because the last year is an internship).

Sorry for Beeing a little messy about my ideas and maybe doing a lot of mistakes in my writing.

What should i do ? Can i still get into the field by studying on the side on my own ? Thanks a lot in advance for your answers.

7pc1ma,9,2018-01-09,"How do research experience, GPA, teaching experience, industry experience, and clubs rank in importance in a grad school application?",beesdyingalarming,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/7pc1ma/how_do_research_experience_gpa_teaching/,"I’m a sophomore undergrad majoring in electrical engineering &amp; CS (minoring in math) interested in pursuing a PhD. I know research experience is the most important thing on a grad school application, but how do other factors, such as teaching experience, clubs, and industry internships rank in importance? What would you consider a “good” gpa, and how would one make up for a mediocre one?

There is no need to read the context sections if you know how you’d answer just from reading the question. **Any response to any subquestion is very much appreciated! Please don’t feel obligated to read/answer everything, and I’m sorry for the wall of text**

**Subquestion 1:** If I have a research position, but it’s not in the field I ultimately want to enter, how does that impact my chances of getting a position in that field? How does one tactfully leave a research position? How would you recommend finding a position under a professor, and how can I prove my competence prior to asking said prof?

**Context:** Currently I’m doing research under a grad student developing software for terraforming research, while I’d be more interested in computer hardware-related research (FPGA/ASIC design and programming, especially GPUs) or hardware-software interface (ISAs, OSs, compilers, maybe security?). I’ve been working with him since the June 2017. Part of the problem is, I haven’t yet tried enough things to be certain of what I want to do. I’m trying to make the best of my current position by learning as much as possible about higher-level software development, but I can’t shake the feeling that this will make it harder for me to get a position under a professor in one of the fields I listed above. Though I am paid, the time commitment is considerable, and the grad student is  not very organized and has no sense of work-life balance. Also, he is not a computer scientist, so he doesn’t really understand the time it takes to research and develop something of the scale that we’re working on. I am trying my best to show him exactly what I’m doing and thereby stand up for my time. My current plan is to finish this project and then find another position.

**Subquestion 2:** What is an appropriate extracurricular load? Specifically, how would you rank research, GPA, teaching experience, industry experience, and clubs in admissions importance?

**Context:** I also TA a lower-division EE course (I was a lab assistant last semester and have since been promoted). I really enjoy it, and I get paid a decent hourly wage. Preparing sections does take time, but I find myself using it to procrastinate on less interesting work. Additionally, I’m in a research-oriented aerospace club. I joined it to get experience with circuit design and building real things. This is my least-favorite use of my time, not because of the work, but because of the people: everyone’s very accomplished, sure, but they’re also extremely egotistical: they look down on people who ask questions and are constantly looking to prove how much better/smarter they are than each other. My GPA is improving but is still a modest 3.3. Should I drop the club to dedicate more time to studying? It meets twice a week for a total of 6h/week, but I also spend considerable time outside working on my project. "

Would it be possible to take CS at UCLA with a major in economics; I'm interested in both. Currently, I'm applying as a CS major, but I don't think ill get in (my chances are a lot higher as an economics major)

I'm not necessarily looking for an easier way to get in; I just don't know what I want to do yet. I've taken a lot of economics/business classes and my parents have ran a lot of businesses, so it's safe to say I know a bit more about economics/business than say CS. I self-taught all my CS (python &amp; swift). 

My questions:

1. How hard is it to get internships?

2. What do salaries look post college? Are they comparable to CS majors?

3. can I work in the tech sector (I really want to move onto business and then management side at the tech companies like google, facebook, etc)

7pchlw,10,2018-01-09,My Story,SpoonHanded,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/7pchlw/my_story/,"Hey all! I just typed in this subreddit name and found out it not only exists but is a pretty big community.  I've suffered from severe social anxiety my entire life, and selective mutism for much of it.  I thought maybe my story would be interesting to some, useful to others.  I definitely could vent too.  This disorder is fucking awful.  It never went away, and I deal with it every day, but I just learned to ignore it. I'm glad I have the strength to do that now and I believe each of you is capable of building that in yourself! Maybe I'm wrong, but it doesn't hurt to believe.

When I was a kid I never really understood how to make friends or talk to other people.  All around me I saw kids matching up and having fun and somewhere.  It confused me so much, even when i was just 6 or 7, that I didn't understand how to do that.  I didn't know why, but I was never able to just go up to another kid and talk to them.  Some voice in my head would always scream at me that I shouldn't do it, that I had nothing of value to offer that person.  This inevitably manifested in me having no semblance of relationships in school.  I had one friend growing up, whos mom was good friends with my mom, and who I guess I became friends with when i was a baby.  This was purely an anomaly though, and he is in many ways more like a brother to me.  I also have 5 siblings with varying degrees of closeness.  I'll say it was crucial that I had relationships in my life.  I'm not sure I could have made it if that weren't the case.  Even the loneliness I experienced was insufferable.  I also grew up with a shitty dad who was almost completely not present, and in 6th grade moved to San Diego and I've seen him once since.

In 3rd grade I made my first friend in school.  To me it was really special.  But always somewhere inside of me I was skeptical of the sincerity of it, and the value it had to him.  Over the summer after 3rd grade I didn't talk to him. I'm not sure how those kinds of relationships work for other kids, but I assumed it was natural.  In 4th grade things changed though.  This kid started bullying me really badly.  He had his older 5th grade brother and these 2 brutes in our grade join in.  They'd beat me up and make racist insults, call me out for the loser I was.  I grew up white in an almost entirely hispanic neighborhood.  I ended up switching schools for 5th grade because I couldn't bear it.

Going into 5th grade, I entered puberty.  With it came a wave of extreme depression.  My anxiety only got worse.  I found I wasn't able to talk to any of the kids in my new school.  I started sitting alone at lunch.  I ended up severely depressed and suicidal.  My grades failed completely.  I also started playing an online video game called WarCraft III. 

WarCraft III was really important to me at this stage in my life.  I would come home from school then play it non-stop.  I ended up getting into a community based around a specific set of custom games.  Not DOTA!!! This game effectively became my life for the next 5 years.  I determined at some point that I had spent 1.5 years of time in-game throughout that period.  It was nice to be able to talk to people without the pressure of being who I was.  I think this was critical in my social development.  I once was watching some random video and the narrator said something to the effect that it isn't a choice to make friends as a kid, and I feel like I might have severely neglected my social evolution had I not been allotted the opportunity to participate in this community.  If it weren't that, i don't think it would have been anything.

Moving into middle school, I started smoking weed.  And then I started experimenting with other drugs, still in middle school.  Towards the end of 8th Grade and into high school i got casually into heroin.  I used for about a year, but I never got addicted thankfully.  I made friends through substance abuse.  These people would tolerate me not really talking or anything.  It was a weird situation.  They were all older than me.  One day, one of them OD'd and died of asphyxiation. I quit and stopped hanging out with them after that.  I started playing a lot of StarCraft 2 after that, as WarCraft III started to die with age.  I got really good.  I would play it all the time. It went from being casual throughout 9th grade into being my main game in 10th grade.  It was nice to have an outlet for my adolescent energy.  I never played sports.  I always felt I wouldn't be welcomed there for some reason.  I regret never trying them, I still have never been on a sports team.

At the end of 10th grade I tried mushrooms for the first time.  This experience was CRITICAL to me.  I effectively attribute this event to my defeat of selective mutism.  I realized that I didn't have to be that way.  I realized that that voice in the back of my head could be ignored.  I realized I could be my own person.  It didn't make the voice go away though, all it did was initiate my struggle against my demons.  That being said, I am always cautious to discuss mushrooms as treatment.  I sincerely think they have potential, and the negative consequences are uncommon, but THEY DO EXIST.  I've seen people change for the worse because of psychadelics.

In 9th grade, my mom had lost her job and long story short because of Texas [anti]labor laws she couldn't find stable work.  We ended up at the end of 10th grade having to move in with her mom in Virginia.  This was supplemented by my grandma's need for care as she approached death.  

Moving to Virginia in the middle of high school, just after having had that experience with mushrooms, was extremely liberating to me.  I had a whole new social canvas.  An issue I had at my old high school was this constant fear that people would be friendly to me out of pitty.  People would always try to sit with me at lunch, or talk with me, but nothing ever stuck.  One friend of that old friend of mine was hanging out with us one night.  Turns out she had been one of those people to try to sit with me at lunch.  I didn't notice, I guess because I didn't make eye contact with her at lunch.  She told me that I looked terrified.  I guess that's how I looked to everybody.  Maybe that's an accurate description of how I felt. 

Not having that fear of prejudice helped me to start to talk to people.  i started to make friends for the first time in my life. It was awesome!  I didn't make that many friends but the ones I did were very dear to me at the time.  I still was experimenting with drugs to an extent.  To be honest, I am of the mind that much of our preconceptions of drugs are false.  This is largely a resultant of misinformation campaigns in our educational systems.  For instance, I found a way to harvest mushrooms in the forest and started using them to some degree of regularity.  I started smoking more weed than I ever had.  My grades really started to falter.  I still was suffering from depression.  but things were better than they ever had been so I was ok with it.

One problem for me living in Virginia was that I had dialup at home.  Since my life had so strongly orbitted online gaming, not being able to do that meant my life was forced to be completely different.  I'm not sure how much this helped, or hurt, but it was significant.

Going into my senior year, I started talking with this girl.  She had been sitting with me and my friends at lunch since I had made those friends.  Eventually, with the encouragement of my friend (""ask her out today or im gonna kick you in the nuts""), I asked her out! We ended up falling in love.  This was the first time I had even considered something like that. It was amazing.  She and I ended up by coincidence going to the same college.  Unfortunately, at the end of high school I had a falling out with that friend group.  This was due to a torrent of them being shitty people and me being unstable I guess. One of them stole from me and I haven't looked back since.

So I went to college after that! Because of my grades falling, I almost didn't get in but by fortune I did.  I ended up making friends with the people in my dorm.  I quit all drugs, even smoking weed. I was finally in a place where i felt stable, for the first time in my life.  I felt finally at peace.  I was in a loving relationship too.  Things fell apart though.  Towards the end of my freshman year, it's a long story but I was put on a temporary detention order due to some disputes I had.  There's two sides to every story, but I think the lead interviewer for my release helped me a lot in understnading what happened.  He basically said that people were looking for crazy so they found crazy, that I should have never been placed in there, and that I should assume it was a result of incompetence as opposed to malice.  He referred to Occam's and Hanlon's razors. 

The thing is the pigs had dragged me out in front of all my friends.  None of them ever talked to me again after that.  About 2 years later, one of the girls started dating a friend of mine I made after it all happened and she gave him a bullshit and false interpretation - saying even that I attacked someone! Total lies, but since then I've realized real friends wouldn't make those kinds of assumptions and cut someone off like that.  Fuck em all.  Ended up picking weed back up after that.  I thought quitting would help, but it didn't.  I love weed.  My mom was part of what happened, she pretty much ruined our relationship.  After that she told all my siblings what happened.  I guess it was because of my social anxiety, but I found myself unable to talk to any of them.

After that, I moved dorms.  I didn't feel comfortable living under the RA and building manager who basically put me in that situation.  I made new friends in my new dorm, but it was hard to do so in the middle of freshman year.  I found myself stuck at home playing video games with no one to hang out with and nothing to do.  Something about spending 3 days trying to convince myself I was crazy and then losing all my friends really hurt me.  I was afraid of asking to hang out with people again.  I got really depressed again.  What was so great came falling down all around me.  My grades suffered because I was in there 3 days, and ended up getting worse because of my depression.  But I didn't give up.  i kept fighting. I still had my girlfriend! She really helped me so much through those trying times.

The summer after freshman year was hard for me.  Cause I had lost all my friends in Charlottesville, I ended up not having anyone to hang out with.  I would just smoke weed and play CSGO, and work at a gas station.  But I got back to college and got back to making connections with friends I had made.  I found a friend group who I could trust.  I still was with that girl.  Still my social anxiety hurt me.  I was still spending many weekends at home playing cideo games. But things were slowly getting better.

Stuff stabilized for a while.  I ended up becoming really close friends with some of those guys.  I still am friends with them to this day! In the middle of Junior year, me and that girl decided to split up because of diverging futures.  That was hard for me, but I ended up using it as an opportunity to find myself.  i tried dating around, hooking up, w/e.  I ended up getting really involved in politics.  I identify as a communist, which made it difficult to find like minded people, but I identified strongly with my beliefs. I joined a communist group on campus and made a lot of friends and got involved in a lot of cool organizing.  This was last spring.

Over the summer after my junior year, I worked an internship.  I ended up having the best summer of my life, doing all sorts of crazy stuff.  Getting involved in various political organizations.  I went to the charlottesville protest and almost got hit by the car.  That was an experience that changed my whole outlook on life.  Something about watching 50 people get mowed down gave me some kind of insight into humanity.  I'm not so sure how to explain it, but I stopped identifying so strongly as an individual.  

Anyways, things kept getting better and better afte rthat summer.  I made more and more friends.  I started having something to do almost every weekend.  Part of college for me has been filling my time with 19 credit hours of engineering course work and working, because if it weren't for that I'd just sulk alone in my room.  But even with that I had a balance of social life and good grades.  

Yesterday I made a big step.  I'm not sure why it was so hard, but I talked to one of my siblings for the first time in 3 years.  It was an awesome conversation.  We caught up, I explained what happened my freshman year and why everything had got so fucked.  It was nice that she was so sympathetic.

Anyways that's my story so far! It ain't over.  Thanks to anyone who took the time to read it."

Hey y’all, I am a sophomore engineer and I can’t decide what to do this summer. I had an internship last year at a small company, and they’d like me to come back. Pay isn’t great, and I’d like a new experience, but I have to decide now before spring recruiting starts. 

That being said, I don’t know what to do. I couldn’t get anything in the fall and very possibly may still not get anything in the spring, which would stick me behind a grill at McDonald’s. Should I take the risk and go after new things? Or should I play it safe, as an internship is better than none?

Thanks!"

I am a computer engineering major who is currently at an internship. I really want a Threadripper system so that I can have a workstation for class, but I'm currently ""gaming"" on a Surface Pro 4. My thought has been to maybe build a system to use for now then when Threadripper 2 comes out either sell this system or use it as an HTPC/Plex server.

I have a 1080p screen with me, I'm not looking to upgrade that until I build a better system. If I decide to keep it I would want to be able to game at 1080p at 60 fps.

7pcw2p,10,2018-01-09,Computer Game Science Major vs. Software Engineering Major [undergrad],[deleted],UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/7pcw2p/computer_game_science_major_vs_software/,"Hey guys,

I am currently a senior in high school and earlier today I received my portal for UC Irvine.

I realized that I put computer game science as my main major and software engineering as an alternative. I'm not sure if I should send a request to switch the two around.

**Preface:**

I love games. Games play a huge part of my life. In elementary school, I got a PS2 and played NBA and Shrek Racing. Then in third or fourth grade, I got a Wii. I remember playing a shit ton of Mario Kart. Man, those were the good days.

I also remember playing Club Penguin and Dragon Fable and some other kiddie games on the computer during that time. 

In eighth grade, my friends introduced me to Clash of Clans. A little while later, I opened up a YouTube channel posting videos on that game. (bit.ly/TabloidGamingYouTube - I didn't put my channel on my college apps)

When Supercell released new games like Clash Royale and Boom Beach, I started playing those too.

I even started playing some other mobile games and got hooked, too.


So as you can probably tell,video games have played a very important role in my childhood. While this isn't emphasized in my college apps since I wanted to show my most ""intellectual"" side to colleges, gaming is something I really enjoy doing. *Playing games, that is.*

While I enjoy playing games, I'm not sure if making games full-time (and not just with those drag and drop builder IDE's like sploder.com but from scratch) is what I want to do with my life.

I've only applied to UC Irvine and UC Santa Cruz as a CGS (Computer game science) major since they're the only two schools I am applying to that offer this kind of major.

My questions in this post are specifically tailored towards UC Irvine, so if you know of the CGS program in UC Santa Cruz, please don't talk about it when answering my questions.

**Here are my questions:**

* What is perceived as an easier major by UC Irvine students (while this may vary by individual students, I am looking for an overal consensus) - CGS or Software Engineering?

* What are the job prospects like for a CGS major? Where do people usually get internships and jobs? What are their roles in the company?

* What are the job prospects like for a software engineering major? Where do people usually get internships and jobs? What are their roles in the company?


* What is the CGS major like? What courses do students take? How is it different from a traditional software engineering major? 

* Which is a more competitive major? Which one is harder to get into (at least in your opinion)? I have a 3.29 UC GPA (I explained the shit that happened to me that led to low grades in my essays) and a 29 ACT. I have some amazing extracurriculars, including a software engineering internship at a well-reputed web design company in the silicon valley (making web / software applications for multiple platforms is my end goal in terms of a career...unless the UC Irvine CGS major has something more compelling). Essays are pretty good too. I had a tutor look over them. Based on my stats, which major do you think I have a higher chance of getting into?

* If I do pursue a CGS major but for some reason am unhappy at UC Irvine and want to transfer to another UC (maybe even Berkeley or UCLA) *besides* UC Santa Cruz, what will happen? The other UC's besides SC don't have a CGS major. Will I just be thrown into a standard CS program and have a few credits transferred? Will I have to transfer to santa Cruz or some CSU or OOS college which has that program?

* Feel free to comment on anything else on either program

Thanks guys! I look forward to potentially being a future anteater!

All my experience has been varied and not much to do with my majors in Geotech Engineering.

I've worked as an Assistant Project Manager in the US, that was the only job I could get as an intern with zero experience, but didn't gain much exposure to real work, as this was basically renovating pre-built houses on 5th Avenue in Manhattan. I did learn a little but not really all that useful, as I was rarely on site. It was more Contract Management, Project Coordination, Planning and scheduling.

Then my visa expired and I went back to India. I attended a walk-in interview and got a job as a Senior Engineer on a major job site, because I had a great interview with one of the largest infra companies in India. I didn't know what I was doing. I did learn on the job and after 3 years I left with new knowledge of a very specific branch of engineering which really isn't useful in most application. Most people in that company were lifers, and spent decades with the same work description. I was about ready to kill myself with the 84 hour work weeks on site in sweltering heat(no joke).

After being unemployed for a month, I started thinking about setting up my own turnkey construction group, building houses for people with a limited budget after a friend of mine asked to assist on a job he was on. I did ok, not much money in that, but I learned a little bit more about how shitty the industry really is in India. Far too many people, far too few jobs, and poor work quality. I did what I could to improve it, but it was clear to me that the system was too ingrained in people and mediocrity came naturally to them, while excellence was never really an option. I left because I had gotten all I could from that job.

I joined a third party quality consultant working on a building project and here was where I learned most of what I know today. The work was onerous, but the first six months taught me more than 6 years of engineering education. After the initial learning period, I couldn't handle the politics, I was being muzzled by my own team, the people who we were supposed to be instructing on quality were the same people who hired us. It was a recipe for disaster.

I had been applying for a Permanent Resident Visa to Australia, for 2 years prior and it finally came through and I quit my job, the salary was shit, ($500 a month) and I moved to Australia, hoping for a better job. I've been here since September 2017 and I dislike it intensely. I can sense the prejudice that I hadn't felt in New York City. I've had heavy hints from people that my Indian name is a big obstacle to me getting hired. Also, local experience is required for any job as a Civil Engineer. That is a bit of a catch-22 situation, I need to get hired in order to be hired. I've applied to various companies, I've updated my resume, used multiple career consultants, paid them to work my resume and still no results. I think also the fact that I got here not too far from the end of the year may have contributed to my failures. I've also asked companies to host unpaid work placements for which I buy the workplace insurance. No luck here either. One company offered me a work placement, but then took it back, citing some problems in the legal department. That fucking took the wind out of my sails.

I was able to get a few casual survival jobs that allowed me to elongate my time here, but I'm quickly running out of money and I'm now not sure if I should stay here or go back. If I do somehow manage to stay, that'll create a 6 month gap in my resume without any relevant work.

If you have any free tips on how to increase employability or inputs to improve my resume or just a comment on how much better your life is than mine, just leave a comment. I will reply since I am now an out-of-work lout on my computer. I'll also take a casual job in Melbourne, if you know of one.

This was a rant, I needed it. But I'm not sure I feel better.

Are there any courses I can do that'll help getting me employed? In India or in Australia?"

I've finished three internships and have been apart of my college newspaper for all three years. Two I took because I couldn't find anything else, and they do not relate at all to fields I'm interested in. The most prestigious and relevant internship was in journalism, which is something I've been working on since Freshman year of high school.

My skills

-Good writer/editor

-Good reader (analytical)

-Reporting skills

-I'm good at school

Things that are holding me back

Social anxiety

Lack of ambition, no passion

Lack of confidence

Sense of being lost

You may ask, why not do something in journalism? I don't think I'm cut out for it due to my social anxiety. For example, during my internship I had to call a PR rep from the government, and I was super, super stressed just about this minor call. I couldn't think during it, which led to a bad interview. Essentially, while I have the writing skills, my personality doesn't suit itself to journalism. Not to mention that it's not exactly the most stable, lucrative career right now.

Career ideas I have...

Teaching (college or HS) -- The idea and stability sounds nice, but I'm not sure I'd actually enjoy it. I do love being a student and the academic environment. And becoming a professor is incredibly difficult.

Law -- I have good grades...I can make good money...??

Copy editor -- Not that many jobs here...not sure how I even get my foot in the door since I can't find any internships in this field.

Publishing -- I like books, but I don't really know what this type of job even entails...?

Librarian -- Idk...maybe?

Anyway, you get the point. I have no idea what to do, I feel like I only excel at schoolwork (not ""real work""), and the career I've been preparing for doesn't seem right for me.

Please offer some guidance :)"

I’m currently a senior psych major in undergrad about to graduate in May. I’ve been applying to experimental psych grad schools (mostly masters programs) and I guess i’m just worried about getting into the program I want. 

I have a 3.2 gpa, at least high B’s in all my research/statistic classes, did an internship with a research center at a local hospital, I’ve been the tutor for my psych programs stats class as well as the biopsych class. I also recently became a data analyst on a million dollar grant opiod project. My letters of rec are strong as well. My GRE scores were okay, but not the best. 

The program I really want is Towson’s experimental program. They say a minimum gpa of 3.0 and the basic letter of rec with research based things etc. I was looking on their website today and saw they only admitted about 11 students in the program last fall. Not sure if this is because it isn’t a big concentration or they only take small groups. A majority of the students were from Towsons undergrad program as well. 

I guess i’m just wondering if anyone had any advice on not being so anxious with knowing whether or not i’ve got in or if my short background info I gave looks good enough to get in.

I'm currently a 3rd year student at a large, STEM-focused top 10 public uni. I want to develop a career in UX design, mostly the visual side. My school doesn't have a degree geared towards UX, but a major called Digital Arts &amp; Sciences (DAS) is offered in the Computer Engineering dept. It's based in comp sci w/ a focus on Comp Aided Animation/ Modeling, and has classes on HCI. [The school doesn’t offer industrial design as a degree either].

My (new) major is Digital Arts and Sciences in my school’s college of Arts (the Arts program version focuses more on animation/ game design). If I continue in this program I would want to get a minor in Comp Engineering to strengthen my skills set/ make me more marketable.

I have wide interests but ultimately I’d like a career in design. I would like to design not just interfaces – but physical objects like medical devices, mobile/ tech devices, cars… even consumer products. I’m also interested in working in healthcare doing 3D modeling and surgery simulations, etc. I really want a creative career where I use my knowledge of science and technology to create solutions that benefit others.

I can’t help feeling like I should get a technical degree [to get jobs/ internships]. I think I should switch to DAS in engineering, or Computer Science and possibly take some electives related to 3D animation.

But I don't think I have a passion for Comp Sci, to be honest. I'm mostly pursuing it because it's stable and coding skills are valuable in any field. I enjoy coding &amp; I've taught myself a few languages on (codecademy, edX etc) but I don't code in my free time.[But I don't even draw or have hobbies like I used to]. I did poorly on a C++ course I took also.

So basically, I want a career in design but I think comp sci would give me job stability/ good work/ life balance, and it can help me in UX design or any other field. I don't know if I'll love the UX field or if I might lose my job because visual interfaces become conversational [or some other reason], and I have so many interests. So since it's such a widely accepted field, I'm thinking I should do a CS degree. But I don't think I'm passionate about CS or coding. I ultimately want to be an artist who works in design and engineering.

So would CS be a better option, since my interests are still broad? Or should I focus on a design-oriented degree early?

Please.... any insight will be helpful."

As a Junior who is graduating a year early, I have had a tough time with job searches. I feel as though a internship is my next step. getting that experience is key for me, before heading into a full time job. However, 9/10 internship positions have turned me down from the offset because I'm graduating. I couldn't get one as a sophomore because I was too young, so I was stuck in growing pain stage.

I did notice that I lacked a niche though. And I didn't know what I WANTED to do with my major. So I chose Web Dev, and lately have been taking my basic skills to the next level. Learning frameworks, doing projects on my own, so that I can say ""I want to be a web developer"" or something along those lines. 

I have a career fair upcoming and thought that I should have my resume reflect that more. Rather than a general resume of ""this is what i can do, do you want me"" I want it to say ""I know web dev. I know x y z. and here is why I can do web dev""

so i changed my resume to have a lean toward web dev positions, but would like advice on it. I'm still finishing up on my portfolio and projects to have to show for, but my I need to make sure the layout and Resume itself speaks to my strengths in the best manner."

7pm6tj,3,2018-01-11,Life Choices,McDoosty,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/7pm6tj/life_choices/,"Hello everyone,

I've been having a bit of a change of heart on my career and been wanting to change the path I've been on. 

A little background about myself, I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance (it just seemed like the safe route) from a California State University. College was a learning experience for me because I didn't do much learning but what I did learn, closer to the end of my college career, was how to manage my own life. I spent most of my college life meeting new people, making connections, and preparing myself for the future. What I didn't do was really plan my career. Now I'm stuck finding jobs that I can't seem to find excitement in. Mostly HR, Data Input, and Office Jobs. My girlfriend said it best ""it's like you're looking for a job, not a career"".

That being said.

I wanted to jump into learning more about Computer Science. Something that I believe will be very valuable in the future, especially with all this cryptocurrency around and hacking becoming more common. With the online world exponentially growing the threats to the online world also grow. It made me want to understand this world. I found countless books to read, mostly from a subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ch0wt/a_reading_list_for_the_selftaught_computer/), and it just made me more interested in learning daily. Thus, my interest in Computer Science grew. It gave me inspiration to maybe pursue a second degree in Computer Science. It made me want to understand Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Software Engineering, and especially Computer Security. I'm not sure if a degree would even help me find a job, because I'm a firm believer that someone can have a degree but it doesn't mean they are the best person suited for a task. Consider me as an example, I have a Bachelor's Degree in Finance and I focused my studies on Financial Management. But give me a Financial Analyst job and yeah maybe I can put a few graphs together but I can't apply that into growing a business. (yeah i'm pretty hard on myself) It's not that I regret my choices in college, because i'm sure many people do, but I do wish I applied myself more to make life a little easier as an adult.

With all that being said. What do the people of this community think my next step should be?

1) Go back to school to earn a Associates or Bachelors Degree and learn from professors?

**Pros**: I get to learn from scholars who have spent their life learning and wanting to teach the world

**Cons**: I would be in more debt... haha

2) Continue reading books and learn by finding an internship where I can find on the job training?

**Pros**: I feel like I'm a better individual learner where if I read a book it sticks. Taking tests and doing homework usually intimidate me and I don't do that well under the pressure.

**Cons**: Finding a job with a degree was already hard. I can't even imagine what it would be like to try and get one in an industry that I didn't have one in.

3) Avoid the whole thing and just stick to my day job? (Please I hope no one chooses this haha)

**Pros**: No learning involved

**Cons**: Stuck at a job I do not enjoy.


I guess my real question is do you guys believe that a second degree would be helpful? Because end of the day, I have a family to feed. So a job is necessary. Or do you guys think that if I gain the RIGHT knowledge through literature and practice the craft that I can successfully find a job in the Computer Science industry?

What do I need to do to protect myself, and what parts of my work does the organization own?",fancyaltaccount,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7pmiic/i_am_on_bad_terms_leaving_an_organization_where_i/,"Edit: I forgot to include our location. Everyone involved is domiciled in NYC, the station, LLC, and work product were all created in NYC. 

**The Backstory**

About four years ago I started working for a small podcasting network - it wasn't an official organization, nobody made any money off of it, it was all for fun. The network has since grown tremendously and has become fairly profitable, so much so that several of the founders have been able to quit their jobs and live comfortably off the income generated. It became an LLC about a year ago. 

I have since become a professional freelance audio producer, but continued doing about 25 hours of work a week for the network, even though I wasn't being paid or legally tied to the network in any way. I produced and edited six programs, the majority of my work was done on my personal computer. I did the work because I loved it, because I considered the people I worked with friends, and because I always figured that when we became profitable enough the station manager would hire me on, even part time or as a freelancer. 

The station manager has been stringing me along with promises of payment for about a year and a half, but has been dragging his feet on the paperwork, etc. Six months ago I discovered a help wanted ad on our website seeking a part time intern to be paid $100/week. I was livid and had a talk with the SM letting him know that it was extremely offensive to be hiring staff for pay while I was still earning nothing for my work. He told me that he'd been meaning to tell me that he had decided to begin paying me a stipend of $150/week (half of my usual day rate) for my work. 

Six months go by and nothing happens. I don't really care because this network has always been a side project for me and has never been about money, so I let it slide. Last month the SM asked me to send him a W9 so that he could start paying me in January. I sent it over to him before Christmas. 

Last night the SM calls me and lets me know that they've decided to hire someone else full time and is going to give all my editing work to the new employee, but that he will let me keep the two shows that I record. He tells me that to show his appreciation for all my hard work he's written me a check for $500 and will leave it at our recording studio. 

I have no plans to stay doing any work for the network. I have notified the hosts of one of my shows about what happened and will be telling the hosts of the other show tomorrow in person. After I've spoken with them, I am going to let my SM know that I'll finish out the month (a courtesy to the hosts), provide any assistance needed with transitioning producers until the end of January, and after that he's on his own. 

I have worked on a LOT of projects for this network over the years; I've done research projects for shows, have four years worth of edited assets backed up, as well as our entire library of every show the network has ever published, saved and organized on my personal computer and hard drives. This is all work that the SM has asked me to do, assuming I'd just hold on to them until he needed them. 


**So here are my questions:** 

1. Before leaving, what if anything do I need to ask my SM for in writing? He has my signed W9. Is there any reason to have him document the fact that I have never done any work under it? 


2. Who owns all the crap on my computer? If he were to ask me to send him my show assets, or my organized archive of shows, or any of the research assignments I've done for the shows, does he have any right to them? Do I have the right to try and sell them to him? Or use the assets (sound clips I designed or had commissioned) or research for future projects?

I appreciate any insight. Thanks!

I've been blessed with an offer from both Google's engineering practicum and Microsoft's explore program. Unfortunately, I have to make a decision by Friday (deadline from Microsoft) and I didn't think Google would give me an offer (I head back today) so now I'm giving EP serious consideration once more.

The pay for EP is slightly higher but I think extra taxes in either New York or mountain view (my two options) would eat that up, so the monetary compensation will be around the same (benefits included)

I will say that I had a better experience with Microsoft, as they flew me out and I got to know some of their engineers fairly well, as opposed to Google's EP where I just did the phone interview (and one Interviewer was 20 minutes late and didn't seem to care so I assumed that thanked my chances)

Also from what I understand, Microsoft gives return offers for either the SWE internship or a PM internship, but Google mostly gives out return offers for EP after the first time, with only a few SWE offers going to first years like me (gleaned from my recruiters).

What do you all think? Microsoft would be a safer choice because if I do well i have a very good chance at a SWE internship, and my recruiter told me I could get placed on Azure's team (as I told him I'm interested in cloud computing). My Google recruiter told me he couldn't promise anything like that and he made it clear most freshman get the return offer for EP again but I think that Google would be more beneficial if I can pull it off."

So I did my undergrad studies at Michigan State University in Supply Chain Management/Agriculture and Natural Resources. I didn't really enjoy what I did but my major did lead to some good internships (4 during undergrad) and a pretty decent first job, Amazon.com working HR. 
I didn't really enjoy working HR in an Amazon warehouse so I quit back in July 2017. Since then I've been out of a job hopelessly trying to get a new one. (Yes I'm stupid for quitting Amazon but I needed my life back.) 
Besides endlessly searching Linkedin and Indeed for jobs I decided to pick up a new hobby out of straight curiosity, learning how to code. I've been using CodeAcademy to learn SQL, Python, and JavaScript. It was a steep learning curve at first, but after a few weeks I'm seeming to get the hang of it. I learned quickly that I love coding and I'd love to learn more, and possibly make a career out of it. 

I thought about going back to school for a Masters in CS or something similar but I do not know which program(s) I should go for. I'm looking for something similar to the ALIGN program with Northeastern University.

I am an Industrial engineering student who is entering his second semester of Junior year. I realize this is a time where most students begin to look for summer internships. 

I know this is an usual post, so I don't expect perfect advice. However, I would love input from fellow engineering students. 

My freshman year of school, I was accepted into my school's engineering program. During this time, I started a YouTube channel which was not very popular at the time, but grew throughout the year. Well, come sophomore year, I was making significantly more money off the channel. To keep things simple, I made about 40 grand in 2017, and I project to make around 60 in 2018. 

Of course, a career in YouTube is heavily unstable. It would be foolish for me to drop out and pursue this. But, managing to produce content is very time consuming (~30 filming/editing per week). So, even though I can manage the channel easily during my semesters, I do not know if working an internship in the summer of 2018 is possible if I want to continue the growth of the channel. Please take into account that it is extremely difficult to keep growth constant on a channel if one does not upload every 7-10 days at the least. 

Here is how I see it in terms of options: 

1.) I can work an internship related to my major in the summer of 2018 and have technical experience for my resume, but possibly allow for failure of the channel. 

2.) I can skip working an internship, continue to work on my content during the summer break to increase channel growth and revenues. 


I see these two options, and obviously the second one seems more appealing considering I am very happy with what I do. I feel as if my experience with my YouTube channel and the success I had with it may be as impressive to many employers as an internship is. 

I just hate the possibility of (when YouTube dies down), an employer looking at my resume and seeing ""self-employed"" for 2015-2019 and thinking I am some sort of joke. 


I know this isn't the best place to ask for help with my decision, but please understand that I do not have a lot of places to turn. I will appreciate any honest attempts at help. Thank you guys very much! "

- no job experience, no prospects, no connections - my life will only get worse with no future, career, living poverty like wageslave until I die, hoping to die sooner than getting old, never owning a house or anything, cant even drive because of my eyes

- living in east/central third world like place in europe with people who are mostly heartless, stupid with slave mentality and they boast about working 12+hours a day for nearly nothing and then get drunk, the ones who made it are successful and got out of this place, everything is crumbling around me

- my physical health is bad with bad eye sight, back pains and problems, problems with blood, I need medicine daily and on top of that my mental health is probably not any better, also Im unattractive, short with mediocre face and small bones like a woman

Her current supervisor is a manager and they all work for a national company that staffs hospitals. My sister might want to work for the company in the future and doesn't want her current supervisor to mark her as a ""do not hire again"". 

A potential saving grace is her immediate supervisor's boss, who has a good working relationship and is more amenable to my sister's job search.

My sister doesn't have any other employers to reference (first job out of college), other than from her internship a few years ago. She can use her senior co-workers as references, but doesn't want to lose out on this great offer because of references. 

It might be relevant to add that the new job interview was done by the people she would be immediately working with, who were all young (early 30s) and seemed inexperienced with interviews.

7pp1gd,3,2018-01-11,The Value of Access in College and What It Might Mean for You.,MysticJAC,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7pp1gd/the_value_of_access_in_college_and_what_it_might/,"#Preamble

To start, I’m not writing this post as some kind of authoritative piece on the matter or anything like that.  It’s more to offer up a perspective for consideration by those folks who are currently in college or seeking out higher education from someone on the other side of it who has come to appreciate in the last decade what potential I squandered while there.  I say all of that to say, take what I’m writing (like most things on here) with a grain of salt.

#Introduction

With that out of the way, it is clear from reading post after post on this subreddit as well as reading article after article about “millennials” that a college education isn’t the silver bullet that our society has historically presented it to be.  I remember growing up with it being an assumption, not a choice or matter for discussion, that my goal after high school would be to go to college.  It didn’t matter if I was prepared for it.  It didn’t matter if I knew what I wanted to do there.  And, it especially didn’t matter what plan I had for myself once I completed college.  It was simply an axiom of my reality that college means a high-paying job, so questions of preparedness, utility, and purpose were pointless.  The problem, of course, is that those questions *aren’t* pointless because they inform the reality that college was never the true destination; the high-paying job was the destination.  I was never challenged to consider anything outside of the thought that a job would be magically bestowed upon me after four years of getting decent grades, creating barely memorable impressions on professors and managers at internships, and managing to not get a drinking ticket.  No doubt you know the next part of the story where I struggled for a year after graduation to find any kind of gainful employment.

Most people know this story.  It’s probably quite a bit like their own story.  I’d be wasting your time if I was trying to present it as some grand insight into the post-college graduate experience.  So, I won’t.  Instead I will bring up the more interesting side of the story: While I struggled and floundered with my STEM degree, my friends with their degrees in History and English were hired right out of school to jobs they found fulfilling and meaningful.  No, this won’t be some outlier tale of how well-rounded liberal arts students are somehow more valuable than people with STEM degrees.  It is a tale of an oh-so-smart STEM major who believed his genius, hard work ethic, and hard science skills would be so self-evident that he would never need to develop relationships with professors or hiring managers because they would magically be aware of his existence and want to give him a job.  Meanwhile, his liberal arts friends were getting their “pointless” degrees with their soft skills and trivia education, but in addition to class, they were talking to people.  Professors, coworkers, managers, research peers, CEO’s, CIO’s, CFO’s, presidents of this organization, thought leaders of that committee.  Whoever they could find.  Checking in regularly with them over four years and developing strong relationships that kept them in the minds of people who might be hiring at one point or another.  That oh-so-smart STEM major would turn his nose up to their “brown-nosing” and efforts to “cheat” their way into a job, wanting to get a job through true, red-blooded American hard work.  I guess I shouldn’t have started with the ending, but the result is that one (or many) of their connections over four years helped them get a job, while the STEM major wondered why no job offers appeared in an e-mail inbox no one knew existed.

#Talking about Access

I acknowledge to an extent that I’m not saying anything new: being well-connected and well-educated gives you a higher probability of finding employment than being poorly-connected and well-educated.  Yet, for this point being well-known, it seems like many of us fail to execute on it.  Part of this failure comes from the way we frame college like I describe above as this instant granting of a good job upon completion of four more years of education when, in practice, college is all about access.  Yes, access to higher educational resources, but also access to experts, access to internships, access to certain networks of people, access to funding sources, and so on.  So much of our early K-12 education emphasized the power and opportunity of knowledge alone that when we are evaluating our choice to go to college, more focus and attention is placed on simple attendance to gather that knowledge in the same way we did through primary school.  

From a historical perspective, we’re not totally off-base in that focus either because access to that knowledge in the past was highly restrictive.  No internet, incredibly rare to have college-educated parents, and college textbooks were hardly ubiquitous the way they are now unless you lived somewhere with a well-stocked library.  However, even then, getting the knowledge of a given professor at University was also about getting access to that professor.  Sure, it would have been cool learning about displacement and velocity in some 101 class from Professor Einstein, but if you were trying to get into physics research, the real hope was to build a relationship with him and perform for research for him or someone at his level he could connect you with.

That’s where we get into the real thing that I missed in college: access to the people and opportunities for making the jump to my next step after college.  As I continue to build my network now, it’s mind-boggling to me the opportunities I squandered to get linked up with so many people who could have helped me (and I could have helped as well), which is even crazier considering I had daily access to so many of them for four years when these days I struggle to bump into like-minded people at annual conferences to make such connections.  The most obvious case was professors and failing to make effective use of their office hours was certainly one area, never going to ask about their research or anything like that.  However, it was also not taking advantage of the many, many, many fellowships, internships, and grants that are pretty much designed with the purpose of making your presence at a company (despite relative lack of skills and education) a cost-effective venture while giving you access to that company’s staff and knowledge.  I did actually do a fellowship and internship while in school (the only reasons I likely got a job after college), but even in them, I didn’t make the effort to connect with people.  Exchange numbers.   Exchange e-mails.  Follow up with them to see how this project or that initiative went after I left.  

The same goes for my classmates and peers.  I didn’t need to be best friends with them in order to maintain a professional relationship, yet that’s the mentality I carried.  I had access to people who I know now have gone down some pretty cool and interesting paths, and if I had squandered my access to them back then, I might have had a few more options regarding my own path.  Meanwhile, it would be equally cool to bring some of those people I already know and trust onto my path.

#Okay, But What Do I Do?

I could go on and on with examples of access, but I feel like I’ve described enough of the problem to start discussing the solutions and considerations I’d like you to take away:

1.	When evaluating if a particular college will be worthwhile for you, it is critical to think about what kind of access this college provides you and how you will make use of that access.  If it is only access to knowledge and a piece of paper with your name on it, then I’d ask you to search around this subreddit a bit and see just how well things work out for people who only leave school with a degree.  

2.	Look at the professors who would be available to you and figure out how they get you where you want to go.  For example, if they don’t have much in the way of active research or attendance at conferences, then while they might be a great lecturer, they likely aren’t going to be able to pick up a phone for you and help you out when Senior year rolls around.

3.	Look at the internships available to you in your area or that would be in the realm of possibility.  I’m not trying to knock community college because I think it can be a cost-effective way to get a higher education that can open certain doors, but if you are taking classes in the middle of nowhere such that you likely won’t have access to internships, then you need to factor that point into your decision to enroll.  Or, more to the point, you may need to be targeted in your selection of major to ensure what you are studying can be relevant to companies you might try to seek out during your time at school, i.e. going to school for Construction Management would be a great idea if you know of several solid firms in your area, but perhaps a much more difficult idea if those firms aren’t there.

4.	Look at the opportunities to link up with classmates.  Similar to community colleges, I’m not trying to knock commuter or online courses, but if you’re not having a chance to connect with your peers (and professors for that matter), then you do need to evaluate if the cost is worth not having a network growing alongside you like if you went to a traditional in-person course.

5.	Look at the opportunities your current company or other companies provide for people who do get their degrees.  If your current company doesn’t have a pathway of access to that next level of employment, then I would re-evaluate getting a degree on the basis of your company recognizing your achievement or start working out your plan to find employment elsewhere.

6.	I know some of these things are coming across as elitist or ignorant of people’s personal circumstances, like needing to work through school, but in many ways, my talk of access goes back to my original point of the end goal being a better job, not a degree.  There’s too many people in a crisis on here who are worse off for having gotten a degree because they spent all of this money to get the knowledge and paper, but ultimately their circumstances didn’t allow them to use that time in college to get more access to the next level of jobs.  Sure, it might mean they now meet the requirements of a new array of jobs, and getting a degree at all still remains a remarkable achievement in its own right. However, with college becoming less about recognition of your strong intellectual capacities and more about being a four-year warm-up for the working world, it seems all the more critical to weigh this major investment against the true access within the world that this investment provides.

**TL;DR – Get the most out of your college experience by taking advantage of every resource, including people, they have rather than treating it like a much freer, yet more expensive continuation of high school like I did.**

So about 6 months ago, I took a job with Tata Consultancy Services in Cincinnati. At the time, I didn’t know much about them when I took the job, and being depressed due to not being able to get an internship and having a non-CS degree, I just took the first job that came to me (the only other offer that came to me around that time being a COBOL job). Now, after joining them, reading the horror stories about them on this subreddit (and others), and being lied to and being put on a production support project where I do nothing all day while I am at work, I am beginning to worry about my future career prospects and whether or not I will ever get another job as a software developer again.

So, any thoughts? Will I be able to get another software developer job in my life or should I give up? I have already began to look for new jobs, but I am not finding much where I am living, and not wanting to relocate from where I am. It just keeps adding to the worry."

Well, as the title states, I am a freshman student in Computer Science. I would eventually like to be a software engineer or game developer, or one then the other. Basically, I have some questions that I would like to ask some of you who have more experience in working in the field. I know that some questions similar to these may have been asked, but I could not find exactly what I am looking for, but if I am wrong then shoot me down now.

1) I have a basic resume, but it does not really include any CS projects that I have worked on outside of classes. The problem is, I have trouble coming up with ideas for fun and interesting projects. How can I go about getting ideas for side projects?

2) Since I am a freshman, I know I do not have the best chances of landing an internship until next summer, but what stands out on a resume when they are so many other candidates?

3) I live in the Eastern US, and I feel that finding a job/internship nearby may be a bit more challenging than in some areas. Should I look into doing remote internships/jobs in the future, until I am out of college and can move to those locations, or just go for broke?

4) What other advice would you give someone like me? I am eager to learn new things, and I know 100% that this is the field I can see myself in. I'll take all advice to heart.

Thank you all."

7ppwb5,8,2018-01-11,"Hate working in an office, any other options?",Arancium,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ppwb5/hate_working_in_an_office_any_other_options/,"So I have accepted a multi-part co-op working at a software development firm. My job will consist of writing test scripts to run in a VM overnight. I started Monday and I already hate it. The office is dimly lit (multiple lights in the ceiling are not on), a lot of layoffs mean that a lot of the cubicles surrounding mine are empty and the people that remain seem to be low energy and stressed, and to top it all off, my first 4 days have been nothing but watching training videos. I cannot stand one more day of it. Its gotten me to the point where I feel mentally ill, breaking down to some friends and family. The conclusion I can draw is I hate the eight hour a day schedule working in an office.

This is not my first office job. When I was in chemical engineering, I got a summer internship working in a firm where my job was using software to update technical drawings, nothing really that involved what I was learning in school. This office space was the opposite of my current one, people were cheerful, the lighting was excellent, I had a window right next to my cubicle. The work I did there wasn't too bad (seeing what chemical engineers do dissuaded me from becoming one), but even then, I felt trapped in the office, I wanted to leave as soon as I clocked in. 

I like the CS major, in fact I love it. The class projects we work on and the languages I learn are both fulfilling and fun to me. However, I feel that if the only jobs in this field require me to work in an office, I need to switch again.

So some feedback would be nice, am I doomed to this life of working 8-5 in an office for the rest of my life if I graduate with this major, or does anyone know of a viable alternative that I can follow if I want to stick with the major?"

Some background for help here: I'm a first year student who is classified as a sophomore and looking at possible minors to add to my education (I do know the general consensus about minors here). I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering and am taking all my tech electives, and some extra classes, in the Aerospace department because that is what my true passion is. I am also involved with 2 engineering clubs and have my 2nd internship secured (the 1st one was hardly an internship IMO)

I joined Mechanical for the job prospects after a long time of internal debate, and honestly I don't see it hindering my career goals. My trouble comes from the fact that because my school has a bachelors degree for aerospace, they don't let you concentrate in that area. I'm subverting this by taking roughly 10 classes through the Aerospace department to further my understanding of those concepts. I am also looking at pursuing a minor in Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE). Currently my course load for my remaining 3 years will be at 18 credits per semester (the cap for undergrads). 

On to the questions:

* 1. On a resume, should I list that I have a mechanical degree with a concentration/focus in Aerospace or would that be frowned upon?
* 2. Should I extend graduation prospects for a semester or year to gain more experience, help my gpa if I fail a class, and lower my credit load? If I did, I'd probably also be able to add a minor in Computer Science, which I've heard can be quite useful in the Aerospace market.

If questions similar to these have already been asked, I'm sorry. I looked but couldn't find anything."

During the summer of 2016, I was working tech support for a city, basically supporting white collars with computer problems and maintaining the servers. We were a small IT team of 4. Our manager (who is VERY knowledgeable as he was a technician for a good amount of years before being promoted), the technician that was there before me, the intern, and yours truly.

Our printers were being pushed out by GPO based on the AD OU. 

&amp;nbsp;

One day, one user calls me saying all his printers disappeared. I walked up to their desk and confirmed they were gone. Ran gpupdate but still no printers. I confirmed the printer GPO was being applied correctly. I ran gpupdate /force and the printers came back on, but disappeared again shortly after. I had to add the printers manually. Problem fixed, I thought. 

&amp;nbsp;

As i get back to my desk we start being bombarded with calls of everyone having the same problem. We figured this couldn't be local to the user's machine. Me and $manager are going frantically through our GPO's to try and figure out the problem. We even created new GPO's. The event logs were silent on our domain controller. 

We thought we had the situation under control by the end of our shift. Boy, were we ever wrong!

&amp;nbsp;

Queue the next morning, and the same problem occurs. We run frantically around the office, remoting to the other sites we have (Library, Arena, etc.) to fix the problem on whoever's reporting the problem. Certain users weren't affected, however. The other tech is looking through logs of our domain controller frantically trying to pinpoint the cause of the issue.


Lunch time comes by and I'm browsing a news source by myself at the office and I stumble on an article about a Windows update that b0rked printer deployment via GPO. Confirmed the computers had the Windows update were affected and informed the other technician, who was responsible for our WSUS server. Once the troublesome update was removed, all our printer woes went away.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR Browsing the web during lunch hour can be productive!"

So, long story short here is I'm stuck in a dead-end working a unique support job and I want to make the move into an actual IT setting but need to hammer out the details on what I need and what to even do. 

To give an idea of my situation:

* I have an associate's in Comp Sci with a focus in Networking. Bachelor's degree is completely out of the question at this time for a lot of reasons I won't get into here. Yes I want it eventually but no, it's not happening anytime soon.
* No formal experience in an actual IT role within a corporation.
* I am a former computer repair technician from Geek Squad, with 2 years experience, fixed consumer electronics and computers, everything bleeding edge, loved it, but it did not pay the bills and I wanted to move up from this anyways.
* I am currently a work-from-home support agent for various retail stores, and I help their callers with suggestions/policy on how to take care of their customers, and how to work the internal systems they use, no actual work with the Windows system or Active Directory. High volume call center, and we case everything, 40-130 calls daily depending on time of year and issues. Sometimes I perform the role of Lv. 1 support for some of those internal systems and submit tickets. 2yrs exp.
* I have good references up the wazoo, every boss I've had has loved my work ethic and skills, but my personal weakness is not having a strong network and not being very good with small talk or making friends that would get me into things. I don't make enemies, I just don't really get close with folks enough for them to pay me mind.
* I was A+ certified but it lapsed, no other certifications. I am open to them but have price limits.
* I am a father and husband and I cannot jump around on temporary contracts, or part time positions that cannot pay the bills, or free internships. I need a full time position.
* I can knock out a good resume, so not worried about this.
* I have toyed around with administration and development at home. I like both and even have a little bit of front end programming down and toyed with Active Directory a tiny bit and can Google my way through Powershell scripting. Maybe I'll go there eventually, maybe not. I don't know. I have a lot of experience with Linux as well and used it for a long time as my main operating system.

So, knowing that:

* My job is a specialized dead end. It's not a bad job and it's convenient, but I don't want to do this forever and I can't move on because I work a remote position for a company that is halfway across the nation that is only just barely supporting remote positions for very limited roles, which excludes my skillset and where I want to go. My family and I are grounded here so relocation is out of the question. There are no branches in my state. They just laid off a bunch of remote folks from another unrelated role. I want out. I can't make the jump without something to land on.
* I love technical work and solving problems. I actually like people even if I don't talk much, and I like fixing their situations, and I'm good at getting to the heart of their issue and knowing what needs to be done and figuring out the real problem and fixing that problem. It gets me out of bed in the morning. It feels good. I'm smiling writing this, man. lol.
* I love fixing technology and computers. I built my own machine, and I've saved countless consumer electronics from a dumpster, recycle bin, or a POS return. I enjoy messing around with settings, tweaking things to work the way they should, and I whoop malware's ass. I've cracked open and fixed laptops and devices other technicians were too scared to go into or thought were unrepairable. Command line and terminal are my bros and Google is my wingman.
* I want to finally get into IT. I envisioned that as a goal before I even started being a computer technician. I want to work for a stable company supporting its userbase on a daily basis. In office or at home, either is fine, but I need a serious, grown-up, actual IT role, not another specialist role working on customized systems whose experience I can't do much with. I am also learning nothing about it where I am now, and I don't have a way to partner up with them for shadowing because I'm remote, and I don't have that very critical actual experience that every recruiter wants 5,000 years of, so I am somewhat flying into this on my own two wings and have a vague idea in my head of where I will land.
* My thought for this career change is desktop support, and just branching out from there, either upwards into higher tiers, or into another subfield within IT if I like it more. I feel like I already would be a good fit for this, and I don't mind if it isn't perfectly tailored to my strong suits and a little different from my expectations, but the problem is how. I can slap a resume and cover letter together and gather references easy peasy but I know this isn't always an easy field to get into and I want to be prepared. Stupidly prepared. I want to go to a company, my eventual company, and wow their socks off if they're a good fit.

Now for the actual question, what do I need? I need a good company, I need my resume and cover letter and references, I know that much. I am thinking of going for Network+. Would this be a waste? Are there any specific, addressable gaps that you know of that I can work on? Anything I should study up on or work on beforehand? Any positions that also seem worth looking into? Am I just crazy? Do I write too much text? Halp!"

One of the goals I had over break was to find an internship opportunity, but to my dismay, I found that many companies were only looking for students going into their Junior or Senior year. So after asking some of my older friends who were engineers, they said that the only way I could get an internship was by knowing someone who could put in a good word for me. Luckily, I knew a lot of engineers through being an Eagle Scout. I considered contacting them, but after skimming through their Linkedin profiles and doing a few google searches I quickly found out how boring their companies work sounded to me and how uninterested I would be interning for them.

So, after all this, I have come to the faithful and more experienced Engineering students reddit where I hope I can get a couple of opinions on some questions I have come up with.


Should I apply for Engineering internships that interest me even if they say only Juniors and Seniors should apply?

Should I be appreciative of any internship opportunity I get after my Freshmen year, even if I don't think I'll enjoy it?

If yes, should I be concerned about whether I am being paid or not when receiving the internship?

Should I give up on getting an internship this summer and just go back to my usual manual labor summer job?

How important are internships to companies when getting a job? Should this be my largest concern or should I focus on other things such as building up other skills that are important to engineering?


When it comes to internships I have a bit of weight to throw around, I'm smart (during school I work as a math tutor and I have a 3.688 GPA and with the hardest part of my year behind me I am confident that will only go up), I am reliable (like I said I am an Eagle Scout and have had multiple jobs where my employers really liked me), and most importantly I am confident and ambitious, if you couldn't tell.

Finally, if you are an engineer looking for an intern in the greater Chicago area PM me :D

Thanks for the help in advance!

EDIT: Thanks so much for all the comments, this has been really insighful and helpful. I will start applying for internships as soon as possible, thank you again!"

Will I regret not taking the money once I'm in grad school? The internship pays a ton, but averaged over 5+ years of grad school it doesn't come out to much (about $350/month after tax).

Another factor is that I've previously done an internship at a hedge fund, and I have most of those earnings saved."

This is going to be a long post so please bear with me. I am currently attending a Jr. College and about to get my Associates of Science in the spring semester, then going to a university to get a bachelors in CS. I have taken some very very basic Java and C++ courses and really love problem solving and figuring out the best way to write codes. No one in my family has any kind of CS experience and I don't really know anyone with experience so I'm kind of lost. I'm going to school full time and I currently work part time in a sales job that I hate. I guess my first question would be does anyone have recommendations for a job that I could work at now to help me get a leg up? (I'm thinking something like Geek Squad, part time). Other than getting a degree what else can I do now to help me learn more? And then finally I guess, when is the right time to look for internships?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!  "

My university is one of many in the DMV/DC area, so you would assume it has a lot of connections. Well, that depends. 


Are you in Computer Science or Cybersecurity? Have fun at DHS! 


Are you in political science, or literally any other degree program? Sorry... we can't help you :(


That's how it feels. As a friend of mine who graduated last year ""the administration is like a chicken with its head cut off"".


I'm not asking to get into Georgetown SFS, but for fuck's sake I feel like as someone entering my sophomore spring semester I have zero resolve to continue to junior year here. It feels like a mental prison. It feels like, professionally and socially, this school is designed to take in money from international students and offer the student body at large nothing in return except a piece of paper and shiny buildings. We don't have an incubator (like almost every other school in the region), we don't have any semblance of a diverse community, and nothing to foster either. 


The few clubs the school has barely meet, or don't advertise, and so the only real tangible social outlet people have is sports. I feel lost. I feel like on the one hand I should be blessed to have gotten into this school, but on the other that I utterly fucked up in that I chose the most isolated school. At least Mason has *some* world-class faculty to use for internship networking...


I know I'm going back this next semester, I need to to get my GPA up. After that... do I transfer? Do I stay and suffer for 2 years trying to take advantage of whatever small opportunities might come my way? I'm scared that I'll get out of here having to compete with grads from Georgetown and GW and in comparison have the most paltry CV you've ever seen not out of a lack of trying but due to lack of tangible opportunity. 


How do I stop worrying about this shit?:'(

I have a 4.0 GPA but no CS internships (tried and it just didn't pan out). I took a huge interest in machine learning/data science/computer vision while in school so would love to go into that field. I took a few classes with the professor who specialized in this area, and he contacted me shortly after graduation saying that he was looking for a PhD student, and he thought I had a lot of potential. The program would be free with a yearly modest stipend, and will last ~3 years. It would start in a few months.

The thing is, I wasn't considering a PhD at this time. I was excited to work! But I have no idea how hard it will be to find a job in this field. I had considered getting a PhD later on for an academic track and eventual professorship, but now I feel that I should consider it. The professor has significant influence over who gets into the program and has basically singled me out as a good candidate, and has offered to help with my application. I actually love the idea of doing research, but I'm also sort of burnt out on school. I came from a different background and have been in school for a few years to get my MS. This also means I have no work experience with software engineering. 

If it makes any difference, I'm a U.S. citizen and female (have encountered a lot of affirmative action portions of applications, though tbh not sure if it helps or hurts to answer them). I also have a very strong visual media/writing background (which, again, I'm not sure whether helps or hurts my application).

So I'm pretty certain I want to go into data science. I've heard really mixed things about the job market, but overall that it can be very competitive for this field. I see a lot of ""Masters/PhD Preferred"" so I imagine the PhD would be more preferred, especially with published papers. But also that it takes a lot of determination to get through a PhD. If I got accepted and I commit to it, I would certainly give it 100%. I guess my question is mostly how desirable or necessary is it for me?

Background on my insight into the college admissions process

I've conducted somewhere around 25 alumni interviews for the University of Chicago, evaluating applicants for admission. I also evaluated hundreds of interview reports when I read and evaluated over 600 applications for admission to UChicago in 2012 and 2013. I am currently an admissions reader for Berkeley! As a college admissions consultant, I've used all this insight to help dozens of my students prepare for their own college admissions interviews. Most students, with some preparation and insight into the interview process, can ace their interviews. Without preparation, however, I often see students really struggle to converse articulately with an adult, convey their passions effectively, and make a good impression.

So without further ado, here's my advice:

**What sort of insights interviewers hope to uncover**

* Who are you and what do you value in life?
* Will you be a presence in the classroom? Are you enthusiastic about learning and intellectually engaged?
* Will you be a good roommate and active participant in various organizations on campus?
* Are you teachable, thoughtful, more collaborative than competitive?
* How interested are you in attending this particular university? How knowledgeable are you about this university’s offerings? How do you believe this university’s curriculum is a good fit for your educational goals?

**Criteria by which you are judged**

Using UChicago’s interview form as a guideline, here are the sorts of things for which your interview will be judged:

* Do you demonstrate intellectual curiosity?
* Are you motivated to learn for learning’s sake (as opposed to being a “grade grubber” [someone who begs a teacher for a higher grade just in search of a perfect GPA] or compelled by parents to succeed)?
* Are you open to exploring new ideas and perspectives different from your own?
* Do you think for yourself and question the world around you?
* Are you open-minded? Do you value being part of a diverse community in college?
* Are you confident in your own abilities and comfortable with yourself? Can you engage in discussion with an interviewer in a mature, self-aware, and poised manner?
* Are you a good “fit” for this university’s community? (NOTE: “Fit” is defined differently by different universities, so glean from a university’s website what characteristics they hold highly.)
* Are you knowledgeable about this particular university’s curriculum, majors, programs, culture, traditions, and extracurricular activities?
* Can you cite specific reasons for wanting to attend this university, as opposed to just saying it’s a “top college” or “highly ranked”?
* Have you demonstrated any leadership?
* Are you deeply involved in one or more extracurricular activities? Do you pursue that activity out of true passion or merely a desire to “look good on college applications”? Will you pursue that activity on this college’s campus?
* Will you be a good roommate and classmate?
* Did you make an overall good impression?

**Questions you might be asked**

Google “questions asked in a college interview” and you’ll find many resources. Since many different people are leading these interviews, questions asked can vary wildly. Some interviewers will steer interviews in one direction, while other interviewers who value different qualities will steer their interviews in a different direction. You could get an interviewer who loves to chat, or one who is solely interested in your answers and provides little feedback about your answers or anecdotes about their specific college experience.

As such, come prepared to answer a variety of questions. Here are some questions you might be asked. I recommend you prepare natural answers (don’t respond as if you have rehearsed) to these questions:

**Question:** Tell me about yourself. **Don’t say:** “Well, um, my name is Rebecca. I go to Stevenson Creek High School, and I’m a rising senior.” Your interviewer knows all of that already! Jump straight into your passions. If possible, mention an accomplishment, strength, character trait, or skill set you’ve honed. **Do say:** Instead of saying, “Well, I started my own cupcake business,” tell them about your greatest accomplishment with your business: “I am incredibly passionate about pursuing business in college, stemming from the business I started freshman year, selling cupcakes. I scaled the business from merely selling at sporting events to now having my cupcakes sold in 15 local grocery stores and 20k revenue each year in online sales.” Instead of saying, “I am captain of the Varsity Cheer team and I volunteer with the organization Amy’s Friends, say: “As captain of the Varsity Cheer team, I spend a lot of my time helping my teammates reach their full potential in mastering our routines. That desire to help others grow is also what compels me to volunteer with an organization called Amy’s Friends, where I help developmentally disabled kids learn social skills.”

**Question:** What classes do you enjoy and why? **Don’t say:** “Math” or any other one-worded answers. **Do say:** Mention the subject you love, but go into detail about why you love it. If you developed that passion over time, tell the interviewer who or what sparked your interest in the subject (a teacher, a documentary you watched, a club you joined, etc.). If possible, give a 30 second anecdote about a memorable moment from that class, or tell the interviewer about your desire to pursue that subject in college. “I used to really despise math as a child, as I found it incredibly difficult to master. However, my freshman year geometry teacher was phenomenal, and not only taught me how to understand difficult mathematical concepts, but also gave me the confidence to pursue math at the honors level. Now, I’m considering majoring or minoring in math in college.” Or, “I’ve always been a voracious reader, so naturally my favorite subject is English. I particularly loved an assignment my junior year where we got to choose our own book to read and present to our class. While my classmates chose the shortest books possible, I tackled East of Eden, which I found fascinating. Now, John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors.”

**Question:** Which classes do you find to be the most difficult and why? **Don’t say:** “I hate history” or “English sucks” or “Chem, ‘cause I got a C in it.” **Do say:** Pick a subject you actually enjoy but still find challenging. “Although I found AP US History to be incredibly challenging as my first ever AP class, I am really glad I took it. Not only did it make me a better writer, but I am better able to engage with modern-day social issues as a result of knowing groundbreaking court decisions such as Roe v. Wade and Brown v. Board of Education.”

**Question:** Are there any current events that you feel strongly about? **Don’t say:** “Yeah, Trump sucks” or “A few months ago I attended a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville!” Unless you’re president of the Democrats or Republicans club, try to steer clear of politics in your discussions, as it’s hard to gauge your interviewer’s political leanings and you don’t want to get into an argument. If you are incredibly active in a politically affiliated club, try to gauge your interviewer’s reaction before launching into political discussions, and always stay polite no matter their political stance. **Do say:** Brush up on some local news, such as your state’s decision to ban smoking in public places or your town’s decision to put a tax on plastic bags at stores. If possible, connect the issue to your activities, experiences, or desired major. For example, “I am frustrated by our state’s recent defunding of arts education programs. As an artist and musician, I benefitted immensely as a child from free art and music workshops in my community that were offered to low-income kids, such as myself. It really saddens me that other kids in my community won’t have the chance to pursue art, theater, and music, which is why I’ve requested my NHS chapter volunteer to teach arts to low-income kids this year.”

**Question:** What do you dislike and wish to change about high school? How would you go about changing your school (or have you already began to change it)? **Don’t say:** Avoid anything too negative about your school, like “our Spanish teachers suck” or “My classmates will throw anyone under the bus in pursuit of an A.” **Do say:** You can be authentic in your answers, however. If your Spanish teachers are terrible, say: “I wish our Spanish program was a little stronger. If I could change this about my school, I would hire natively speaking teachers who are incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about teaching. One thing that I have done to supplement my own Spanish education is meet every other week with a foreign exchange student from Spain. I help her practice her English while she helps me practice my Spanish.” Or, “I wish my classmates were less obsessed with getting a perfect GPA. I want to be surrounded by students who love to learn and do so not in pursuit of a flawless college application but for the sole appreciation of a well-rounded education. To be honest, I’m not sure how to go about changing my classmates’ approach to learning, but in college I hope to volunteer to tutor kids; doing so will enable me to spark a love for learning in kids from a young age.”

**Question:** What do you want from your college experience? **Don’t say:** Something generic that applies to all universities, such as “I’m eager to live on my own,” or “I can’t wait to join a sorority.” **Do say:** Tie whatever you’re looking forward to most about college to their university. If you want to major in history, say: “I want to be surrounded by diverse perspectives that challenge my own way of thinking. As an aspiring history major, I especially want to learn about history as it applies to the modern day. In investigating Northwestern’s history department, I found a cool class called ‘Race, Sexuality, and the Politics of Protest.’ I think the course will not only teach me about history, but will introduce me to diverse perspectives applicable to today’s society.”

**Question:** What is your favorite book? **Don’t say:** “Hah, I hate reading.” **Do say:** For some of you who love reading, it will be challenging to pick just one favorite book. For the rest of you who hate reading or never have the time in your busy schedules to read for pleasure, pick a book you’ve read in class, such as The Great Gatsby, The Crucible, etc. Don’t say you don’t enjoy reading, you haven’t read for fun since you were 12, Diary of a Wimpy Kid (or another book from childhood), Harry Potter, or “Does watching Game of Thrones count?” When you reference a book, ask them if they have read it and, if they haven’t, give them a short synopsis. Tell them one or two things you liked about the book, from a particular character to the author’s use of symbols to advance the story, to even the style of narration.

**Question:** What did you learn from participating in/leading [a specific extracurricular]? **Don’t say:** Avoid anything overtly negative about the extracurricular, i.e. that your dad forced you to do it. **Do say:** Talk about the challenges you’ve overcome, such as getting cut from the softball team sophomore year but trying out again junior year after a hard year of training. Talk about the leadership experience you’ve gained, like recruiting 5 kids to join the debate team, or welcoming incoming freshmen to your high school as an orientation leader. Hone in on the skills you’ve gained, your accomplishments, the lessons you’ve learned, and the character traits you’ve forged. If you have concrete details, like how you shaved off time from your 400 meter dash after a summer of intense training, the money you personally raised for a fundraiser, or the number of students who joined your club in its inaugural year, include that information.

**Question:** Of all the highly selective schools out there, why [university]? **Don’t say:** “It’s so highly ranked!” or “I love the prestige of Harvard” or “Well, my mom is an alumni” (the last one’s doubly bad, for it’s also grammatically incorrect. Your mom’s an alumna, your dad’s an alumnus, and your parents are alumni). **Do say:** Be specific into what makes that university special. Do your homework before the interview and research your desired major, the school’s curriculum (like Columbia’s core curriculum or Brown’s open curriculum), unique programs (such as pre-professional, internship, or study abroad programs). Think about what differentiates this university from any others. Perhaps hone in on their mission (Jesuit schools such as Georgetown, for example, focus on service and justice for all, whereas NYU values global experiences). If your parent is an alum, mention something specific about their experience as it relates to your future experience, if accepted. Instead of, “My dad really valued his education at Tufts,” say, “My dad raves about Tufts’ interdisciplinary learning. I’ll take advantage of that opportunity for interdisciplinary learning by exploring both between schools and within them. Although I plan on majoring in engineering, I’m also passionate about drama, and I love how Tufts will let me explore drama as a minor and the surprising ways I can apply the discipline to my study of engineering.”

**Question:** What most excites you about [university]? **Don’t say:** “The PoliSci program is really great.” **Do say:** “The opportunity to study under great thought-leaders in the political science department, such as Professor Selma Hershenberger. I’m amazed that I can learn from someone who was the former U.S. ambassador to Egypt.” Include specifics that prove you’ve carefully researched the university and know precisely why that university is a great choice for you.

**Question:** What classes would you be interested in taking at [university]? **Don’t say:** “Well, as a biology major, I’m really looking forward to Yale’s biology classes.” **Do say:** Research a couple classes before your interview. You don’t necessarily need to memorize them, but it would be great if you could memorize some of the topics. Talk excitedly about a class you discovered on the history of pirates or a class where you listen to and analyze rap lyrics through the Race and Ethnic Studies department. Try to pick classes that you won’t easily find at other schools. Thus, skip talking about “Intro to Engineering” and instead focus on one of the courses you’d take as a major in your fourth year. Electives are usually much more fascinating and much more unique from school to school. Question: If you could choose anyone—alive or dead—with whom to have a discussion, who would you choose? Don’t say: Try to avoid cliches, such as Albert Einstein, “my grandma,” Donald Trump, Tupac, etc. Well, maybe Tupac isn’t a cliched answer for this question in a college interview, but it will certainly make your class of ‘59 interviewer choke on his tea. Do say: It could be wise for you to pick someone relatively unknown in history, except for a niche field about which you know a lot. That way, you can inform your interviewer about this person and why a discussion with him or her would be illuminative to you, without facing rapid-fire questions by a die-hard fan of the person. Oh, and speaking of “illuminative to you,” make sure you have a reason for why you want to talk to this person. What would you discuss? How would that discussion fundamentally impact your view of the world? If the person is alive, would you take the opportunity to convince that other person of something (such as your desire to meet with your state Senator to convince her of pursuing more funding for a cause dear to your heart)?

**Question:** Who is your greatest role model? **Don’t say:** “My mom,” “my dad,” “my grandpa,” etc., unless you have an incredibly good reason for saying so (i.e. they overcame a formidable hardship and fundamentally impacted how you think, feel, or view the world). Likewise, it’s best to avoid cliched answers, such as people currently in the public eye, politicians, celebrities, etc. **Do say:** Let’s say your mom really is the most wonderful role model you know. You can choose her as your answer to this question, but you must be clear about how her life’s circumstances and her courageous attitude has forged some quality or dream within you. For example, I have a student whose mother is battling ALS, a disease of the nervous system that is sadly fatal. Her mother’s condition has influenced my student’s passion for medicine; she knows she won’t ever get the opportunity to save her mother’s life, as ALS is too fast-progressing, but she wants to save the lives of other people who, in the future, develop the disease. That’s a pretty powerful thing to say in an interview, so situations like these absolutely trump my “avoid saying a relative” rule. Generally, good choices would be pioneers in your desired industry, people making a difference in your local community, etc. The more personal you can get for why that person is your role model, the better. How did that person influence how you think, feel, or view the world?

**Question:** What do you want to major in? Why? **Don’t say:** “Computer Science, because it’s a practical career choice.” Avoid saying you want to major in something because it is practical, will make you a lot of money, or because your parents want you to be a doctor. Also, don’t say, “Eh, I’m decided. I really have no clue what I want to study.” **Do say:** Why you’re passionate about the subject, what you’ve done to prepare for/explore the subject inside and outside of the classroom, how you hope to pursue the subject in college (specifically at their university, referencing specific professors or classes), and what you hope to do for a career. It’s okay if you’re undecided in your major. Say you’re undecided, but then talk about what wide-ranging fields you’d like to explore. “While I’m undecided in a major, I am curious about psychology, sociology, and maybe even neuroscience. How the brain works and why people make the decisions they do really intrigues me, so I could see myself majoring in one of those subjects.”

**Question:** How have you prepared for such a major inside and outside of the classroom? **Don’t say:** “Well, I’ve taken Honors Geometry, Honors Algebra 2 Trig, AP Calc BC, and AP Statistics to prepare for a math major.” Well, say that, but then go a step further. **Do say:** “Well, I’ve taken Honors Geometry, Honors Algebra 2 Trig, AP Calc BC, and AP Statistics to prepare for a math major. I also tutor math to freshmen at my high school, and am part of Math Olympiad, where I’ve helped my team win 2nd place at regionals. I’ve also researched how I would explore math at Harvard, and really think I could learn a lot from the Ahlfors Lecture Series.” If you haven’t had the opportunity to explore your desired major outside of the classroom in formal extracurricular activities, cite some of the reading you’ve done on the major, and what you found fascinating about what you learned. “While there are few opportunities in my community to pursue anthropology inside or outside of the classroom, I’ve studied people, culture, and history through many different capacities. For example, my history, foreign language, and literature classes in high school have introduced me to different cultures, perspectives, and modes of thought. And in Debate, I’ve delved into anthropology through debating both sides of various current events.”

**Question:** What are some of the biggest challenges you have faced in life and how have you overcome them? **Don’t say:** “I’m pretty privileged, so I haven’t really experienced any challenges.” And don’t open a can of worms by saying, “Well, my dad is abusive.” **Do say:** Not every student has overcome a big challenge in life—and that’s great that you’ve been so fortunate. If this applies to you, you can answer the question in one of two ways. 1) Focus on a little challenge you’ve overcome, like not making the play when you auditioned freshman year, so you joined the Speech Team instead. 2) Admit that you’ve been fortunate enough to haven’t experienced many challenges, and describe how you’ve worked to eliminate challenges for others. For example, “I’ve been really fortunate enough to grow up in a supportive family, school, and community. That supportive upbringing has made me want to support others, so I am a mentor in Big Brothers, Big Sisters and am partnered with a very smart little girl who is from an underprivileged background.” Let’s say, in contrast, you’ve experience some significant life challenges, such as abuse, homelessness, coming out, racism, mental health issues, physical health issues, learning disabilities, death in the family, having a child at a young age, difficulty immigrating, parents’ divorce, etc., don’t drop that information on your interviewer as if they are your therapist. That being said, you can absolutely talk about it. For example, “I didn’t have the easiest childhood, but I’m proud of who I’ve become. Because my mother suffered from mental health issues, she wasn’t always a positive presence in my life and I had to take care of my three younger siblings. I started working at 12 years old to put food on the table, doing everything I can to make sure my brother and sisters have every opportunity they would have had if our mother had been more supportive.” This student mentions the biggest challenge she’s faced in a really mature manner—stating the facts (mother suffers from mental health issues, student had to get a job at a very young age) but not dumping private details on the unsuspecting interviewer. Focus on how you’ve become a better person as a result of this experience, even if the experience was incredibly, incredibly hard on you. Explain how you’ve become more empathetic towards others’ struggles, you’re an advocate for those who don’t have a voice, you’ve become more mature, you are independently motivated to achieve your goals, etc.

**Question:** What three qualities best describe you? (Or, “What are your strengths?”) **Don’t say:** “Hardworking, perfectionist, motivated.” Avoid cliches and don’t be repetitive with your adjectives. **Do say:** Find a less common synonym. Instead of “hardworking,” for example, say “methodical,” as it is less commonly used. Instead of three adjectives to describe the same character trait, describe different facets of who you are. If you’re struggling to even find adjectives to describe yourself, Google “100 adjectives to describe yourself in an interview” and write down every single one that applies to you. From there, whittle down the ones that only loosely apply until you have 5-10 adjectives that definitely apply to you. Cross out any cliched answers, and then pick 3-5 adjectives that describe different parts of who you are. Have a top 3 and then 2 more in reserve in case the interviewer asks for 5 adjectives. Don’t just list those adjectives, either, but in a short sentence describe why that adjective applies to you, how that adjective has encouraged you to accomplish something, or how you forged that adjective over time.

**Question:** What are your weaknesses? **Don’t say:** Anything unfiltered, like “I am addicted to video games” or “I procrastinate a lot.” **Do say:** Admit an actual weakness (no one likes someone who veils a strength in a weakness, such as “Some people say I work so hard”). However, describe how you’re overcoming that weakness. Better yet, pick a weakness you’ve actually overcome. For example, “In junior high, I got good grades with little effort. My freshman year of high school, that posed a problem because I procrastinated, thinking I could easily pull off an A with little effort. I quickly realized that wasn’t the case so worked to overcome my tendency to procrastinate by planning ahead, sticking to my self-imposed deadlines, and studying for exams a few days away. Now, I’m confident that I won’t let this weakness hinder me as I transition to college.”

**Question:** Describe a time when you experienced a setback. How did you respond? **Don’t say:** “Getting a D in English made me realize that I don’t want to study English ever again.” **Do say:** You can admit a setback, but focus on how that setback has made you more determined to achieve than ever. “Struggling to do well in English class really demonstrated to me where my reading and writing skills were lacking. Instead of getting frustrated and shutting down, I approached my English teacher and discussed with him the ways in which I could dig deeper in my analyses of our reading assignments to better understand themes and symbols. I also partnered with the best English student in my class; she helped peer edit my writing assignments, while I tutored her in chemistry so we mutually benefitted. This experience not only taught me the benefit of hard work and perseverance, but also the value of forging strong relationships with my teachers and classmates.”

**Question:** What is your greatest accomplishment? **Don’t say:** Don’t list esoteric award titles that wouldn’t make sense to a layperson. **Do say:** Instead of “I won a Mustang award for Honors English,” say, “I was really proud when my teacher awarded me the top student award from among 60 students in Honors English. It made all my hard work, raising my grade from a B to an A in one semester, worth it.” Even if you don’t have any honors or awards, you certainly have some accomplishments: being brought up to Varsity from the JV swim team sophomore year, being 1 of 15 students out of 50 applicants to be selected to welcome incoming freshmen during orientation, raising your C first semester of AP Chem to a B+ second semester, etc.

**Question:** What career do you wish to pursue? Or, what do you hope to be doing 10 years from now? **Don’t say:** Any one word answer. **Do say:** Your dream career and the insight you have gained into that career path. If you want to be a doctor, for example, tell the interviewer why and how you’ve explored that career both in and out of the classroom. Mention your AP Bio teacher’s influence on your career goals and your volunteer work at the hospital, for example. Prove to the interviewer that you’re not just following a career path your parents picked out for you or something that will earn you top dollar, but something about which you’re both passionate and knowledgeable. “I would love to become an orthopedic surgeon, as I’ve witnessed how much my grandmother’s scoliosis has negatively impacted her life.” You can take things a step further and outline to the interviewer how this particular university will help you reach your dreams: “At [university], I plan to be a human biology major, where I can not only fulfill requirements for medical school but gain a really interdisciplinary education in understanding human beings from many angles—biological, behavioral, sociological, and more. Such an education will be a huge asset to my career in medicine, for I’ll not only be able to address patients’ physiological symptoms but treat them with compassion and understanding.”

**Question:** What do you like to do for fun? **Don’t say:** Don’t say what I said in my Yale interview long ago, when asked this question. I rehashed one of my extracurriculars, and my interviewer said, “No, no, no, what do you do for fun outside of organized activities?” I froze. I was so busy with school and competitive soccer, cross country, speech &amp; debate, plays, and all the other stuff I had going on that I never did anything just for fun outside my activities. When pressed, I said I went bowling a few weeks ago with friends, and she was like, “Oh? Do you like bowling?” “No,” I choked out. “I hate it.” Not my finest moment. **Do say:** Here’s my opportunity to tell you to have some fun your senior year. Yes, I know—you don’t have time for fun. I totally get it. I was you! But make time, not just in the event you’re asked by your interviewer what you do for fun, but also for your mental health. Do something you enjoy (even if that’s bowling). Read, listen to music, paint, garden, cook with your grandma, play board games with friends or family, go hiking with friends… do something that calms you down, refreshes your spirit, and gives you a great talking point in your college admissions interview. What else there is to know

Want 15 more questions (complete with ""don't say"" and ""do say"" for each question)?

I currently have a degree from LaGuardia Community College in CS as well. Obviously neither of these schools are much to write home about, but beggars can't be choosers. I've been applying like crazy for summer internships and have only heard one response which was a rejection. 

As far as I can tell I have a decent resume, but something must obviously be wrong since I'm getting zero attention. I have zero side projects mainly due to the fact I'm trying to get out of school as quickly as possible and keep my grades high. I currently have a 3.8 GPA and have been asked to be the TA for one one of my prior courses next semester. I have also never gotten below an A in any CS course to this date, but I'm not sure if that's due to the quality of the school I attend or if I actually have anything going for me. 

The entire process is getting very draining as I've completely dedicated myself to this but have seen zero return. 99% percent of the jobs I am applying to are in New York as I still have a home there but I'm completely open to Cleveland/Akron and have had nothing. I have peers with significantly lower GPA and people I consider to myself to be a stronger engineer than who are getting offers from Sherwin-Williams and other local companies while I seemingly get ignored.

What can I do to better myself and to better my chances at landing anything. At this point I'll take the first thing that pops up as I need to get my career jump started immediately.

7q15i5,1,2018-01-12,Computer Science major (college) to do UX/ career in design? Is it worth it?,learning1skey,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/7q15i5/computer_science_major_college_to_do_ux_career_in/,"I'm a 3rd year student at a large public uni. I want to develop a career in UX design. My school doesn't have a degree geared towards UX, but a major called Digital Arts &amp; Sciences (DAS) is offered in the Computer Engineering dept. It's based in comp sci w/ a focus on Comp Aided Animation/ Modeling.

My major is now DAS in my school’s college of Arts (Arts program version focuses more on animation/ game design). If I continue in this program I would want to get a minor in Comp Engineering to strengthen my skills set/ make me more marketable.

I have wide interests but ultimately I’d like a career in design. I would like to design not just interfaces – but physical objects like medical devices, mobile/ tech devices, cars… even consumer products. I’m also interested in working in healthcare doing 3D modeling and surgery simulations, etc. I really want a creative career where I use my knowledge of science &amp; tech to create solutions that benefit others.

I can’t help feeling like I should get a technical degree [to get jobs/ internships]. I'm planning to switch to DAS in engineering, or Computer Science and possibly take electives related to 3D animation.
But I don't think I have a passion for Comp Sci, tbh. I'm mostly pursuing it because it's stable and coding skills are valuable in any field. I've taught myself a few languages but I don't code in my free time.

I want a career in design but I think comp sci would give me job stability/ good work/ life balance, &amp; can help me in UX design or any other field. I don't know if I'll love the UX field or if I might lose my job, and I have so many interests. So since it's such a widely accepted field, I'm thinking I should do a CS degree. But I don't think I'm passionate about CS or coding. I ultimately want to be an artist who works in design and engineering.
So would CS be a better option, since my interests are still broad? Or should I focus on a design-oriented degree early? 

Please, any insight will be helpful."

7q1zlb,24,2018-01-12,Good Help is Hard to Find,Lovely-Lanae117,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7q1zlb/good_help_is_hard_to_find/,"“We lost another receptionist,” I said to the disinterested human resources lady. “You know the one down on 3? Yeah she didn’t show for work today. No, no don’t worry about it. I’ll call for a temp while I interview for a permanent replacement.” I hit the button ending the call and rubbed my temples. Good help is so hard to find these days, nearly impossible in fact.

I pulled up the temp agency's website and began clicking the necessary buttons on the screen that would post the online posting for the now vacant position. This receptionist had lasted just four months but that was practically a record for Alcore Industrial Kitchen Supplies. The turnover at the company is remarkably high and as the president of sales and staffing it is my responsibility to hire. Looking over my calendar for the coming month, I thought I could probably squeeze a few interviews in throughout the next week. I hit the intercom allowing me to speak to my own receptionist, “Mary, please free Friday afternoon for interviews. We lost another receptionist.”

“Will do Mr. Marks,” Mary replied.

If only all the women I hired could be more like Mary. Always present, on time, cheerful and competent. She's been my secretary for long as I've held this position and I haven’t had a problem yet. I know I'm very lucky to have her. It can’t be easy coming into work every day not knowing who will be sitting out there answering your phones, typing your correspondence, bringing your coffee. First world problems as they say, but it really can make all the difference in job satisfaction. Besides that, I have no patience for incompetence.

Of course if I'm being honest, it doesn't hurt that Mary is attractive. Blonde curls, blue eyes, curvy body, stereotypical hot receptionist. Now, just to be clear, I have always made it a point to keep things completely professional, as has Mary. Nothing untoward has ever occurred between us. Though I do think I can feel a slight tingle in the air sometimes when we're together.

My wife Lisa has never approved of Mary, always been jealous. She's constantly comparing her mousy hair and flat chested figure to Mary’s bombshell looks. My marriage hasn't really been the same since getting this promotion. Then again before the promotion there was no receptionist at all. Though I've explained again and again that there is absolutely nothing going on between Mary and I, she's never quite believed me. She doesn't believe me when I say that I'm working late, even if I call her from the office. She always imagines the worst.

We were never able to have kids, and while I'm secretly happy about that, it does leave Lisa with a lot of free time. She doesn't have a career or hobbies or even many friends so she just spends all of her time worrying about me.

There was a brief period where things actually seemed to be getting better. Lisa had started volunteering at the local women’s shelter. She really took an interest in the cause and had taken a special liking to some of the women. She took them on lunch dates, shopping, that sort of thing. I wasn’t thrilled with her spending so much of my hard earned money on these women and this caused a minor tension between us but in the end I backed off, let her have her fun as long as it kept her occupied.

Lisa’s favorite was a young girl named Jessica. She had two young children and an abusive ex-boyfriend. She was small and mousy just like Lisa. I guess they bonded over being the ugly ducklings of the world. There were two little boys too, three and four I think. Even I had to admit they were cute little things, all big eyes and curls but they were also loud and sticky and rambunctious. Definitely not my cup of tea. I didn’t like having them around the house and I was suspicious of that mother of theirs. She seemed sweet, but I could see the cunning in her eyes, she was just waiting for chance to steal something. Lisa was well aware of my feelings and to her credit, she did her best to keep any visits to the house to the hours when I would be working.

For almost a full year things were going well. Lisa was fulfilled and I was just happy to be able to come and go without her constant nagging. We had never been that passionately in love but it seemed as if...well as if we were back in the early days of our marriage. We were actually happy to see each other after a long day apart. We even went on a few dates. Overall things were great, until the day that I came home to find my favorite watch missing. It's a very expensive item and I was sure I had left it on the mantle, but when I got home from work that day it was gone. In my mind there was really only one explanation.

At first Lisa denied that Jessica could possibly have had anything to do with it.

“She would never do that to me,” she said.

Soon enough though as days came and went with no sign of the watch she had to concede that maybe, just maybe I was right and she had taken it. As far as I could tell there was a big blow up when Lisa confronted Jessica about taking the watch. Of course Jessica vehemently denied taking it and was so taken aback that Lisa would make such an accusation that she said she hoped to never see her again. That's exactly the overreaction you could expect from a thief who had been caught red handed.

This obviously hurt Lisa a lot but she continued her volunteer work. She didn’t seem to get attached to the girls anymore though. She seemed to just do the bare minimum and leave her heart out of it. I thought this to be a good thing. Eventually Jessica called and apologized to Lisa for the things she had said, though she still didn’t admit that she took the watch. Lisa was ecstatic that the relationship could be repaired but I made it clear that they were not to return to our home for any reason. Naturally Lisa immediately made plans to visit them at Jessica’s apartment.

Then one day just as I was just finishing up some paperwork for a big account I'd landed the phone rang. Since it hadn’t gone through Mary’s desk first I knew it had to be someone with the direct number. Unfortunately, only one person has that number. I let the phone ring through to voicemail the first time. I was in a great mood from the big sale and I absolutely refused to be brought down by Lisa’s nonsense. I sighed deeply when the phone trilled again just seconds later. I snatched the phone up, “What?”

“Oh Ralph! I can’t believe this, I just can’t” she wailed into my ear, I cringed away from the headset.

“What is it?” I demanded, alarmed rather than annoyed now.

“They’re all……dead. All of them. How could this happen?”

“Ok, now I need you to slow down and explain what’s going on. I can’t possibly help you if I don’t know what the problem is. Who is dead?” I asked as patiently as I could. Then a thought occurred to me. “Oh no, it’s not your parents is it?”

“No Ralph, not my parents, Jessica and the boys. I went to their apartment for our visit and…. just please get home. I can’t be alone right now” she cried, pitifully.

I really wasn’t in the mood to deal with this at all. I gritted my teeth, “Ok, I’ll be home just as soon as I possibly can. You just rest for now. I’ll be there soon.”

I wrapped up what I was working on and called Mary to let her know I would be leaving shortly and that she could have the rest of the day off as well. Mary was gone by the time I walked out into the outer office. I turned off the lights and locked up. Resisting the urge to check things in the showroom, I begrudgingly headed home.

Lisa was sleeping on the couch when I got there. Her face was red and puffy from crying. I tried to be quiet in order to not wake her but her eyes snapped open as soon as I walked in to the room. At first she looked confused then her face crumpled in on itself as she remembered what happened.

“Oh Ralph it was horrible,” she cried.

It turned out that Lisa had been the one to find the bodies. She was stopping by for a visit and apparently after knocking several times, she tried the front door and found it unlocked. That should have been her first clue not to go inside, I thought but did not say. Inside she said she found Jessica’s body lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen, beaten black and blue and barely recognizable. The boys were still in the bed they shared with their mother. They could almost have been sleeping, she said, if not for the gaping wounds in each of their heads and the congealed blood drying on the pillows.

“At least the boys didn’t suffer honey,” I tried to say comfortingly, “they probably didn’t even know what hit them.”

Lisa burst into tears again. “I know who hit them” she cried. “That crazy ex- boyfriend of hers. He must have tracked them down and killed them when she wouldn’t take him back. She always said he’d be the death of her.”

The next few months passed with Lisa in an increasingly depressed state. She became desperately needy and while I tried to be patient and supportive, my patience very quickly grew thin. I paid for the best psychologist around who diagnosed Lisa with severe depression and PTSD. She was on a laundry list of medications but nothing could seem to pull her out of the dark place she was in. There was a brief period where she seemed to be coming around, until she found the watch that she had accused Jessica of stealing under the couch and broke down all over again. She called me at the office crying and almost incoherent of course. At this point I'd had enough, I was missing work left and right over her silliness. I had even lost a big client because I wasn’t able to make an important business dinner due to another pointless breakdown.

“Lisa, this is getting to be unacceptable. You need to grow up and move on. Those people were not our family and were nothing but a burden on society. I know you “loved” them but they are gone and will never come back, your moping and crying and calling me at work will not help them. If you want to be miserable go right ahead, but leave me out of it.”

It was a little harsh I'll admit it, but I can only attend so many pity parties before I reach my breaking point. There was silence on the phone for a long moment and then Lisa whispered “Ok” and hung up. I may have taken it a step too far, but what else could I do? I didn’t see any other way to handle the situation that wouldn’t have been equally hurtful. So I did what I had to do and put the situation out of my mind.

There were no more phone calls from Lisa that day. No more calls for the next three days in fact. I felt like I had done exactly the right thing. Lisa had been more herself lately, very quiet, but I really quite enjoyed that. I took advantage of her improved mood and independence by working late each day.

It all came to a head the other night when I came in around 10 o’clock and found Lisa waiting for me at the kitchen table. I will admit I was later than usual and I opened my mouth to give some sort of explanation or apology, but the look on her face made me close my mouth. Her calm demeanor from the last few days was nowhere to be found. Her face twisted into a sneer that I would have sworn she was incapable of. Her generally sweet and amiable attitude was what attracted me to her in the first place and the thing I still counted on from her. The way that she was looking at me then, I barely recognized her.

I decided the best way to handle the situation was to ignore the strange way she was behaving.

“Hey, sorry I’m a little late. It was a crazy day. How are you?”

Lisa snorted mirthlessly, “Oh I’m just great. It’s always so nice to sit at home alone waiting for my cheating husband to get done fucking his secretary and come home.”

My mouth dropped. I had never heard her speak this way before. I shook my head and sighed rubbing my eyes tiredly.

“Lisa, I thought we were past this. I know you’ve been having a rough time lately but let’s not over react.”

“What would you have me think then?” she demanded. “Should I believe that my husband is working late into the night selling kitchen appliances?” She laughed again but there were tears leaking from her eyes.

I started toward her, meaning to touch her arm gently. I feared that she had had a mental break. “Lisa, please” but she cut me off.

“No. I’m done looking the other way. I’ve been your quiet little mouse for too many years.”

“What’s brought this on?” I asked, truly dumbfounded. “I don’t understand.”

Lisa was quiet for a moment then she sighed loudly and seemed to deflate. It was as if she had pumped herself up just enough for that exchange and anymore would completely exhaust her.

“Maybe” she began, in a shaky voice, “maybe I’m just finally letting myself say what I’ve always known.”

With that she turned away from me and headed down the long hallway to our bedroom. When she reached the doorway she hesitated for a second before turning around.

“Fire her or I want a divorce” she said, then turned and walked back into the bedroom, closing the door behind her.

I sat down heavily at the kitchen table. This was an unfortunate turn of events. I knew I couldn’t fire Mary; she had been with me for far too long. Good help like her was hard to come by. On the other hand, I couldn’t lose Lisa. I'm not actually opposed to being a bachelor, in fact it's exactly the lifestyle I enjoy, but having a wife just completes the trustworthy good guy image I try to project. As a salesman half the battle is convincing the client to trust you, no one trusts an accused adulterer.

Everything was quiet yesterday when I woke. There was no sign of life in the house, so I ate a quick breakfast and rushed out the door. I was running late; the excitement the night before wore me out more than I would have expected. I grabbed my things and flew out the door, as quickly as I could weighed down by the duffel bag full of junk I had been planning to store at work.

After I had parked the car, right up front in the spot with my name stenciled on it, I looked at the duffel in the backseat. I groaned inwardly before deciding to wait until the end of the day to lug the heavy bag in. Normally I'm very efficient and detest wasting time or putting things off, but that day I was in an especially good mood as I pushed the large glass double doors and made my way into the lobby. I greeted the security guard at the desk and made my way to the elevator and up to my office.

“Good morning Mr. Marks” Mary said when as I walked into the outer office. She was smiling her customary bright smile. I returned her greeting with a smile of my own and went into the inner office, closing the door behind me. I made a mental note to check into a raise for Mary.

I spent the morning making calls to clients, following up on new orders and attempting to persuade the new pizza place downtown that they would really benefit from the newest oven model we had just gotten in. I invited the owner to come on down and take a look at it. It had been my idea to convert the mostly unused basement into a showroom of sorts for the products. A show model of each of the high end products our company sold was housed down there; most were fully functional so that potential customers could try them out before committing. It was my proudest achievement and I relished the opportunity to show it off. Things were looking promising for the sale by the time we hung up. I slogged through several interviews for the open position that I had almost entirely forgotten about. I knew they were dead ends. The first was too fat, the second too old, the third was actually a man. After I had walked the last candidate out and thanked them for their time, I sighed.

“No winners, huh?” Mary asked.

I smiled sheepishly, “Guess not.”

“Don’t worry, you’ll find the right one, you always do.”

“Well,” I replied as I walked back into my office, “they can’t all be as good as you, now can they?”

Mary smiled at the comment and went back to the letter she was typing. The rest of the day passed quickly and before I knew it Mary was popping her head in to let me know she was leaving for the night.

“Six already?” I asked.

“Afraid so,” she replied. “It seems like you practically live here though. I bet you’re not even close to leaving are you?”

I chuckled, “I’m actually just wrapping up. But you are right, I can’t help it. I just enjoy my work.”

“I can tell. I definitely admire your work ethic. Have a good night Mr. Marks.”

After Mary closed the door behind her I began to think. Her comment worried me. Had anyone else noticed my long hours? Did they think I was weird? I care a lot for the image I project.

Shaking it off I decided it had just been an innocent comment. It was just about time to head home anyway; I wasn't looking forward to dealing with Lisa but I couldn't very well live in my office. I pulled on my coat and locked up the office door before making my way to the first floor. I didn’t really feel like dealing with the duffel, but I needed to check on things in the showroom anyway, so I decided now was as good a time as any.

I nodded to the security guard as I pushed open the front door.

“Sir…excuse me. Will you need back in tonight?” the young guard asked timidly. “I’d like to go ahead and lock up but I wouldn’t want to inconvenience you.”

“Oh, I just have a few things to put down in the showroom. You go right ahead and lock up. I’ll go in the back door” I told him with a smile.

I heard the lock click behind me as I made my way to the car. The day was unseasonably warm and the car belched out hot, musty air when I opened the door. I grimaced at the smell but slid behind the wheel and pulled around the building to the rear entrance. I debated on parking in the no parking zone for only a moment before throwing the car in park right alongside the back door and getting out. I didn’t plan to be inside long anyway and the bag was pretty heavy.

I made sure to prop the door open before wrestling the bag out of the backseat. Sweat was dripping from my brow by the time I made it down the long hallway and into the showroom. I sat the bag down for a moment in the doorway to catch my breath. The room is enormous. Along one wall are large industrial sized ovens and grills, another displayed dishwashers and countertops. There are various specialty items along another wall, meat grinders and giant mixers. I often feel like Jack must have felt stepping into the Giant’s kitchen. What I was interested in was against the back wall where the walk in freezers were lined up neatly side by side. A large padlock hung from the latch of each of them. This was another of my ideas. I couldn’t, after all, have the stupid interns playing around in these things and possibly getting locked in. It would really be a lawsuit waiting to happen.

I hefted the duffel with a grunt and headed for the freezer in the corner of the room. It’s an older model and there is never any interest in it, but I like to keep it around. The rest of the inventory rotates every few months, but this was my first show piece and I keep it for sentimental reasons. When I finally reached the freezer I dropped the bag with a thud and started fishing for the key to the padlock. It seemed to take forever but finally I found the key and pushed the heavy door open. With one last heave I lifted the duffel bag over the threshold and tossed it in.

The first thing I did after stepping in was pull the door shut behind me, being careful to wedge a thin piece of cardboard into the opening so I wouldn’t be locked in. Then I turned on the overhead light and went to work unpacking the bag. With that done I sat down for a moment to rest. I felt a lot better having taken care of that but I was actually pretty tired all of a sudden. I leaned back against the icy wall and watching my breath frost in the air. I always felt more at ease in here.

A little too at ease apparently as within several minutes I had dozed off. I heard footsteps in the showroom and my eyes snapped open, my heart pounding. It took me a moment to get my bearings and realize where I was. I sprang to my feet with effort, my joints stiff from the cold and hurried to the door.

“Mr. Marks? Are you down here?” Mary called.

Thoughts bounced wildly through my head. Should I keep quiet and hope that she goes away? Or should I come out and hope she wouldn’t question why I was there in the first place. I finally settled on a solution and opened the door just enough so that she could see me, but not see past me.

“I’m in here Mary, what brings you back to the office?” I asked, trying to sound normal. “I thought you’d gone home already?”

“I did start to head home but I left my purse in the office. Along with my keys, so I couldn’t even get back in when I realized what happened. I had a feeling you might still be here though. Thank goodness” Mary laughed at herself a little, “you must think I’m such a blonde.”

“No of course not” I said with a smile. “We all make mistakes sometimes. I’ll be glad to let you into the office, but hey would you mind giving me a hand over here for just a minute?”

Mary hesitated for the slightest moment and then walked toward the freezer door.

“So, what’s going on? Something wrong with the unit?”

I didn’t say anything until Mary was within arm’s reach. I stepped back and opened the door wider. Mary’s smile faded and was replaced by a blank, confused stare when she saw what the freezer held. She tried to back away instinctively but not fast enough. I grabbed her arm, simultaneously clamping a hand over her mouth and pulling her into the freezer with me. I held her trembling frame against me and said calmly, “Can you promise not to scream? If you can promise me that, I can let you go. We can sit down and have a talk.”

She quickly nodded her head and tried to say something under my hand. I removed it from her mouth but kept it up, ready to replace it at a moment’s notice. She remained quiet though she was breathing heavily and making whimpering sounds. She looked around, eyes wide with horror, taking in my prized collection.

Eight women were placed around the interior of the freezer. Seven of them were seated along the walls. They were all made to look like they had just sat down for a rest after a long day at work, still dressed in the business suits and dresses that they had last worn. They were all blonde and bore a striking resemblance to Mary herself. The thick layer of ice on all but one of the women was all that ruined my little tableau. The last woman was a brunette. She was dressed in a sweat suit and sat away from the rest of the women. She wasn’t part of the group; she wasn’t meant to be here. She was an ugly, unfortunate addition. I was embarrassed for Mary to see the eyesore among my otherwise beautiful collection.

Finally, Mary whispered, “Why Ralph? Why would you do this?”

“You don’t like my collection?” I asked, sadly. “Do you recognize any of them?”

Mary looked closer at the women and gasped, recognizing several past coworkers.

“How Ralph? How could you possibly do this?”

“Ahh, I’m glad you asked,” I exclaimed, I had been terrified of anyone finding out my little secret for so long, but now that it had happened I found myself excited to show them off. I held out my hand gesturing to a woman in the corner. A thick layer of ice mostly obscured her face.

“Courtney here was my first. She was working late and I happened to bump into her headed out the door. She didn’t want to accept a ride from me, but it was raining so she did. I didn’t really plan to kill her when I offered to take her home. But it was almost like someone took over my body, once it was done I knew I couldn’t just throw her away, so I brought her here. Then I realized that I could keep her and see her anytime I liked. It wasn’t long before I thought she needed a little company.”

At this point I had moved away from Mary, I’ll admit I was warming to my story. Moving closer to the girls and farther from the door.

“So, you killed eight women just so that you could keep them here to look at? You know that makes you a serial killer right?” Mary said. Her tone was disgusted, and this hurt me a little.

“No, no, no Mary!” I exclaimed, anxious to set the story straight. “I killed seven of them to look at, the last one was an unfortunate necessity.” I chuckled, “You know my wife always thought that we were having an affair? She actually gave me an ultimatum last night, fire you or get a divorce. I didn’t like either of those options so I made my own choice.”

“You killed your wife?” Mary questioned. “How could you do that? Didn’t you love her?”

“Of course I loved her, she was my wife. But what option did she leave me?” I frowned and turned to stare at Mary. She should have felt flattered. I killed my wife rather than fire her. She should feel at the very least grateful to still have a job. I could feel the anger bubbling inside me but I tried to stamp it out.

“Everything was fine before that girl and her little brats came into my life. If only they had stayed away I wouldn’t have had to kill them and my wife wouldn’t have gone crazy. How was I to know the watch had fallen behind the couch?”

Mary was confused by this latest outburst, of course she had no idea what I was talking about. I was just so anxious for her to understand. She nods, trying to placate me.

“Of course. You did what you had to.”

She was patronizing me; I see that now. If I were in my right mind, if I hadn’t just woken or if I weren’t so desperate to believe that she could understand me I would have seen it for what it was. But I didn’t. The next thing I knew she had made a break for the door. She pushed it open and even got one foot out before I grabbed her and pulled her back inside. She screamed for help but the door was already shut and there was no one close enough to hear.

“I thought you were going to be quiet?” I said, hurt and anger roiling in my stomach. “Why would you do that? I thought I could trust you?”

Mary was crying profusely. “I won’t say anything. I swear. No one will ever know about this.”

I actually thought about this for a moment, considered trusting her.

“You also said you wouldn’t scream” I said finally.

Today I got to the office later than usual. The outer office was dark and empty, no one had put on the coffee and the phone has been ringing ceaselessly. There is of course only one thing to do. I sigh and grab the telephone.

“Yes, this is Ralph Marks, I’m going to need a temporary secretary as soon as possible please. My secretary hasn’t shown for work today. Good help is so hard to find these days.”

I am interested in completing my masters abroad in the UK. I was looking at a few different top universities and I am wondering if it will be beneficial for me to go about this.

My background:
- Supply Chain Management major at a California State University
- 3.75 cumulative GPA
- Graduating in about 2 quarters
- 2 Internships (one only semi-related)

Schools I am looking at:
- University of Edinburgh
- London Business School
- Cambridge
- Oxford

If I decide to come back to the U.S. afterwards, will I have trouble finding a job? Additionally, if I wanted to stay in the UK would it be difficult for me to find a job since I am from the U.S.?

Thank you!"

I am a below average student(struggled moderately in school but eventually made through most of CS courses to graduate) that just started an intern position 2 weeks ago and I am having very difficult time and need some advice. First, I have been reading documents for almost 2 weeks to just install software, tools and getting to know things like git and linux system. I had very difficult time and to consistently ask for help because due to being overwhelmed/confused and searching info for doc/google did not work and was stuck on things for long time. I try to search up online/documents but sometimes I just get stuck on things. 
Also, I understand that it’s not a good idea to ask same questions again but even when I write down as much as I can, I just get confused by it and sometimes I end up asking for more clarifications/confirmations. I am still very shaky of linux and version control, which I just think I need more review... Also, there are times when I would spend a lot of time on tiny things that breaks, such as getting connections, configurations etc. I feel like I am very disrupting to coworkers by asking too many questions and I am trying to tone it down and trying to resolve things on my own...
After all this struggle, I was just able to start on a ticket recently. I have hard time understand the code and I was unsure/not competent of some programming concepts and it was brought up today that they have concerns about my competency in programming and I was suggested some resources to study after work. They said the things I were confused about were pretty standard in the industry and I was expected to be very familiar with it already. While I had exposure to things, I just simply forgot or not having competency (my fault). Also, a lot of things in the code just seems like new concept to me that I have not encountered and the size of it is just overwhelming... I felt very grateful that they show concerns for me and guiding me to improve, so I will DEFINITELY dedicate rest of my time on studying. However, I just can't get rid of the feeling of how unqualified I am, and every day, the pressure is building up. There are a lot of talented people at my school, including some other experienced interns at work, and a lot of people seem to have great success with internship experience. I have been spending more time than my regular hours just to desperately understand what’s going on to a minimum level and making no contribution. 
I am worried that I will be let go pretty soon.  I will, however, try my best to improve but I am beginning to wonder if this is a sign that I am not fit for this kind of job…
Again, very sorry for lengthy and unorganized post, any feedback is appreciated.



Edit: Thank you so much for all your comments. There are some comments that definitely made me more confident and some that really gave me wake up calls. I will try my best to get through this!!!

7q3yie,3,2018-01-13,Dealing with Autism and Depression/Anxiety at work,anonymousanom,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7q3yie/dealing_with_autism_and_depressionanxiety_at_work/,"Hi everyone. So I'm new to Reddit and to give a bit of context, I'm a Graphic Designer living with Autism, who has been struggling a lot lately.

I started a new role as a Junior Designer at an agency, (following an internship at a start-up company) and I'm terrified that I won't make it past my probationary period.

The issue isn't relating to creativity (i.e. being able to come up with new concepts and ideas), but more my ability to understand specifically what the client and my boss wants, without misunderstanding. I also have also have great difficulties with memory, which means that when it comes to feedback on my work, I usually miss something off, even when I write it down.

The main difficulties I experience with Autism are:

1. Difficulties with language and communication.
2. Problems with short-term memory.
3. Executive functioning, which includes self-monitoring, organising and planning and problems with switching back and forth between tasks.

On top of this, I also think I'm suffering with problems from Anxiety and Depression, (which I'll admit that I first started seeing the signs before I started work with the agency), which have progresively gotten worse to a point where I realise I can no longer cope on my own. Symptoms I'm currently experiencing include: loss of appetite, oversleeping, feelings of emptiness/, feeling like a failure, feelings of guilt and hopelessness, decreased energy etc.

As a result, I've booked a Doctor's appointment this week, in the hope that I will be able to seek help and am also thinking about raising the issue with my employer, but have no idea how.

The worst part is, (which sounds horrible), is that a lot of how I'm feeling at the moment goes back to my disability and worrying about how much I'm going to struggle later in life with regards to employment.

So, are there any Autistics/ anyone else who can relate and how did you go about raising the issue with your employer. Did you quit, discuss the issue with your boss or continue on, despite knowing the struggle? Thank you."
7q429j,5,2018-01-13,[AskIndia] Some Insight on doing masters from abroad,enigmaVada,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7q429j/askindia_some_insight_on_doing_masters_from_abroad/,"Hello guys. I am currently pursuing B.E Computer Engineering and i am in my third year. Pretty critical time for me to decide on my career options for post-grad. I am not that inclined to get a management degree (i.e doing an MBA), i want to get a masters degree from a foreign university. However, i got some doubts and need help.
These aren't related to how to prepare for the GRE or TOEFL exams but more of a what-after-that kind of questions.

1) Is getting a masters degree worth right now. Also i heard that some degrees do not work here in india..how true is that or is it country/university dependant? The reason is i feel getting a masters would narrow my job opportunities.

2) Since i am pursuing computer engineering, what is the current trend right now? Like specialization in what subject would broaden my spectrum of getting a good job?

3) What factors are necessary to getting a scholarship as that will actually decide whether i can do masters or not. I won't be able to afford without a scholarship. I found out that it depends on my GRE score, CGPA and some other stuff but if you guys can provide some better clarity it would be awesome.

4) Which countries offer a good IT industry? I mean considering the H1B visa stuff happening, my parents are asking me to think about other options other than the US. Or is going to the US and working there possible with all this stuff going on? Or getting a degree and coming back to work in india viable with my reduced options due to getting a specialization?

I have a good CGPA and right now i am working on building my resume by trying to do some projects and internships. I want to give these exams before my placements start so that i atleast know where i stand.
I am open to any suggestions and appreciate the help given.

People who has gone through this phase and is currently pursuing masters, please be kind to advice :)
Thanks for the help!"
7q5m1o,1,2018-01-13,What sort of summer opportunities should I be looking for in C.S. as someone almost completely new to the field?,assbaring69,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7q5m1o/what_sort_of_summer_opportunities_should_i_be/,"Right now I am quite at a loss for what to do. People always say that it's never too late to switch career directions, and technically people can change majors even up to sophomore year of college. Well, I am just about to start spring semester of sophomore year in college, and last semester, after having my first C.S. experience via an Intro to Comp Sci course (beginners' Java), was when I decided to switch into C.S., completely inexperienced.

For years before this, I had preened myself to go the M.D. route: multiple summer volunteering, student researcher positions, A.P.'s in the relevant subjects, and of course a classic premed courseload in my freshman year of college. As a result, my resume, however attractive it can be brushed up, is definitely not going to catch the eyes of anyone in C.S.

The only thing that has been going right for me so far is a good grade in my Intro to C.S. course and a pretty sound proficiency in the intro Java that the course taught me -- plus a genuine passion for comp sci, if that by itself actually counts for anything in terms of finding an internship. I am planning on self-studying Python on EdX over the spring semester. But other than that, I am completely lost. I have no self-made projects, and frankly I don't even know much about the other things needed to attract employers for internships and beyond.

My course professor for the Intro course had not been helpful. I showed interest by going to a handful of his office hours over the semester and asking a few deep questions among the mostly assignment-related ones, but we don not seem to have a good rapport (I have never been a very socially attractive person). When I inquired him about research opportunities and internships, he just said something like ""You need to take the next-level course before you start getting those. You can look around on the Comp Sci department's faculty page and inquire, and I can help put a word in, but I assure you you're not going to hear much back.""

One of my super-smart friends who has experience with C.S. suggested that I should focus more on finding research over internships. I did that. Starting from my own school's faculty page and research program (keep in mind that my school is not particularly known for its C.S. department), I found that the level of competency -- not just in C.S., but also in related math abilities -- required far outweighs my puny knowledge of intro Java. Plus, I can barely understand the meaning of the titles of their research topics and papers, let alone the content of the papers themselves, so unless I literally just ask them, ""Do you have any random spots opening up that I can snag for the summer?"", I don't think I have a very attractive ""pick-up line"" in any emails to them regarding research opportunities. And I thought my resume was pitiful for *internships*...

Basically in short, I have no idea what to do.

In the long term, what should I focus on? What languages should I learn, what projects should I go for (and how does that work), and what connections/networking should I make? Things like that. *But much more importantly right now, in the short term looking at this summer, what realistic shot at an internship or research do I have, given my current situation? If I even have a decent chance at finding something -- literally anything that isn't pure grunt work -- please let me know how I can get on that (or maybe even if it's resume-helping grunt work, that would work)! But in the worst-case scenario, if I don't get anything, what is the most productive thing to do over the summer to salvage/minimize the wasted time?*

Thank you very much; any advice is greatly appreciated! "
7q5qli,4,2018-01-13,"How does the whole ""send out 50 emails to prospective employers/professors/P.I.'s"" thing actually work?",assbaring69,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7q5qli/how_does_the_whole_send_out_50_emails_to/,"So I am currently a sophomore in college lost about the whole summer opportunity thing -- internships, research, stuff like that. I'm sure everyone, me included, has heard of the whole schtick about ""you have to send out 50 emails asking for opportunities"". A little about my current major situation: I originally wanted to do C.S. and Econ double major, but as I had just this year moved away from Pre-med with no prior experience in C.S., I realized that getting a major in both will be next to impossible, so as I am currently more interested in C.S., I think I will minor in Econ.

Anyways, I cannot find much of anything in either field. In short: yes, I have talked with my professors, I have talked with knowledgeable friends. The short summary is that I haven't gotten much help from there. The only thing I haven't done yet is consult my school's career office (I need to get on that soon). As I've said, I had zero prior experience with C.S. before last semester, and only intro Java now. As for Econ, even though I started taking courses in high school and have been taking courses regularly in college as well, in terms of actual Econ experience in the workplace or research, I've got nothing, and know nothing. I have had very good experiences -- and entries on my resume -- for Pre-med, having groomed myself to go down that route before finding out and deciding it wasn't right for me. But that's all gone now -- a wasted path taken.

So currently my only strategy left is ""brute-force"", ""send emails to multiple positions found online that look the most attractive and suitable"". However, the problem is, with no real experience in either field, especially Comp Sci (where I could not even fully understand the titles of the papers published by professors in my school's department, which isn't even a particularly good C.S. school), how can I realistically get to know each professor's work before making first contact? And that's to speak nothing of the logistical difficulty in getting to know all ""50"" of those people for whose works I need to show at least a semblance of familiarity and interest in -- even if I am capable of understanding the titles of their papers and whatnot. So how does that actually work? Is ""50"" just a popularized figure of speech, and the typical, actual number is closer to 20? If not, what is the actual, non-stereotypical way I should approach making first contact with the ""50"" (or 20) people?

Thank you for your time. I am very lost right now, and any advice is greatly appreciated!"
7q61xe,12,2018-01-13,Is transferring from an unranked CS school to a top 15 program worth the extra 20k?,troubledcsstudent,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7q61xe/is_transferring_from_an_unranked_cs_school_to_a/,"So my scenario:

I currently go to an unranked, lightly recruited university (some mediocre tech companies come), and while I have found early success as a sophomore by landing 2 internships (1 big mediocre tech company, 1 national lab), I begin to doubt whether or not I would be able to use this momentum to get noticed by more prestigious companies (BigN). This is because many people from my school who have been in the same context as me, have had no luck getting any ""juicy, circlejerked"" offers in terms of internships/new grad offers even though they were ""stacked on paper."" So while I do not doubt I will ever be able to reach that level EVENTUALLY, I do doubt my ability to attain those internships/new grad offers. 

I am pretty likely to get into this top 15 school form the looks of statistical data, anecdotes, and given my academic history. However, like my title suggests, it would cost about an extra 20k-30k from tuition and housing. Regardless of whether I transfer or not, I will not have any debt due to financial aid, part-time jobs, and saved up money from internships. 

So, is 20k-30k worth transferring to an extremely better school if I already have some success at my unranked school or would it be redundant? Would the opportunity cost of transferring to the school eventually be paid off by the better job opportunities? 

EDIT: Would it still be worth if I had to take an extra semester in the worst case that some classes don't transfer?"

I'm really just looking for a place where I would be happy working and learn a lot, pay doesn't really matter to me in this sense. 


citadel: 

-I'm really scared that I would have a horrible time working there, I would be on an infrastructure related team, but i've heard of horrible things all around and during my onsite I also did find that the office was quiet and people seemed unapproachable. I struggle with mental health so this is probably the biggest con for me 
-Housing is provided and it's apparently really nice 
-I had 8 interviews with them but only 1 leetcode style question was ever asked which makes me doubt their technical strengths? Everything else was behavioral/weird knowledge based questions
-being in a new city in chicago which is nice! 
-may help with similar types of companies in the future? Not sure if I even want to go into trading/hedge fund kind of field in the future though.


Quora:

-interviews were the hardest, but I really enjoyed talking to everyone at the office that I encountered 
-housing is provided but it's dorm style, or a 2k housing stipend
-I would be in the bay area again which I'm not too excited about
-learning opportunities seem to abundant and mentorship is something they're really serious about, I think I would have a good time here 


Snap:

-concerned about company culture, I've heard bad things about how bro-ey they are but from my interviewers both were really nice 
-No housing provided but 1.8k stipend
-new city! 
-I find the team they put me on really interesting and different from everything I've done in the past

7q76pg,0,2018-01-13,Lying to get good internships!,whyNotlie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7q76pg/lying_to_get_good_internships/,"i see people complaining about the ethics of lying, but i've always lied for ~40% of my resume (work experience and extracuriculars involving leadership/certain projects) and have always gotten away with it. I only lie about the specifics of the work i've done  (also certain projects i don't make open source for obvious reasons) and just exaggerate and claim I did ~5-10x more than I really did b/c they can't even check :) (such as claiming i contributed more than i did, did/used projects/languages/tools i never really worked with/on, did work other interns did that I simply familiarized myself with). How else am I supposed to get a google internship as a sophomore you know? Also i never lied about the locations or actually having the internship - don't do this b/c u won't get away with it. Also don't lie about other things people can easily find out like GPA and school.

Just thought I'd give some good real world advice and point out the great benefits to lying and people stressing about internships shouldn't be afraid or hesitant to do so to put themselves ahead of their ""honest"" peers. Of course this is only if you are good at lying/willing to practice/rehearse a lot/knowledgeable about the claims you come up with. I spent ~100/hrs over the years building up, improving and practicing my ""speech"" for interviews (behaviorals aren't too tough to BS but certain technical ones where they really pry at your experience are ones to be wary of) and I've never not interned at a big 4 since sophomore year. 

Lying is most effective/seen on resumes though so you do need to know your stuff in interviews. Lying still helps in interviews as long as you can back up what you did. Don't lie about language proficiency, if you want to include something just put it under ""Familiar"" and not ""Proficient"" - i've never been asked hard questions aobut languages im only ""familiar"" with but it still shows your flexibility/willingness to learn new things.

Generally, for lying about a project you're going to want to know the language and technologies used very well. What I usually do is recreate (somewhat) the project/thing I lie about enough so that I know how to explain how I made it/did it in the interviews. It's the thought that matters and it's not like they're going to ask you to recreate it in front of them. You're able to explain challenges/design/everything easier by doing this.

I did study a lot, been coding since 9, go to a top 10 cs school, and am actually very knowledgeable/cautious about what I lie about so take this advice with a grain of salt.

Good luck on your internship hunt!"

We both live in Canada but last year we moved to London together. I was completing a master's degree and he was studying music production (he's a DJ). After I graduated, I got a job in London which doesn't pay much compared to the cost of living there and he took on an unpaid internship. We are now both back in Canada for the holidays and have a tough decision to make. 

I dislike my job and want to quit and stay in Canada and my boyfriend was also on board with this idea. Until yesterday. He received a once in a lifetime offer to interview for a position in a town that's an hour outside London. 

Another couple we're friendly with had mentioned they'd like to move in with us because it would save us all a lot of money on rent in London. We had said that would be fine but we have to figure out what we're doing first. Well, they found an amazing apartment and jumped on it and put down a deposit without speaking to us first. Now if we say ""no"" to living with them, they'll lose their deposit. If we don't live with them, my boyfriend says he'll want to live somewhere closer to the train station so that his commute to his potential job would be a bit easier - however the areas he's looking at are far from the city centre and not the safest and would extend my commute. 

I'm feeling lost. I don't want to work at my old job again, but if I move back I can't move back without a job. He won't be interviewing for the position until next month and won't know for sure that he got the job for another month at least. This other couple is waiting on us to make a decision about an apartment that's in an amazing location, but if we sign the lease and he doesn't get the job we're in a really tough position. 

The other option is that he would go over by himself and live in the town while I stay behind in Canada. 

Whichever way I look at it, there's no decision that leads to the perfect outcome and I really don't know what to do. I just want to make a choice and move on with my life. "

I'm in a unique situation with my degree.

I totally fucked around in college, did nothing, dropped out to work a shit job full time for a couple years. Discovered programming, came back for a CS degree. The catch: I didn't get into the CS program, so I came in as an Engineering Technology major (weird easy Electrical Engineering) and planned to do a minor in CS to get an internal transfer.

After completing my minor over last summer and fall, I got a big 4 co-op for this spring. Incredible opportunity that really validated my excellent grades since returning to school.

Despite this, my internal transfer failed, so I cannot enter CS in my current school.

I am considering trying to drop out and go full time with my big 4 employer, as I cannot return to my school for a CS degree. My two other options are transferring (difficult with my academic record), or remaining at school for my current major, which is like Electrical Engineering lite. Very little programming.

Edit: time is an important factor. Sticking in my current major would take me 2-2.5 years to graduate, while going to another CS program would take 1.5-2. That's a half a year of lost salary! 

* Thoughts?
* How bad is it for someone without a degree?
* If I work for Big 4 for a couple years, would that guarantee me admission into a good school?
* Edit: now also considering an online degree - this could allow me to work and get a degree at the same time. Thoughts?"

I was wondering if any of you guys have ever been in the same boat, and if you have links or advice on how to be ""okay or happy"" with where you're at. Ideally, I'd like to be happy for my friends and with myself."
7qdanv,8,2018-01-14,Playing Doctor,vamale552,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7qdanv/playing_doctor/,"I always wanted to be a physician. Ever since I was a young boy. My desire was to help people, to heal them, to make a difference in their lives. What brought this on? I was 12 when my father died. I never felt like the doctors did enough to save him. I was determined that I would do better and no little boy would suffer the way I did. Nothing would get in my way. Nothing!

I read all that I could about medicine and doctors growing up. We were lucky that we had the internet. A whole new world opened up to me. I found web sites that showed doctors and nurses examining men and women. Sometimes I was lucky enough to see adults examining other children but those sites were usually difficult to find.

The year before my father got sick he and I built a little ‘fort’ in the woods behind our house. No one knew about it, not even my mother. One day I realized that this could be my clinic. I called it ‘The Children’s Clinic’ and began setting it up. I took some things from the house that I thought would be good medical equipment. Things like a thermometer, a flashlight, those popsicle stick things that are used for crafts that look like tongue depressors, notepads, pencils, some of my dad’s tools from the garage, and one of his old white shirts as a lab coat.

I told my friend, Lonnie, about my clinic and he wanted to see it. I told him he could be my first patient and he agreed. So, we went back into the woods and I began the examination. I asked him what was wrong but he said, “Nothing.”

“Then what brings you here?” I asked.

“You did, dummy.” And he laughed. I told him that this was serious stuff and he had to stop playing around.

He finally said, “This is no fun. Let’s do something else.” So, I closed up and we went to play in his yard.

Later his sister, Jessica, came out and said that their mother wanted Lonnie to take the trash out. He ran into the house saying, “I’ll be right back.”

His sister was a year older than me and we started talking. I told her I wanted to be a doctor when I grew up and she told me she wanted to be a nurse. Then she said, “Maybe someday we’ll work in the same hospital.”

I told her I had opened a clinic and asked her if she wanted to see it. She said she did so when Lonnie came back we took her out to the woods. I showed her around and asked her if she wanted to be my nurse. She said she did so we let the other kids in the neighborhood know the clinic was open. 

It took a while before we got anyone to come in but soon they were. We made a couple of benches out of some old lumber and a check-in desk. Lonnie was the receptionist. He’d take their names. Find out what their complaint was and then bring them back.
By now I had talked my mother into getting me a doctor kit from the toy store. Jessica would take their blood pressure and check their eyes and stuff like that. Then she’d tell them to get undressed and to lay on the bed.

I would check them over and make a diagnosis. I had to do a lot of poking and prodding sometimes. But I was thorough.

We did this for about a year. As we got older we lost interest in playing doctor. But Jessica and I stayed close. We would do exams on one another and one thing led to another. Soon we were boyfriend and girlfriend.

I never lost interest in being a doctor and she still wanted to be a nurse. We took biology in middle school and then into high school. It was in tenth grade that we did our first real procedure. 

Unfortunately, it didn’t turn out well.

My mother was diabetic and had to take insulin. I had seen her get sick sometimes and she’d say her ‘sugar was high’ and she’d have to take a shot of insulin. One day my sister, Amanda, got sick and she looked just like my mother did sometimes. My mom said she had the flu and went to the store to get some things and told me to watch my sister.

Jessica and I were concerned because my sister was moaning and sweating. We discussed it and decided that her blood sugar was too high. I don’t know how much my mother took but Jessica and I decided a full syringe was probably about right. I got a syringe and Jessica got the insulin out of the fridge.

I pushed the needle into the bottle, turned it upside down and drew up a full syringe of insulin. I went to my sister and told her I was going to make her feel better. She told me to go away. I told her I had to help her and Jessica held her arm while I gave her the shot.
She screamed at me and wanted to know what the hell I had given her. I told her and she said, “You idiot! I’m not diabetic, you’re going to kill me.” I told her to be quiet and let the medicine do its work.

She began to sweat a lot, worse than she was before. Her hands began to shake, she was saying weird things, and crying. After a while she went to sleep. When Mom got home she asked how Amanda was and I told her I had healed her.

“What do you mean?” she asked.

“I gave her some insulin because she looked like you do when your blood sugar gets too high.”

My mom screamed and ran out of the room. I heard her on the phone and when she came back down the hall and screamed at me, “What is the matter with you? Why would you do that? She’s not diabetic. You killed her. You killed your sister!”

“We were just trying to help,” Jessica said.

My mom spun around and yelled, “You did this too?”

Just then there was a knock on the door and the rescue squad and the police came in. The EMTs went down the hall to check Amanda while the police talked to us. An EMT came down the hall, said, “She’s gone,” and turned and went back down the hall.

The cops grabbed Jessica and me and put handcuffs on us and took us to the police station. We were charged with manslaughter. The judge said we could be released to our parents. Jessica’s mom and dad took her home but my mother refused to come get me. I spent a week in lock up and then was sent to a foster home.

When the trial came around Jessica and I were found not guilty. They said it was involuntary manslaughter because we didn’t intend to kill Amanda and really thought we were helping her.

They did, however, find us both to have low IQs and we were sent to a special school. At least we were together. We became even closer after that and kept to ourselves. Jessica was released on her eighteenth birthday and I was released a year later. She always wrote to me and would come see me.

When I got out we got jobs at a local hospital. I was an orderly and she was a nurse’s aide. We moved in together and worked the same shift, 3 p.m. until 3 a.m. Tuesday through Friday.

My desire to become a doctor never left me. Jessica still wanted to be a nurse. We enrolled in community college and got Associate’s degrees in Biology. Jessica got pregnant right after we graduated. We got married.

I continued to go to college while she stayed home and took care of the baby. We decided that when the baby got old enough Jessica would go back to school too. After a few years, I was finally accepted to medical school. It meant we’d have to move to Maryland from North Carolina. We just didn’t know how we’d pay for school.

One day I got a letter from a lawyer telling me that my mother, who hadn’t spoken to me since the day Amanda died, had passed away and I was sole beneficiary. Enclosed was a check for $500,000!

I graduated medical school with honors. Jessica went to nursing school and finally realized her dream of becoming a nurse. We worked in the same hospital while I went through internship and residency. 

We’re making good money and are very happy. We recently had a baby girl. 

We were at home when she started to cry. Jessica went down the hall to check on her.

She called me. “Babe? Can you come down here and check on Ariana? I don’t like the way she looks.”

I rush down the hall and check my baby girl. Her skin is red, she is sweating and crying.

“What do you think?” asks Jessica?

“I’m not sure. Do you think maybe her blood sugar is too high? We’ve seen this before.”

“You know, I bet you’re right. Let me go get a syringe of insulin to give her.”

7qdcy3,2,2018-01-14,First semester not going well,UncompetitivePumpkin,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/7qdcy3/first_semester_not_going_well/,"Sorry for the wall of text, I need to vent and get thoughts from those who are further in than I am.

I started grad school in STEM this fall. Everything is kind of falling apart on me. My number one goal in selecting programs was finding a department with a healthy work environment and an agreeable advisor, I had been doing research for enough years to know nothing else matters more. I totally misjudged things, my department is a mess, my adviser difficult, and my relationship with one of my labmates contentious. On top of this my spouse (still finishing undergrad) got very sick and had a rough semester, we are worried about getting them an internship, money is tight, I think my project is a bad idea, and I am having a resurgence of psychiatric issues and still haven't figured out my medication. Let me briefly detail this-

Adviser seems to have a mild anger problem. Says confrontational things before they take a long breath and apologize for being ""too aggressive"" as they call it. ""This is wasting my time, If you send me one more thing without a species name italicized..."" and ""Why would you ever do that..."" There has been more I don't care to remember, the tone these things were said in was definitely not playful.

I have been having a lot of problems compartmentalizing since my spouse got sick. Terrible semester for them academically and psychiatrically after missing most classes for 4+ weeks due to physical illness, worried about the future, etc. I am already a somewhat disorganized person but this pushed me over the edge. I have trouble staying organized and motivated enough to work and am so anxious I have trouble answering emails.

A 5th year I have been working with does not like me and is passive aggressive, they say things like ""I mentioned this on monday, I thought you would have enough time during the rest of the week but I'm sorry I didn't know you were so busy!"". They are friendly to me but are constantly criticizing me to our adviser, sometimes for things that are not my fault or are misrepresented. Don't get me wrong I have screwed up some recently and feel totally incompetent, but not for those things. This has lead to two uncomfortable conversations with my advisor. I am normally unflappable and professional when dealing with this sort of thing but I was very obviously fighting back tears when I apologized and confided I was having trouble coping with my spouse's health problems. Things turned out alright and thankfully they were reassuring near the end. They mentioned ""besides everyone but you and another grad student is leaving the lab by the end of the spring semester"" which was nice.

My project is in flux with the central focus drifting since I started on it in the fall. Much of it is new to our lab, hasn't been tried before by anyone, and is in an area that I am not too familiar with. There are so many points along the way that the experiments could fail for technical reasons. I feel like the project is in free fall and am confident it will be a resource sink. Fortunately my adviser is open to ideas and I've written a proposal I am much more confident about, I have a meeting in a few days about it.

I am totally isolated from everyone in my actual department and the students I went through orientation with because I am doing interdisciplinary work in a building no one else from my department is in. I have no friends here and am scared of talking to old ones or meeting people.

I am seeing a psychiatrist and trying to get my medication sorted out, I was doing better for awhile but after a recent medication change I have had trouble doing anything and want to hide under a table. I am distant and spend much of my free time fighting off anxiety by reading papers to the displease of my spouse who feels I am too detached. I have an appointment tomorrow but am worried about how it will go.

I can not emphasize how much worse I am doing than 6 months ago. I am depressed, anxious, lonely and paranoid all the time. I live in fear of a recurrence of psychotic symptoms I suffered from years ago. I feel like I am screwing everything up in lab and life in general. These problems have swallowed up my entire identity. I am reading those articles and anecdotes about mental health problems in grad school and I have never felt something applied to me so well. Everything- Imposer syndrome, anxiety, isolation that je ne sais quoi feeling of impending doom. I went in with eyes wide open knowing that all of that was a risk but my god how did I fall into it so easily without noticing.

Anyway thanks and sorry again for the length."
7qddlg,20,2018-01-14,Eating alone in college? Insecure and alone.. Would love any advice,somebluewaves,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7qddlg/eating_alone_in_college_insecure_and_alone_would/,"I'm about to start my second semester of college. I'm a generally insecure person and I often let the irrational thoughts of ""omg that girl is eating alone?"" Or ""aw poor girl she has no friends"" or things like that consume my mind. I feel bad for others who ate alone last semester, even though honestly they didn't seem to mind. I want to be able to be okay with myself enough to just suck it up and eat alone often for the first few days or even weeks, but I don't know how. 

If you're wondering, I have made a small group of friends.. The thing is they're abroad this semester (my school lets the business kids get internships second semester freshman year. I am a bio major, so no abroad for me) and I feel like a loser for seemingly having no one close this semester. Last semester I took 19 credits (don't do this ur first semester I died lol) and so I hardly had time outside of class and eating and dance to do other clubs I am in, especially towards the end of the semester. I want to include myself in this one club I really loved going to and now will finally have more time to go to, but I get these stupid irrational thoughts like it's too late to ask members to dinner, or ask them to hang out, or just integrate myself into a group of friends who will most likely accept me. 

I guess I'm just stuck because I feel like a loser. I don't care as much about eating alone for breakfast and lunch, but dinner makes me feel really worthless. Last semester I ate in my room or just skipped dinner all together when my friends left after their finals were done. I've never gotten that low before and I feel ashamed. 

Can any of you just relate to me? Or just tell me your story, or just give me some advice? I'm scared I'm going to start gaining weight because my metabolism will drop so much because I don't eat right. If it gets so bad I fear I'll develop an eating disorder. I'm just really embarrassed and feel alone, even though I know I'm not. I just want help. "
7qe1lh,6,2018-01-14,Sitting too long on a verbal return offer,DeltaNegative,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7qe1lh/sitting_too_long_on_a_verbal_return_offer/,"Hi! I'm a soon to be grad trying to figure out how in the world I'm supposed to transition into being a real individual in society, and having a moral(?) issue with my job search. 
  
  
Last summer I interned at a nice company in the heart of San Francisco which was a really nice experience for me, especially being my first internship in the field. Regardless, my manager, many of my coworkers, and even one of the partners seemed pretty satisfied with my performance. Enough so that I was told that if I wanted to work for them after graduation, that I just had to contact the partner. Anyway, school got rather busy for me and our communication was pretty spotty for a while, but when I checked in near the holidays with the partner to see how everyone at the company was doing, he said that if I was still interested, I could again, just let him know.
  
  
Obviously, this isn't a binding contract or even a real offer, but I think that it's definitely a good option that would require less work (if any) to get.
  
  
My hesitation to proceed stems from a few things:

- My financial situation is a bit rough due to some family stuff and the cost of a premium degree, so living in a place like SF could be detrimental to my long term stability
- I'm not certain that I would like living out there compared to the culture near my college town or even back home where there seem to be a good amount of job opportunities (even though a job isn't permanent, I feel like a lack of excitement about living there isn't a great sign?)
- I feel like I could learn more from other potential employers
  
  
I've been applying around and asking friends about potential opportunities, but I'm still searching around for jobs as my last semester kicks off. So, my dilemma is essentially this: I don't know if it's unprofessional or even immoral to ask about their offer at the moment, especially given that I want to weigh my options (even though I haven't received any offers yet). I'm not holding out because I think it's inherently a worse choice, I just feel like I haven't really done the rest of my search justice yet. At the same time, I don't want them to think I just sat around for 3 months just waiting for something more enticing and then reached out because I couldn't find something (I could still see myself working there).
  
  
I guess, ultimately my question is, do you think it's worth asking about their potential offer in the near future and let them know I'm going to be searching for a while (while letting them know I'm just trying to figure out my best course of action), or should I just not contact them while I look around? I want to give them full disclosure, but I don't want them to feel like I wouldn't want to work with them given a different option.


Sorry for the long winded question, but I really wasn't sure who to ask about this."
7qe3nk,0,2018-01-14,"People who have graduated with a STEM degree in your 30's and up, how did you manage your time and budget?",yomidoji,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7qe3nk/people_who_have_graduated_with_a_stem_degree_in/,"I found out the hard way that going into a software career without a Computer Science degree and without networking is a big hurdle. A lot of doors become hard to open in jobs. Right now I have worked several low-paying jobs as a web developer without a CS degree but I'm running into a dead end with pay and jobs. Networking is still an excruciating grind to me, as I could never figure out how to approach it organically, but I'm open to going back to college for CS.

My biggest problem, and I think is also common with older people going back to college: I don't have as much free time as I used to. I don't have the privilege of not having to worry so much about paying bills, putting food on the table, reducing time dedicated to college as I had when I was in college in my early 20's. And I'd rather take daytime courses than go to a night college, to get the full campus experience of networking with professors, internship opportunities, joining profession-oriented groups and clubs, and going to their career fairs. 

I got a Bachelor's degree before, but my degree was in a concentration that was made when the college was scrambling to capitalize on the next big thing but ends up being impractical and scatterbrained for the real world. It was hard to actually build on it for real world work. Out of about 24,000 undergrads in the university only about 20 students were in this concentration, in my graduating year.

How did the people that graduated at an older age get through the 4 years of college? How can they find time to study and also keep from starving themselves and living on the streets when it's hard to balance a full-time job with full-time college? I find many people in their 30's married, or at least living with a partner which helps off-load expenses to another person. Unfortunately I don't live with a partner and don't have a job so all financial responsibilities are going to fall on me. So in my mid 30's and I have to come up with a time management plan."
7qetyv,7,2018-01-14,Reaching out to a start up with no actual experience?,d3f3atedhr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7qetyv/reaching_out_to_a_start_up_with_no_actual/,"Idk exactly why I'm writing this...maybe just to build up my courage. 

I'm a member of another sub in a field that I'm directly interested in working for in the long term. Someone, who seems to be maybe the ceo or some higher up, posted a job posting for their small startup which looks to be maybe like 6 people but idk exact numbers. 

So the great part is their start up is a small niche of this field...and that niche is almost exactly what i have experience in and EXACTLY what I think I'd be good at. The more I think about it the more I want to reach out to them. Ive been doibg lab and research work that can be related to the start up work. 

Thing is, I have NO experience with their tech stack of d.3 amd like node.js and some other stuff. I have web framework experience from class and stuff but with django and rails and idk how those carry over. I'd absolutely be willing to learn while working or even during the final months of my last semester so that id be up to speed more later. 

I have this horrendous fear and anxiety of rejection/embarrassment/etc when it comes to reaching out for this stuff and other things of the like (like references and stuff). On one hand, I LOVE their products and just would love to be a part of it but my lack of experience (no internships, huge projects) and no knowledge of the tech stack makes me not want to send my resume to this guy. I also know they would probably ask for sample work and my github...My lab work is partially complete...i have something to show but I dont think it's that impressive, unfortunately that's all I have. I wouldnt be able to show code either prob and my github doesnt have projects either...

Idk how start up culture is really...is it even worth reaching out, how flexible are start ups normally with noobs anyway? Like how much or what do they expect from people? "

I’m a senior engineer (early 20s) in the tech industry so I’ve been fortunate to make it this far. I have a name that screams North African Muslim. I never really thought it was a problem because it wasn’t hard for me to make friends, turn up, play sports, date, etc. I grew up in NYC so that probably helped compared to other parts of my country.

In college, I stumbled across a few studies that showed that white people had over a 50% chance of getting called up for a job (here’s one where it’s 70%+ and white vs black people in England http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/20541/test-for-racial-discrimination.pdf#page=13). That got me thinking. My senior year I came up with an alias that screamed white boy. Maybe it helped or maybe it didn’t but I more than doubled my job offers compared to the internship offers I had the previous year (7 vs 19). In terms of my resume, nothing changed because I took that summer off. I also didn’t list my coursework or projects because I had plenty of work and research experience.

I’ve also noticed that when I travel, especially in Europe, whenever people read my ID or ask my name I’m looked at like a migrant who’s going to leach off your taxes. 

I’m a type A personality and I’m generally looked upon as a role model in my friend group. I’m proud of who I am and I love my name because it has meaning (both my first and last name translate into an awesome phrase in Arabic).

But I’m starting to wonder if it’s worth fighting an up hill battle to teach those who don’t want to be taught. There’s a lot of ignorance around us and I feel like teaching about names, isn’t going to help. I’ve also thought what if, I’m currently being held back because of my name in my career. I feel like companies won’t have a Muslim name in executive leadership because of the bad PR. What if I decide to run for public office? Imagine the bashing on Twitter Trump would lay out!

What do you all think? Am I just overthinking this whole thing and shouldn’t be worried? Is it actually a problem and if so will keeping my name actually help people? Or should I just set my pride aside and change my name and educate through some other medium?"

* * * 


**COMP** 

Code|Title| Comments
:--|:--|:--                       
**COMP 202** | Intro Comp | Teaches a lot of new concepts if this is your first introduction to CS. However, it is a very fun and rewarding  class. Even if this course is not part of your major, I would recommend taking it as an elective to give programming a try. I had Anil Ada, who I don't believe is a McGill lecturer any longer.
**COMP 206** | Intro to Software | Didn't particularly enjoy this class and ended up skipping quite a bit. Learning the UNIX environment was quite useful though. We also covered C, Python, Perl, HTML &amp; CGI, but each one somewhat superficially. I had Vybihal for this class who is a good prof and is a big proponent of recorded lectures.
**COMP 250** | Intro to CS | This class felt like 202 Extended, and I enjoyed it a lot. It was somewhat abstract, so I'd recommend really focusing on the assignments to develop intuition. You learn your basic data structures (in Java) like arrays, stacks, binary trees, etc. This class is useful if you intend to interview for internship positions, where the coding questions will build off this knowledge. 
**COMP 251** | Data Structures | This class felt like 250 Extended. If you took 250, you probably have to take this class anyways.  Again, looking at data structures, but with more depth. Useful for tech interviews as it teaches you dynamic programming, graph algorithms, red-black trees, etc. Had Jerome Waldispuhl who was great at teaching the concepts clearly.
**COMP 273** | Intro to Computer Systems | This seems to be a pretty polarizing course. Very interesting to learn how the low-level operates even if it's not your primary interest. This class seemed to be divided into Assembly, which I didn't really care too much for, and microcircuit design, which was extremely fun. Basically, we learned to create CPU, RAM, storage, etc. in terms of circuits. I found myself zoning out a lot during the lectures, but when playing around with Logisim and Assembly at home, things just made way more sense. Took this lass with Vybihal again.
**COMP 302** | Programming Paradigms | Had to use SML/NJ as a language, so I wasn't too thrilled about that, but I've heard things have modernized since then. My first look into functional programming which was very different to everything I had seen so far. Very fun and useful concepts in this (albeit quite confusing). However, it can definitely get overwhelming and you'll ask yourself why does anyone thinks like this? Wasn't too time consuming of a course as assignments were relatively easy. Had Friedman as a lecturer.
**COMP 303** | Software Development | Thought I would enjoy this class, but did not at all. Like you would learn all these design patterns (like Flyweight, Observer, etc.) that would make sense on their own, but didn't really translate to useful tools when I code. I feel like maybe it was my own fault for not getting the picture. It definitely did feel like the prof was just too smart for me to understand, and all I was left with was a patchwork of loosely connected knowledge. Definitely a class that I kept zoning out of. 
**COMP 330** | Theory of Computation | I had Prakash for this course which definitely made it a great experience. Prakash is a blessing. Very funky class that doesn't involve any coding or traditional CS. The assignments were quite time-consuming and difficult, but the midterm/final were difficult but fair. The knowledge I gained from this class seems very domain specific, like if you wanted to write your own programming language for example. Still a fun and worthwhile class. 
**COMP 350** | Numerical Computing | This class was all about how computers do their calculations at the low level - think rounding errors, solving linear equations, polynomial interpolation etc. It can be somewhat dry, but what you learn is lowkey useful. Assignments were very fair, midterm and final as well. The prof (Xiao-Wen Chang) said that if you go to class and do the assignments, you'd do well in his course, and that held true. Honestly felt more like a math class than a CS class (which makes sense, since it's somewhat equivalent to MATH 317). 
**COMP 360** | Algorithm Design | Most people seem to not like this class, but I found it interesting with Hatami. I don't know when I'll use the knowledge from this course in the real world though, but it's there, in the back of my head, slowly fading away... The Big-O, and complexity classes stuff was not too fun, but the network fow, dynamic programming, and linear programming were really interesting. There was also a part on PTAS, which I didn't even pretend to understand, but it wasn't tested. 🙏🙏🙏
**COMP 424** | Artificial Intelligence | I had Joelle for this class, who was a great prof. The assignments and evaluations were hard but the content was very interesting and I had no trouble paying attention in class when Joelle taugh it. The grading scheme at the time was also the best grading scheme I have come across at McGill. Starts easy, but gets pretty challenging all at once after the midterm, so be careful. 
**COMP 462** | Computational Biology | Despite the name, this class probably had the most programming involved out of most of my CS classes. You don't really need any prior bio knowledge to go into this class, so I feel many CS students overlook this great class. You learn to solve many real-life problems in the programming language of your choice. Open book exams and assignments that are worth a lot made this class a very stress free experience. Would definitely recommend, especially with Blanchette.

* *Note*: I didn't really use the textbook for any COMP class, so I can't make comment on them.

&amp;nbsp;

**MATH** 
                
Code|Title| Comments
:--|:--|:-- 
**MATH 133** | Linear Algebra | Definitely a very hard freshman course. Starts off with matrices and linear equations, and everything is super simple like using your fingers to multiply matrices together, and then all of sudden eigenvalues and eigenvectors appear out of nowhere and you're lost. Don't let the low course code fool you, keep on top of your work for this class and use the textbook to do problems when you can. 
**MATH 140** | Calculus 1 | You probably have to take this class if you're reading this. Make sure you understand Riemann sums intuitively and just practice lots of problems and you should be good. This was taught by Axel H3 Hundemer, so that definitely made things easier. 
**MATH 141** | Calculus 2 | Cal 1 with integration. This is another math class where practicing a large volume of problems is very important. Definitely harder than Cal 1, and many of the students in Cal1+2 have taken some form of calculus in high school, so if you haven't, I would recommend reading the textbook after class to make sure you keep along. Oh yeah, the textbook is good.
**MATH 222** | Calculus 3 | The single worst experience of my McGill career.
**MATH 223** | Linear Algebra 2 | I didn't really go to this class at all, so I will refrain from making too many calls. Will make you realize how much you've forgotten from 133. However, people seem to do better in the Lin 2 than Lin 1, as they seem to be more prepared this time. The textbook for this class was very useful for me. If it's still the Schaum's Outlines one, I would go get it (it's also like 18 bucks). 
**MATH 235** | Algebra 1 | How many different necklaces can you make with 5 rubies and 5 diamonds? Like fucking billions apparently. This class seemed to appeal to more pure mathy students, of which I do not belong. It did not really interest me, but if you memorize certain theorems and the bigger example problems, you can do well. 
**MATH 242** | Analysis 1 | Again, it's the boi Axel Hundemer showing us how it's done. This class is for if you didn't trust what they taught you in calculus. The content can be somewhat abstract, but Axel will show you the way. Assignments didn't take too much time, but there are a lot of them, and you sometimes do worse than you expected for some reason. I would recommend studying for this class with a partner, and taking turns explaining to each other what is going on, until your definitions eventually match. 
**MATH 314** | Advanced Calculus | Went *ok*. This felt like it would be more useful if I was in engineering. You learn stuff like surface and line integrals, implicit functions and Jacobians. Remember Stokes, Gauss, and Green? You learn their theorems too. It is a very structured course, with distinct blocks that you can learn and practice. Feels like you make progress when you study. Still pretty hard though. 
**MATH 323** | Probability | From what I've heard, this course may depend heavily on your professor. I had Anderson and I really enjoyed this class. You might have to memorize distributions and their expected values, which is the not-so-fun part. But I feel like what you learn from this class is very useful, and it helps to think of each distribution in terms of simple examples. Textbook is decent, but not critical. Would recommend.
**MATH 324** | Statistics | Didn't really attend this class, and really should have. The content from that class makes sense to me now, in retrospect, after having to learn it after the fact. In that sense, this is class that can seem really hard or really easy depending on whether you took the time to truly go through the material. I would like to take this class again. Took it with Steele who is actually a really great prof with helpful notes.
**MATH 340** | Discrete Structures 2 | This class was divided into 3 very distinct sections, which made it much easier to study for: Graph Theory (fun), Discrete Probability (alright), Enumeration (alright). These topics really don't overlap at all. Otherwise, the content was easy enough to digest, except that one random section on the Balls in Bin problem. Had Norin as a prof, who is extremely smart, but it felt like he was maybe a little bit too smart for us.
**MATH 410** | Majors Project | Definitely recommend if you are looking into going to grad school. Independent study with a prof on a topic that you and your prof decide. It is largely self-motivated, so take that into account. Try to keep working on it over the course of the semester if you can.
**MATH 423** | Regression | This course was taught by David Stephens, who is my favourite prof at McGill, so this review could be biased. This was a really good course that taught the fundamentals of regression, and had several real-world examples in R. The prof always sends extra handouts/practice problems to help you out for assignments/midterms/finals, so if you read through them thoroughly, everything should be swell. 
**MATH 447** | Stochastic Processes | One of the only classes which I enjoyed yet still did poorly in. David Wolfson was great, content was interesting, I didn't do well. I might have been studying wrong, so be careful I guess? The textbook does not help at all, that's for sure, I felt like it was way too advanced for the notes, thus wasting your time. Still glad I took the course though.
**MATH 524** | Non-parametric Statistics | Very cool stats class, and Genest is a great teacher. This is a very small class (~10 people), but everyone seemed to do well. The assignments were tough and time consuming but the professor adequately prepared you for the midterm and final such that everyone did well. 
**MATH 545** | Time Series | This was potentially one of my most useful classes at McGill. Definitely not easy, and there will probably not be any curve. Taught by Stephens again, so you know you he'll keep you well prepared. He hosts weekly optional tutorials if you feel like you're falling behind. This is a time consuming class for sure, with a heavy final, but I would still recommend it.

* *Note*: Many of the math classes have optional midterms with highly weighted finals (80%+). Write the midterm like it was a real one!

These languages don't go through huge changes every year or so.

But now I'm teaching myself web development, since I learned PHP and some basic angular2 stuff from my college internships. My current job is Netsuite development, which is backend JavaScript on the Rhino engine (yeah...I know).  

I'm trying to ""bridge the gaps"" so to speak with everything I've learned with Colt Steeles Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. It's going pretty quickly for me since I'm already a professional developer (on the bootstrap part right now, which is where most of the totally new stuff lies for me)...but I feel like by the time I'm good enough with all the tools I want to use...it will all be outdated; especially since my current job isn't really true web development (meaning I'm doing stuff at work...and then going home to do even more coding in an attempt to stay relevant).

So I'm wondering, just how ""up-to-date"" do I need to really be before I could theoretically move to a more typical web-dev job? It's got me thinking, since it seems that plenty of people still stick with things like PHP, angular1, jquery, etc. Heck, like I said, I don't get to use the new stuff at my job (although I did get to make a tiny electron app for a client). 

I'm thinking of finishing his course, finishing an angular 2 course that I really like, and then start working on a mobile app I want to make with the Ionic framework. So what if I end up using Bootstrap 3 instead of 4, so what if I accidentally do something without some Angular feature that totally would've made it easier.  Then if I get that done I'd like to use it as something to show off to employers. Thoughts? I feel like at some point you just gotta make an app, website, or whatever and just hope for the best."

I'm learning a lot all at once, and between trying to get good grades (to help pay for my education), read all the textbook material and do all my lab work, I don't even have time to create something on the side (as a project). I'm also slow at learning in general, which really impacts the time I have for school. I got a 3.6/4.0 GPA last semester, but not without working constantly and letting my mental and physical health suffer.

I ask this because I'm currently writing my resume for an internship, I don't have all that much. I've learned C, Perl, Bash and Python (which I barely remember). This semester, I'm learning Java and I'll have a final project (developing a full front-end for a database they give us), but other than that, I don't have anything else to put on my resume. I have previous work experience, but they're not relevant to CS.

But I have no real experience.  I know C++ primarily, some Python, and know enough to be very familiar with data structures, like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc. We've programmed plenty of things related to those, but I guess somehow I feel as though I still haven't done anything of worth to put on a portfolio?

So what I'm wondering is first, is it plausible for me to start building up my portfolio with projects now to be able to apply for internships for this summer?

And where can I find projects that might bridge the gap between knowing these basics, and actually using them in a meaningful way? 

Also, even though I've somewhat done the equivalent coursework of a second semester sophomore in undergrad, is it viable for me to even look for an internship? Is there anything else I can do?

My boss recently told me that I am due for a promotion within the next few months, which will basically be my 1 year mark at this software company.  However, I often feel that my teammates and I are overworked, and we are rarely able to fully test our features to completion since we have too many new features coming in to keep up with and a lot of old bugs that developers don't have time to work on.  Because of this, I feel pretty unsatisfied with my job, as I feel that I am never able to finish my projects.  The company is small enough that I feel as though I am making an impact, but I'm not sure if this situation will improve for a long time.  I am also interested in eventually becoming a developer instead of a QA engineer, but I don't think I'd enjoy doing that at my current company.  

I found some other positions at other companies that I think I qualify for now that I have some experience under my belt (~1 year at this company, and I'm ~2 years out of college where I had some small internships).

Do you think I should continue working at my current company until the 1 year mark, probably getting a promotion/raise, or should I apply to other companies sooner than that?  

My hypothetical pros and cons of switching jobs are the following:
Pros:
  I would (hopefully) join a company where QA engineers are not as swamped as they are at my company.
  Better work life balance. Currently working ~9 hours / day with occasional on-call duties.
  Better benefits / paid time off.  Currently getting ~15 vacation days per year, which isn't bad, but could be better based on what I hear about other companies.
  Get to learn different technologies.  I feel that I am plateauing at my current company, as most of my work involves knowledge based on my company's product.  

Cons: 
  Would likely reset the process of getting a promotion / raise.
  The risk that the workload may be just as tough at a different company.
  Would need to repay a signing bonus if I leave before the 1 year mark (~5k, not too bad).

Any input or advice is welcome.  I am interested in hearing if my pros and cons seem realistic, and what your thoughts are in general about switching to a new company.  From what I hear from colleagues at other companies, they feel similar time crunches, so I am curious to see if other people generally feel stressed / rushed at their companies or if things seem more under control.

My current employer, whom I have been working an internship with since October, presented me a full-time contract. The contract scares the shit out of me. 

BACKSTORY: I was let go of my last job towards  the beginning of my last semester back in early September. They were a small company downsizing due to a huge financial blow, and I was a perpetual intern. We left off positively [as far as I know]. Current boss approached me a few weeks into me looking for another job, having heard about me from a professor who I was using as a reference. Got me going with an internship in late October. 

The internship contract was exactly the same as the one I'm being offered now, just with the ""Term"" clause [clause 3] indicating that it was 90 day internship. At the time I was just desperate to get through my last semester, and I was about a month from not being able to pay my bills. I signed it. 

https://imgur.com/a/rvDGt

Imgur link is the contract currently on the table, but is 99% identical to the internship contract I signed. 

My degree is a MS in Information Security. What has me concerned is the Non-Compete Clause [section 5, page 3] and the Shop-Right clause [section 9, page 5/6] screwing me out of potential opportunities when I leave here. I'm both scared that I already screwed myself by signing this in the internship and that I may screw myself further if I sign this one. 

I've brought up my concerns to the employer and they have told me that I may present an addendum (?) to them for them to add to any particular clause to be more comfortable with it. I have no idea how to word that broad enough or specifically enough to protect me. 

MY QUESTIONS:

1.) Did I screw myself by signing the internship contract that looked just like this?

2.) Is the internship contract enforceable, provided that it's the exact same contract [but with a term limit]? A 5 yr non-compete for a 90 day internship?

3.) Any ideas of what I should demand on a new contract to not be screwed out of future prospects?

4.) Could this contract in it's current form fuck me out of future prospects?

5.) Any other red flags/huge problems with this contract I should be concerned about?

* Wife and I met summer 2016, she was here on internship visa (J-1)

* Dated all summer; toward the end she found out she wasn't going to be allowed to continue with her master's degree at her home country university, so she made plans to apply for a work visa &amp; got her J-1 extended by 3 months

* She didn't meet the qualifications of an H1B visa. We foolishly thought 'well we love each other even though we've only been together 6 months, why not get married and she can stay?' and proceeded to do so

* Married 1/19/17, interview done, conditional green card received 12/15/17

* No surprise, nearly a year later after it has been made painstakingly clear the relationship is toxic, I told her I'm going to divorce her (should have notified her with the filing, I know that now). After screaming at me, crying, a little pleading and then more screaming, she got really calm and just said **""You know what? It's fine, I'll just file abuse charges against you""**

A Google search led me to [this](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2010/11/a_husband_spurned.html) and a few other articles that describe the fraudulent maneuver my wife has apparently found out about &amp; plans to execute to stay in the country. I am freaking out, mainly because **I have never so much as breathed on her too hard before, let alone hit her or verbally abused her**; she doesn't have any marks, pictures, witnesses, or any other possible form of proof of me doing so because it does not exist. But that doesn't seem to matter in these cases. 

Obviously I need to lawyer up.. And I plan to as soon as humanly possible. But for peace of mind I want to ask here:

- If she goes ahead with the fraudulent claims &amp; I am already gone from the house, staying with friends, will a warrant for my arrest still be served? Is there anything I can do to avoid being arrested? 

- Are there any preemptive things I should do to disallow/prepare for her conditional filing of Form I-751 with a waiver to the joint filing requirement with fraudulent claims of abuse etc.?

- Has anyone gone through something similar and/or known someone who has? How did it end?

First, some background: I am a female poc in my late-late twenties living in the Bay Area and have decided to make the switch to become a software engineer. For the past few months, I have been taking community college courses and have been doing some self-study at home. I would like to earn a masters (conversion course) in computer science to round out my transition. I have found two programs (one in the Bay and one in London) that I really like but I’m having a hard time deciding which way to go.

The dilemma – I have always wanted to live abroad. Specifically, London. It has been my dream since I was fifteen years old when I first travelled there. I was unable to study abroad in college because of financial/family circumstances and have finally found myself in the position where I can make it a reality.  There are a  few one-year conversion MSc courses in London (and just outside) that look promising and I think I would have a good shot at gaining admittance. Here are the pros/cons as I see them:

The pros:  I get to live my dream! It’s a one-year program (less time outlay)

The cons: I’m limited in the number of hours I can work per week (i.e. I can’t do a summer internship ☹ and will not have any work experience when I’m job hunting); moving is going to be a pain (I have a cat and will probably need to live in an airbnb for a month); and I’ll have to live on and earn much less than what I currently make. Plus, I would plan on coming back to the Bay once the program is over and am unsure about how difficult it would be to find a job, etc. 

As I stated before, I live in the Bay Area and there’s a program at a local college that is a two-year MA in Interdisciplinary Computer Science. The class size is small and there are many opportunities to participate in hackathons, network and attend conferences as well as the other myriad opportunities (mentorship, etc) that come from living in the Bay Area.

The pros: Lots of career and networking opportunities; I don’t have to give up my rent-controlled apartment; I can do a summer internship and can work as many hours as I’d like during my classes.

The cons: It’s a two–year program, I’m slightly worried that employers won’t look favorable upon the fact that it’s an MA 

I know in my heart of hearts what the obvious and practical choice is, but I’ve been doing the obvious and practical thing my entire life. I’m worried that this might be the last time that I might have a shot at living my dream of living in London. I’ve made numerous pro/con lists and now I thought I would ask for advice from the wider community. Do you think its possible that I could move to London and not have it be a setback when I’m just starting out? Please be gentle, I’m a newbie to all this and while it may not seem like it, this journey of figuring out which way to go has been stressful.

I'm a junior at a vocational high school near Boston, MA, where I'm in the computer programming shop. Summer's coming up, and my school also has a co-op program that allows students to go work somewhere instead of coming to shop. (Shop weeks and academic weeks alternate, so I could be out on co-op every other week.) As such, I'd like to find an internship or job of some sort in tech that I could be doing in both of those time slots, because of the resume and career value that they provide. However, I haven't managed to find anything yet, so I'm wondering what I should do to try to find some of those opportunities.

I like to think my level of experience is pretty good. My teacher feels that, as an adult at least, I could go out now and get a job in .NET development with my knowledge and portfolio. I've worked on several large(r) scale projects, which are all showcased on a website I wrote from scratch. I do a lot .NET desktop development and more recently Xamarin mobile development. More recently I've taken an interest in machine learning; I completed Andrew Ng's machine learning class on Coursera (after some struggle for sure; I didn't have anyone around to help me and it was not easy!) and am working through a couple more courses on different topics within it. I've also been going to local meetups for .NET development and for machine learning and networking with people in both fields. I have about 10 connections on LinkedIn from those meetups; not a very big network but I think it's better than a lot of people around my age have.

So obviously all of that, including asking the people I know if they know of any opportunities, hasn't led to anything. So I feel I might need to start taking some more action to make something happen. My LinkedIn profile is marked as ""Open"" to tech internships and similar, but all that's caused was a recruiter messaging me about a senior data scientist position. I know I am not at all qualified for such a position so I didn't respond, assuming it was a generic form letter; was that a mistake?

Would it be a terrible idea to message people at companies on LinkedIn or send emails to companies asking about internships? As I said, I'm best with .NET development, but I'd love to find some way to do work related to machine learning. I think being around Boston is a big advantage in this regard; there's a lot of companies around here at the cutting edge of machine learning and programming in general.

If I were to send out emails/messages, should I be mostly targeting startups or big, established companies? I think big companies are more likely to have the resources to spare on someone who may not necessarily match up to a real developer (I'd work very hard of course but that's just the reality), but they tend to have more red tape and bureaucracy that makes it difficult. Especially if they don't have a program for high school students in the first place; most places have a college student program but getting a high school student in there so far has seemed like moving mountains. The alternative is smaller, more startup-style companies. I don't think these places have nearly as much resources to hire a less experienced intern as I said, but there is much less organizational inertia to get in the way.

In summary, what can I do to find an internship or similar opportunity? Emails, LinkedIn messages, in-person networking, etc? And should I focus on larger companies or on smaller companies? Thanks!"

I am 22 european and I am about to finish my BSC in mathematics with a specialization in computational maths before summer 2018. Throughout my studies I've had courses about graph theory, computability, complexity, automata, recursive functions and objective oriented programming, some were on par with MS students. Besides my education on those subjects (I am guessing I should name them as theoretical cs in my CV?), I have a decent programming background but nothing spectacular (mostly some simple projects in VB, C#, python and Imacros and an app deployed for personal use in Windows mobile 6.1 some years back).  So I would like your advice on those two questions:  
-Provided I focus on working on some projects I have in mind (either in an android app using node,java or some ML concepts with tensorflow) and enriching my skills by learning angular and doing some reading on data structures, heaps, hash tables, leetcode exercises etc (any advice on other things I could focus on would be also helpful) do I have a decent chance of landing an internship/ job? Also would it be possible time-wise to start a MS in CS in my country while interning or working (or maybe it would be better not to apply at all and start the MS full time)  
-In law school there was a very interesting course about legal informatics, I've studied the course's notes and I was wondering if I could rather choose that path as a DPO or sth similar, especially if I could find some relevant MS in Europe?  
thanks in advance

The world would be just the same without me as it currently is with me. I feel like that because in the end, I'll just live an ordinary boring life. Whenever I start a personnal project, I work on it for max 1 week and then I abandon it. 

I also hate my parents most of the time. They're always so oversensitive and I feel like I must be careful about everything I say near them, as if I was walking on a rope. This is the same for my gf's mother, although I don't hate her.

Worst of all, I feel like I don't deserve to complain. After all, I've had a rather easy life. I went to highschool and college without much difficulty, don't have financial problems and currently have an internship at the governement of my country in IT.

I'm a CS student about to transfer to a 4 year university. I recently finished a semester and I'm free until the next one.
I want to know what I should get into considering my background and interests. Basically, I'm looking for some direction.
 
Here's a list of classes I've taken so far:

* Beginer &amp; intermediate programming in C++
* Computer architecture and organization (Machine code, Assmbly)
* Intro to data structures
* Object-oriented programming
* All math classes required for the major up to Differential Equations

Here's a few things I dabbled in during my internship:

* Linux, bash scripting
* ASP.NET with C# ( very little working knowledge of C#)
* HTML/CSS/JS (very little working knowledge of JS)
* Databases (MySQL)
* Adobe Photoshop &amp; Illustrator for designing UI

Here's classes I'm currently enrolled in on Coursera:

* From NAND to Tetris
* Intro to Swift programming


I'm naturally good at design and illustration, so I want to get into web and application development for iOS. That's why I took the Swift course on Coursera but it turns out it's outdated (they're teaching Swift 2). I'm not sure I even want to commit to Swift if it's still a work in progress by Apple. Some of my developer friends tell me I should consolidate my knowledge of JS and look into React Native and/or Angular. I don't even know what those are at this point. All I know is I want to be able to design and develop a working product from scratch.

But my interests aren't limited to creating web and mobile applications. I also enjoy low level stuff and I want to learn things like: 

* Networking
* Operating Systems
* Compilers
* Neural Networks

I've also taken great interest in crypto recently. Should I wait until I've taken algorithms before I dive deeper into it?

Any advise is greatly appreciated!

I'm currently in my second year of my CS degree, and I'm with my schools CO-OP program, but recently I've been thinking of declaring a second bachelors and completing a Math degree as well (it would only take an extra year)

The only issue is unless I want to make my terms absolute hell, I need to take a couple of courses over this summer, which would mean I need to drop CO-OP, and not do any internships over the summer. Between dropping it and pursuing both majors, I think it's unlikely that they would let me back in for next summer.'s internships either, meaning I would either have to get one on my own, which would not be an easy feat, or just not do an internship.

From my understanding and a friend's opinion, getting just the CS degree + internship experience would probably get me a job quicker (out of school 1 year sooner, etc), but having the two bachelor degrees could open the door to some more interesting jobs, while still leaving the option for grad school open (my GPA alone isnt bad, but might not be enough)

What do you guys think is a better move career-wise? Would I miss out on a lot of chances not having the internship experience? Any other advice appreciated.

EDIT: Some extra info, if that helps with my future employability/chances of getting an internship on my own

- from a very average school  
- GPA ~85% major and cumulative   
- Decent results in ACM ICPC so far  
- CS degree would have a specialization in A.I.  
- both degrees are honours   

I'm going to try and get some decent projects done over the summer as well

It has been 6 months since I got out of college with a BS CS degree and just recently I've been applying to some places (~15) and haven't yet gotten to any interviews; not even the personality checks. I am constantly getting either no responses back or the 'sorry not a fit' email.

The places I have been applying are usually for either software engineering/developing, data engineering, or frontend and the postings are usually a day to week old (have been using BuiltinNYC recently). These roles that I'm applying to are either lower on the years experience level (1-2 years) or do not say an experience of an X amount of years is required. These companies are varied in sizes and are mostly in the NYC area and for every single one that has a cover letter section, I write one expressing a true desire to be a part of the company's mission. So far I have not yet applied to a place where I don't think the company's tech/mission isn't cool.

During my last 1.5 years at school I worked an average of 35 h/w as a developer operations engineer for mostly Microsoft products like Azure, SharePoint, and MSSQL (I dropped working from the last semester to focus on school and decided not to go back because I wanted to be more of a developer). Because I did an average of 35 h/w I delayed my graduation by one year and took 5 years to graduate (I did also switch from civil engineering during my second year). I thought that could get me some boost up to at least not get denied at this stage of the application, but it seems like maybe taking that 6 month break after school was a bad idea. I had to take this break because I just felt really burnt out after graduating and decided to get back into shape.

Was taking that break a bad idea and how can I bounce back from that? Should I be applying to internships at this point? Maybe just forget about applying to companies I want to work for and just play the numbers game? Or is it normal to get this many rejections so early?

Am I making a big mistake?,rppzrq,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7qtoxa/small_npo_right_out_of_college_am_i_making_a_big/,"Yesterday I received an offer from an NPO to come on as a software engineer. The pay is competitive, and it's in a place I want to live. My concern is that I am making a bad first move as a SWE out of college. I'd be working on a team with another junior dev, and a team lead (engineer with 10+ years experience) to create an Angular app from the ground up. The NPO has a 25 person tech team and there a few senior devs, but most of their experience has been working at this org as far as I can tell.

In some ways I see this as an opportunity to have an impact as a junior dev and gain a lot of experience quickly, but I'm worried I won't be adequately mentored and will end up learning bad engineering practices. I'm also worried about how this will look on my resume going forward. I'm pretty sure I don't want to stay at this org for the long term (it seems like 5+ years is the norm). 

A little about me: I graduated a year ago from a top 20 CS school in the US with a 3.8 GPA and 3 years internship experience at smaller companies. I've been unemployed since August, largely due to marketing myself poorly. Since rewriting my resume I've been hearing back from more recruiters and am actively interviewing at a few other places.

Any advice would help me out a lot"

Right now I'm a junior looking for a summer internship so I can hopefully return full-time for a position. I have an offer from Southwest Airlines and one from AT&amp;T.

AT&amp;T has brand name recognition and higher pay with a better chance of a return offer but I've heard the work environment is terrible with greater chances of layoffs.

I'm a account executive at an advertising agency. I've been with my company for a few years now and have been doing very well, starting as an intern and making my way up to Executive. I volunteer for all the inner agency assignments (helping run workshops, etc) and I have a reputation as a workhorse in the agency.

Back in July I was unhappy after finding out I was under-paid compared to my coworkers at the same level and sought to get a raise. After my boss denied my raise attempt, I started looking around and found a job at another agency which offered to pay me significantly higher.

After much internal deliberation, I resigned, only to have my company counter offer by raising my salary and offering me to move to a different account that had less oversight, so more room to manuever. Every senior C-level manager that day ended up sitting with me and trying to convince me to stay onboard.

Long story short, I accepted the counter offer and I've never been happier. I have more autonomy and my new account challenges me. That was 7 months ago now. 

Recently, I found out that I've been passed for a promotion and people who have been there the same time as me are getting promoted to the Supervisor level this year. I have a feeling that quitting and forcing managements hand ended up blackballing me at the company, that now I'm getting passed up for opportunities to grow my career.

I'm currently in my last year of studying mechanical enginnering but things aren't going well. First of all i never had strong feelings about ME and all these years i've been just going through the motions. I picked ME because people advised me to become an engineer and I excelled in physics and maths in high school. 

I chose ME over EE because i was more suited to classical physics. First year in uni was a breeze, i studied regularly and got good grades. Second year i started struggling a bit and had to retake a course in my third year. I started to lose motivation at this point but decided to push through hoping that it would all work out in the end. I noticed my classmates enthusiastically doing all sorts of projects, they were absolutely bursting with ambition. In all my time at uni I've absolutely never felt that, every project was a bother in my eyes.

I had to retake some more courses in my third year and that meant i would have to prolong my studying for a year. I felt horrible but still managed to pull through somehow. During my internship i was almost at breaking point, the people there were kind and helpful but every cell in my body was telling me: ""I don't want to do this, I would rather kill myself"". After my internship i had an exam left which i had to pass in order to continue studying, i couldn't retake it anymore and all my focus went into studying so i wouldn't let my parents down. I didn't even think to stop and ask myself why don't I quit right then and there.

I managed to pass that course and I'm in my final year now. But things couldn't be worse now. I don't even have the will to get up in the morning, some days i just stay in bed all the time. People started noticing this and started asking if i was sick. I told my parents i want to quit ME and study programming considering how i chose exclusively programming courses as my electives and it's the only thing i had passion for and looked forward to during my time at uni.

My parents told me i should finish up my ME bachelor's degree and then i could purse whatever i wanted. They don't understand that i don't want anything to do with mechanical engineering ever. For the first time in life I found my passion, the thing I absolutely love doing - programming, and i wasn't allowed to pursue it. The thing is, my parents won't let me quit ME.

i’ve always been passionate about CS, and have self taught myself my whole life, which is something i’m decent at. my life goal is to have a software engineering job at a respectable company (which is subjective to most people at who’s respectable) but ya get my point.

my question is, what can i personally do to maximize my chances of success with internships and companies when i’m competing against guys who come from more developed CS programs? this can be resources to study, tips for portfolio/resume, extra curricular stuff to do, etc. i was even thinking of becoming a TA in a class because i have such a passion for CS. anyways, thanks in advance for reading over, any and all feedback is appreciated.

The issues is this company does not run a hosted exchange and no real Microsoft servers or Active directory.

I have about 10 scholarships/awards on my resume. I once got to go to San Diego for free to attend a conference, because I was the *only CS major that applied*. This was in a field I was completely unfamiliar with. I have had internships every summer, and usually more than one offer. This summer I get to do research out of the country, completely paid for.

On my resume, under the ""Projects"" section, I have links to two portfolios (although I don't know if I should call it that just yet) that contains all the important projects I have worked on.


The first link is a link to codepen.io and has all my javaScript/html/css projects that I have worked on my own time outside of school. The second link I have included on my resume is a link to my Github account and I want it to have all my projects I have built using C. 


My Github page does not have any projects yet, but I was wondering what is the most efficient way to build a portfolio on Github? I googled this and it seems there are two options: ""start a project"" and ""add a repository"". Before I upload all my C files, I want to make sure I know what I am doing and don't make my Github account look too ""newby"" or look like shit. Even from researching, I am a little confused on if I should upload my C files using ""add a repository"" or ""create a new project"". I don't have actual work experience in programming so it is very important to me that I know exactly how to build a professional portfolio on Github. Any advice or links are appreciated.


I also have another question: All my javascript/html/CSS code is on codepen.io and I feel like it is redundant to transfer all this code to my Github account. Is it ok if I leave all this code on codepen.io and just put all of my C projects on Github?

Right now I have a systems engineer type job reserved for me in the army. I'm currently taking an AP Computer Science class in school that is the reason for me wanting to major in cs and go for a programming career. In the class we use code.org for most of our lessons and our AP project for this semester will be making our own apps. I really enjoy everything we've been learning about and I've been able to understand everything pretty quickly. I plan on going to the University of Arizona in Tucson because that's where I've grown up and the high school I attend seems to work with the UofA in a lot of things. Plus, many students from my high school get accepted to the UofA with most of the seniors going there right away. My Army recruiter was talking about how I will likely end up around $80k in debt if I go to college right away and I'll be making only around $45k a year since its so difficult to get a job. He also talks a lot about how I'll have to get a part-time job and lessen my classes to work and end up taking 6 years to graduate. So my main questions are

1. Is the training in the military any different from what is taught in college or that I would learn from internships?

2. Is going into the military just for it to pay for college or get some experience a good idea?

3.  Will trying to get certs while in college help me just as much?

4. I will likely have to get some loans if I go with college, how quickly do people usually finish paying off their loans in the cs field?

5. While in college, is getting internships and getting certs the main things I should focus on other than getting the degree?

6. I'm open to relocating after college, what are the main cities I should look into?

7r6nrb,1,2018-01-17,Foot-in-the-door advice for finance graduate,throwawaycareerhalp,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/7r6nrb/footinthedoor_advice_for_finance_graduate/,"Hi all, long time lurker, first time poster here (using a throwaway).

I've seen some people on here receive some really good advice, and there are some really knowledgeable folk on here who (without realizing it) have helped guide me through a lot of choices I've faced regarding my future career, so I'm basically just after a bit of advice regarding my personal situation. Any advice/criticism/constructive-insults would all be extremely valued and appreciated.

I'm a 23 year-old Australian postgraduate student (master of applied finance) in a top school with 1 year to go. My WAM at the moment is sitting at a rather average 75.5%. I completed my undergraduate studies in 2016 at an average university (reputable, but not a top school). My course was a double degree in finance (credit average) and IT (distinction average).
At this stage in my life, my primary goal/ambition/dream is to land a decent graduate role, ideally as an analyst but at the very least a position relevant to my studies that will help me into corp finance in some capacity. I'm not about to type a big long post asking how to land a grad position in IB at Goldman Sachs, instead I would be hugely fulfilled securing a grad analyst or consultancy role at a boutique, BB or Big 4. I feel this goal is reasonable (but frankly, still ambitious).


My situation is essentially this;
During my undergrad, I never secured a finance internship/summer analyst position, as I blissfully unaware of just how important they were, which has been a really huge regret for me. After graduating though, I secured an entry-level consultant position in the wealth management department at a Big 4. Unfortunately, this role ended up primarily being a customer relations role, and whilst it gave me exposure to the corporate environment and the operations of the firm, it wasn't a position that was going to really get me anywhere, or allow me to ""get my teeth into it"".
After working there for just under a year, I made the decision to leave the firm and enroll at a top university to do my masters (a 1.5 year course). So far, I have loved it.


My reasons for doing this are basically the following;

1) Given my failure to get an internship or summer analyst position during my undergrad years, i surmised that this would give me another option to apply for summer analyst positions in my penultimate postgrad year, which in turn would increase my chances of landing a grad position.

2) It would give me a chance to improve my GPA, as my undergrad GPA in finance was lower than i would have liked.

3) It turns out, after working full time for a year, being a student again sounds pretty great!


My questions are;

1) In Australia, summer analyst positions take place December 2018-February 2019. Grad positions generally start in February 2019. Applications for both open in a month or so. If i continue to study full time, I will graduate in November this year. Meaning I should TECHNICALLY be applying for graduate positions in a month or so. However, I am considering reducing my study load and stretching my remaining studies over an extra semester (graduating July 2019), so that I can apply for summer analyst positions for the upcoming cohort as a penultimate student. If I can acquire an internship/summer position of any capacity for the end of this year, this will allow me to apply for grad positions next year with a better chance of success. If this worked out, I would graduate in July 2019, but have to wait until Jan/Feb 2020 to start the grad role, but to me, it would be worth it. I know of other people doing this, but what are your thoughts? Basically, I don't want to apply for graduate positions this year, be unsuccessful, and find myself as a graduate next year without any kind of analyst experience (again).

2) If I were to do this, I am thinking of enrolling in the CFA program whilst my study load is reduced. The coursework in my masters has been designed to be in line with the CFA curriculum, so studying for each is not entirely mutually-exclusive. Further to this, I just received a scholarship offer for the level 1 exam, so I have the opportunity to enroll and give it a shot whilst its like $250. If I am successful, how much do you think this would help my situation? My understanding, is only slightly.

3) Let's say this all falls over and I'm not able to secure an internship, or a grad position (I'm very much aware of the competition in this field, and that this is certainly a possibility). What type of roles would you suggest I pursue after graduating, with my goal of landing an analyst or consultancy position. All I would want is a foot-in-the-door to get into corp fin.

A couple of side bits of info;
I've started a bit of volunteer work in my uni's finance/investment societies, helped out volunteering at a few charity programs over the last year, 

Feeling really flat, and really stressed thinking about this next year, and the potential ways things could turn out. If anyone has any advice, or tips on what alternative roles I could pursue if this doesn't work out, I would be truly grateful.

Thanks again guys"
7r6rjr,1,2018-01-17,Rejecting offer after accepting!,thefancycow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7r6rjr/rejecting_offer_after_accepting/,"I got an internship offer from a mid-sized local company a few months ago and accepted it. It was supposed to start in May this year. 

Today I got an offer after months of interviews from a dream Big 4 company which starts soon and ends a few days after the date the other one was supposed to start so the times overlap by 3 weeks. 

The big 4 company won’t move the start date or the length. The small company only hires once a year so they also most likely won’t move the start date. 

The big 4 has been a dream since the beginning and the project is really interesting and the other company’s project is something that I would never actually use in real life so it’s not as interesting to me. 

I want to ask the small company to see if they can move it but I feel bad for having to make them make changes after accepting it and I would also feel bad for rejecting. At the same time I don’t want to reject the big 4 offer because I don’t think I would be able to pass again and would probably regret it in the future.

What should I do? Does anyone have experience rejecting a company after accepting their offer? I would love to hear anyone else’s experience on this.

She does not manage the day to day of our counseling center. That would be me. I have been here for a bit over four years. Over time I have taken over collecting our statistics, grant writing, supervising interns, and so on. 

In April of 2017 I was approached by my boss' boss, let's call him C, to become the supervisor of our little department. H would become a consultant and would lose supervisory duties. Now, in our agency things move at a glacial pace. So, I was not expecting anything to happen soon. In June 2017 the budget was approved with included my little 2K/year raise. I was told that it would be a couple weeks before things were ready to go. That was the last I heard about it. There has been no communication regarding this change in status. 

The week before Christmas an old intern of mine texted me to see if I would be interested in working for her agency as a clinical supervisor. This position would have lots more responsibility but likely more pay. So, I applied. I received a call last and was offered an interview on 1/22. I want to go to this interview with eyes wide open, so I approached C to ask about the promotion yesterday. He told me that I would know more today. There has been no communication from him today. Now, I am off site on Wednesdays, but he knows this. He still didn't call or email. 

Yesterday, I was ready to tell him I had an interview lined up to keep my options open. But after today I am angry since there has been no communication when he said there would be. I plan on keeping the interview even if the position is offered later this week. 

Should I tell C about the interview? Should I accept the new position if offered? Am I justified in being angry? I really don't trust him anymore since this lack of communication is a red flag in my book.  "

Been professionally working for 5 years as architect/computer graphics generalist. Have a Bachelor and Master of Architecture. Did CEGEP Pure&amp;Applied (long time ago).
I'd apply for Fall 2018, starting school at the age of 28.

- Do I even have a slim chance of landing tech internships at this age during summer?

- Would like to reintegrate job market asap

- Would like to focus on core software, rather than hardware (noticed that SOEN@McGill is Electrical/circuits heavy)

- Engineer title is still enticing if it can help with career advancement

- Would basically graduate at 31-32 yo in ~4-4.5 years. Ideally would like to be employable at that age and not feel left behind.

So the good ol' question here is, CS or SOEN for my situation?

The plan would be to keep working fulltime and save some $ until Sept. while following some Udacity classes on C++, CS fundamentals, and a higher level language. And maybe publish a few mini projects on Github as exercises. 

Any other tips greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

If I was looking for a frontend internship, then it would probably be a bad idea to use a premade template right?

7r80ue,3,2018-01-18,"Accepted Internship offer from company affiliated with my college and outside program, Another offer",LostSoulBigCity,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7r80ue/accepted_internship_offer_from_company_affiliated/,"Hey guys,

I am currently a college student in my third year of study in computer science. This year is a pivotal year in the development of my career since it is the last summer I have for an internship. Last semester, I was hustling to land an internship for the summer. I received a few offers late last semester and chose the best one I had at that time worried that I was hearing nothing from many of the ones I actually wanted. Meanwhile, after I made this choice, I heard back from a few companies that I was very excited about. During this process, I somehow managed to score an internship with one of the ""Big 4"" and am even in the final round with another. I am not sure what I should do at this point having already committed to an internship a few months ago. If I give up the ""Big 4"" internship, I feel like I will regret it. On the other hand, I look unprofessional and dishonest saying no to a company that helped me rush through the process as short deadlines loomed over me, had an executive take the time to talk to me to convince me to accept, and, worst of all, has partnerships with both my college and to the career development program I am affiliated with. Do I give up the ""Big 4"" offer I am pursuing or do I go ahead and take it, likely being blacklisted at that company and causing issues with the relationship between my college + career development program and the company. Thank you for your advice!

TL;DR: Accepted offer from company two months ago likely with help from their partnership with my college + career development program. Just got offer from ""Big 4"". Do I give up the opportunity or do I risk causing problems for myself and others? How do I go about this?"
7r9jbc,3,2018-01-18,I over-estimated adults way above of what I always thought I had in mind,Indi05,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/7r9jbc/i_overestimated_adults_way_above_of_what_i_always/,"Having Social anxiety and being isolated for most of my teenage hood I always had an image of adults being super serious and some what professional. (my dad was very strict and rarely joked) same goes for my mom who was very mature and kind...

However these past months during my studies ive met countless of adults aged 30-50 and it kinda shocked me that they are nothing that I have imagined.
Like teen behaviour, They gossip, they talk about their personal life to a whole new level, they talk about sensitive subjects in detail (sex) , they talk about the newest accessories that they are going to get or they like, they talk behind students backs/ Talk about students behaviour and their personal life (I did an internship at school, where I worked closely with staff) and overhead a lot of their conversation, They make immature jokes etc... All that said it kinda shocked me and made me realize that deep down, everyones the ""same"" and theres literally no difference from teenage hood and adulthood the major difference is adults ""mature"" which basically in my definition they show a very different image and face then if they were with their close friends. I see older figure laughing their asses off and telling jokes, however it is COMPLETELY Different when they are in class teaching...

also as another example the woman that was working with me, she was somewhat serious, we would get the work done etc... but as soon as we hoped in the car together (had to go somewhere to meet people) she was acting COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, putting on her own playlist in the car, talking a lot shit about the drivers in front of her for giggles...


Blame the movies where older adults are seen as ALWAYS mature and know what they are doing. but honestly its wierd asf for me to see this. it kinda makes me wonder a shit ton and honestly with social -anxiety it makes it HARDER to judge and how I should hold myself when meeting new adults knowing that deep down they are vastly different.
its just way bizzare seeing them in a different point of view away from the bullshit that society molds them into,
Finally I wanted to know if there was any movies which really shows how adults act in real life, (I heard chic flicks were good, simply because they did deep into a womans life and circle of friends)

7r9uzf,0,2018-01-18,What the hell do I do with my life?,vaneskara,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/7r9uzf/what_the_hell_do_i_do_with_my_life/,"Hey. I'm 18 and I live in the UK, and am going through the admissions process right now. I have no clue what I want to do with my life, including what subjects I want to study and whether I should take a gap year or go straight to uni. This is all going to sound very rambly so I'll try to split it up into sections.

Degree -

I don't really know what degree I want to do. I'm studying Maths, English Literature and History at sixth form so this cuts off stuff like Biology, Chemistry etc. I've applied for an Economics and PolSci degree and got my offer from an amazing university but am coming to the realisation that politics is way too draining for me to continue with it. I still have beliefs I hold close to me but I've definitely decided I'd rather participate in politics through normal conversations, volunteering for the party I like etc than doing a degree in the subject. I've had mild depression for a few years and I definitely don't think politics helps me feel better or help me meet new people and be open minded. I'm loving maths in school and was considering doing a maths degree but 1) even though I enjoy it, I really don't feel like I'm good enough at it? and 2) I do love maths but I also love history and the social sciences and I can't imagine never doing those again.

I've only recently learned about the Liberal Arts and Sciences degrees that have started in the UK in unis such as UCL and Birmingham. This definitely interests me, although I don't know what I'd choose as my major within those courses either, and I feel like I'd remain in an eternal state of confusion. On the other hand, I think it'll be super fun and maybe I'll come out the other end with a greater sense of clarity because I'll actually have studied different subjects so will know what they really consist of. 

I guess another problem is that I don't know if I should pursue what I love or what will get me some £££. My absolute dream (unrealistic, I know, but would be amazing if it happened) is to make history related documentaries across South Asia. However, knowing that that's probably unrealistic, I guess the other careers I wouldn't mind would be working for a charity or in academia or even something maths related. 


Gap year -

Should I maybe take a gap year? I wouldn't be able to get jobs in different industries to see what they're like mostly because very few places offer jobs or internships to non graduates, but I could work in retail whilst doing some reading about different options, maybe learning to code on my own and seeing what I like. 

I'm so sorry about the length of this post. I'm in a crazy state of confusion where you could throw any interesting subject towards me and I'd say ""hell yeah I wanna study that!"" Any advice would be appreciated."

However, I’m uncertain about which one I should pick (the internship dates all overlap making it impossible to pick two). Here’s my thought process on my offers and was wondering if someone could help  provide some input.
(FYI, they are all London based)
Moelis:
- generalist program (covers M&amp;A and restructuring) 
- 10 week program
- extremely long hours ( moreso than other banks)
Green hill:
- short program (only 6 weeks)
- low conversion rate (~30% get full time offers)
- also generalist program
- more attractive culture from my interviews and meeting the people
Other mid market boutique:
- healthcare focus
- 12 week program
- very high chance of conversion into full time
- very small office 
I ideally want to choose the offer that provides me with the best platform to enter venture capital.

I've been lurking forever on my main account and I'd like to thank everyone for their advice and helping me through this stressful period of my life. You guys are awesome and provide the solid information newbies like me need.

Anyway the details. I went a decent school and got my cs degree with an almost 3.0 GPA. I didn't do many projects in school or have an internship, so  it pretty much seemed that every employer out there filtered me without seeing how ambitious and excited I was to break into the field. I aimed for a front end web dev position since I knew it had a low barrier for entry while learning honestly a lot of all of the popular back and front end tools and frameworks so I could spread my net wide and at least show employers I have working experience with a lot of things. 

Finally, an established company in a low COL area reached out to me for a full stack ASP.NET MVC and JQuery job. For about 30 minutes, I made the two people I talked to laugh and they asked a single technical question about SQL and I thought - cool, I definitely made it past the first phone screen. They called back the next day with an offer about 70-75% of the competitive salary and said they absolutely loved me and want me to relocate pretty soon. Now I'm not one to argue about a good thing, but the speed of their offer makes me very wary despite how big of an opportunity it seems. It's my first job and I really don't give a crap what they pay me as long as I get to touch a lot of things to beef up my resume, learn as much as I absolutely can, and get money to eat and move out of my parents house. However my one issue is it's very clear that they don't have a lot of developers, maybe 1 more senior dev and 1 junior alongside me). So I'd like to know. Am I walking into a fire, and how should I approach these red flags considering I don't have any other options? I want to reiterate that I'm still truly ecstatic about the opportunity, but I personally would never hire someone I haven't even met, let alone after only a single phone screen. I'm caught off guard and I'm inexperienced, so I'm not sure what my mindset should be other than ""try to negotiate for a little more since there's no harm in doing so, work really hard, and pray for the best."" I did get the offer in writing, and have asked to come in to meet the team once beforehand which they set a date for. All help is appreciated. Thank you in advance. "

Went through a lot of crap in college (mom going thru cancer, commuting 50 miles to class everyday, etc), and managed to get my degrees. As a student I worked throughout college mowing lawns from dusk till dawn and other odd jobs, conducted undergraduate research with a material science group for 1 year and I had a PAID internship in the pharmaceutical industry.  I also taught myself a second, and a third language to the point of fluency.  Since graduation I've had an unbelievably difficult time trying to find work.  I've applied to over 1500 jobs, only had 2 in person interviews and 5 phone interviews.  I had 1 job offer in Houston that I accepted which was rescinded when Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston because their office was flooded and they sustained a lot of damage financially.  I have been aggressively networking on LinkedIn, cold-calling companies, I've driven to other states and cities for job fairs.  I've had no luck at all, not even with jobs that have nothing to do with engineering (such as at a bank for example).  Everyone that I've spoken to has liked my resume and experience, however it's always ""I don't have any contacts"" or ""we will contact you later"". And then I hear nothing.  

I'm incredibly intelligent and extremely hard working (hell I've never been late to work or even a class in my whole life even). Truly don't understand why someone like myself is not having any breaks 8 months after graduation.

I am reaching the point where I will have no choice but to abandon my search and try to join the military in order to survive (even thought I'm probably disqualified due to my horrible eyesight).  I'm unable to pay my student loan payments, unable to cover my bills because of my long term unemployment. I am terrified of the possibility that I will soon be homeless on the street unable to pay my bills. This is my first ever reddit post, fyi.

I have no idea what to do next or how to resolve this problem.  It's painfully clear that applying to company websites and so forth is a waste of time."

So I had a video chat a couple days ago with someone from the company who asked a few questions and wanted to know about the grad date. He said since they hire for a particular position from among these interns, they require that interns graduate in 2019. Would that be possible? So I said yeah, okay, if I get the position I'll skip my industry year and graduate early. It'd be worth it! So we'll proceed with the interview process (I'll have to go through 3-4 interviews).

Having had some days to think about it, I'm not sure. Like, I have no fucking idea either way. This internship would be a dream for me, and probably a job after it too.

So I don't know if I'm ready to make that commitment. What can I do? I could of course go through the interview process, see if I get it, and IF I DO, then I could decide whether to take it or leave it.

I could email and say 'sorry, not sure I'd be able to grad early' in which case a) I'd most likely be guaranteed not to get the internship, b) they might look badly on future applications.

I know the basics of Java and Python, know some C, PHP, HTML and R. Most of them were self taught since I wanted to have the basics so I could pick up quickly if I needed them, but since my main motivation is that need to work with them, I don't really feel motivated to start something very specific with any of these languages. I was never really driven by technology but rather the business or project I'm working on, so I've always used programming as a support to what I am doing and not as an end, something I would deliver to the final customer. However, since I am unemployed, I'm not completely excluding the idea of having to work as a developer/tester/etc.

* It it owned by one contributor and generally only hires internships (cheap labor)
* The company's website is a lack-luster wordpress.com template
* The company is not well known

7rc187,2,2018-01-18,Deciding whether to go back on meds - it’s hard,LightNightNinja,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7rc187/deciding_whether_to_go_back_on_meds_its_hard/,"(F22) I was officially diagnosed with ADHD 3 Years ago when I started college, after leaving the country for 9 months after high school. It was by no means a surprise, as I always struggled with school work, couldn’t keep track of my phone or keys (the front desk lady almost always had them), and I never did my homework, but almost always got A’s on tests. Let’s not talk about studying either - still to this day I can’t study to save my life.

Anyway, freshman year I ended up taking Wellbutrin, for anxiety, and it definitely helped a little bit with my ADHD, but it ended up making me super edgy after 6 months. After the paperwork from my testing went through for ADHD, and I was able to meet with a psychiatrist, I started with 10mg twice a day IR Adderal tablets. It just made me tired, but I was able to focus more, but the crash was terrible. Then we moved to Adderal XR At 30mg, and that was good for a while, I had made a ton of friends, met my SO, and overall things were good. But not sleeping or eating was starting to wear me down, so I decided to try something else. Ritalin was the absolute worst, and then I was given too high of a vyvance dose, to the point where I just broke down crying out of nowhere a few days in. 
More or less, it was a total roller coaster. My mood was always swinging, but my grades were getting better, thanks to being able to complete my work on time. 

I ended up trying to stop taking adderal, as I was moving to Texas with my (to this day, still amazing) SO. He said he would support me as I basically went through two months of drug withdrawal (this is the part they often don’t mention, it takes a reallly long time to stop taking stimulants). During the year I was in Texas, I took online classes, which were incredibly hard to be motivated to do, but I was proud of myself for quitting, and doing things through the grit of my teeth. My grades started to slip though, I failed my first class, so I decided to only take it when around midterms and finals. Great, that got me through most of the last two years, but I ended up taking a really low course load, and dropping down to 8 credits. 

Somehow I ended up getting an amazing 6 month internship. The pay was good, I had a free place to stay, and my SO had been transferred back to the west coast, and would only be 3 hours away.  Everything was great, but I was starting to get bored at work, because I always wanted to be here with him. This is the point I wanted to start taking meds again - i wanted something to keep me present, instead of listing for something else. 

Now, I am living with him, trying to work 25 hours a week for a start up, and take a 12 credit load online. I’m exactly where I want to be, but school and work are too fragmented, and I don’t feel like I can focus on either, which makes my days really unproductive. It really doesn’t help that the startup currently is unpaid, so I’m a lot less motivated to actually do my work (long term vs short term rewards). Also, because there is so much uncertainty, I always feel on edge, and like I can’t get my school work done in the day gaps. 

My anxiety of failure has gone through the roof, and I don’t have any leniency in my last 9 months of school (will be graduating with a CS degree). I just want to go back on my meds and get out of this constant fog I’ve been in for the last year, but I also don’t want my SO to have to deal with constant mood swings and lack of sleep, a he has to be an adult and go to work early in the morning. I know he’ll support me either way (his support is the only way I made it this far off meds), but I still feel bad. 
I really don’t miss the constant roller coaster, but I just desperately want to be able to succeed in work, school, and not feel bad about watching Netflix in the evening.

I just want to feel normal again, it’s just a slippery slip and I’m not sure whether to try finding a psychiatrist up here and going back on meds, it’s scary either way...

Anyone else stop taking medication, but choose to go back on after a few years? What was the tipping point and was it worth it?"

Often you don't just come up with an idea and develop it on your own, you rather look for a company that wants to support you in doing so, by helping with knowledge and often providing a paid internship, during which you work on your project and get further assistance. Deppending on the field of expertise of the company, you can do really interesting and complex projects. Also having a company support you, reflects positively on the project, which in turn reflects positively on you.

Now to come to my question. The [Johannes Kepler University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler_University_Linz) offered to collaborate with 2-3 such projects in my school, cherry picking the most promising students for their program, including my project partner and me. The thing is, we also got the possibility to collaborate with a very well known company in our region, called [Catalysts](https://www.catalysts.cc/en/) which is quite an opportunity too.

And now i have a difficult time deciding wether to do a project with the university or the company.. Both have expertise when it comes to machine learning, but i can't decide which would look better on a resume and which would be more help with the thesis. What should i do? Whats your opinion? University or Company?

Sidenote: I dont intend to study at this university after finishing school, because there is another socalled [Fachhochschule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fachhochschule) in the region which focusses even more on software engineering and IT."

How should I handle this? Should I tell the company I am interviewing with that I accepted an offer? Or should I not mention it at all or should I just say that I have a pending offer to try to speed things up with my first choice company?

I like people. I don't want to sit alone at a desk all day, I want human interaction in my job.

I like problem solving and logic puzzles. Figuring out how to do something or what the optimal choice to make is really fun for me. 

I hate tedious, repetitive, and/or mindless tasks. 

I don't need a mansion, but I don't want to constantly worry about money either.

I have a bunch of foundation courses so I have about 2 more years of college left for a bachelors basically any path I choose. I don't want to stay in school forever, so no grad school for now 

In HS I took a lot of Computer Science courses, and I've taken a few more in college. Software engineering seemed interesting, but I'm worried that I might spend a lot of time alone at a desk implementing some solution, which sounds terrible. However, I think working on a team to discuss and collaboratively tackle complex problems and passing off the solution to some intern to implement sounds amazing. Realistically, most jobs will have some combination of both, but I'm not sure what the ratio will be and if i'll be happy down this path.

In HS i did't really like math that much even though I was good at it. However, as I've taking more math courses I've grown to like math more and more. Calc I and Calc II was where math began to get interesting for me, but it still had parts I found really boring like trig that required a fair amount of memorization. (Fuck trig, it's my least favorite part of math). In general I've like college math course and my favorite college course was a math course, Discrete Math. Not really sure what I would do with math, there's a lot of options.

I've taken some into to Psych, which I though was just ok. 

I've taken 4 Econ courses, which I liked a lot, but again left me worried that I would spend all day behind a desk crunching number alone.

I've taken some education courses and done one field experience course, and teaching seems like a good option (I like kids) but I'm not sure about the pay and the bureaucracy. I would probably want to teach Comp Sci or Math at the highschool level or above if I did teach.

I'm open to other suggestions too.  

Sorry for the shit formatting, Thanks for any help."

$800-850 USD

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 I think I appreciate all these specifications, but optional touch input is nice, but good battery life and RAM size is really appreciated.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
 I'd prefer around 3lbs and under.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
I'm used to Windows 10, I've never used Mac OS as my main personal OS, but all my mobile devices are Apple (iPhone 8 Plus, Apple Watch Series 3, 2017 iPad)

 No, not really any of these.

 No.

Of all the machines listed in my post title, I really desire the MS Surface Laptop the most, but it's well outside my budget right now.  As I stated earlier, I've never used an Apple computer as my primary machine, but I'm open to it - I did use an iMac for a year-long internship and I found OS X to be quite alright after getting used to it.  I like the thought of rounding out my Apple device ownership with an Apple computer, but I'm not entirely sure if I'm just considering the MacBook Air for the sake of having an Apple computer more than the practicality regarding my needs.

Lately I feel like Ive been obsessed with my phone. I usually go through these waves of being normal self esteemed, then way down to absolutely none and constantly seeking validation from social media/texting. Each of these valleys seems to get lower and lower. Especially low since my gf moved away for an internship for the semester. I miss her a ton and I thought the start of school would help distract me but Ive sunk even lower since the first day on tuesday.  

For example today I woke up and spent about an hour on reddit, was late to class. After class I saw a snap from my gf and ended up checking her and my insta and facebook accts for about 10 minutes waiting for my truck to warm up. Got home and decided to get back on instagram before making food, another hour wasted. All the while constantly checking to see if people opened the snapchat I just sent out.  

This pattern continued pretty much all day until now. I just got out of my bed and decided to write this post after spending 2 hours on youtube watching dark souls 3 videos.  

Im driving myself crazy, and I know Im driving my gf crazy too since I usually end up texting or snapping her every two hours. Its hard not to constantly think about her when Im on my phone for 11 hours a day.  

Anyone have some advice on how to overcome cell phone addiction? Ive considered leaving it at home all day but idk that just seems extreme.  

Of course its hard for me to provide all the context in my life to effectively seek advice but I feel the true problem for me mentally right now is my addiction to receiving texts/snap chats from my friends and gf. I seriously crave it now, and when someone leaves me on read it absolutely ruins my day. Ill even spend time planning out my snaps for the day to try and trigger specific responses from people. Its absolutely unhealthy behavior but I dont know how to stop without losing it.

I'm currently a double Math/CS major. I originally double majored because 1) I wanted to develop my problem solving skills and 2) improve my chances of finding a well paying job.

I'm a junior at my university and started taking the upper level math courses such as Abstract Algebra and Bayesian Modeling. Although I found myself enjoying those classes and learning new things, those 2 classes were the source of my stress during the semester. I also had 2 CS courses - Design &amp; Analysis of Algorithms and Theory of Computation which I felt were much easier than my Math courses.

A part of me wants to drop the Math major, free up my schedule, stop stressing, and work on personal projects instead. However, another part of me is scared that dropping the Math major will make me a less desirable candidate when searching for a job. I do have a summer internship lined up but its at a financial services firm that I don't really want to work there as a FT. It was the best offer I had unfortunately. I remember during the interviewing phase, interviewers seemed impressed that I was a double Math major but never really asked anything further.

Also, I don't pay any tuition and I'm not graduating any earlier if I drop Math. Double Math major means I need to take 18 credits a semester and be stressed out but still enjoy taking it. There is also the fear of missing out on becoming a more ""logical"" person, which to be honest, I don't even know what that means but in my head I feel like I'd become dumber for dropping math.

7rhyze,9,2018-01-19,Is it crazy to turn down a Google internship?,pumpkin_pasties,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/7rhyze/is_it_crazy_to_turn_down_a_google_internship/,"I'm a first year at a T15 and was happy to receive an internhip offer at my top choice CPG company. It has been my top choice for almost a year, due to its location, products, and the amazing people I have met there. They only extend a few offers a year and this was a highly coveted position among my classmates. This is for a  brand management role.

However, I was recently invited to interiew for a CX internship at Google. I never considered that I might have a chance there, so this came as a surprise. I have a tech background and like the idea of returning to tech. If I were to receive an offer from Google, I would have an extremely difficult decision to make. 

I'd love to hear from the general MBA community what a smart decision would be in this case. Is it crazy to turn down Google for a smaller CPG company? Just how big a difference does having ""Google"" on your resume make?"
7ri0nn,2,2018-01-19,Advice about friend (?),[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7ri0nn/advice_about_friend/,"Hey, 

So I have this friend who I've been keeping in touch with for about five years. I've always initiated but he responds and visited this past summer. We had sex and I lost my virginity so it was really special for me, but he was only here for 5 days. He was then traveling all over the world and did not text me once for the rest of the summer. Also, when he visited, he was very kind after we had sex, and he was okay before we had sex as well, but way more neutral. The thing that bothers me is that he made a joke that sort of offended me, saying he hoped I didn't have a penis...Albeit we were watching some very explicit yoga where a man was doing a lot of very weird things on a stick with his penis (it's true...) and I had said it must be painful...Anyway, I wanted to do long distance but he didn't, and, after the 5 days, he was constantly traveling with his best female friend, and it really looked like they were a couple to me...(maybe open or whatever but they are always together and I saw countless pictures of them). He also texted her the entire time he was visiting me and he was on his phone about 75% of the time. He has some wonderful qualities (smart, outdoorsy, good cook, good sense of humor, can be very kind, adventurous) but I felt quite offended at times by the things he said and did: He messed up the tire on one of the family vehicles and let the family blame me for it (he took no responsibility), he said he'd split lunch, but took my cash and paid without giving me any change whatsoever, and he even allowed me to think about transferring to his college to be with him when he is traveling abroad for all of this semester (again, with his ""best female friend""). I've gotten a bit impatient at times when he doesn't respond (and he hasn't unless he ""needs"" to to save face). I messaged him on skype and wanted to skype but apparently he suddenly has a net neutrality issue. We had a decent interaction last time we texted (even though we didn't actually talk) and he's sent me a message again saying thanks for allowing him to visit and all of that. I haven't been very needy, but I have been a bit moody sounding at times over text I guess, because I've been angry. He's been patient and it seems like that is all good. The thing is, we go to university at different ends of the country, and he's usually traveling, and somehow has internet connection but is ""unreachable and busy"" even though he constantly posts about his ""best female friend"" who goes to university with him...I am stumped because, on one hand, I like the guy and he's been a very decent long distance friend for about 5 years, and I want to maintain the friendship, even if we only are in contact once a year... On the other hand, I may have feelings for him now (?), he's always with this other girl, so he clearly deeply enjoys her company even if he's single, and I don't want to constantly feel jealous of their friendship/relationship. Do you think it's even worth maintaining a friendship? We never Skype (at least not for a long time and probably won't from the look of things) and this is the first time he's ever initiated in five years...He did initiate the visit but he was already in my state for an internship over the summer. I am wondering if I should just delete his contact info and totally get over him? Or if I should keep his number just in case I ever hear from him...? My parents and him are connected on facebook, so, if need be, there is a way for me to reach him. However, he's always traveling and rarely ever has cell reception, or is reachable...What should I do? I was thinking of texting him but he says he's not reachable from his cell number for most or all of the semester...I guess I shouldn't? I was responding to his skype message which he sent about a month ago and I just saw it...that would be the text. 
Note: I know he was kidding about the penis thing but it really hurt my feelings, and he also made some implications about my body that were a bit mean and I felt insecure about it. (He was joking about those too, and I joked a bit with him as well, but I wasn't mean to him about his body...maybe his race but he joked about that himself...)"
7ric75,189,2018-01-19,"PSA: In the US, tech internships MUST BE PAID",Jeffbx,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7ric75/psa_in_the_us_tech_internships_must_be_paid/,"Just as an FYI to everyone, since I've seen this come up an alarming number of times - 

There are almost no instances where it's legal for a tech internship to be unpaid.  Here's a good article that explains: https://www.propublica.org/article/when-interns-should-be-paid-explained

&gt;According to the Department of Labor, **an unpaid internship must meet all these criteria**:

&gt; - The internship is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment

&gt; - It’s for the benefit of the intern
&gt; - The intern doesn’t displace paid employees
&gt; - The employer doesn’t benefit from work the intern is doing, “and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded.”
&gt; - The intern isn’t promised a job at the end (unpaid “tryouts” aren’t allowed)
&gt; - Both the intern and their boss understand its an unpaid position

The biggest roadblock for tech positions is this one:

**The employer doesn’t benefit from work the intern is doing**

That means if you're doing helpdesk, machine setups, troubleshooting, coding, software installs... you know, pretty much anything a tech intern would be asked to do - *you must be paid.*

Don't even consider unpaid internships unless they meet all of the requirements above."

I have an associate software developer offer from Tesco at a competitive package. So, academically, I have very less to do this semester. I am thinking of applying for GSoC.
I have done my projects primarily in CUDA. For example, last year, I made an Eclipse plugin that can be used to predict the execution time and power consumption of a CUDA kernel on a particular hardware. The plugin is ready to download and is available on GitHub. This is just one of my many projects.
 
The problem is, my area of work is so niche that I can't find any organizations doing work in it. How do I crack the GSoC this year with such a profile? I am proficient in Java and UI development as well (thanks to my internship), but working on something related to CUDA is my top priority."
7riqwy,2,2018-01-19,"College Students and Graduates: Chase Opportunity, not Jobs.",unemployed90210,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7riqwy/college_students_and_graduates_chase_opportunity/,"I'm about 30 years old at the moment and I've been through three major phases of my life where I had to figure out what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. That was shortly after high school, then after the military, then finally after college. And truth be told, I still have no idea what I want to do or will do. I don't think this is an answer we can ever truly figure out, and which is why so many people struggle with it. 

Therefore my advice to myself and to others in my predicament is this: chase opportunity, not jobs.

For the record, the opposite can always be argued for and I certainly will advocate that there is truth to both worlds. You need to have an idea of what you want to do, map it out, and pursue it, while staying away from what you definitely don't. Meaning, if you know you enjoy working with computers, then by all means pursue a career in which you will work with computers. And if you hate the idea of working with computers, then stay away from a career choice in which a third of your life is spent behind one.

But my focus is on this: the jobs which exist today may not exist in five or ten years, and there are jobs today that certainly did not exist five or ten years ago as well. Therefore, how can you realistically prepare for a job market that is constantly changing? Unless you're a working professional with years of experience under your belt who can use their diversified skillset to craft their resume to fit the needs of the position, it's simply unlikely that anyone can truly prepare themselves for a position which may or may not exist once they've finished college. 

*Disclaimer: Unless of course you pursued something in the medical or vocational fields, which specifically train you for a job that is always in demand*

Therefore, take advantage of whatever opportunity presents itself to you. Whatever that is. Maybe all you can find right now is a bullshit position with a small startup. Fine, do your best to make it grow, make yourself known and network from there. Or maybe a large bank is offering internship opportunities in the summer but you may not be interested in finance at the moment, do it anyway. Or maybe there's a program that helps people like you, a veteran, a woman, a minority, an alumni of nutsack community college, whatever, to explore careers in different industries. Do it as well. Whatever it is, just do it to the best of your ability and grow from there. 

Don't allow yourself to get sucked into the mindset that college prepares you for a job. It doesn't. And if an opportunity arises, be prepared and willing to seize it. "

Anyway, the week before Christmas I was asked to help move hardware from our production line to a new server cabinet out of the way, as line operators were occasionally turning everything off for no apparent reason.

The first day went smoothly, with 3 of the 5 PC's moved without a hitch. The second day however wasn't as successful. The line manager in his infinite wisdom decided to join in and help, and started pulling all the old cables out and cutting them. Keep in mind that there was probably 40 cables being fed through a gap in the wall.

This broke everything, half the line stopped responding to inputs, the other half wasn't showing any data, and the reporting software stopped getting data. Line manager however decided he did nothing wrong, that we broke something, and that we had to fix it else we'd have no line operations in the new year and would cost the company thousands.

The next 3 days were spent panicking and trying to get everything working again, not really what I planned before Christmas break. Somehow we miraculously fixed it by following out-of-date network diagrams,  figuring out what cables were cut, tracing them through under-floor panels, and bodging up the line in order to at least make it functional again.

I've at least learned that companies are built on bodges, and that I should probably keep my head down once in a while..."
7rk0os,1,2018-01-19,IBM Vs Trip Advisor,adamforward1225,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rk0os/ibm_vs_trip_advisor/,"This is an anonymous account. I have recently gotten offers from both IBM and Trip advisors for summer internships as a software engineer intern.

Looking at the pay I was offered and how interesting the work is, trip advisor is the clear winner. I think that I would enjoy the summer more at trip advisor.

However, I haven't done much in my career yet. I don't go to a target school, I don't have any internships that are reputable and I haven't done anything that would make me stick out in an application. Subsequently, I don't get much interviews from top companies. My main priority is to choose the internship that will open more doors in the future in terms of getting interviews. I'm willing to have a less enjoyable summer for the sake of getting more interviews when it is time to graduate.

So the question is, which company is more reputable? Is it close? I don't have much of an idea of how the outside world views an IBM internship vs a Trip Advisor internship.

7rk0pj,1,2018-01-19,Investment bank vs. late stage startup,cscq990,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rk0pj/investment_bank_vs_late_stage_startup/,"Tldr; Canadian student, want to move to States after grad. Have internship offers from mature startup (8 month) &amp; investment bank (3.5 month). Which has better exit opportunities for a final internship?
_____________________

Hey everyone, 
I've got a couple of offers that expire at the end of the month, and I'm trying to decide what would be the best choice career wise. 

I've already got an 8 month co-op at a small (&lt;30 people) early stage startup under my belt. I'm in Canada and want to more to the States after grad. This is my last internship. Which one would bring me the most opportunities? 

The first is a late stage startup that does analytics. They're offering an 8 month co-op, in my city. I don't know what project/team I'd be working on yet. I do know their tech stack &amp; am happy with it. Reading Glassdoor, it seems this company is very dev focussed.

The second is an investment bank (Morgan Stanley). It's in Montreal &amp;  basically halfway across the country. They have a 14 week summer analyst program. I have no clue as to what I'd be working on, since there's a lot of diversity. I was told there is a chance of being in the front office, but more likely I'd be mid/back office. 

I feel like the bank has better name recognition, networking &amp; exposure to the finance world. I am not sure how to judge their technical competency. Their Montreal office is mostly a dev office, but I still feel like tech is considered second fiddle to traders/ibankers.

On the flip side, I think I'd be a much better developer after 8 months at the smaller company, and have a better chance of converting. It's also a tech company, so obviously devs are super important to them. 

I did get interviews from most of the big companies this sub loves this season,  but I wasn't able to get an offer. I do think I'd be able to get interviews with them again, but idk how to get the attention of companies with a less widespread reach.  

Thanks for any input!"

I applied to a bunch of positions online, came to career fairs and info sessions. But so far I haven't landed an internship or a job offer yet. I have had two or three really nice 30 minutes conversations with some recruiters, they was going to invite me for interviews until they asked me for my status in the end. They said, ""please let us know when your status changes, we really like you and we will be happy to hear from you again."" Sure, I guess changing my status from non-citizen to US citizen is as quick and easy as flipping coin lol. Even marrying a US citizen (which is the fastest way to get residence status and which I am probably not gonna do as well) is not going to take less than a few years. This is a total let down. 

I am a pretty good student, have a decent GPA, multiple job and research experiences in the university (as you might know, they don't discriminate against international students for on-campus jobs or research positions). I hardly know any international student that is not in CS that got an internship or a job offer outside of the university, even if they have stellar resumes and are very personable. From what I have heard from my friend , in CS it is pretty hard to get an offer as an international students but a lot easier compared to other majors since the demand for software developers in the US is amazingly high. 

I wanna work here after graduation to repay the crazy amount of tuition that my parents have paid and for the experiences as well. But this seems impossible. Are we just basically fucked?"

The major itself isn't well known though... no one ever knows what my major means, and it's never on job application drop downs. My program was a weird combination of web development/design, mobile development/design, video game development/design, and animation/digital art. It was very project-based and I did very well in it, have 3.7 GPA, dean's list all semesters. HOWEVER, the major mostly focused on innovation, ideas, and design over good practices in coding, many students project's were just ""ideas"" that ""could"" be something if they ""tried harder,"" a lot of projects I saw being turned in around me looked like absolute garbage, and it was really uninspiring. While Interactive Media had programming, I believe the program would definitely put me at a disadvantage skills-wise if I didn't have my CS minor, because they never taught programming practices. When I joined the Interactive Media program, it was more tech/game/web focused, had more tech classes, but as I am leaving I believe the program has become more art/design-focused in time, due to a lot of students not quite ""getting"" coding, which has been scaring me a bit for its reputation. I also have seen multiple graduates of the program on LinkedIn and they are working retail jobs and have not found work.

&amp;nbsp;

MORE BACKGROUND: I also have a computer science minor and have done these classes: intro to programming, data structures, software engineering, and this semester will do analysis of algorithms, and I've taken discrete math and calculus. My goal is to go to grad school online for Computer Science Master's once I graduate while working full-time. I've also had 2 internships (1 at school, 1 at a large publishing company) in Web Development but only using basic HTML, CSS, WordPress, API and JavaScript.

&amp;nbsp;

QUESTION: My goal job would be doing C#.NET development I think, based on the fact that I know C#, and I have web experience, which seems like it might apply there. The hurdle I'm working on right now is learning the .NET framework since I've never touched it, but I have a full semester before I graduate to work on that (although i'll probably be applying to jobs in the meantime). Would I even be considered for a C#.NET dev role or dev intern role with my major ? Wondering if I'm ill-informed and it's actually a bigger longshot than I think it is. I'm not aiming for any remotely fancy companies, but definitely not looking at getting a super lowball salary or working with an antiquated system. What other CS jobs might apply to me? I'm really sick of HTML-heavy web dev, it doesn't challenge me."

I eventually asked my old job for rehire in September and have been working for them since now. 

My old IT job put up my old position and I am thinking about applying because it was very fun and definitely in line of what I'm studying. The HR manager told me when I got let go that I was definitely welcome to apply again if our paths cross and they need more IT people. To my knowledge I was liked in my department.

I have been working at the toy store for 4 months and on one hand I would love the extra money and a job I want, plus I am definitely not going to make this toy store job a career at all, On the other hand Upon rehire I got a small / minor promotion and feel like a traitor because I am going full circle.

Some Background info (mostly to give context, but feel free to skip it if you want): I am a 25 year old stay-at-home dad who is ready to get a new education. I was previously a welder, but have since developed fibromyalgia (a chronic pain condition) so welding isn't a trade I can do anymore. My wife is about to start a job, but I think we would both prefer me to be working in the long term. 



I have been looking into online degrees (has to be online, as I need to stay home and watch my son while my wife is at work) and I thought I had discovered exactly what I wanted. I have always wanted to work in radio, and an audio production degree would have been perfect. However... lots of people who have attended schools for audio production say it isn't the way to go. Instead, they suggest hiring a producer or sound engineer for lessons while experimenting and learning at home, then move into an internship or apprenticeship. 
That would be great, but my son has special needs and really needs me 100% of the time. I can't devote the time to an internship, or even lessons outside of my home, until my son is old enough to attend public school. This really sucks, but all of my research points to this not being the way to go.

So all of that being said, I need to look at different options. Considering all of the needs of my family, an online degree in IT seems to be the best option. I've hopped on Code Academy, and I can wrap my head around the basics for sure. It's just so... boring. Coding and IT work seems to be mind numbing. I don't know if I can ever care about it enough to really sink my teeth in. I know that real-life projects will be more engaging, but I don't want to let my family down just because I don't feel stimulated by the work I would be doing. 

Is IT a career path that one can become passionate about over time? How does one go about *choosing* to become passionate about something? I just don't know where to go from here."

In my opinion, over the last few terms since I've been apart of the OSU online post-bac program, the OSU Slack community has become incredibly toxic. The amount of complaining is outrageous. The arrogant domineering is out of control. The occasional talk of sexism and/or racism in the tech industry is off-putting (mostly fueled by trolls). Brewster &amp; other faculty are all pretty much non-existent now. And no one can go on slack anymore for helpful advice. What the hell happened?

This term, it seemed like there were a large number of new students that joined, and granted, the slack community has grown alot in the last year. But because of the toxicity, new students don't talk or interact with anyone. The #general channel is a graveyard. #jobs and #internships has devoid into a /r/cscareerquestions circle jerk. Class channels are dead or riddled with trolls. And don't even go to #whine or #random; you'll get talked over by a few people who never leave those channels. 

I miss the days when I felt like I could go to the slack for a helpful ear, get good advice on class material or code, and I especially miss the feeling of community and comradery. Now, I feel like anyone and everyone just gets dominated by arrogant users who *have* to be right all the time. 

My hope is that this reaches the slack and there is a serious discussion there about the online standards everyone agreed to when they entered this program. The current conduct is disrespectful to the school and is unfair for new students who are being introduced to such a toxic environment. This is not how CS should be represented and it especially shouldn't be how OSU CS is represented."

I asked him who is looking for my type, and the guy recommended a few companies (ViaSat and Qualcomm). Qualcomm wasn't there, but ViaSat was, so I just decided that'd be my last one. I went up and he was, to my surprise, actually impressed by my projects and I left a good impression.

Here's the thing: I was expecting that I was going to be a general ""software engineer"" but I don't even know what that is anymore. I used to think it'd just be programming in languages like C++ and Java, but now it seems like there's an insane amount of back end/front end/full stack, which I have no experience in. The guy was using the word ""embedded"" a lot, which makes me think I'm just straying away from the ""software engineer"" role.

It's nice that someone was actually impressed by what I did, but the more I think about it, the more I might be making a mistake. I want to be a software engineer, but I feel like if I get an internship like this I might end up somewhere I don't want to be. 

I think I haven't gone into this specific area of programming with enough experience to know if I truly like or dislike it. I did the projects because I was obsessed with the outcome, and completing them was satisfying. But if it's something I'm not passionate about I feel like it's gonna kill me.

So basically, some questions: Am I really too specialized to be working a general software engineering role? Should I maybe branch out and try some web development stuff (maybe a mistake)? Am I just overthinking this? I do desperately need an internship so I'm not just gonna turn it down if I do get it (not that I know I'm gonna get it, just thinking ahead a bit)."

I got offered an internship back in November for the upcoming summer. It's a pretty big deal for me and I'm very excited. After signing all the papers and NDAs, I was told they would reach out to me ""closer to my starting date"" with a background test/drug test. I don't start until May, but I am kind of worried that I haven't heard from the company since I signed and submitted all the papers. It was definitely a formal offer, as the hiring manager called me first, then emailed me and I filled out the necessary paperwork. I recently emailed my hiring manager on Wednesday evening and haven't heard anything back. What do you think my next step should be? Is there any reason to be concerned about my job security? I think I'm going to call the hiring manager on Monday but now I have all weekend to fret, so any insight would be fantastic, thanks!"
7rsdec,13,2018-01-20,NEED ADVICE: Should I go for my Masters,cskhalessi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rsdec/need_advice_should_i_go_for_my_masters/,"WARNING: RANT

Need some quick advice from people who have done a Masters in CS. 

I am going to be a senior next year, studying CS and Math, and I am considering grad school. I do not really know what I want to do with my CS degree, and I think a good Masters program is going to open more doors for me and expose me to different aspects of CS that my bsc did not; this is the main reason I am considering a masters. The main reason I do not want to do my masters is because i do not know what i want to specialize in.

Also, I do not want to be a coder for the rest of my life, I want to move up into a management position and I am assuming that a masters will give me an upper hand. I am doing my undergrad at a no name school and I am praying to get into a school with a better cs reputation. 

Ill be doing my first internship this summer, (couldnt get one last summer) as a software engineer intern so im hoping to get a glimpse of what that is like, and if i even enjoy being a software engineer.

Part of me is telling me not to get a masters simply because i do not need it to land a good generic software engineering job at a good company. But the other part of me is looking far into the future and wondering how this masters could help me move up quicker in my career or expose me/get me into a field i did not know i has a passion for.  

SO ultimately i do not even have a quesion to ask. This is just a rant as I am confused on what to do with my life.  Any comment is welcome.

7rsvyb,7,2018-01-20,"I hate Law School, despite succeeding at it, and I feel paralyzed. I sent my mother an email about this, and she's coming in town with my Aunt to talk with me about it. Could use advice.",paralyzedbylife93,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7rsvyb/i_hate_law_school_despite_succeeding_at_it_and_i/,"I think I'll just start by including the email I sent followed by a few details that aren't in that email: 

&gt; Dear Mom,

&gt; I’m writing you because I know two things: (1) any start to this conversation over the phone would result in an argument and; (2) I want you to be able to sit on my current state-of-mind before you comment.

&gt; I hate law school. Having to walk back into that building yesterday and today has taken a toll on me to such a degree that I would describe any minute inside of it as miserable. I know that sounds dramatic, and to an extent it is, but it’s also the truth. The truth of the situation is that I don’t see myself finishing law school, and I lack confidence in my ability to finish the semester. I’d like to cut-off one of your arguments that you have challenged me with through my life, that I haven’t or won’t give law school a fair shot. I would strongly disagree with that for the following reasons; I fully invested myself in law school. I competed in a competition (client counseling). I went to official law school events. I would attempt to hang out with numerous people in my class. I voluntarily signed up for a week long-internship to take up a chunk of my break just to give law school a chance.

&gt; Mom, I honestly hate it. On Monday, I spoke with the FBI recruiter for the [X] Field Office. He was very candid with me, and said that if I wish to be an Agent, I would have to spend multiple years in either a prosecuting attorney’s office or as a defense attorney before I could be considered, and the odds of being selected that early in my career were slim. In fact, it could take up to a decade of experience before I would be a great candidate. He also told me that the internship they offer is extremely competitive. This year, they received 153 applications and only accepted 3 candidates. I can’t see myself practicing for nearly ten years just to pursue a career that honestly has always felt like a “lite”-version of my original dream of the [military]. 

&gt; The mention of the [military] requires me to cut you off at another thing I know you are thinking: That somehow the [military] is “running again.” To be honest with you, I resent that you said that to me when I was in town. You were somewhat supportive of not completing law school, or being a lawyer, but somehow pursuing the [military] again would be “running” but pursuing any other career wouldn’t.

&gt; This email isn’t to tell you that I’ve chosen to pursue the [military] again, but it’s also not here to tell you that I’m ruling it out. I started doing [military] style training again after I got back in town and it’s made me happier than literally any-single-day of law school has in an entire semester. Further, ever since I “changed paths” I denied myself anything [military] related out of fear of regret. I refused to watch Military films and I donated all my [military] books. I was denying that fact that I had regrets about my change of path.

&gt; Again, this isn’t an email telling you that I’m going to try and be [in the military] again, but it’s important to me that you know that it isn’t running. In fact, I could argue changing paths was running. 

&gt; The entire point of this email, is that I can’t stand law school and it is making me miserable. What that means for what I do in the future, I’m still working on and I would like your support, advice, and consideration while I sort all this out. I don’t know if the military is still for me. I don’t know if I’ll finish the semester. I don’t know a lot of things right now.

&gt; What I do know, is that diving into cases again, even criminal, has brought me no joy. I know that the idea of applying, interviewing, and potentially doing a summer-internship at a law firm makes me miserable and anxious. I know that this isn’t how someone should feel about a career path. I look around at my classmates and they may be unhappy about having to work hard again after break, but they have a passion and a drive for the material, and more importantly the work.

&gt; I don’t mind hard work, I worked hard for years to have a shot at a [military] contract, what I can’t stand is hard work towards a goal that I don’t have a passion for. I don’t have passion for law, in fact I may have the opposite in resentment.

&gt; Just think on this. I love you. 

&gt; paralyzedbylife93

I had been training for years to pursue a career in a special operations unit. It was my dream and I was eventually offered a contract that would allow just that. However, at the time, I was in a very long-term relationship and I ended up choosing to pursue law school in lue of the military aspiration because of that relationship.

However, now that relationship is over and I'm left wondering why I'm in law school. I truly hate every second of it and despite being successful at it (I'm top 20 in the class after my first semester) and receiving a full ride to the school, I just hate the work, hate the field, and the idea of working in the profession is making me incredibly depressed.

I'm asking for advice on two different things really:

* How should I handle this conversation with my mother?

* How do I push past this paralysis where I feel like I'm stuck going to law school for the foreseeable future while also resenting the very idea of that?

Thank you.

How to write a letter of continued interest: A guide by Novembrr, a former UChicago admissions reader &amp; current Berkeley reader",novembrr,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7rt7t1/deferred_how_to_write_a_letter_of_continued/,"Deferred from your top choice? Don't give up! Each year, many deferred applicants are accepted to their dream university within the regular decision pool—and many more deferred applicants are ultimately denied. What leads some students to be accepted and some denied? Overwhelmingly, the determining factor is a carefully crafted letter of continued interest. 

​Now is your chance to demonstrate how you would add value to their institution, to show how you embody the university’s values (known in admissions lingo as “fit”), and to prove your knowledge of the university’s unique offerings and how they align with your own interests.

In my experience VERY few applicants who do nothing but wait are accepted within the regular decision pool. Don't wait in radio silence—use my guide to send the perfect letter of continued interest. This guide has worked. Last year, my deferred students used this guide to be accepted to Duke, Princeton, UChicago, and Yale. My waitlisted students used a waitlisted version of this guide to be accepted to Penn, MIT, USC, and Amherst. 

**The great thing about this guide is you don't even have to be deferred or waitlisted to use it—you can follow the same processes to send a LOCI to your regular decision schools.**

My guide [""How to Write a Letter of Continued Interest""](https://www.helpwithapps.com/store/p16/LOCI) is 16 pages (vastly more characters than Reddit allows me to post). The complete guide includes templates for how to contact current students, alumni, and professors to glean valuable insight into the university's values—and then craft an email to admissions, utilizing what you've learned to demonstrate how you embody those values. I've included an example email to a professor, and **FOUR examples of LOCI to admissions officers for you to help craft your own**. When I shared this guide with my own students, one responded ""Holy Shit"". Hopefully you read it and say the same!

If you're interested in the complete PDF guide, [it's available for purchase here](https://www.helpwithapps.com/store/p16/LOCI). If you're interested in the condensed free version, keep reading!

**""Okay, tell me already! My top choice deferred me and I'm dying to get in""**

You should write a letter of continued interest which, unlike how it sounds, is not just an affirmation of your interest in attending the school. Thus, don’t write something like this:

Dear Penn Admissions Office,

I wanted to thank you for your consideration of my application for early decision. Penn remains my top choice and I would love to join the class of 2022.

Sincerely,
[Name]

Especially if you applied early decision, single choice early action or restricted early action, the university knows they are your top choice. As harsh as it sounds, you just aren’t their top choice. But, they saw promise within your application. With a carefully crafted letter of continued interest, you can add new information—something new and cool you've done in the months since you applied—and demonstrate the value you would bring to their campus.

Start by talking with someone affiliated with the university—not to ask them if they can pull strings (well, unless they can… in which case, ask away) but to get to know the university better and drum up information with which to email your admissions officer.

Can’t find an alum or current student? Check LinkedIn. Find someone with interests overlapping with you and contact them. Ask your guidance counselor if any alumni from your high school currently attend. See if the university’s alumni or student directories are publicly accessible. Check Facebook to see if you have any friends in common with current students. Do your research.

Contact them. Make it short and sweet. Let’s say you know them personally. A text, Instagram DM or quick email will suffice. Let’s say you don’t know them. Be brief but informative in your email to them.

Here is an example:

Dear Sreya,

I hope 2018 is off to a terrific start for you! My name is [Name] and I am a recently deferred applicant to Yale—my top choice—and I discovered we have something in common: we both attended Peabody Senior High School. Go Knights!
I’m reaching out to you today to see if I could take five minutes of your time to learn more about Yale, so that I can better refine my application in the regular decision admissions process. I hope to update Yale on my interests, accomplishments, and embodiment of Yale’s values, and a quick conversation with you would really help me achieve my goal of being accepted to Yale.

I know you are incredibly busy, and I really value your time. Thanks so much for considering my request. Have a wonderful day.

Sincerely,
[Name]

Let’s say they don’t respond. Give it a few days. Still no response? Email someone else. Let’s say they email you and say sorry, I can’t help you but best of luck. Don’t see that as a dead end—politely ask them if they have any friends that might be willing to chat. You never know; they might just know a chatty tour guide who would love to tell you all about the university.
Let’s say they say you bet, let’s chat. Schedule a quick phone call with them. Ask them what their favorite things are about the university; what classes have had the biggest, yet most rewarding, challenges; how they would define the university’s spirit and values; what quality, despite the diverse student body, does every student possess?  

Take notes (if you can do two things at once). And utilize that information in your email to admissions. 

**""Okay, got it—contact a student. What’s next?""**

Not so fast. You’ve got other options, and these might be even more beneficial. If you had an alumni interview, contact them. 

Dear Ms. Jones,

I wanted to follow up with you regarding the status of my application to Tufts. Unfortunately, I was deferred, but that still gives me hope that I might be accepted in the regular decision pool.

I found our conversation invaluable (thanks again!) and wanted to know if you have any advice for me moving forward. Do you recall anything that previous deferred applicants did to convey their love for Tufts and be accepted during regular decision? Any advice for me in contacting my regional admissions office or updating my portal with new information?

Any and all advice you might have is welcome. I really value your time, and appreciate all that you do on behalf of Tufts as an alumna.

Sincerely,
[Name]

And, lastly, consider contacting a professor. This could be someone with whom you’ve corresponded before (perhaps you sat in on their class when you visited campus) or someone you contact now, for the very first time.

To use this tip effectively, you must do the following:

* Research the department in which you wish to major. Understand the course offerings, special programs, and pedagogical approach. Click on the faculty tab, and investigate the research interests of various professors.
Pick the professor who has the most in common with you and your interests. This will be the first (and hopefully only, if they respond) professor you email. Do more research on that professor, including what classes he or she teaches.
Using the information you’ve gleaned, write the professor an email. See my templates below for how to compose your first email.

* Wait a week for a response. If the professor does not respond within one week, follow up with them gently, telling them that you know they are incredibly busy, you hope not to take up too much of their time, but you would love to learn more about their research interests, course offerings, or their ideal kind of student. Be polite and, if they still don’t respond to this email, reach out to the second professor on your list. Don’t pester professors; they are busy people and while many of them will respond to prospective students, many more are just too focused on their research to check their emails regularly.

* If a professor does respond, write back to them! Engage in what they have to say! Ask them about their research interests, pointing out how they align with your own. Ask them about the type of students who take their classes—what qualities do they overwhelmingly exhibit? What makes a student successful within their department? What does the professor wish every incoming freshman did to prepare for the rigor of his or her classroom? How do they like the university’s culture and pedagogical approach? Questions like this will not only sustain a conversation, but they will also give you clues into the values of the university—things you can mention within your letter of continued interest.

* Contact admissions. Hold tight for those templates, which are coming later in this guide.

Clueless on what you should write to a professor? Check out [my guide](https://www.helpwithapps.com/store/p16/LOCI) for a template and an example! 

**How to email your admissions officer**

Many universities list admissions officers by their region or territory (the part of the world in which they read applications and travel from school to school, recruiting potential new applicants). You might be able to find your regional admissions officer just by Googling the university’s name + “admissions officers by region”. If that doesn’t bring up any results, approach your high school guidance counselor to see if the regional admissions officer has visited your school in the past. If he or she has, your guidance counselor likely has the individual’s name and, if your guidance counselor is nice (and you ask politely), he or she will share that person’s email address with you, as well. Alternatively, some universities have an open-to-the-public faculty directory, in which you can enter the admissions officer’s name and find their contact information. 

**What to say**

Eager to get started? Here’s a bare-bones template for you so you can get an idea of what you should write.

Dear Admissions Officer [last name],

[Last week I met an alum, talked to a professor, discovered some cool program or tradition at school]. I did not think it was possible, but it made me like Harvard even more!

I appreciate you considering my application to Harvard and am excited about the second chance you have given me to be considered within the regular decision pool. Harvard remains my top choice in universities for countless reasons.

[Include a few sentences about your discussion with an alum, current student, or professor. Don’t just say that you talked to someone or what you talked about—discuss why it strengthened your passion for the university and how you will engage with that professor, class, research opportunity (whatever it is you discovered in your conversation) if accepted to the university.]

I know that it has been a number of months since I applied for admission to Harvard, so I feel compelled to share with you a [project, award, anything new about you] of which I am very proud. 

[Go into greater detail about that new piece of information. It can be something small or large, but it must be new and interesting. You just won an award, was named captain of whatever, you got to do something cool with your internship, your club just raised $X. You can stretch this ""new"" quality, too, by just saying you learned something new that reinvigorated your passion for learning. I.e.: ""In psych class we just learned about [whatever]. It made me look at the topic of psychology with fresh eyes. I am now interested in minoring in psychology. I explored Harvard's psychology website and discovered [something cool] and I would love to pursue this program/minor/internship/class in the future. This would also be a good opportunity to mention your great grades fall semester or a new and improved test score you wish to add to your application.]

I know you are incredibly busy, and I greatly appreciate your time. I am very excited about the possibility that I may attend Harvard in the future, and wish you the best of luck for the remainder of this academic year. 

Sincerely,
[Your first and last name]
[Your school]
[Your city and state]

**""Can I get an example?""**

Why yes, you can. 

Subject Line: Email from prospective applicant regarding South Asian Languages department
						
Dear Admissions Officer Newt,
						
I hope this email finds you well! I appreciate you considering my application to the University of Chicago and am excited about the second chance you have given me to be considered within the regular decision pool. UChicago remains my top choice in universities for countless reasons.

As a UChicago alumnus yourself, I am sure you have experienced countless illuminating conversations with professors. Last week, I had the opportunity to do just that with Professor Sascha Ebeling, a professor within the South Asian Languages and Civilizations department. Initially, I was drawn to the University of Chicago for its Core curriculum and my ability to simultaneously major in SALC and study the humanities, social sciences, natural and physical sciences, mathematics, and more through the Core curriculum. In talking to Professor Ebeling, my love for UChicago has only grown, for I have never met a professor so eager to converse with a prospective applicant. UChicago really stands out as a university which cares about their undergraduate students.
						
It is my desire to become, like Professor Ebeling, a polyglot—not only learning multiple languages, but using my insight into those languages to translate ancient texts to better understand the resultant modern-day cultures. For that reason, I am drawn to SALC courses that engage with modern-day topics, such as “Inequality: Gender, Violence, Citizenship” and “Islam in Modern South Asia.” I love how UChicago melds both theory and practice, enabling me to deeply investigate ancient texts and the theoretical approaches to understanding them, while gaining research and job training experience.
						
Speaking of job training experience, since I applied in October, I am newly employed at my local history museum, where I am a docent. I love sharing my knowledge on various exhibits—gems, World War II posters, pottery from Mesopotamia—with museum attendees, and hope to get involved in the wonderful museums at UChicago. I would be eager to find out, for example, whether UChicago’s Oriental Institute employs undergrads. I could imagine applying my newfound skills as a museum docent to my work there! 
						
I know you are immensely busy and thus I greatly appreciate the time you have taken to read and respond to this email. It is my greatest hope that I may one day surround myself by others who are just as intellectually curious about ancient languages and texts and their modern-day applications as I am; I know that I can find such a community at UChicago.
						
Sincerely,
[Name]

In your email, it is important that you reference your conversation with the professor/current student/alum, but also go beyond that to mention other things you’ve learned about the university (in this instance, this student references two classes). They also—which is key—update the admissions officer with new information that adds value to their application. 

**Need more help?**

I have three more (awesome) examples of letters of continued interest, sent to admissions officers, utilizing real students' experiences, accomplishments, etc. **These letters have worked for my past students, and similar letters can work for you, too**. If you wish to purchase my comprehensive guide, [check it out here](https://www.helpwithapps.com/store/p16/LOCI). 

As always, feel free to comment on this post and ask me questions! I am happy to help (for free)!

**Last words**

If you were deferred ED/EA/SCEA/REA, send your LOCI by the end of January. If you want to send a LOCI for your RD school, don't send your email to AOs in January (though you can get started now emailing professors/current students/alumni). Instead, send LOCI to your colleges in late February/early March.

Do not copy my templates verbatim. I have seen many kids on Reddit try to copy my verbiage and it **will hurt—not help—your application to use my templates/examples word-for-word**. Think about it: thousands of people see these posts, and many will hopefully use my advice. If dozens of you use my examples word-for-word, colleges **will** catch on, and you will be penalized. So, do yourself a favor and put things in your own words, using your own ideas, research, style of writing, etc. 

Lastly, real kids get into their dream schools. The key is to create a 3D version of yourself for the AO—who you are, what you value, how you embody the university's values, and how you can add value to their campus. A great application is the first step, but a LOCI can go a long way to helping you get that proverbial fat envelope come late March/early April.

I just had a, very, casual interview today for what's listed as an internship, but more of a ""we'll hire you as needed"" job for a small Defense Contractor company. I'm a junior computer science major at my college. Interview went well and I have a really good chance for the position according the guy who interviewed me. However, I feel it's a lot and it's causing unneeded anxiety. Out of everything the guy told me the company wants to do over the next 1-3 years, I really only feel I have the ability to do one, maybe two of them. I lack any database experience that he is looking for and cannot for the life of me remember how to write up a data flow diagram, let alone one big enough for the project he wants, and I can't do any modeling or simulation. Yet he felt I could be a good fit.

I'd be working alone, no team, and presumable from home in my on campus apartment other than the times I would meet directly with him. But he would want me to start during my current semester, and I just don't feel I have the time. Both my girlfriend and mother agreed that quitting my current job at our on campus IT desk would help with time (but I really don't think so since it only frees up the early mornings when I work and the occasion afternoon hours between classes on Tuesday). 

However, discussing this with my mother has brought up a good point. I really only knew that after graduating, I only wanted to do software engineering, but it doesn't seem like there are many jobs looking for that right now (at least that I can find so far). She stated that every job requires learning something at the start, which is not wrong, but I still feel worried about potentially taking this job with the contractor.

I'm currently on my last year of Comp Sci, this will be my sixth internship. I'm in a co-op program, so I've pretty much accumulated 2 years of experience since Cégep. For those who wonder, Cégep is a pre-college in Québec.

I'm looking for an internship opportunity that could end up in a career afterwards. I don't really have projects out of school, as I've been a full-time athlete since I started University.
I'm looking for an internship preferably in Canada, possibly anywhere else.

I've been told my resume looks like a wall of text... What do you guys think?

I did my undergrad in CS and then worked in webdev for a year and a half after which I decided to go back and get my masters focusing on machine learning and computer vision. 

I have done well in my coursework and am about to finish up my thesis exploring new fully convolutional architectures for semantic segmentation (working with a university collected dataset in a specific domain I won't mention because you could probably find me). On paper I actually feel okay about what I have been able to accomplish and learn. Here is the deal though, there is so much that I feel I should know that I don't.

There are a lot of things I feel comfortable with, OpenCV, SciKit-learn, SciKit-Image, Pytorch, Keras etc etc. But at the same time I know that my mathematical foundations could be a lot better (I have tried really hard to stay on top of it but there is only so much I can pick up without going back for a Math or Stats degree). Some annoyingly basic stuff has faded for me from my CS undergrad (obscure data structures, bit rustier than I should be on big o but maintain good intuitions which I know isn't good enough).

I have had some small internships and have been working in 2 CV based labs on my campus doing research. All the interviews I have done previously I feel like I kinda just slipped into the position. They all asked a couple stupid easy questions and then essentially just said, ""who knows if you'll be good but it is only an internship so you can't screw anything up too much.""

As I start looking for full time positions though I am struggling to come to terms with the fact that I don't know everything I want to before I start interviewing. How do I deal with this? How do interviewers deal with this? There are so many ML/CV algorithms to understand they can't possibly expect me to remember everything, right? What about my imperfect maths and rusty CS undergrad memory? Will that be what dooms me in these interviews? Anyway, just looking for advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation, sorry this got long. Do interviewers for ML/CV positions expect widespread mastery? I love working in the intersection between machine learning and computer vision but that makes it tough because then I feel like I need to have mastery of both, which also requires mastery of stats/linAlg/calc and mastery of all undergrad level CS.

TLDR - I can honestly say I have worked my @$$ off getting my degrees and I have good work and grades to show for it but I legitimately feel like there is still way too many things I have forgotten or need to learn before I am ready to be a fully competent ML/CV engineer. What do interviewers expect? What can I do to be better prepared? Worst case do I need to be ready to pivot to another type of position?

I realize that this question seems like a very I-am-very-new-to-programming-question at face value. Please keep reading.

I'm a graduated CS student and I believe myself to be a fairly competent programmer. I have a good job lined up and I've had internships, etc. I currently work doing front-end web development. This is just for context. I know my fair share of programming languages, I am probably most fluent in javascript and python. However, due to my progression through higher education, I was never introduced to C or C++. 

I feel like this is a hole in my knowledge. I have a cursory knowledge of C/C++ and am familiar with computer architecture, assembly but would describe myself as pretty seriously a noob when it comes down to writing a C program. I am not neccessarily interested in pivoting my career into infosec or netsec but it is what got me interested in programming/CS. I have some time before I start my job and I've been spending it enriching myself, filling holes in my education. 

So my question is this: given my background, in a security/netsec context, which will be more ""enriching""? It seems everything I search on is either 1) very detailed, to the point regarding implementation or 2) geared towards people just getting started

I'm tempted to say that C will provide a better learning experience but C++ generally seems easier to learn. Is this true? Which will provide more value? C++ seems easier and more familiar.

Sorry if this isn't necessarily a question for this subreddit. I am tempted to ask it on /r/cscareeradvice but it's not really a career question and I've found that the folks here tend to be more experience and humble. "

Some weeks ago I've bought some fans and a new 4TB HDD for my PC. Since my MOBO has only 1 PWR_Fan and 2 SYS_Fan places, I had to use 1 Y adapter to be able to put install all the fans (4 in total), and because of the HDD, I had to use an extension cable for my DVDRW. 

Why am I telling you all this? Because after I did these things, some days later my pc started freezing randomly nearly everyday. Freezing like really freezing. Randomly. While browsing the internet, moving my cursor around, or even having nothing opened and just clicking on the desktop. Would happend once or twice a day. The screen, the sound, the mouse, the keyboard, everything freezes, but I still could open and close the DVDRW. Tired looking for a crash report or anything like that, but windows does not let anything behind since it has no time to do so because of the freeze.

Anyway, I started taking out one by one every change I did to the PC that day, since since that day this stupid thing started. Interesting to note is that until yesterday, it never froze playing a video game. First I took out the DVDRW because I used an extension cable to it. Still freezing. Then took out one of the fans and the Y cable with it. For 2 days I had no freezes, but yesterday, for the first time I got a freeze while playing a video game. I took out the last thing, the 4TB HDD, then went to bed. 2 hours ago I woke up, browsed the internet for 20 minutes, then freeze.

I'm all out of ideas... I thank you all in advance!

7rxu4e,1,2018-01-21,been preparing for my first career fair at the university i attend. problem is that i am graduating in august with a degree in math with cs minor. no internships or anything. I'm worried about the elevator speech.,akguitar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7rxu4e/been_preparing_for_my_first_career_fair_at_the/,"Pretty much all experience i have is in the classroom. ive taken OOP, data structures, comp org, and atm im taking software engineering. my group is planning on implementing a nintendo emulator using WebGL.

Other than that im working on a personal website to get some exp with HTML, CS and JS/angularJS. been working through a python book as well. That's all i have.

So in terms of elevator speech, most examples online that i find assume that i will have something relevant to talk about with a company i am presenting myself to. However, with my lack of side projects and internships, I am not sure exactly what i could say to have myself stand out.

So here is a generic example of what i will typically find, this is from a previous cscareerquestions thread:

""Hi I'm x, nice to meet you. I'm a senior CS student interested in working in (companies industry) and am currently looking for an internship. Could you tell me more about (something about the company or whatever)? Oh very cool, I actually have some experience working with ...blabla / yeah I agree. there's definitely a lot of value in (companies industry). I mean look at.... blabla. well nice meeting you, could I give you my resume? ""

my problem is exactly when ""Oh very cool, I actually have some experience working with ...blabla / yeah I agree ""

i dont think i can pull that off...

Am i overthinking this? what should i do to make the most out of my situation?"

**Where I am now:** I am in my mid-20s and work at a private equity firm. I will be leaving my job this summer to attend an [M7 business school](https://poetsandquants.com/2015/01/05/the-m7-the-super-elite-business-schools-by-the-numbers/).

**Where I came from:** I went to a public high school in the northeast and was a good student, but was raised in a family where going to college meant going to the local public college. An exotic school to me was Boston University. To emphasize this point, if you would have asked 17 year-old me what Williams College was, I would have no idea.

Long story short, I applied to about 10 schools in the northeast and ended up at a flagship state school (think UNH, UMaine, UVM). After a mediocre first year (no ECs and a 3.0 GPA) I transferred to a small state school in my home state for financial reasons. 

The school I transferred to is known as being good (ranked in the top 20 of US News *regional* rankings) but is by no means a “target” school for recruiting. I pledged a fraternity my second year and finished the year with a 2.6 GPA. Again, other than the fraternity, no ECs. Junior year was much of the same. At the end of my junior year, I was not in the best of positions. I was not technically an economics major, because my GPA was too low to take upper-level economics classes; therefore I needed to have a stellar next semester to have any shot at an economics degree, and even then I would graduate a semester late. One bright spot was, I had lined up an internship at a retail bank for the summer.

Something clicked in me that summer, I think it was the discipline of going to the internship everyday, and I came back to school with a renewed sense of motivation. I crushed the fall semester and was allowed to take upper-level economics classes in the spring. I joined the student investment fund, and parlayed that into a finance internship in NYC for the summer after my senior year. I then came back for my extra semester and graduated in December with a just above a 3.0 cumulative GPA.

After graduation, I took a job in the “back office” (finance, operations) at a bulge-bracket investment bank (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley) in a non-hub city (aka not NYC, London, SF etc.). It wasn’t a dream role, but it was a foot in the door.

While at the investment bank, I studied and networked into a role at a private equity firm. The role I took at the PE firm was also non-traditional (it was the first person they ever hired in that role), but I have since been promoted into an investment, or “deal”, role.

Post grad, I have also become much more involved in my community. Most importantly, career-wise, I’ve taken on leadership roles in non-profits and industry groups. I believe this helped me with b-school admissions.

**Lesson:** What I hope to convey is, even if you go to a state school, end up transferring to an even smaller state school, and continue to struggle, all hope is not lost. Try to figure out a path that is reasonable and attainable (for me it was first just getting into the economics program, then it was getting an internship), then continue to seek out opportunities. 

One big tip I have for doing this is to use alumni from your school. Alumni who have “made it”, especially from lesser-known programs, are usually very eager to help current students. Reach out and say that you’re interested in what they do and want to learn more about it. Just be sure to give back and help out students yourself once *you* have “made it”!

To those who have already been admitted to a great school, congrats, you deserve it! Go on and keep crushing it. This post is not meant to glorify a harder path, but to give perspective to those who may need it.

**TLDR:** Went to a small state school, had a low GPA, little ECs. I now work at a private equity firm, am involved in my community, and will be attending a top business school next year. If you’re anxious or struggling, you have time to right the ship."
7rzbw5,8,2018-01-21,CS - Go for masters or get industry experience and then apply for PhD program?,tobysblog,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/7rzbw5/cs_go_for_masters_or_get_industry_experience_and/,"So, I'm sort of coming to terms with the fact that I am *DEFINITELY* not getting into a PhD program at any big school. As a short little profile:

CS Undergrad at CSU San Marcos. 3.67 GPA (w/ 3.69 GPA since Transfer from CC), graduating Fall 2018. I wish to study AI, specifically NLP. Yes, I know AI is hot right now. Biggest blemishes on my record are a failed Linear Algebra, that I retook and passed w/ A and a Discrete Mathematics that I got a C on. Also, I had to withdraw from a semester halfway and take a semester off due to unforeseen family issues. I will have 2 internships under my belt. 0 research. I haven't taken the GRE yet, but for the sake of this post, lets assume I get good scores (I'll of course have to reevaluate my plans if I don't score well... and by reevaluate I mean go into industry haha).

So my obvious, huge concern is that I have no research done at all. There is likely going to be no explicit research opportunities available to me. They have a summer research program, but I have a pretty good internship lined up. The only option I see is to try to do independent research, but I am not quite sure how to go about that. 

So, I guess my concern is, even if the best case scenario happens (e.g. Stellar GRE scores, somehow get a paper published), I still don't have a good enough CV to get myself into good programs. So, the two paths to a PhD that I see are 1)Master's program to prepare myself for a doctoral program, building up research, improving my GPA or 2)Go into industry and apply years down the line, I presume somehow getting independent research experience.

I feel like option 1 is the better option, but I've heard that C.S. Masters are much more industry oriented and it is hard to set yourself up for getting into a PhD program. Is this true? With my stats, would I even be able to get into a Masters program that would put me on course to get into a PhD program? Or, should I just abandon all of this, go get some industry experience, and come back to ""the dream"" at a later date?"

Also, even though my GPA is strong, I feel genuinely inferior frequently when people are (figuratively) talking about accepting their nobel peace prize for their solar powered aquifer right after completing their internship at Google and finishing up their Linux server and how they seemingly learned English and programming in parallel.

My second issue is that in my classes, it feels like I am learning and studying more than actually creating and building, and my concern is that I will be unable to make the switch at my first job and will struggle.

Out of school nearly 2 years, a few internships exposed me to full-stack development in agile environments. Lucky enough to have a breadth of experience, although not so much depth. I'm on my 2nd job out of uni now, working in a very established enterprise company with pretty good development practices. 


In general I've felt less than other programmers I'm around. I'm still not entirely confident in my abilities, and feel like things take me longer than others. Starting at this job, there's much complexity behind the technology we use. Many separate codebases interacting with each other. While following the business logic is usually straightforward, just making changes lead to unintended consequences, because I don't fully understand how a system is supposed to function. I've been here for over 2 months now too, but haven't done anything significant, barely any coding. Mostly reading code and minor bug fixes.


I also have pretty bad short-term memory. Its something that I've come to terms with and rely on writing things down to help alleviate any trouble being forgetful might cause. 


I want to take this opportunity to develop myself into a contributor people are confident in relying in. I want to leave a solid mark at this company so that I can establish a good reputation. I want to develop myself into a solid dev. How do I ensure I'm on track for this?"

It's true that the recruiting material of a company does not accurately reflect its values or cultures. I also clearly phrased my post poorly, since I didn't mean to focus on Google specifically. Rather, I wanted to find out if anyone had a recommendation from personal experience of companies that value open discussion of their ideas and mission statement. I certainly also had no intention of criticizing the tech industry as a whole. 

My motivation behind this post was that the company I previously interned at seemed to be on the opposite end of the spectrum: surprisingly low morale within my team and division. While I found this unappealing, I also don't want to work at a company where it could be viewed as blasphemous to criticize any of its aspects. But clearly, from most developers' experience here, it seems that open discussion is much more common across the board than I thought. As a college student, I only have limited industry knowledge so far; I hope you understand how I could misjudge the accuracy of recruiting materials. Thanks for taking the time to discuss and share your opinions. 

Anyway, my original post is below. 

----------------------------------------------

Maybe I'm crazy, but when I saw Google's recruiting videos, I thought it was the stuff of nightmares. It seems like the campuses are loaded with perks that are designed to make you stay at the office after hours and keep working because after all, work is ""fun."" There was also a cringe-worthy line where a manager told a group of interns that ""at Google, we have the opportunity to make more impact in a year than most people do in their lifetime."" What a condescending statement. I hope no one at any company thinks of their work as objectively superior in impact to the rest of the population. 

The last thing I want to do is work at a company where I'm expected to cheer and clap when the CEO walks in the room, or where I'm expected to only sing praises of the company. I believe there should always be a healthy level of cynicism and that people shouldn't be afraid to discuss and criticize aspects of the company, or even the mission statement itself. I believe that encouraging open, honest discussion about these topics is healthy.

With that being said, what are some examples of tech companies that fit these ideals and don't drink the Kool-Aid? I don't necessarily mean places where you consider your job to be ""just a job."" I don't think passion and dedication to your work and having a healthy level of skepticism are mutually exclusive. At least, I hope not.
 
Side note: Another thing that bothers me is the companies that portray themselves as ""quirky,"" but on the other hand, companies that try to hard to have a ""bro"" / frat culture are pretty unappealing as well. What companies have, for lack of a better word, a pretty normal, sociable culture? "

I'm a 30 yr old dude seriously interested in making a career change and learning to become a software developer. 


My original plan was to earn an AS in computer science at my local community college, and then transfer to a 4-yr school to complete my BS.


However, my local CC does offer an AAS in software development.  This approach would be much cheaper than completing a four-year degree.  **Would I be able to compete in the job market with only an AAS?**


Some background: I have a BS in biology and have been doing field work with birds for the past few yrs.  Was planning on going back and getting an MS, but do to a sad series of events, that's no longer an option. This series of events does give me the opportunity to go back to school in my home town, however (where pursuing an MS in biology isnt an option, but a degree in CS is).  Additionally, I'm realizing I will never earn enough money as an ornithologist to be comfortable.


I was a pretty shit student when I earned my first BS (average grades, no internships, no relationships with my teachers), and becoming a biologist was an uphill battle for me after graduating.  I'd like to be a better competitor after completing my degree this time around.

I recently graduated from college and have yet to find a job. It looks like I'm going to have to return to my college job of waitressing. Unfortunately, I'm worried that I'll get stuck there and never manage to reach my career goals. (In case it helps, I hope to go into HR).


I'm worried for a few reasons. 


* 1- there aren't any entry level HR jobs in my area. I have looked. On several sites. The ones I find are either only for student internships or require several years experience. 


* 2- there aren't any entry level office assistant jobs that want to hire me. I figured this would at least be the smart stepping stone to take, since office jobs would impart skills I can use in HR much more than food service can. I'm not sure if I'm just bad at interviewing or they just want someone with more experience.

* 3- I'm a coward. If I call my old boss and get re-hired at the restaurant, or even if I take a brand new retail/foodservice job, I'm afraid of quitting after 2 weeks if one of the hundreds of applications I've sent to office-type jobs pans out. Because of this I'm afraid accepting a retail/foodservice job will mean I'm stuck in that line of work for a long time.


I guess I'm just looking for advice from anyone who has been here before, anyone who may have tips for breaking into an HR job, and anyone who can make me feel less like a failure for going back to waitressing despite my age (25) and degree status...or advice on being more assertive and not feeling guilty for quitting serving/retail after a few weeks if a better job pans out.


Alternatively, anyone currently in food service/retail who has advice for not hating life in that line of soul sucking work?"

The majority of my work experience is in more BI analytics, creating dashboards, web, app and database analysis. Use of SQL, Spreadshets and sometimes Javascript for setting up tracking.

In 2014 I started learning how to use R and completed the Coursera MOOC with Andrew Ng. Then, in 2015 I completed a certificate [""Big Data and Advanced Analytics""](https://ce-online.ryerson.ca/ce/default.aspx?id=3635) course in Toronto. 

Since then I've been freelancing, mostly in web tracking and reporting, however I've completed several data science projects including:

*  Statistical modeling for a content site trying to understand which types of articles lead to higher engagement (time on page)

*  Classifying text reports into categories. NLP and clustering to generate labels then XGB to classify.

*  NLP + clustering to understand text responses  of users cancelling from a SaaS service.

*  Hypothesis testing in several contexts. E.g. Choosing a new email sequence over the original, does the new sequence lead to more paying customers. 

Among a handful of other projects. 

While I might not be a particularly advanced user, I have a reasonably good understanding of when to use which method (Classification, Regression, Clustering).

I'm also reasonably confident in using R. I wrangle data a lot using R, often in exploratory analysis that might not even use ""advanced analytics"" such as the methods mentioned above, instead focusing on grouping data and generating some bar charts or a trendline.

I've also built some shiny apps (Marketing dashboards).

I have a foundational knowledge of statistics, including probability, inference and regression. I have not yet looked much at Bayesian stats but it's on my list and I'm aware it's important.

Can I call myself a data scientist?

My confidence is being hammered. I've applied to countless jobs over the past 3 months and while most just ignore me, I've noticed a common theme in those who do respond - I don't have enough relevant experience. I'm confident I could land a BI job very fast, I get a lot of Linkedin messages asking if I'm interested in positions along the lines of managing a web analytics team who use Tableau for reporting. It just doesn't appeal to me any more, data science is fulfilling and a new frontier in advancing my understanding.

I've tried applying for intern or junior data scientist positions, should I do that or should I try to sell myself into a mid level position?

I'm applying to jobs on Linkedin, Indeed and a few niche sites. I do this daily, I apply for at least one job each day with a tailored, unique cover letter and I spend anywhere between 30 minutes to a couple of hours wordsmithing it. 

I'm tri national and apply to jobs in the USA, Canada and UK, but still cannot get an interview.

At this point I'm thinking there's something fundamentally flawed in my approach. I've done everything by the book - got some formal education in advanced analytics, completed several projects and carefully applied for so many positions.

What else can I do. This is a general distress call."

I need advice finding a job.

A bit about me:

I live in North Jersey, 35 minutes away from NYC. I’ve just finished my B.S. in Comp Sci. The past two years I also worked an internship at a technology company. I got some good experience there but I should’ve taken an internship at a large company when I had the chance. I learned a lot of SQL and .NET web development. I’ve taken what I learned there to learn Xamarin and I partnered with physicist at my University to make a mobile gravitational waves simulator. It’s almost done, but not quite. There’s a lot of back and fourth on the project. I’ve also been working on a blog/portfolio website using MVC on a LAMP server. I wrote a lot of business reports and stored procs / small components for our web system at my internship. And working with one other developer I made my first school’s (County College) official app.

I’m finding with all this experience, it’s not as easy as I thought to land an entry level gig. So far I’ve received a lot of calls from consultant firms. But that’s a last resort. I don’t want to be forced to travel for 2 years. I don’t mind a contract for a year or two to learn. But I don’t want to go all over the country. There are some interesting bootcamps that are free and will pay to teach me mainframe programming. But I’m not sure if I want to be typecast into that field. 

I know I need to keep applying like crazy. But does anyone know of any train-to-hire firms/bootcamps/companies in the North Jersey/NYC area that I should consider. I’m experienced with Xamarin and .NET web development but since I’ve only had an internship with these technologies, I don’t think I’m as marketable.

Any advice for someone like me would be helpful.

Best,

Nick

This semester, I'll be taking enrolled as a full time student taking the last 5 computer science courses I need to fulfill the requirements for a B.S. Degree.

I had an internship over Summer 2017 and they pretty much told me that I should expect a formal offer in May 2018, but that was assuming I would be finished with school by this time. I'm not sure if they expected me to officially graduate or not, and I don't really know what to tell them. 

A bunch of questions are running through my head:

- Can anyone help me out? 

- Is my situation common? 

- What should I do or say? 

- Can I technically say that I've earned a B.S. in Computer Science if I completed everything except the general education requirements?

Should I be worried?,integralcowcueluss,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7s2x36/i_have_to_work_lots_of_hours_during_school_dont/,"At the moment I work about 45 hours a week. Though I am only in 7 credit hours, it's still a fairly full schedule, especially adding in commute times. I also plan on upping my hours quite a bit in the coming semesters in order to hopefully graduate a little earlier than anticipated.  

My current workload and other responsibilities really limit how many hours a week outside of class I can spend truly working on my programming. Perhaps this sub is rubbing off on me a bit too much in that I feel like I'm going to need all these sorts of side projects in the coming years in school. Although just starting out I genuinely do enjoy when I get to sit down, program, solve programs and improve my skills. I just worry that being a pretty non-traditional student who needs to work a lot is going to hinder my improvement over the next 2-3 years before I graduate. How much difference could an extra 30 minutes to an hour a day outside of class really improve my skills, if that's all I can do at the moment? I can definitely spend more time on the weekends, as long as I'm not catching up on homework.  

I enjoy this and wish more than anything I could find a way not to work and fully immerse myself in these studies and graduate in as good a position as possible. Finding a year round internship is definitely a focus for the coming years as I feel I wouldn't be wasting so much time at an unrelated job.  

Overall I suppose I'm asking, should I be worried that I don't have several hours of free time a day to just simply code? I'm learning in my classes, I just don't have the opportunity to dive in like I want. Was anyone else in a similar situation as myself and still end up being ""successful"", for lack of better terms?  

Any advice or inspiration would be great, thanks!"

7s3jgf,0,2018-01-22,Should I Drop Out of College to Self-learn Web Development?,Neocyte,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7s3jgf/should_i_drop_out_of_college_to_selflearn_web/,"**Disclaimer** 

I haven't even started learning anything related to web development yet. I was inspired by a close friend who showed me a few of her projects from self-learning. In a few months, she was able to accomplish more than I did in 2 years. I'm terrified, proud, and naive--all at the same time. 
I understand that questioning the value of a CS degree must be extremely common in this sub, but I need all the advice I can get for my specific situation. My mind is filled with thoughts and questions, but I will try to organize them as best I can. 

**Background** 

I grew up all my life being constantly told that a college degree was the golden ticket to success. I made the mistake of attending one of the most expensive private colleges in Pennsylvania (Bucknell University) for a psychology/education degree--only to discover that I hated people. After 2 years of studying, I realized that I wanted to do something in software engineering or web development. But I only came to this realization after taking a semester off from college to reflect on my interests. Right now, I am a 20 year-old student that has done nothing significant in his life. I feel *incompetent*. I want to make a product or application on my own and feel proud of myself for contributing to something tangible. I am tired of all these theories that have gotten me nowhere in life. 

**Current Situation**

After my semester off, Bucknell University offered me a Computer Science BA that can be completed in 2 years if I overload my semesters. So I took the offer and soon became miserable: 
My general ed. courses all seem inapplicable/borderline useless for web development. Furthermore, I have heard that CS degrees focus primarily on computational theory and mathematics and less on practical applications. Apparently, some CS grads even come out of college barely knowing how to program effectively! I come home everyday feeling depressed and unfulfilled from spending so much time, money, and energy on what I feel is essentially... nothing. 

The alternative that has been on my mind is to self-learn web development through FCC, Udacity, and several other MOOC's. Through these programs, I could finally gain control over my own education and learn practical skills that would be relevant to my career goals. These programs would also help me develop a project portfolio that would be instrumental in my job search (Udacity's nanodegrees, for example, have you complete a multitude of projects after each major lesson). In a couple months or a year's-worth of dedication, I might have enough knowledge and skills to obtain an entry-level developer job or at least an internship. 

What should I do and why?

**Thoughts**

* Am I a coward and failure for throwing away a college degree that might benefit me for life? 
* Why do I have to waste a total of $240,000 in tuition ($60,000 annually) and still have to learn on my own to brush up on practical skills, when I could hit the ground running with MOOC's and begin to setup a solid portfolio?
* I understand that the value of a degree isn't necessarily how much practical knowledge you gain; it is the connections and internships that truly matter. But are those connections and internships really worth a fortune? Is it impossible for me to network on my own? 


Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this. Every bit of advice goes a long way towards my future. "

I was never really social in high school. Never partied, never really hung out with people on the weekends. Never did any of that.

However, I felt like this crushing loneliness and knew I wanted to fix it in college, to have a big supportive group of friends and never be a loner again.
First semester was weird. At a school where halls are usually very close, mine never got together. My roommate turned out to be a jerk, and I made the mistake of introducing him to some girls on my hall I was friends with, who he promptly became super tight with in a way I never could because he's gay. So I was left out there. I became close with the guys on the floor above me, and we're planning to room together next year, all 8 of us. I went to Virginia beach with two of them for fall break, and one of those guys might be coming home with me for spring break. However, they're kinda introverted and a very jokingly rough group, like always making fun of each other and me. I don't really know if they like me or if they consider me a good friend, because I consider them my best friends and I would be humiliated if they didn't do the same.
I joined an IR club, but didn't really click with the people there, and the group of friends I did make have begun to leave me out of events and get closer, leaving me out.

I am trying to figure out what to do over the summer of 2018. I would like to do some sort of internship, if possible. This is my desire because (1) I want to learn new skills, (2) I want to make a bit of money, and (3) I prefer working to bumming around and being bored (or worse). Are there any summer internships available to people who have just finished their undergraduate degree and are preparing to start graduate school in the fall? My interests, broadly, lie in statistics, data science, and computer science. Thank you."

My current work experience is just one summer intern at a family's place where I did some small data analysis with excel, but outside of that I have no other experience. 

Over the summer I'm going to take summer courses so I can graduate on time, and I'm not expecting my GPA to go too far above a 2.0. I don't know what kind of jobs I can look for, I don't know what I can even do with my degree and gpa at this point. I'm really at a loss and I feel the anxiety and panic set in with each passing day I get closer to graduation. "

Or is knowing Java enough?,CSMinorCareer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7s7m45/should_i_learn_c_or_is_knowing_java_enough/,"Hey everyone. I am currently a senior at a school that teaches Java as the ""main"" programming language for the CS department. I intern now @ NASA and am interested in a career with a more technical field, as my major is actually chemical engineering and CS is my minor. Think aerospace, neurotechnology, or experimental engineering etc. Basically somewhere where my engineering background will help me to succeed. 

Many of the jobs I see posted for software engineer jobs at technical companies (such as NASA, Nueralink, Google X) seem to use a lot of C++, for obvious reasons. My question is, if I am proficient in Java (as much as could be expected from a student), is it worth learning C++ so that I am a stronger candidate for these somewhat specialized jobs? Or will they likely be able to get all of the info they need from me interviewing in Java? 

Thanks!  

Edit: I feel like I should mention, I love learning new things so it isn't that I am wondering if it is worth it at all, but more should I spend my limited free time learning it as opposed to getting stronger with technologies I already know (aka grinding leetcode w Java). "

My reasoning:
(1) I will have experience at two companies of significantly different size, so I can judge which I like best for full time. 

(2) if I don't get a return offer from FB then I could still get a return offer from Yelp and not have to deal with recruiting again, which was an extremely stressful and anxiety riddled 2 month process I don't want to repeat. 

(3) I will save between $4,000-$5,000 on University housing if i return in the winter semester. So taking the pay cut of intern to full time is negligible. 

So, Reddit, does this seem like a good choice?
Will accepting Yelp in the fall potentially harm my reputation with Facebook?
Should I let Facebook know that I am working for a different company in the Fall?

I am Master's student from a top 10 CS university with two internships under my belt (one of them w/ Fortune 25 Company) and plenty of research and projects. Last semester I accepted an internship offer with a new financial company offering me $29/hr because they were very nice to me and valued my experience.

My goal is to eventually work at one of the Big 4 because I feel a recognizable name for internships is pretty crucial.

The issue here is I have already accepted the offer on paper and signed. Should I end up doing the internship or should I seek out a more prestigious name for an internship (and probably be black listed from this company/ and it is pretty messed up)?

7sa6bc,4,2018-01-22,Coming Up With a Back-up Plan,illiniithrowaway,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/7sa6bc/coming_up_with_a_backup_plan/,"Hi,

So given how competitive graduate CS programs appear to be (based on both posts here and gradcafe), I figured it was useful to come up with a back-up plan in case I come up empty. If anyone has found themselves in a similar position, I would welcome any ideas.

To offer some background on my particular situation, I graduated from a top 5-10 undergraduate CS program last Spring with a GPA of 3.6 (CS GPA of 3.55) and a humanities minor. My GRE was 169 Q / 168 V / 5.5 W. I had very little research experience, having spent a semester doing paid programming work for a lab focused on high-performance computing. At the time, I was mostly focused on getting an industry job so I did several swe internships and some freelance work. I also held a tutoring job, providing virtual tutoring in CS and Math. Since graduating, I have been working at a fairly well-known financial services firm applying machine learning to a fairly wide range of areas.

For recommendations I have two letters from professors, one from a notoriously difficult theory course where my class rank was in the top 5 out of 350ish students and another from a graduate level ML course where I received an A. The last recommendation is from a PhD I work with in my current role.

I've applied to a mix of top 25 MS programs that offer funding (UW-Madison, Cornell, UBC, Toronto, etc.) and PhD programs in the 50-75 range. However, I am skeptical of my chances given my lack of significant research experience. Hopefully I'm overthinking things and have a shot at at least one program?

Regardless, I think it is worthwhile to have a back-up plan. Currently, I've thought of the following possibilities:

1. Complete a ""cash-cow"" masters program in hopes of gaining research experience. I applied to several of these as well (Stanford, Michigan, Dartmouth, etc.), and would think I would probably get into at least one of these. This is relatively unattractive due to the enormous cost (on top of the lost income). However, I had no debt coming out of undergrad and my parents could help with some of the cost so it likely would be doable.

2. Find a way to gain research experience. I live in a major city with several large research universities, so it may be possible to volunteer my time to a lab. Not sure how interested professors would be in working with me part-time, although I have a lot of practical skills to offer a group doing more applied research. Has anyone done this before? I've also heard of post-bacs in other fields, but cannot find any notable ones in computer science.

3. Settle on doing a professional masters (e.g. GTech OMSCS) and realize that I likely will not be able to work with ML beyond the grunt work I am doing for PhDs today.  Not really attractive at the moment, even if it would be financially prudent.

4. ?

tl;dr: Lack of research experience may ruin funded MS and PhD chances. How can I set myself up to have a chance at these programs in a later cycle?"

**Pros**:

* Good pay/benefits.  Right now I make about $67,000 and get 2-3% raises annually.  Plus 401k and medical benefits.
* Plenty of jobs
* **Specific to my current job**: I get to work from home every Wednesday.
* **Specific to my current job**: I like my coworkers.
* In my past 2 IT jobs, the office environment has been pretty lax (not too corporate-feeling, get to wear whatever I want)

**Cons**:

* Constant education (have to stay on top of new and emerging technologies)
 * I don't have anything against learning new things, but IT, especially when it comes to corporate use, really isn't something I care about, so I don't really have much drive.  For example, today a coworker asked ""How are your C# skills?"" and I answered ""Pretty much non-existant."" and he said ""We might need to both brush up on it for this new project."" and all I thought was ""Fuck...I don't want to learn C#.  I got out of programming for a reason.""
* Bringing my laptop home with me everyday makes me feel like I'm bringing work home with me.  I'd like to work in an environment where everything work-related stays at work.  However, a good part of this is that if I'm sick or need to stay home for some reason, I can work from home.  So this one is a double-edged sword.
* Even though I said my past 2 jobs haven't had much of a corporate-feel, I still want to get away from working for a big company, or anything where you're working in a typical office building.  Also, not every corporate job down the line is gonna let me wear jeans and a hoodie every day.  My IT internship in college had me wearing khakis and a collared shirt every day and I hated it.  I don't mind needing clothing that is required for the job (i.e. construction requiring a hard hat and boots and gloves), but I really don't want to have to dress business casual or even formal to go work in an office.


**My passions/hobbies/interests/things that just make me feel good**

* Playing guitar
* Hard Rock/Metal (music)
* Parkour
* Ninja Warrior
* Martial Arts
* Nature
* Asian culture, particularly China and Japan.
* Dogs (animals in general, really)
* Video Games
* Cleaning/organizing
* Creating things that are visually appealing
* Building/fixing things (I'm not instinctively handy, but I'm a quick learner when it comes to it)

Basically what I'm trying to think of is something that relates at all to anything on this list that can grant me a similar level of living, but I don't know what it could be."

7sb6ex,45,2018-01-22,Am I unemployable?,Kittii_Kat,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7sb6ex/am_i_unemployable/,"Hello Reddit, thanks for reading.

To start things off, I'm looking to get into software engineering, with a preference toward game development. I've attended two colleges, but only graduated from one - each focused on game programming.

The first was DigiPen, which I attended for about 2.5 years before a major life event happened and took me away from that opportunity. This school is fairly well-known in a field and has gained me a few kudos for attending, despite not finishing.

Second, when I was able to afford college again but had moved and was looking for something that fit my needs, I attended the University of Advancing Technology via online courses. Most of my credits from DigiPen transferred and after about two years of online courses, I graduated from here with a 3.52/4.0 GPA.

That was two years ago. I've been looking for work since.

While I was attending college, I applied to hundreds of internships, entry-level, junior, and associate positions.. but was unable to land any of them. After college, while still looking, I worked with two small indie groups for no pay (I was to be paid by a % of whatever the project made). Each of these groups fell apart for reasons beyond my control.

I've been unemployed for about two years. During that time I was living off of my savings, which was made easier because all costs were split between me and my partner, and we don't go spending money willy-nilly. But after two years, it's rough. In this time I've applied to thousands upon thousands of positions - internships, entry, associate, junior, dev 1, even senior in a few cases... just to give it a shot.

Most don't get back to me, maybe 10%. Of those that do, a few turned me away due to ""lack of experience"", while the rest simply ""decided to go with another candidate"". I've reached the final stages of the grueling multi-month hiring process a number of times, only to be beaten out by competition (or that's what they tell me). Outside of issues in the field, I've been applying to any other jobs that I feel I could do - things that require a degree just for the sake of having a degree, things that require no degree, minimum wage jobs, etc. Places like Target, Walmart, and other ""high school students can do this"" positions simply ignore me.

Even my previous employers ignore me, despite leaving on good terms.

I'm now on the verge of homelessness, with a massive student loan debt defaulting to my dad (since I can't pay it), who isn't much better off than me.. and I'm feeling like there's nothing I can do. Obviously the whole situation is having a nasty impact on my mental health as well.

Am I unemployable? If so, how do I fix it when *nobody* will hire me? "

Long story short I had a physics degree, minor in math, worked for about 6 months at an engineering job I hated in another state, and got laid off. I took one C++ class my senior year and wish I had done CS all along. 

Thing is, I suck at teaching myself to program and need some form of formal training, but I don't feel like going back for a full degree is entirely necessary to get a software development job and want to start working again soon. I'm considering a post-baccalaureate certificate at a local college because I can live at home with my parents and it can be done fairly quickly (3 semesters), and cheaply. [Link here](http://bulletin.vcu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/computer-science/computer-science-certificate/)

The plan: Start teaching myself to program now and work on personal projects. Take one pre-requisite class over the summer at a CC, take at least two semesters worth of classes (24 credits) and hopefully have a strong enough foundation and personal projects to apply for jobs after those two semesters. If not then I'll complete the certificate and finish it up in three semesters and start applying. 

I've talked to advisers in the program and they have said that students almost always pick up an internship and start working towards the end of the program and are able to secure their desired employment afterwards. But I'd like some other opinions from others who have completed programs similar to these. As long as I put in the effort do you think this program would be worth it or should I consider other options? I've looked at OSU's online degree but it's pretty expensive. Any opinions would be greatly appreciated. "

Some companies have really high standards so I just add those assessments into experiences to improve them later on. As of today, I've had like 3 final interviews already but its still unfortunate for me. I'm still not giving up because if i do, then I lose the game.

Looking back at some of my colleagues in college, most of them aren't that good in some subjects and would tend to look for me and ask for the answers on some homework/projects. I also tend to give tutorials to some of them who wouldn't understand some topics regarding the subject. But they still got the most rewarding job in the end. Pretty unfair for me after all the work but I still set that aside and hoping that we wouldn't cross the same path.

Anyways, I'm not that good with coding either but I know the basic syntaxes and principles of some PL. I cant code without references or documentations on the internet. I've finished my ojt requirement because of some help in stackoverflow and my mobile development subject by that time. I've also tried applying as mobile dev specializing in android but some companies have too many requirements to which I couldn't keep up with. I've tried applying also as an IT staff because I think of it as a starting point in the IT world but theres too many applications that I dont think I have a chance with those but I still apply nevertheless. Today, I'm basically learning about front end development with the help of some tutorials in Udemy and have successfully deployed 2 web apps (one powered by python django and other is wordpress with custom themes php) and I'm currently working on another one for portfolio references. 

If for some reason, I'm still not been able to find a job, then my last resort would be joining the Army as an OCS (Its better than being at home doing nothing and just being a freeloader).

So what do you guys think? Am I screwed? Any suggestions?"

I spent the last month and a bit learning basic android development and making my first app. Nothing fancy, just a game collection app that uses Giantbomb's Api for the data and lite sql for storage. But it's something, and it looks nice. 
What are your recommendations for the types of projects I should be doing or languages I should be familiar with to help stand out in a herd of computer science majors? (any general final year recommendations) 

Should I just stick with Java and Android projects, or am I better spending my time doing something else?

Are internships during the school a thing, would it be weird to go around asking companies for an internship?

Second year student, applying to internships currently. Secured an internship with a top-15 privately owned org in the US.

In relation, I’d like to know which languages I should be using when working on projects whilst trying to enter a Soft Eng or Infrastrusture type job.

I’ve got 2 projects using Python and SQL which have seemed to impress employers at interviews, but I feel I can do a lot more. Recently I’ve been learning Java, C and some form of app development. Would tying to tackle a project with multiple languages to basic knowledge or one which exhibits extensive knowledge be better?

If Company A makes me an offer today is it reasonable to wait until I hear from Big4 to accept or decline?

How big of an impact overall on my long-term career would starting at Big 4 rather than a small shop?

I'm a sophomore (one of the three ranked at #11 USnews) I constantly feel like I try so hard, but I'm always just gonna be ""average"". Never coded in my life until I got into college, then I proceeded to work my ass off with coding. Developed numerous apps, personal projects, did well in school, applied to 100+ companies...etc but nobody wanted me as an intern. Only offer I got was from a startup and I ended up interning there for $6/hour as the only mobile developer in the startup, doesn't sound too bad right? Wrong, the startup (&lt;20 people) was filled with incompetent people and other devs often came to me to ask me to help debug their code, like actually. I was only an intern getting paid $6 yet I did their website, campaign page, mobile app, managed their databases, did 3D CAD for their prototypes, worked the email list, had to stay in contact with investors, and I worked on the weekends + overtime for no overtime pay. I was a slave. But I told myself it would get better, that as a sophomore I would be doing much much better.

Speed up to sophomore year. Grinded leetcode and hackerrank like crazy. Applied to 100+ places, ended up getting 1 offer from a no-name company and 1 big telecommunications company for 22/hour. Rejected from most saying that ""I don't have enough experience"" or they're ""looking for juniors."" In fact, I just got a rejection from Blizzard despite passing all test cases on their hackerrank in around 30% of the allocated time. It's nice that I at least have an offer to fall back on, but I don't understand why I'm doing so poorly considering how much work I put in. How do people even get internships at G/FB/AM/MS? I applied to so many places with referrals and they didn't even bother to reject me. I would really love to work in the bay area but I just can't seem to land anything. I've had my resume looked over by 1 guy at FB and 1 guy at Groupon and they both think it's decent. Even if my resume isn't as good as I think it is I think it is I would still expect to hear back from some other companies. Bloomberg/Twitter/Uber/Lyft/Coinbase/Square...list goes on and on where I either didn't hear back or I did at least decently well on their hackerrank and never heard back. I don't know I feel so lost. I've worked so hard but it's amounted to nothing much more than ""average"". Now I'm kind of just blaming my foolish self for choosing a non-target uni instead of UC Berkeley, I should have went to Berkeley man I regret it so much. All of my highschool friends are doing so much better than me right now and I had put so much work into grinding leetcode. I don't even know if it's worth it anymore. I don't want to intern with the knowledge that despite all the leetcode mediums I've done, I ended up interning at a company where the internship screening consisted of reversing a linkedlist, fizzbuzz...etc. I'm so lost."

After a week, I received a call from them and called me in for an interview on the same job but on a different engineering team- I really did well and never felt nervous whatsoever since I doubled my preparation. I didn't get a call. 

Fast forward 8 more interviews, no one called me in any of the jobs- one of which was an internship job at Intel. I always said to myself that I can do the interviews after the first meltdown on my first interview. Everything went really well, I just don't know maybe my personality is what's pulling me down. 

I started feeling bad as the rejections piled up but tried to keep up. Almost all of those 8 interviews were actually good. I started drifting away from my work ethic since pessimism has taken over me. It felt like I was too incompetent unqualified for the jobs despite my background.

I already have a good domain name, tried WordPress but apparently I need to pay $100 a year and go premium to use my own domain name? I thought ""I would rather go with SquareSpace"" but not sure about that one.

Basically my 3 options are:

1. Cheap (Free blogs, directing domain to Tumblr or something)

2. Efficient (As far as I know SquareSpace is, while I never used, pretty efficient and has no downtime, keeps stuff updated well, gives good support etc. but not sure how much of my website becomes ""mine"")

3. Personalized (Developing my own website, while learning development itself, is highly personalized, I can tinker smallest stuff, although a blog itself won't need much features, other than ability to add articles for editors there, which will be me and a friend right now, commenting etc. but still, doing something from scratch and owning it all feels like a good business decision)

I can start with 1st, go 2nd then go 3rd once I get a website ready, but like I said not sure how much of my SquareSpace website is ""mine"", and problem with option 1 is, starting too cheap in the beginning may look bad and affect the interest newcomers have.

Going efficient, like I said, may take control away from me, not to mention it is a little pricey for a student like me. But I can manage the cost.

Going personalized will take time and can have problems/errors but it will be my own creation with everything I want and while still cost, will be cheaper.

I feel like this is a time, quality, price triangle situation, 1st is less quality but faster time and better price. Second is better quality but more price and faster time. Third is slower time but good price and good quality (if I can learn well).

What is your suggestion? Go cheap, go efficient, go personalized? Or go cheap -&gt; efficient -&gt; personalized over time? Or go efficient -&gt; personalized over time?"

I have always thought internships were supposed to be short (3-6 months, occasionally there are 1 year co-ops), opportunities for students to get work experience and potentially get hired. However, it seems like my company is keeping me on as a permanent intern, without ever intending to hire me for full time regular employment. This is a giant company with around 80k employees worldwide. I am currently making $18/hr and no benefits, no raises/performance reviews. 

It’s really upsetting when a company uses the excuse that there is no money in the budget. I see managers and directors extravagantly wasting money by ordering tons of expensive food for conferences every week, traveling to different business branches every couple of weeks (this includes airfare and hotel stays, car rentals), buying expensive software licenses that many people don’t use, 3 week paid vacations for some managers and directors, etc… 

I performed exceptionally and everyone liked having me around. I got all of my work done and even helped other people out with their work, some of it wasn’t even in my responsibilities, but I did it anyway because I wanted to prove myself and get hired as a full time, regular employee. None of that really mattered, my niceness and willingness to help was exploited because I really wanted to get hired full time.

Anyways, there is a possibility that I might be let go in a month or so because interns are usually the first to get let go. It is not fair. All I want is steady employment.

I've never seen in my time here more than now so many people struggling to find work. And it baffles me how I'm seeing a motivational post about someone who applied to 1600 places before landing a job. Or how it's ok accepting below market rate offers for your first job. And every day I'm seeing floods of questions of those who struggled to find their first job months in. Which was somewhat normal in the past but is alarming now.

In H.S. I remember internships during the summer making $17/h at a local company doing programming or devops was somewhat common. Boot Camp and self learners flooded this sub with good advise and information. You didn't need a degree or plethora of projects to land a gig. The stakes were lower. At my company right now 3 developers are old Bootcamp grads and 4 have unrelated degrees. Yet we have Masters of CS graduates applying for Junior Frontend Developer positions this year. 

Now I feel CS suddenly became a massive mainstream and popular field. And this sub adamantly denies any speculation of oversaturation. I see a clash between those like me who made it vs a wave of people entering the field thinking its their only salvation to the middle class. And this creates arguments after arguments how ""its easy to find well paying work"" vs ""I was trying for months"" and scrapegoat anecdotes how ""if you are good you would have found work"" or ""you didn't have an internship and that was your mistake"". I find the whole dynamic really funny.. Like this sub is battling on the edge of what is reality and what is not.

So, I recently got an internship for my last semester. As far as I know, the company wants this internship in the spring to be a sort of training for when I graduate and then come on full time. However, there wasn’t anything to explicit except for the few things they said in the interview. The offer I signed was just for this spring of course.

I’m just wondering how likely it is to have them extend an offer for post graduation? And if I should continue to look for full time positions to have as a back up if they don’t?

What I am most interested in, and what I feel like would be the best place to start for what I want to do is to start working at an agency. The reason is to get exposure and learn from many different types of clients. Recently, a family friend referred me to a boutique agency (Company A) that seems like a great place to start. (Family Friend  grew up with the woman who owns the agency). They offered me an internship, and this family friend who got me the connection says she hears nothing but hopeful news from the agency owner about the opportunity. The internship would end in May and is unpaid (a $250 stipend at the end of the term). I do not know for sure whether they would hire me after the internship. 

On the other hand, I have a different family friend who works at a global tech company that is helping to prepare me for an interview process in an inside sales position which would pay handsomely at up to $60k including commissions. The problem with it is 1. I am not sure if sales is really the right place for me to start. 2. If I start the internship at company A, I would either have to leave early if offered the position at company B (which I am not sure would look so good), ask company B to wait until May (not likely), or turn it down. 

Hard facts are that I know for sure I have the internship with company A, as they have contacted me. Nothing about company B is set in stone. Lastly, working in company A would be a dream come true, but I don't know for sure if they would hire me post -internship. 

How do I go about navigating this issue professionally and respectfully, without completely losing out on both opportunities? My other concern is upsetting both or one of the family friends who helped me get the connections and worked to help prepare me for the opportunities. "

I am currently looking for an internship all around in Europe and after three months of intense search, two companies sent me an offer... I don't know which one to accept, honestly. Any advice?


**Company 1**: Medium-size company (50 employees, more or less) operating in the entertainment field. It is located in Ireland and they are offering me a paid Marketing internship (500€). 

I like the company, but I don't want to move to Ireland and spend a fortune for just 6 months. Also, I checked the rents in the capital, and I have to spend an average of 800€ monthly, just for a room in a shared house. That's the double I'm currently spending for my room and I don't think I can afford living there, even though I will get paid for the internship. 


**Company 2**: located in Germany, it is a pretty young company also operating in the entertainment field, but it has branches in Japan, Hong Kong, and North America. They are offering me a Sales internship, paying me a simbolic salary of 100€ per month.

I am more interested in this one just because it is located in Germany, and I don't have to move anywhere to do my internship. Otherwise, they are both interesting companies to work at.

Which one should I choose? "

I am a recent college grad who is interested in becoming a software developer. While I've been thinking about this move for a while, I am just now committing to the decision and doing the substantive research on what I need to be working on. To that end, I hope you could provide me with some guidance on my next steps.

Some quick background, I am a recent (2017) college grad from a top 5 college in the US. I majored in a social science and got a decent GPA (my GPA did not close any doors for me in internship and post-grad job-searching; that was entirely my own efforts in interview prep :) ). I was a few classes short of a double major in statistics and loved the subject a lot. I took a few intro computer-science classes as well (in Java, Python, and R) and did pretty well. I found the type of thinking intuitive. I'm currently working in a non-related industry in NYC. My original plan was to apply to law school this year, but for various (and many) reasons, that's definitely a hard no right now.  

I've been getting some competing information from my reading online; some people advise to attend bootcamps, some advise to work towards certificates, and some even advise to beeline to a master's. I understand that in any case self-study and working towards creating my first own project should be the priority. So I've picked up access to the Java Masterclass on udemy (it was my favorite in undergrad. We made solar system ""simulators""!) Definitely am enjoying working on coding rather than LSAT studying after work every day.

Would appreciate any advice, especially from people with similar backgrounds currently working in the industry. Thank you!"

7sqx7m,3,2018-01-24,It's a long post-crisis post. You don't have to read this.,EnjoysTheSilence,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7sqx7m/its_a_long_postcrisis_post_you_dont_have_to_read/,"Hey. I don't know how to do these things. I just got off the phone with the suicide hotline lady, I cancelled my appointment with the social worker who's trying to keep me alive. I'm fresh off an attempt so I'm shaky and I'm sorry if I make no sense. It's a fucking lot of text but I feel like I need to say... things.

Who am I? I'm 26, female, average looking at best but funny at least, single, socially awkward because I act weird and only realize it later, pretty smart, teacher to be, I'm graduating in a year after dropping out of school multiple times and I was supposed to do a Masters but I'm not really thinking in future tense much anymore. Diagnosed with your good ol' pal depression since 2015, my only stable relationship in life. I live with my folks, a younger sister and brother and an uncle. My dad's pretty verbally abusive, he calls me fat and worthless and (he speaks French) so he calls me an épave, which is a shipwreck because I sank and I'm not getting back up. He calls my depression a weakness and tells me to toughen up and I try but it's so fucking exhausting. My mom kind of sort of understands because she's had depression but she's not like, educated about it in the sense that she doesn't understand why someone with opportunities like me gets to be depressed. My brother is a recovering anorexia survivor and my sister is 12, I haven't really talked to my brother in years despite living with him and my sister is, well, 12.

I'm someone who tries really hard to show I'm worth it. Maybe it's because I have impostor syndrome and I feel like I have to justify my part in everything or because I'm a person of color and I was always told to work twice as hard as everyone else. It drives me nuts, I set impossible ass goals for myself and seriously, it's getting the best of me. My first attempt was when I was 12, got into some honors program bullshit for high school and I didn't want the pressure that came with that, I think, or I just really liked how the rope felt around my neck and how liberating it felt to think about being gone but my little brother came out to the backyard where I was and asked if I wanted to play, so I went to play instead. I never thought much of it. I tried again in December 2015, it just wasn't going well in my head anymore, I was struggling with my sexuality, not being able to do well at work, at that time I was coping with recent sexual assault from a man I don't know and will never find again (and I'm kind of used to this shit, I mean, I was assaulted as a child many times but it felt so much more wrong as an adult and the police could not help me with no leads on him after 48 hours) and my self-image was shit because I thought attractive = potential dangerous so I let myself get fat as hell. I cried for no reason all the time and I couldn't concentrate in school and I was so frustrated because I didn't understand anything and my professor called me out for being physically here but not mentally so, I just bawled in front of the man. I failed his class, it's a core class for a program where only 50 or so people get in every year. I don't know why but it triggered a need to immediately die. I tried to hang myself with a fucking sweater of all things and failed miserably because the knot came loose. I called a helpline, they called the cops, I was kept there for a while, therapy, lost my job over that two week leave the hospital gave me, got medicated, took a break from school. Then I stopped everything because I felt so judged by my family. I threw the pills away, I stopped seeing professionals. Cold turkey. Just stopped. I was broke anyways and paying for that made me more miserable.

I tried my best. I saturated myself with classes and found solace in transposing the love I have trouble expressing to those I love to one of my old interests: (please don't judge me) KPop, especially SHINee. I dedicated myself to it, like, fangirl crazy levels of it. I used it as a crutch for a lot damn time and it made me very happy and the music and the colorfulness of it all, it was a great escape. Didn't even have to talk about it, it was like my treasure. Video games, also. Writing. Sometimes I danced. I joined a sorority. Things like that. Still couldn't keep a goddamn job, still slept too long or not enough, still ate my emotions. 

Then a fucking miracle happened: I kept 2 jobs (at the same time) for like 7 months, started working out/dieting, got a Fitbit to monitor my sleep. I somehow felt in control. I emerged with a fantastic bump in my GPA, getting hired part-time by a school after my first internship despite not having a teaching license yet, getting a higher-than-minimum-wage second part-time job (no more grocery stores and restaurants, what?) I have fantastic friends who understand me, my best friend moved across the globe and we still keep in touch, I grew to love helping people because I was in a place where it wasn't as demanding for me to be there and I could guide people. For the first time in my life, I could say achieved things. Many of them. Surviving being the biggest one.

And yet. I felt fucking empty. Like none of this matters. Like this is what I'm supposed to do anyways and it's just automatic; I exist, I don't really feel like I'm living. All of it could vanish tomorrow and I wouldn't even care. Like I felt like I didn't want to live enough and I didn't want to die enough. Just limbo. Just existing. Realizing how my little girl dream of being a teacher meant nothing to me anymore really hurt me, now I'm not sure I love it, it's super stressful to be giving kids the tools that will build our future, but I know I'm damn good at it and those kids love me. I'm doing what I am good at, not what I love. I love things I'm not good at. I love technology for example, would have loved to work in that, but I'm shit at maths so I thought about a master's in Educational Technology to mix what I love and what I'm good at without the pressure of being engineer-levels of good at math. Now, I don't know if I want to do that. I just want the goddamned bachelors because I want to be able to say ""hey, I did a thing and here it is."" I don't particularly care for that either, I  just want my dad to be able to show it to his friends or something so he knows I wasn't always useless.

I never stopped doing some little things like not wearing a seatbelt ever, spending like I'm never gonna need that money, being a bit reckless in general and not even understanding till someone tells me THAT WAS DANGEROUS. I also do not see a doctor when I'm sick, lowkey hoping it's fatal so there's something to blame if I'm gone. (Like, I have symptoms of diabetes and it killed a few people in my family and I'm 100% not bothered enough to get it checked.)

Then, December 18th of last year happened, I just had my birthday and all, was bracing myself for the holidays I despise so... And then the lead singer of my favorite group committed suicide. I don't know how or why, I never met the guy, but that really fucked me up. I related to him a lot because when he was more candid about who he is, he sounded like me a lot. He was successful, good-looking, great at what he does and yet, depression got him. How did the person who brought so much light to me and pulled me out of my darkness ended up succumbing to it? He planned it all so carefully, and because of media coverage about it, I learned how he did it and that it's painless and it was so inspiring for all the wrong reasons. At first I felt sad about his passing, then angry at the world for mistreating him, then angry at me, then guilty because I've been surviving, it all happened really fast and my head was pounding and I almost picked up a box cutter because I couldn't deal with the thoughts spinning in my head. It just threw all my darkness right back at me and I was in pain. It became a lot less about him and a lot more about me and how I've been putting my healing aside with placebos and crutches instead of addressing my issues or finishing treatment. Everything hurt, I was crying at work, oversleeping, not eating and though I was grieving, it was not about him that I was crying but about me. My crutches are gone and it's not even fair to him because he didn't ask to be that. I called a suicide hotline, they talked to me, I still think they think I'm fucking insane for being triggered by some man I never really met. They got me back on therapy with the same woman as last time. I thought I had it together.

I've been struggling with waking up, pushing myself to 'do the thing', I don't even want to talk to my sister and we talk everyday, I can't keep up in class since my brain is not retaining anything at all, my new jobs got real dull to me. I don't care if it all goes away. Limbo again. Except I'm leaning a lot more towards dying. I don't care enough to live, but I'm afraid to die for two reasons: One, guilt. I don't want my family to live with the pain of me being gone, so I stay alive. Two, pain, but since now I know there's a painless way to do it... I keep away from stores that have what I'd need to do it or leave my card at home when I know I'm going there because I don't trust myself to not buy it.

Today and yesterday were a lot. I maybe should have slept better, maybe I shouldn't have watched that posthumous video that was released. I called the hotline a few hours ago because it was a lot. Then I went to my room, quietly, even with my sister and mom upstairs and they saw me crying as I left. Looked up how to do it right, no rope so I DIYed that shit like Pinterest with the only belt I own that I got like last week. My throat didn't like that. I'm not good with pain. I tried again, stopping like ""it hurts like a bitch"" but it would just make everything else stop hurting so I tried two more times. Still a fucking pussy. Called my mom. Cried to her. Told her. She came down to see me. She asked me if I hate my family because why would I do this to them? It's not about even about them. I love them. Dearly. It's me that I don't love anymore. I hate myself, not them. She called my dad. They're talking about having me ""taken away.""

I still feel it around my neck. Despite the pain, it felt very comforting. Like the most forceful hug.

I've come to terms with the fact I'll do it someday if I figure out a sure way to do it that I can't fuck up. I don't know guys, I feel nothing. I don't want to go on but I also don't want to be here, I feel like there's nothing more I'm doing but wasting space, getting older, uglier and more bitter about not finding that ""spark"" that keeps people going. I'm just exhausted and needed something to do so I don't try again."

I am a graduating senior (graduate in August this year) in Bachelor's of Computer Engineering from the University of Arizona.  My GPA is a 3.4 and I have a math minor.  I have two 7 month co-op experiences: one with a major semiconductor company in AZ (2015) doing RTL validation and computer architecture related work, and another with the same company in CA (2016) doing more of a software/scripting validation role.  These two co-ops delayed my graduation by a year or so. 

&amp;nbsp;


I also had an internship experience with a strong tech company in Austin (2017) for 4 months, learning about Python, automation, benchmarking and such.  My team was impressed with my work and put in a request for a full time offer starting in 2018 for me.  Unfortunately, they weren't granted any openings and could only offer me a spring 2018 internship.  I've accepted this internship, thus my final graduation date is now August 2018.  I accepted it because I fell in love with Austin and the industry in that area (many different tech companies).  This is where things get rough.

&amp;nbsp;

In the weeks leading to my internship start in the end of January, I applied to full time positions in that company and a few others.  Anything specifying Software Engineering in Austin I applied for.  However, one of these was a software position in Boston with the same company (I applied because I really like the company anyway and was getting desperate).  The interview process went well but I found myself conflicted about if I could bring myself to imagine living someplace that wasn't Austin.  When the offer came I was both happy and sad that I would have to make a decision to potentially leave an area that suited me so well.  Things only got worse when I went looking for apartments and housing close to the office area (west of Boston) and found they were at least 60% more per month for anything remotely equivalent to what I would get in Austin, with not enough of a salary difference to really accommodate this (rent for a 1 bedroom apartment could take up to 30-60+% of my base salary in Boston).  The company offers transfers but it appears that is only possible after 3 years.  And is it really good for me to go into a location fully expecting I might leave as soon as I could?  I'm not sure if the Boston area will agree with me like Austin's does (side note: I don't care about the weather stuff, it's more the feel of the city and culture).

&amp;nbsp;

Do I turn down the offer and keep looking?  At this point I'm worried if I even have the skills to make other companies without an internship with them (I'm missing frontend web development stuff like NodeJs, javascript, HTML5...).  I haven't heard from any other companies I applied to, is it too late in the year for an entry level like me to be hired?  Will I have to wait until next year if I don't accept this position?  I'm struggling because I've been told that my experience on my resume is highly appealing, and I've had very positive performance reviews with the companies I've worked with so far, yet I haven't gotten anything interview wise with any other companies.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a university student, about to finish my final year this spring. I'm studying in the UK but I am from a Central European country.

I am looking for some advice regarding my career and the steps I should take as I am worried and wondering whether I'm making the right plans/choices.


My degree is  Transport design. The industry is very competitive and there aren't many new job openings at all compared to most other industries.

However, I'm at one of the best courses in the world in the subject and the amount of students that are employed in a design field after 6 months is 70%.

My plan as of right now, is to start applying to jobs/internships early, starting in February.

Unless I somehow get a job before June, I'm planning to go back to my home country and work as a delivery driver (a job I have done for 4 months last summer and can count on 100%) while continuing looking for graduate design jobs, elsewhere in Europe.

This is my first problem. I'm worried that by relocating home, where I'm sure I won't be able to get internships or a job with my  degree, and working a shitty delivery job will make my chances of finding a job worse.

At the same time though, staying in the city where I studied would mean that I would be jobless (much more difficult to find even a shitty job), depending on my parents for money and for most jobs and interviews, I would still have to travel. Maybe less. 

*Am I planning to do the right thing there?*

The second problem that I have is that I wasn't able to get an internship in my industry during my studies. This is mostly because I did a 3 year course instead of 4 year, in which the university allows students to leave and do a placement.

Most entry level jobs ask for experience in the industry.

Now, my portfolio of work is overall between average and strong, and I know that I have the ability to get hired by someone. Some of my skills, like free hand sketching and Photoshop rendering well above average.

But I have no official experience in a design position apart from a graphic design work experience/internship in a small company when I was 18 - I'm 21 now.

I'm planning to apply to pretty much any position that I think I would be competent at - not limit myself just to my niche, and maybe ignore some of the ""experience required"" lines.

What would your advice to me be? What would you plan differently? What should I focus on?

My main worry is not failing to get my dream job straight out of university. I know that's something that almost never happens to people.

I'm just worried that my lack of experience and backup plan of working as a delivery driver in a country where no one cares about my degree will bite me in the ass and I'll have problems getting a job in anything related to my field...

Thank you very much for advice. Appreciate it."

Salesforce Einstein is one of their data/ML teams, which I'm interested in. However, I'm unable to come to a conclusion on whether Salesforce does legit ML on the level of other tech companies. It's clear Einstein Research does cool stuff, but I'm looking at one of the more business oriented teams which fall under ""einstein analytics"". Overall, it was relayed to me they're a product-focused team as opposed to a research team. They use H20.AI, is this a good or bad sign?

Moreover, the team I'm looking at came out of acquisition, which could potentially be a mess. From some reviews online, looks like the predictive power of Einstein as a platform is weak. 

I understand I'm quite critical about Salesforce in the post, and I'm looking for guidance on how to evaluate this team, compared to something at LinkedIn or Uber (teams currently unknown).

The second problem that I have is that I wasn't able to get an internship in my industry during my studies. This is mostly because I did a 3 year course instead of 4 year, in which the university allows students to leave and do a placement.

Most entry level jobs ask for experience in the industry.

Now, my portfolio of work is overall between average and strong, and I know that I have the ability to get hired by someone. Some of my skills are certainly above average.

But I have no official experience in my field apart from a work experience/internship in a small company when I was 18 - I'm 21 now.

I'm planning to apply to pretty much any position that I think I would be competent at - not limit myself just to my niche, and maybe ignore some of the ""experience required"" lines.

What would your advice to me be? What would you plan differently? What should I focus on?

My main worry is not failing to get my dream job straight out of university. I know that's something that almost never happens to people.

I'm just worried that my lack of experience and backup plan of working as a delivery driver in a country where no one cares about my degree will bite me in the ass and I'll have problems getting a job in anything related to my field...

Thank you very much for advice. Appreciate it."

I took the offer because it was a large company and did not care about it was QA. Now, I am regretted and very frustrated. I want to quit this job at this May and go for other internship. However, I have a hard time to find a summer job.

7st9li,0,2018-01-24,Should I renege on return internship offer in favor of Big G offer?,MxRacer100,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7st9li/should_i_renege_on_return_internship_offer_in/,"As the title says I have recently received an offer for a Google SWE Internship during the summer. However, months back I accepted a return internship offer from the company I interned at last summer. 

Info/Context about both companies:

Previous Company:
I interned with them last summer and overall it was an amazing summer. The company is a mid sized and pretty well known tech company, although certainly not of the same prestige as any of the Big 4. They had a great internship program which included lots of company outings and events for interns. The return offer they’ve given me is in SF on a team that sounds extremely interesting to me. Also the compensation is extremely competitive, high pay, paid living, the whole deal so that’s not an issue. 

Google:
Obviously people know about Google’s internship program so i won’t talk about that. The team I’ve matched with is decent, however, it’s definitely not as exciting as the team I’ve been offered at my previous company. Position is also for MV, which is cool because it’s the headquarters, but I’ve also heard living in MV is kinda boring. 



So overall my accepted offer has a better location (I’d be living in the city) and what sounds like a more interesting project. However, Google is Google and obviously would be a huge resume booster and I’m sure I’d learn a ton there too. Plus it would be good to intern at another company.

Would it be worth it to renege and possibly burn the bridge at my previous company? I think there’s a good chance they’d be understanding and not burn the bridge but you never know. 

Another option is i can reject this host match and continue looking for teams at Google that seem more like a dream project. Idk if this is worth the risk though as i may end up with nothing (I’m 3-4 weeks into the 6 week process)

7stczq,17,2018-01-24,Computer science student and struggling with my personal identity,aperks,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7stczq/computer_science_student_and_struggling_with_my/,"I didn't know what I wanted to do when I came to college, so I bounced around between business and IT courses and finally decided on changing my major to computer science. I do enjoy programming and problem solving with it is fun. For my first internship, I did web development (mostly front end but some back end too) and it was awesome and satisfying to see my actual work being used by my company.

If you met me outside of class and work, you would know me as the person who's a die-hard soccer fan, craft beer lover, plays video games (mostly Nintendo stuff), and always getting into random fun shit with my friends. But I'm also a computer science student and part of my school's ACM chapter. When I think of people in our ACM chapter, I think of people who are extremely intelligent, dedicated to computer science, always keeping up with the latest tech news, and always keeping up with personal projects. These are the people that are the most successful students who get excellent internship opportunities.

I feel like as a computer science major that I should be programming and doing personal projects in my free time, but I don't want to do that. I want to do other things like hang out with friends and watch soccer and play video games. But students who focus on technology and personal projects definitely have an edge. Some companies want to see personal projects and Github contributions, while some companies might not even consider a candidate who lacks those.

When I tell people that I'm a computer science major, I feel like my identity (soccer, craft beer, video games, etc.) is foreshadowed by computer science and that people see me as someone who programs and works on projects all the time, or at least should be doing these things. I know that's probably not true... When I was first a business major, I felt like I had more of an identity. Looking back, I felt like I was more identified by who I am rather than what I study.  

Am I really supposed to be working on computer science stuff often? Is this what I should be choosing to do as a computer science major? I would rather have fun outside of class and work, and I know that puts me at a disadvantage when it comes to finding jobs. I do think programming and web development is pretty cool. I like it, but I wouldn't say I love it. Currently I always feel pressured to start working on a personal project and learn a new language or technology, but I just cannot bring myself to do so. Sometimes I even get the question from my academic advisor... ""Are you sure computer science is right for you?""

Overall I'm pretty satisfied with where I am, but I'm always doubting myself. I know this sub tends to be a group of smart people always looking for the best opportunities, so I was wondering what people might think of this."

I applied for 40 jobs in total and I have gotten 6 interviews so far. I have done 3 of them, one of which has already given me an offer for a software testing position and it requires a response by Friday. The process for this job was super quick, I received the invitation for the interview on Monday, interviewed Tuesday morning and I received my offer today (Wednesday). My other interviews said they would be making a decision sometime this week (it is Wednesday night so there is still some time for them to respond). These companies did not reach out to me as quickly (a few days between the application and interview request).

I feel like I am conflicted because I really want to do software development. All of my other interviews are for developer internships and it is something I am really passionate about. If I don't get any offers from my two other interviews, I will feel really pressured to accept a testing position even if it is something I don't want to do because it is still involving software and some degree of experience. I also have 3 other interviews, which are each for programming/developer positions. Any insight into my situation would be really appreciated! 

Edit: in case anyone comes across this post and has a similar situation, I did end up rejecting the offer without any other offers at the time, but was able to secure another software developer position at another company after some more interviews.

What do you guys think is the best way to go about it?

What has me doubting is that it will probably need to store quite a bit of data, and solutions like Heroku could get quite expensive, but also I'm not sure how well I can set up a server or how long it would take me if we were to go the self-hosted route.

EDIT: About the application, it's mostly CRUD actions over a few things, but there's also gonna be storing and delivering files (usually pdf reports) to clients. So it will have to be accessible by both internal company employees and the clients. It's written in Ruby, using Rails."

Already in my third year and I have nothing. No relevant work experience, shit side projects form my courses, nothing at all. All i have is my 3.6 GPA, which I've realized employers don't give a fuck about. I was so close to choosing Waterloo but decided to go for UofT because of the ""prestige"" and ""academic rigor"" and so i can graduate faster to find a better paying job.

As it stands now, for work experience, I've done two separate internships at the same company and another internship at a different company, so three sections detailing each one. 

Recently, I've been doing some part time work that I'd like to have on my resume but adding another section would bump one of my previous internships off. So, my question is: Should I show that I've have experience at multiple companies (i.e. diversity)? Should I show that I've worked at the same place on two separate occasions (i.e. commitment)? Should I just combine the two internships at the same company and indicate it spanned two separate time periods? 

Now, another consideration is that the 3 internships I have on there now are roughly in my field (comp. sci.) and the new part time work is less so (video production/editing). I'd like to include the video editing to show some range of skills, but would it be better to tailor my resume depending on if the employer would ""appreciate"" it -- so include editing for a ""creative"" company, include more in-field experience for a ""technical"" company?

I'm currently studying Computer Science in a university in Ireland. As far as I know the whole university system over here is a bit different than in the USA and Canada. Most of our modules/classes are mandatory and we don't get to pick and choose as we wish. For the most part it's a structured path to receive our degree. We do, however, get the choice of choosing more math modules as opposed to programming modules. I'm currently in my 2nd year out of 4 and want to get a professionals advice on which they feel would be more beneficial, as currently I'm on my third semester of the math route.


Core modules:
These include the fundamentals such as OOP, web development, operating systems, databases, linear algebra, discrete math etc.


Optionals:

We are given the choice then between two strands. Strand A (Programming) or Strand B(Math).

Strand A includes:
-Touching into game development using Java (We already use Java in our main programming classes.)


-Modelling using MatLab


-Healthcare systems.


-Human computer interaction


-Programming paradigms 





Strand B includes:


-Differential forms


-Complex analysis


-Numerical analysis


-Metric spaces


-Groups


-Probability


Currently if you do Strand B you only cover the core Computer Science modules and then lots of math. You don't really touch any of Strand A unless you ask classmates for their notes. Likewise if you do Strand A you miss out on a lot of math, though I feel most of it isn't necessary unless you wish to pursue post-graduate studies in ML or AI.


Next year we undertake a 9 month internship and all of the classes above will be completed before we begin. Would I be at a disadvantage if I continued with the math side of things, or would I possibly be considered for a larger amount of roles? I've emailed lecturers too but would like a broad range of answers.


**TL/DR: I'm taking the required fundamental CS classes. I have a 9 month internship next year. Should I take additional programming/CS classes or continue studying math classes(metric spaces, analysis etc) in addition to what I'm currently studying (Java, C, JS etc). At the end of the degree I'll leave with a BSc in Computer Science regardless, though I think with Strand B it will also include something about Math (just like a minor in US maybe)**"

I have an opportunity through work for tuition reimbursement. This is something that I'd like to finally take advantage of. 

Background: I'm employed in workstation support, handling computers, phones, and ancillary systems at a 100-bed hospital in the Midwest. I've worked here for about 3 years and make $45,000. I've had a few internships at a major avionics firm, and I have had a few part-time IT gigs. I am full time at my present employer. I'm 27. 

I have previously attended university for a BS in Computer Science. To be blunt, I flunked out with 3 classes remaining in the degree. Going back to school to finish a 4 year degree at this University is not viable financially. I can, however, go to a local community college and complete a 2 year degree. I feel this would help my career significantly, and I would be reimbursed for the tuition.

I have two main options:

- I could go for an AS in Computer Science. This would be the fastest option, since a decent amount of courses should transfer in. It would be the fastest and easiest way to just get some sort of degree. While I would not necessarily use it to locate a coding job, it would open some doors. I could likely complete this entirely during my downtime at work.

- I could go for an AS in Server Administration. This is more in line with my eventual career goals of moving out of workstation and into systems administration. My SO is in the middle of this program right now, so I have a passing to intermediate familiarity with the course work and subject matter. This option would be a long slog, and I would spread it out over the course of at least 18 months, if not longer, since I'll continue to work full time. As I said before, this would be more in line with my planned career, and should open many doors at both my present employer and any future opportunities.

Should I go for the quicker, more general option and rely on my industry experience? Or should I suck it up and go for the longer slog and get a targeted degree in what I want to end up doing? I plan on staying at this employer for at least a few more years, to both get my experience up, utilize the the tuition reimbursement, and possibly move up to a senior position. My supervisor has been giving me tasks that straddle the line between the two levels, and there are multiple second-level techs that will be retiring in the coming years.

Any and all advise is appreciated. Thank you."

7szaid,0,2018-01-25,Major or minor?,majorproblemo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7szaid/major_or_minor/,"I'm currently not in school due to health reasons, but once I go back next Fall I'll be a junior psychology major. In my time off I've really had a lot of time to think, and I realized that I don't really like any of the traditional psychology jobs (researcher/psychologist). 


I'm debating if I should major or minor in computer science. If I change my major it will take me 4 years to graduate because I have none of the preqs done. I also could just keep going for my psychology degree and minor in computer science which will only take me 2 years. I'm also not sure how important an internship is, but I don't think this route would leave time for that. It also seems silly to finish a degree in something I know I don't want to do.


I really want to be a software engineer, but I don't know if I can handle 4 more years of school. However I'm nervous that just a minor will leave me fighting for jobs when I could have just stayed in school for a little longer. "

7szmzn,3,2018-01-25,Apartment neighbors can suck!,eblackham,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/7szmzn/apartment_neighbors_can_suck/,"This was back in 2015. First a little background:

I graduated college in May 2015, got an internship the same month, and found out I was having a baby 2 weeks in (Had to grow up fast). Got hired on in August, and moved into a nice apartment with my (girlfriend at the time) wife. My little boy would be born in January of 2016. He had his own room in the apartment for when he came. Some relevant info to the story later is that we are on the top floor (thank god), and the floors were always creaky when walking around. 

We notice there is an empty apartment below us for awhile. Well soon enough these 2 younger girls move in. Nothing wrong with that. Some time passes and we notice a note on our door one day. These bitches actually wrote a full one 8.5"" x 11"" page note about how we have been stomping around since they moved in. We never ""stomped"" ever, just normal walking around. I go down and knock on their door....nothing. Fine, I leave a kind note explaining that there isn't anything we can do, the floors are creaky and that isn't fixable when you are living there. We cant just move out for a month and have the landlord redo the floors. 

Some more time passes, about 3 months from our son being born. We start hearing abnormally loud music from their room. Like not just playing loud music, it sounded like they literally taped a fucking stereo to their ceiling under our room. Well, they did, and I will tell you how I knew later. 

After I hear this shit, I immediately go to their door and knock. They would not come out.  I give it some time and go back later. Nothing. Okay, now I am pissed. The only thing I could think of is them doing this fuckery when my boy is born and I will NOT stand for that. They think we stomp on purpose? I go into where I can hear the sound loudest and jump as high as I can and slam down. I head a huge crash from below which was obviously the stereo falling down, then nothing. How they got it up there is a mystery to me. My future wife and I were laughing so hard. Serves them right. They must of left the apartment and turned the ceiling radio on to be dicks while they were gone. 

The next morning before work I am walking down the stairs and they open the door (the one girl was leaving the same time for work). I thought to myself, ""Finally, I can confront them."" I ask why the hell they were playing music so loud under our room.  She said, ""Because you keep stomping around!!"" I said something along the lines of ""How many times do I have to tell you its our floors and we can't control it, fucking come upstairs and walk around on it, you'll see!"" I said my wife is pregnant, and this shit WILL NOT happen when the baby comes. She responded with, ""Oh, so its your fat wife walking around making all the noise?""

I fucking lost my shit...

I don't even remember what I said to her, twas not something my grandma would approve of. While she was getting into her car the last thing I said was, ""Have a great day, ma'am"" and after all the shit I said to her previously, that must of pissed her off the most because she was fuming and didn't know what to say. I though it was hilarious.They moved out 2 weeks later. 

We win. 

Thank god I moved to my own house later in 2016. Fuck apartments with shitty neighbors. Anyway, that was it, not something I am still mad about, but thought it was a good/funny story to tell. "
7szn14,1,2018-01-25,"Time is passing by, based on [my] true story, update.",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7szn14/time_is_passing_by_based_on_my_true_story_update/,"Long text translated from Polish language, in regards to what was happening with be, before I deleted the other account [from the other website]. I am sorry for mistakes, but I am translating everything by myself, on the run, without polishing the text. I already wrote couple posts here, and got no reply, ever, therefore I want to do it as fast as possible, and not waste more time than than I need to. The reason why I got back, is spontaneous, just as what I have been doing in the latest months. Noone will help me, because noone ever listens to me, noone tries to help me, instead everyone hurts me. I am writing this for no reason, to be honest, it may help someone, definitely not a person in need, but maybe a family, or friends? You will have a chance to understand what people like me have in their head, what they think of, what they do, see some sort of pattern. 

The last topic which I wrote about, was me testing black powder gun that I own, I had it for years hidden in a cardboard box. About 2 weeks before my 30th birthsday, I decided to finaly test if it works, or not. I prepared everything, and waited for a best moment. As always, for no apparent reason, I got up, left everything behind running, took what was needed, and went to test the gun. It is alway like that. I went to the area that is located quite close to me, trees, open field, not that many people around. I took the gun out, with my shaking hands, and shot. It was loud, then the black powder smoke appeared, I felt pretty much no recoil. Echo spread over the area, dogs started to bark. After that, I got home, like nothing happened, just to plan my next approach.

13th of december was my 30th birthsday. Gun has 6 slots for bullets. I loaded  all of them at home, and went much farther this time, selecting similar area, with no people around. It all took me over 2 hours. First, when I arrived, I started laughing, but then instantly, I started crying, I kneeled. I have been crying all my way back home. Instantly after I got back, I messaged my psychiatrist. I do not really know why I did that, because she never helped me, the way I expected. I am always being given some prescription pills. As stated earlier, and will be even more, noone listens, noone wants to hear me, or understands me. Everyone labels me, thinks they know better than I do, what I feel. During my visit, I had quite a lot of pages printed, that span over my entire life, and explain everything that I went through, year by year. I also had a hangmans knot, but due to being unable to find a tree with branches I left it to her. I also left my history + last will letter, as my doctor was supposed to call me at the beginning of the next week to talk with me about the entire text. Did she, you might wonder? No. The last time I was there, was 2 years ago, and back then visits were 1 hour long, which to me was not enough. Now visits are 30 minute long. I did had no chance to talk much, she kept on saying ""we have to finish, there are more patients in line"", that made me feel like shit. All she cares about, are money. Come in, whats up, prescription, fuck off, next person, repeat.  

Couple days passed, and I went to the forest again. I always select different place. I bought two bottles of wine the day before. I have been drinking a lot lately, it makes me keep alive. I had all of pills mixed in the other bottle. I used to test how they work, imagine, that I took just 4, and lost consciousness in bathroom, witch resulted in me breaking a leg, and sprained ankle. I had a cast on my leg for 6 months, and spent over 2 month on rehabilitation, learning how to walk again. Getting back to when I went to the forest. I found a tree, and sat under it, I started to drink drink, it was cold, and dark. I started to shake. That is when I got up, left the other bottle at its place, and was wandering all over my city for the next 6 hours. I went back home, had a temperature, my eyes started to tear, cought, couple days passed, and it all passed. 

Couple days passed, and I went to the forest again. Deja vu. For the 4th time. The same road, the same area, but farther, straight to the forest. I went offroad, tried to find a place for me to settle, and die, but there is a reservoir there, and I encounteret steel nets all over the place. I could not find a way through. I have no idea what was that for. It got dark, and I got home.

Everytime I go out, I feel amazing, I feel peace of mind, Im smiling, but when I arrive at the destination, it is all gone, I feel something completely opposite, like I was in a trance, or something. I have a lot of thoughts ""maybe..."", ""there are so many opportunities"", ""I have to do... this and that"", etc. I myself am not defending anymore, I gave up already, but something in my head is, still being conscious. The truth is, every step I make, is the step in obvious direction, and I am very close to let go.

At te beginning [when I bought the gun], I thought that I would shot myself in the heart, but since I am a person of domestic violence, and school bullying, I am afraid of inflicting myself pain, therefore headshot seems more reasonable, and painless. I would not mind if someone hatched me to death, etc. I think I might even like it. I am so used to receiving pain, that when I was younger, I even stopped crying, because I could not take in any longer. My nervous system said, enough. Then all of my emotions were wiped out of my face. Things startet to happen. 

I recently started to listen One More Light by Linkin Park, the album itself is pop crap, but the song itself is amazing. I relistened to all of the LP albums in the recent days, now focusing on the text, more than a music. For years I have been witnessing death of famous people, if it is natural, then okay, but suicide is hard to walk by without noticing, especially if you heard about them, or followed them. They often had everything that I do not. Money, fame, families. They are gone now, and I am still here. That is weird. I started to think, that one of the reasons why I am still alive, is the fact that noone would notice when I am gone, not even one person. I would rot in the forest. On the 13th of the december, I wrote a final post on my Facebook, where I explained everything. I took cell phone with me, but noone called, to this day, noone came to check if I am alive. My worst fear, become real. Noone gives a fuck about me. I sometimes think If should kill myself in a widely visited part of my city, or in a popular place, where someone would notice, came and stopped me, hug me, kissed me in my cheeck, said no, but, would these people really mean it? Of course not. Police would came, they would most likely drug me up  with pills, or other medication, close in a mental asylum, and observe how I struggle, like an animal in a cage. Emotions, feelings, deeds, it is only worth it, if it is true, and not forced. You might wonder, how did I survive all these years? I did, because I tell everyone what they want to hear, and pretend that I am all right, constantly talk about my plants, and do things that are within my reach. Move forward, little, by litte. I become an actor. When I was younger, I used to talk out loud about everything, but then I was sent to addiction treatment center, because I smoked weed, one of the things that helped me go through the worst times. Then I was sent to psychologist, therapist, psychiatrist, etc., but once again, if you do not talk with someone, do not care, do no listen, how can you succeed? Noone ever did. I have been suggested all of these so many times already, just as the asylum, but I always say no, and my condition is getting worse with each day. People think they will drug me up, close me in a cage, and that this way, they will cure me. Do they realize we do not live in a matrix, and pills do not solve problems? I do not have problems with neurotransmitters, as much, as I have problem with the world, and my existence. Sure, I have a lot of problems, etc., most likely PTSD, and shitload of other, these things could be treated, but, you do not treat the outcome, but the reason. Right?  

For years, I have never wanted help, because as I wrote, I have been getting completely the opposite. I always thought, that someone would finaly find me, and help me. People that can, and would willingly do it.

I often want to hurt someone, or would want someone to be me, go through what I went. 

I did not translate most of the text. Why? Because some parts are meaningless. 

I live in Poland, and I hate this country, hate this body.

When I was younger I used to wrote on the internet, on random American forums ""adopt me"". I used to search for an American wife, so I could leave this shithole. Green card is like winning lottery, pretty much impossible. 

That is the type of help I always needed for fuck sake, a real help. Get me out of here, give me a hand. Sponsor me a working visa, or whatever. 

I always dreamed of being a marine, but the 28 years limit, I am done. A USArmy soldier is another thing that I could become. I have a bachelors degree as a paramedic, I did the internship, and months of volunteering, but did not really do anything interesting, or worthwhile, I have not learned anything either. 

Combat medic was also my dream, or being part of the blackhawk crew.

I would give everything for it, even if I knew that I would die on the 1st day of the deployment. I have been waiting for my dream to come true for all these years. Since my education is worh nothing, and I have no experience at work, I can not go anywhere. USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, only EU, but I do not like it, I spent year in the UK, as this is the only place that I could go to, and do not want to go there again, unless Im set before I go. I applied for a paramedic job, but was refused 3 time already, lol, even for the lower grade job. 

30, shitty education, no work experience, no money, unemployed virgin. 

I am sure that someone might write, that in the army you need to be healthy etc., sure, who know how it would turned out. I have also an IT diploma, after high school, B driving license, tried C, but I lack money to finish it. I have FCE with grade B, and TOEIC Listening &amp; Reading, with the highest, gold grade. You would not guess it reading this pathethic post, but I have these. 

It is so sad to see people dying daily, mainly because those who should, or could do not care. Is it really that much? Talking to someone. I have never asked for money, it would help, since in Poland if I had from someone abroad 500$, that would let me move out, and start a life on my own somewhere. All I ever asked is a helping hand, a hand, no lies, and telling me things that mean nothing. That is the hardest thing, and hardly anyone can do it. So many people pretend, act, put a mask on their face. I would even be happier if I lived the homeless life in the USA :).

7szpur,1,2018-01-25,Web App Project or Mobile App Project for Internship,Furd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7szpur/web_app_project_or_mobile_app_project_for/,"Little bit about me: I'm very inexperienced, first tech internship. I'm a 3rd year business major self taught (although I am taking CS classes now). This is at a big finance company, not really known for fintech as far as I am aware. I originally interviewed and got in for a web development internship but my manager recently called me asking whether or not I'd be interested in a mobile dev project instead.


ORIGINAL PROJECT: 


-	Web App Development: trading platform
- Much later in the life cycle, near the end
-	Project already in development
-	Team of 30 that ""needs lots of work to be done to fill up the skeleton""
-	Webstorm
-	Typescript
-	HTML/CSS
-	Angular 4
 
NEW PROJECT:

- Mobile App Development: trading platform
- Highly favorable for getting funded and going into production
- Currently in early stages, working on proof of concepts and UI
- By the time I join, would most likely be working on backend integrations for those POC
- Don't know much else yet, manager was going to tell me more next week

I know that both projects will be rewarding especially at my skill level. I will be working under the same manager, although unsure about the team. To me right now, I see the new project as something more exciting and possibly something I'd be working on if I get a return offer. I'm hoping to hear insight and other thoughts to help me be aware on the short term/long term effects of whatever project I pick. I'm aware that honestly there really is no difference but I'm still indecisive.

Thank you! "
7szy4q,5,2018-01-25,Do I still have a chance at HYPSM and other top tiers with an awful first semester junior year if everything else is strong?,MangoGodXOXO,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7szy4q/do_i_still_have_a_chance_at_hypsm_and_other_top/,"Would you say it’s possible for an upper middle class Asian male from California to get into HYPSM and top UC’s for electrical engineering/computer science with a 3.65–3.75 uw due to one bad semester? My first semester of junior year went very poorly. I got 1 A, 3 B’s, and 2 C's due to a few personal problems, but nothing too extenuating. The C's were both 79% and they were in AP Physics and APUSH. In AP physics I have some tensions with the teacher who has been accused of unfair grading practices, but my counselor should be able to cover it. However, this was definitely an outlier semester and I have straight A’s every other semester with the exception of one B. I’m on track to earning straight A’s the next two semesters as well. I also have a 36 ACT and many 800s on subject tests. I’m also taking a few advanced math classes at the local community college and am getting A’s. Demonstrating I’m academically prepared shouldn’t be a problem, but I fear my gpa disqualifies me. I read somewhere that for MIT, Stanford, and a few top Ivies, 93% of admitted students had an uw gpa of 3.75+. I assume the other 7% is reserved for URMs, athletes, those with amazing artistic talent, legacies, development cases, etc. and maybe a major award winner in a very rare case. If my uw does happen to be below a 3.75, might they forgive me for a small slip and ninja me into that 7% if I have the personal qualities they look for and lots of potential? Or am I completely dead since I’ll lower their average gpa and therefore “lower their prestige.”

My extracurriculars are really good and might show that I can add something to their community. By the time I’m applying and through the end of senior year, mine should include leadership and entrepreneurship (hosting a hackathon this spring), lots of personal computer science projects, volunteering, math team, lots of robotics, 3 software development internships, debate, and research with a professor that might be published. I most likely won’t win any major awards, but might garner a few smaller accolades such as AIME qualification and Siemens semifinalist. I should also get glowing recs from teachers and mentors.

I have a couple of schools in mind including MIT, Stanford, Princeton (SEAS), Caltech, Cornell (Engineering), Upenn (SEAS), Columbia (SEAS), Brown, Uchicago, UC Berkeley (EECS), UCLA (CSE), UCSD (CSE), and Umich (EECS). I do have a few safeties in mind, but I’d honestly be pretty devastated if I had to attend one of them.

I’m just hoping my chances aren’t gone at this point. Intel STS or Simens finalist aren’t completely out of the question, but it’s hard and rather unlikely. I’m not sure how else I’ll compensate for my gpa and the two C's."

I’ve been depressed for the last month.  My highs last 6 hours if I’m lucky.  I don’t cut for my boyfriend.  I haven’t killed myself for him either.  I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve his love, but he doesn’t deserve my mess.  I am a financial and emotional burden.  I’d be working in a psychiatric hospital if I was emotionally stable enough.  What if I’m not in time for my internship or when I should be getting a job?  In a year I need to be hunting for internships before my loans hit me.  I could be in a dead end job and financially stable if I hadn’t gone to college.  There’s nothing else here that I’d want to do.  Everything else I’d enjoy or make enough money for an apartment and my needs don’t need college.  I’ve fucked up and its only added stress.  The only way I can make myself happy ends up hurting me more.  I love him, but he’d be so much better off without me...

I feel lost and stuck.

My loans would be forgiven if I died...

My healthiest way I can think of to get to tomorrow unscathed is to just take my meds early.  I tried to nap earlier, but it just got worse.  I don’t like using seroquel just to sleep though.

I’m tired of this.  I’ve felt exhausted since my depression started setting in harder than normal.  I have my therapist and psychiatrist appointments tomorrow and I feel too exhausted to do it.  I already know I’ll put on my mask like nothing is wrong, go home, and cry some more."

I landed a job at a store involving machinery. It was fine at first and I got along with my coworker who trained me. Then the manager started training me. Manager was OK at first with just a strong personality, but soon it got worse, like she'd give me a death glare for answering a question not exactly right. That made me anxious to the point where I was afraid to make any mistakes while training. My shifts were infrequent, and I couldn't retain all knowledge after 5 days of no work when she'd only shown me the task once at her pace. She'll talk away and punch buttons without letting me try it (coworkers always let me be hands-on with machines). If I remembered 8/10 things she said, she'd yell at me over the 2/10 things I forgot. Manager later showed her true colours with yelling, threatening, saying things like ""I want to kill her"" over the phone, swearing in her language, and sometimes in front of customers too. I didn't have opportunities/guts to talk to her about her reactions. I felt like a child being scolded, not like an employee in a workplace.      
       
&amp;nbsp;

    
My last shift I was with another coworker, and I could calmly and successfully complete any task that she asked me to do. It was smooth sailing with frequent small talk until closing when I punched a critically wrong button on the cash register by mistake. I was never told it was irreversible and critical not to punch it. She had to call the manager about it and I was dismissed over the phone through a tirade of yelling.    
    
&amp;nbsp;

    
Before this I worked in volunteer jobs, a self-employed job, an internship for uni, and the most relevant is a p/t job at a clothing store 3.5yrs ago. Management at those jobs never reacted to my mistakes like this. Also in previous years, I had a rough patch in life which made me more prone to anxiety and depressive feelings. I've tried to manage these negative feelings, but they affect me on and off. The manager's behaviour was a big trigger and almost made me have a breakdown on Monday. Even though I parted on good terms with the coworkers, manager likely gossiped about me and I can forget having a good reputation with coworkers (she's gossiped to me about the coworkers too). I feel uncomfortable even being near that part of the mall.     
    
&amp;nbsp;

    
I don't want my parents knowing because they'll probably make it seem like my fault. Only 2 friends, a uni counselor I spoke to, and my boyfriend know the details. What they said was consistent with my findings when Googling about the situation, that manager was verbally abusive and controlling. They've never been treated like that for mistakes in their p/t jobs before. Bf noticed me channeling a lot of energy into my anger. I don't want to burden him with my problems, but he's the one I felt most comfortable talking to.       
    
&amp;nbsp;

    
I know I need to deal better with being under time pressure, with or without a strict manager. What if in the future the same situation happens but the job would be critical to my survival? There has to be something my coworkers (they worked there for 3 and 7 years and have a good relationship with manager) can do that I couldn't, and I want to improve on that if it's an area worth working on for the sake of future jobs. I already know I need work in conversation skills, and some minor mistakes were truly my fault because I was tired or I mind-blanked. Manager questioned my ability to perform in future jobs related to my uni studies during one of her rant sessions, and now I'm questioning the same thing.     
    
&amp;nbsp;
    

Because I can't stop trying after the first fail, I already applied to a volunteer position for an event next month related to my studies. My greater goal is to land an internship this year that's better than my previous one. What can I do to improve my overall workplace skills? Thank you for reading this half-rant-half-reachout.

I struggled to get my school to fulfill all the official requirements [example: they didn't have a counselor and the teachers can hardly use a computer] and worked my ass off on my apps but when my efforts didn't pay off, I was initially disappointed. I either didn't get a lot of aid or was rejected at all of my dream schools - from Cornell and Oxford (rejected) to Georgia Tech and UIUC (got in but no aid). 

I applied to UTD only because it's easy to get lots of merit aid. Never really liked the school. But the more I read about UTD, the more I find myself falling in love with it. I love how strong the CS department is. I'm excited to be a part of the vibrant tech scene and startup culture at Dallas. I love how nerdy the kids are. [These might be myths but pls don't debunk them cuz I'll be v sad. I'm a delicate little rosebud.]

I have a couple questions and I'd really appreciate if any of the current students answered them.

1. Do international student receive the 6k a year AES Honors stipend? And is it taxed? [I emailed the office and I was told they do but multiple students have told me they don't. I think those students don't accept the stipend simply cuz paying taxes is too much work.]

2. My COA would be ~5k a year (assuming I get the stipend). To what extent can an on-campus job and/or internships cover that cost? [I plan to major in CS and have a decent amount of work experience. Also, I'll be on an F1 Visa so I think my working hours are going to be limited.]

3. What APs should I be taking and what score should I be looking to get on them if I wish to graduate 1-3 semesters early AND I'd *hate* to take required introductory courses in anything other than CS, Math, Statistics, Physics, and Finance.
I currently have 5s in three APs (CS A, Calc BC, Phy C: Mech). How many intro courses can these help me skip? 

4. I'm brown, bi and have a weirdass accent (which I'm trying to lose.). Will any of these be a problem on campus? (Genuine question, not bait.)

5. I've heard lots of negative comments on the dating scene on campus. How true are they? {I'd love to read answers from both men who date women and men who date men.}

6. [Just curious] I'm 182-184cm. Will I feel tall, short or average on campus, and in the US in general LOL? 

7. When is the earliest I can start taking the 'hard' CS and Math classes that are typically taken by juniors and seniors. If I skip most or all intro-courses with AP, can I take them in my freshman/soph year? 

8. How hard is it to get a chance to conduct research under a professor as a freshman/soph, considering I already publish often. 

9. Is it common for tech companies based in Austin or Cali/NY/Boston to recruit interns/full-time engineers from UTD? 

10. How good and how expensive is the gym @ the Student Recreational Center? Are the coaches/trainers helpful?

About #4 and #5, I know, they can't be as bad as they are in my town. It's a first world country after all. But it's always good to know what to expect lmao. 

If you've read this far, thank you. If you can answer one or more of these qs, pls add a reply to this thread or PM me.

Cheers!"

I can't use it for paid internships nor for most summer school courses (the experience should be something that I can't typically undertake while the semester is in session, like I can't use the funds to complete major requisites). 

Do any of you know of interesting CS-related programs one can do or projects one can get involved in the summer for around that budget? It can take place anywhere in the world (the funding can be used for flights and room and board). 

I was thinking of doing one of those immersive bootcamps at first but I already am quite proficient at web dev, am self-learning iOS dev, and data science ones usually exceed $7200. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of social good/international development and technology, as well as in picking up knowledge and skills in AI, cloud computing or cybersecurity, but anything goes really. I'm still relatively new to CS -- started self-learning a bit more than a year ago. 

Would sincerely appreciate any suggestions or advice! Thank you very much :)"

7t50no,4,2018-01-26,Stuck on a sinking ship (long story),[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7t50no/stuck_on_a_sinking_ship_long_story/,"Please have mercy on me. I just want help. Here's the backstory; I grew up in a very abusive home. At one point I couldn't take it anymore and I ran away from home and ended up living with a friend and his family. His family was having issues of their own, so a friend of a friend suggested I move into the spare room they had in their house. I end up living there for about a year and the friend and I start dating. Everyone's in college by then and I'm going through an internship program. Everything is looking up. 

His mother is religious, so she demanded that we get married if we are going to be in her house. I have no money to move out and neither does he, so we have a court marriage with the assumption that we'd have a ""real wedding"" later. Later never came though because a year or so later the mother decides she wants to move us all to Georgia from Boston because she was sick of the snow up North and thought rent would be more affordable. Never mind that everyone has a scholarship, no, let's all move, I guess. No body could tell her no and no body had money to move out so off we went to Georgia. In spite of her having ""friends"" there, we ended up nearly homeless for almost a year while everyone desperately looked for work. 

Finally we find a home to rent. YAY! Except now my husband can't get into school because the college wouldn't help him financially until he had worked full-time for a year. He couldn't work full-time because every employer he talked to wanted a degree. We were stuck for a few years like this with MIL making more and more exceptionally bad decisions (let's have a dog! let's buy stuff we don't need! YAY!) until now FINALLY my husband has a $15/hr full-time job! But now I have a baby. 

It wouldn't be so bad to live like this for a while except MIL and I butt heads constantly. She's a lazy slob who has raised other lazy slobs and my husband and I were the only ones cleaning the house for a while. Living here, you need to clean DAILY to keep up with the mess because otherwise you'll walk into the kitchen and find food splashed all over the counters and appliances. We've tried talking to everyone and assigning chores to no avail. Whatever, fine. That aside, the family is constantly borrowing money from us. So, husband and I are over here taking care of the house, dog, baby and paying the $850+ rent PLUS being guilt-tripped into lending $100s here and there, filling the tank for the car, paying for the car's mechanical bills, our groceries, paying for dog's medication and on top of all that MIL wants us to pay car insurance and whatever else she feels like. 

How the hell are we ever supposed to save money? Is there anything we can do? Husband is trying as hard as he can to do programming projects on the side to make his portfolio look more attractive (he originally wanted to be a software developer but is right now working in IT) and all that so he can get hired someplace paying more. I just don't know what to do. 

EDIT: He was going into school for Computer Science. He taught himself programming and was always developing games but never got to finish them. He was working on his programming and getting CompTIA while he was out of work. So, it's not like he wasn't doing anything. On the other hand, all my work experience is retail and I never got to finish school because, again, we moved."

After I graduated college, I was offered a full-time position. It took 4.5 months before I was given a salary, benefits, etc. and allowed to work more than 30 hours/week. It was brutal on my wallet, but I made it.

My coworker (N) is retiring and was giving her office to my boss. My boss (B) didn't want it, so I was offered it. Score! I've been crammed in a dark, ugly room for most of my time there (I was moved once to a communal room, but moved back eventually.) 

Well, B comes to me and says I can't have the office. HR and the director said they are going to eventually hire a replacement for N sometime NEXT YEAR and that I can't have the office. First of all, B is taking over all of her duties and I'm taking over B's. We don't need another person. If anything, we need an intern, and they can just have my current space. B was bummed too, since he really wanted me to have the office.

I feel so betrayed. I work SO FUCKING HARD. I gave up so much of my life. I live in a stupid college town away from my friends and family. I didn't move closer to my out-of-state boyfriend for this job. I was soooo patient when they took FOREVER to get me officially hired. I didn't complain when they moved me to a communal office away from my team to put a new intern into my office to have him quit a month later. I was patient when they took 3 months to move me back into my original office. I do so much for them. 

I was the first person to suggest digital marketing for our center. I spearheaded multiple very successful campaigns. Our following has more than doubled in just one year. This was the fastest growth we've seen since the 70s!! 

I've been given so many new responsibilities with only a small pay raise here and there. I've consistently scored well on all of my performance reviews (lowest score I got was a 44/45). I am quiet and nice to all of my coworkers. All this but I still get treated like a fucking intern. 

There's another former intern who got promoted to full time after she graduated (she's been at the company for a year and a half less than I was). She gets treated with respect. Everyone calls her by her job title. People still stumble and forget that I haven't been an intern for almost 7 months now. I still get treated like a student worker by everyone except B and his boss (who also really wanted me to get the office.)

My boss broke the news right before lunch. I said I was bummed but I know it's not his fault and it's okay. I went back to my office, shut the door, and cried. I've been stepped on a lot recently... I was supposed to go to the state capital to meet with our advisory committee (I haven't been formally introduced) but the director last minute made my boss going instead of me. It's not like we have to do stuff at the meeting, just take pictures and tweet about it... I can do that just fine. Hell, I'm the person who tweets EVERYTHING we do. 

I sacrifice so much for them. I moved my jury duty summons to a bad week for me just because they wanted me to go to a conference. I wouldn't be surprised if they make me stay home that day too.... which would suck since that conference is in the same city my mom and sister live.

I love my job. I love what I do! I work for a university that I absolutely love and treasure. Out of my whole team, I'm the most active in the university. I'm a founding member a fucking social media accessibility committee! The head of the Marketing/Comm department of the business school (we're a center for the business school) meets with me once a month and values what I have to say.... Why can't they?!? I'm FUCKING PISSED!! Ugh. I want to quit so badly, but A) I don't own a car and B) my lease is up in July and it's hard to find subletters here 

I'm getting a car next weekend. I'm so excited, because when I have off for spring break in March I'm going job hunting. I can pay off my lease. But I'm not going to extend the courtesy of helping them find my replacement, because I'm obviously not worth much in their eyes and pretty much anyone can do my job. I just tweet and use Facebook. Nothing I do is valuable for them. I can't wait to leave this job that keeps me overworked and underpaid. Hell, I'm taking over my boss's job but they aren't giving me a raise... for my experience and education I should be getting paid at least $10,000 more per year than what I get now. 

Ugh. I'm still crying... thanks for listening.

The only problem is that I have no experience outside of one class I took. That class did give me project experience with normal mapping, shadow mapping, deferred rendering, and large scale terrain rendering via heightmaps.

However I feel like I need some more real experience under my belt, and as it’s looking like I can’t get a graphics related internship at this point I want to come up with some personal projects I can do during the remaining school year and the upcoming summer that would look appealing to employers.

My long term plan would be to get some graphics related position like a rendering engineer out of college, work a couple years, and then get a cs masters focused on graphics and it’s applications before going back to the industry.

What kinds of projects do you think I should try my hand at // what skills should I focus on honing to achieve my goals? Or is getting a graphics job out of college with my current experience a bit of a stretch?

Any guidance would be much appreciated, and sorry for the wall of text!

When the CEO was done talking, he opened the floor for questions. Among many questions, people had concerns like ""How do I deal with coworkers working less than 50 hours"", ""Can we get more projects pulled into our workweek"" and some other questions I can't remember, but made me lift an eyebrow.

Somebody asked ""how can I advance my career into leadership positions?"" and the CEO said to work long hours, be the first in the office and last to leave, and to continually improve on your skills in your free time...

WTF? I get working 50+ hours if you love your job, need the money etc. But why slam people who value life outside of work?
Why is the focus in this industry seemingly to climb the ladder at the cost of your personal life?

I had an internship this past summer too where my fellow interns chastised me for showing up early, putting in my 8 hours, and leaving at 4 each day. None of our work really relied on the other's work, and our manager even encouraged us to go have a life and leave by 4.

I'm really losing hope in a career in this field, just cause I wanna put in 40 and go enjoy life, but seems that's not accepted here."

It’s not just standing in front of your class in your underwear bad.  They’re legitimately terrifying to me.  You know, running away from demons in the forest, having to crawl through a sewer tunnel lined with shards of glass… That sort of bad.  And then I’d wake up, usually means ore disturbed than freaked out.

But today when I woke up I was jolted out of sleep. I shot up from my pillow and gripped at my chest.  I realized the bed was wet, and I was lying in a puddle of what I hoped was sweat.  I peeled myself from the damp covers and went to shower, hoping to wash away the remnants of last night’s story.

In the dream I was walking through a door in some alley, descending on unseen steps.  They lead to a dark room, hot and stuffy in the heat of a summer day.  The sun shone brightly behind me as I pushed further into the growing darkness.  I was still walking when I suddenly felt something coming down slightly on the top of my head.  As soon as I stopped, the feeling of overhead movement ceased. I inhaled sharply.  I didn’t need to look up to know it was the ceiling.  But how was it even possible?  When had it become so low? 

I took a step forward and felt the ceiling lower a bit more.  When I stopped, it stopped.  I turned and looked behind me, crouching slightly.  The door I’d entered through suddenly seemed so far away, impossibly far for the few steps I’d taken into the room.  Tears started to well up in my eyes as I took one slow, low step after another towards the opening, turning into sobs of pure panic and crawls of desperation as the truth sank my heart like an anchor.

I soon found myself just a few feet away from the open door, sunlight spilling through as I pushed myself along the floor on my back, the ceiling finally pressing down on my face.  I felt an insane pain as my nose snapped under the weight of it.  My tears were pouring out now, pooling around my head and it was so hard to breathe I felt I was going to drown in them. And as the water began to rapidly rise around around me, I stopped all movement.  I decided that that was the better way to die. 

I was practically shaking as I went about my day, horrified by what my subconscious had managed to produce.  I wasn’t even claustrophobic, so where did the concept of the tomb come from? 

I was spacing out by the water cooler at work when Joseph, an intern with the sales company I worked at, as well as a relentless flirt, snuck up behind me.  His expression immediately fell as I turned around and he flashed me a look of concern.

“Whoa, Trace, your, uh, nose…”

I automatically raised my hand to my face and winced when I touched the tip of my nose.  It stung slightly and I winced.  I rushed off to the bathroom, leaving Joseph behind without a word. In the mirror, I saw that the skin around my nose was slightly inflamed, a little red and purple.  What the hell?  I didn’t have any concealer on me, so I went back to my desk, convincing myself that it didn’t even look that bad. But by the end of the day my nose had swollen considerably and the red was now all purple.  It also looked a bit crooked. 

I practically sprinted to my car.  I got home and proceeded to ice my face for an hour, but the cool did little to relieve the now burning pain spreading across my face.  I gave up and headed to bed after downing two ibuprofens. 

The next morning, the swelling seemed to have stabilized. Thankfully it was Saturday so I had the day to recuperate.  I couldn’t remember dreaming that night, so I assumed the pills had put me more at ease than I’d expected. It was fine with me.  I decided to make it a lazy day, with books, snacks, and the TV playing through crappy infomercials as I lay in bed.  Despite all of the distractions, I fell asleep with chips on my face and a book still gripped in my hand.

--

It was a dark night in some random cul de sac. My shoes made a light crunching sound on top of the dry grass that grew between the cracks in the sidewalk as I walked down an unknown street.  I had no clue where I was going or where I’d come from, but I just knew that I had to continue on.  I would get there eventually… I had to.  The world around me was empty.  Houses lined the streets but not a single light was on.  Not a single dog was being walked, no one resting on their porches in the light of the high moon. It was just me. 

The sudden sound of a twig snapping somewhere behind me shot through me like a bullet and froze me to my spot mid step.  Was I not alone?  I turned my head to the side slightly, and when I saw nothing in my peripheral I fully pivoted.  There was nothing.  No one. I took in a breath and thought to myself that it must have been a squirrel.   

I turned to continue when I felt a sharp pain shoot through my foot as soon as I’d set my foot back on the ground.  I jumped back and fell, scrambling backward like a frightened animal.  I saw something stuck between the cracks in the sidewalk.  I moved closer to get a better look.  

It was a fucking needle! 

The disembodied needle of a syringe was sticking out of the ground, camouflaged by the blades of grass around it.  I stood and quickly passed over it, stumbling into a slight jog down the side walk.  I had to keep going.  I had to get to where I was going. 

There was another sound somewhere behind me, like the crunch of a dry leaf.  This time I didn’t turn around.  I kept my eyes forward and quickened into a sprint.  There was a light up ahead!  That must have been where I was headed all along.  As I closed in on the house from which the luminescence was emanating, I felt another sharp stab in my ankle and jumped in panic.    This time it was a needle sticking straight out from the grassy ground.  The sidewalk was gone.  There was only a field around me now. What the hell? 

But I kept going.  I had to get to the house.  My house.  That’s right!  I lived there with my boyfriend, and something urgent had brought me here.  He needed me.  He was in danger, and no one else could get to him in time.  I ran to the front door, but as soon as I was close enough to touch it I dug my heels into the ground and stopped. 

The door knob was covered in needles. 

Sharp and long like the ones in the sidewalk, they covered every other millimeter of the door knob. How was I supposed to get in?  I heard a groan from inside the house and called out to my boyfriend inside.  He only responded with sharp gasps.  I had to get in.  I’d come all this way just to see him. Something was wrong with him!

There was a sudden screech from within, and I banged on the door while shouting his name.  I tried explaining that I couldn’t get in, that the door was full of needles and I couldn’t get in, but he only let out shrieks and groans of pain in response, each one louder than the last until a great scream cut through the air.  I swear I felt the walls shake. 

I stopped and my hands dropped to my sides.  The left one inched towards the knob, and before I could stop myself I pushed my hand down upon it and screamed as I twisted.

I woke with a start, a bag of chips flying off the bed and my book falling from my hand to the floor. I was hyperventilating, and I tore the covers off me.  As I turned to climb out of the bed, I noticed that my book had landed page up and was smeared in red.  I looked down at my left hand and must have counted at least 100 pin pricks, each pouring out blood.  I looked down to my feet and saw a small red specks dotting the white sheet beneath them. I placed a hand to my mouth and let a sob ring out. This was impossible.  This couldn’t be happening. 

With any hope of relaxing horribly snuffed out, I got up and tended to my wounds, icing my nose after I wrapped up my feet and hand.  How could this have happened?  Maybe I hurt myself in my sleep.  Maybe I’d balled my fists up so tight that my nails tore into the palm.  Maybe my rampant imagination just made the wounds look like needle marks.  But what about my feet?  And realistically I couldn’t have balled up my fist since I was holding the book.

I forced myself to leave the apartment.  I couldn’t stay there.  I needed to be outside.  I ran to a nearby café and sat in a corner, hunched up and hiding my bandaged hand from plain view.  I pulled out my phone let a few residual tears roll down my face as I looked up possible ways to hurt yourself in your sleep.  Of course, the results were mostly useless, since I was pretty sure I wasn’t sleep walking and I didn’t have a homicidal roommate sneaking in to hurt me while I was unconscious.  I wiped away a few tears and scrolled through result after result until I came upon a forum thread titled, “Nightmares are real, can’t make it stop”.  I clicked on the link and read.

I know I can’t be the only one.  I can’t possibly be the only person going through this.  Please, I haven’t slept in 3 days and I’m losing my shit here.  Every night my dreams get more violent, and then they become more real.  It started with a nightmare last week of my father stabbing me in the shoulder with a kitchen knife.  I woke up in a pool of blood but knew it couldn’t have been real… my father died 10 years ago.  

Look, I know I sound crazy but I can’t live like this anymore.  What demon or spirit or god did I piss off to make this happen to me?  Someone… please just help me before I have to try and end it all myself.

My mind was suddenly abuzz with the immediate panic that I had to find this man and talk to him.  Contact him however possible.  But I noticed that the post was last dated from one month earlier.  My heart sank.  A whole month.  There’s no way he’d been able to go that long without sleeping.  He might as well have written the post years ago.  There were also almost no answers to his question.  A paranormal thread and no one bothered to even offer him some possible explanations.  

I put the phone down in my lap and buried my face into my arms. 

 --

This went on for another three days.  I’d try to stay awake, but I was never really that good at pulling all-nighters.  I tried watching uplifting movies and listening to pop music during the day in the hopes of tricking my subconscious to produce only happy dreams at night but still, the problem only grew worse. 

I’m writing this down now, in my own forum thread of as many paranormal sites as I can get to, because I believe that the danger of these nightmares has reached a crescendo. I just don’t know what to do and I don’t want whatever happened to that one poster to happen to me.  

Last night I dreamt that I’d come across a wounded dog in the street.  His black fur was matted with blood, and vines wrapped around the length of his torso.  His stomach laid torn open on the sidewalk.  I stooped to pet its head and coo words of comfort to it as it bled out.  But almost as soon as I’d touched it, my hand came back with a terribly sharp pain ringing out from the center of my palm.

When I awoke this time, my hand was indeed bloodied and throbbing.  I rushed to the bathroom to wash and patch up what was clearly a hole in the center of my palm, but winced as I was drying my hand with a towel and felt a sudden snag.  I immediately dropped the towel, and stared at the top of my hand.

Just barely breaking through the skin was something small and sharp.   In disbelief I pressed a finger against the bump, applying a painful amount of pressure until I felt a sharp sting and heard what sounded like something light hitting the floor.  I turned my gaze downward, and on the white linoleum lay a single black thorn.

Please help me."

7t7z8u,115,2018-01-26,"Down Will Come Baby, Cradle and All",spaswimmer1023,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7t7z8u/down_will_come_baby_cradle_and_all/,"My head had just hit the pillow when the phone rang. Again. It was my weekend to be on-call and the phone had been ringing non-stop. 

“This is Jessica”, I said as I rolled my eyes hard and sat up.

“Hey Jess, it’s Dana. There’s a little one at the ER for alleged sexual abuse. It’s all yours kiddo”, she said as you could hear a faint smile in her tone.

I hung up with Dana and knew I couldn’t be mad because Dana had saved my ass more than once. She looked out for me and it helped. 

I got dressed and bundled up in the subzero temperatures as I made my way to my car. The parking lot of my apartment complex was silent as my flats click clacked across the black top. I had been doing child abuse and neglect investigations for a little over three years. It was demanding, exhausting, and rewarding all at the same time. You can judge me for my choice to work in this field, but let’s face it, somebody has to do it. 

The waiting room in the ER was crawling with flu patients. I quickly grabbed a mask as I went past the desk. I waited patiently for the nurse as all of them sped past me in a rush. There had to be at least thirty people in that waiting room, I didn’t mind waiting.

“Are you social services”, the nurse asked, stopping at the desk.

“Hi, I’m Jessica with Children’s Division. I’m here to see Taylor Vincent”, I replied.
 
She led me to a small room in the corner of the ER. Somewhat tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the unit. The lights were dimmed and I could hear the small pitter patter of little feet. I poked my head in and introduced myself. Taylor was running around the room, like most two year olds, and was playing with some stickers that the nurses gave her. Eva was sitting in the chair next to the bed visibly trying to make herself cry. I brushed it off that all of us grieve in different ways. She did look familiar, though, but I couldn’t place her.

“What brings you guys into the ER today”, I asked.

“Well, Taylor has been exhibiting some behaviors lately and I’m just so afraid something has happened to her”, Eva said bursting into tears again.

“I know this can be a scary and overwhelming thing to discuss, but I want to make sure that I can get all the information I need to keep Taylor safe”, I said. “Can you tell me a little about her behaviors recently?”

Eva quickly got herself together and replied, “Last night she had a nightmare and said that her vagina hurt. Then she shoved her hands in her diaper and was scratching.”

 “Did Taylor use the word vagina or is was there another word she used”, I asked.

“No, I taught her what body parts she has so she told me vagina”, she said as Taylor tugged on her shirt for attention.

“Ok, have there been any other behaviors that you’ve noticed”, I continued.

“The other day, she wouldn’t let a certain someone change her diaper. She kicked and screamed and told them no”, she added.

“Has she done this for anyone else”, I asked.

“No, she doesn’t for me, but I make sure we talk about it for a long time before I change her diaper”, Eva said.

“Can you tell me who was changing her diaper that day”, I asked.

“I don’t feel comfortable saying that”, Eva said as her gaze went directly to the floor.

“We can come back to that question. Let’s go ahead and verify your address. I’m going to need to come to your house with you all tonight and check a few things. Do you still live at 780 W. Jordan Ave”, I asked.

“Yes, but that’s not where we are staying right now”, Eva said, still staring at the floor.

“Could you tell me where you are staying now,” I continued.

“No, I don’t feel comfortable with that or with you coming to our houses. That’s what happened last time and I can’t lose another one”, she said.

“Have you been investigated before”, I asked.

“Yes, and they took her from me. They took her from me and she died while she was there. I couldn’t do anything about it and you people didn’t do anything to help her” Eva said, shaking with anger.
“Ma’am, do you have another daughter”, I asked.

It was like something snapped inside of Eva and she sat straight up and stared directly into my eyes. Her body was rigid. Her face expressionless. “I don’t need another daughter. I have Taylor”, she replied flatly.

“What did you say Taylor’s birthday is”, I asked.

“May 9th, 2015”, Eva said, never leaving my gaze.

“Which hospital was she born in”, I continued.

“Three Rivers in Trenton”, she said.

I paused, taking a long look at Taylor. She was tall for her age with big blue eyes and blond hair. She sat carefully putting her stickers in a specific order. She laid her hand gently on the bed and on her left thumb was a large birthmark in the shape of what looked like a “giraffe” spot.
 
I knew exactly where I knew Eva from.

“Alright, you two, hang tight for just a second and I’m going to check in with the doctor”, I said moving toward the door.
 
I quickly found the nurse. “Call the police. I need them here now”, I said as adrenaline started pulsing through my veins.

As I stood there replaying the events of the last three years, I remembered who Eva was. I’m not sure how I didn’t remember it before. When I was an intern at Children’s Division, I went to Eva’s house one evening because there had been reports of a child running out on the lawn at two in the morning. My mentor picked me up at my apartment and we went straight toward their house.

As we pulled up, police officers were in the front yard with Eva on the ground, handcuffed, and Trish in the arms of one of the other officers. It seemed like a relatively simple case. Eva had severe mental health issues and had started having audial and visual hallucinations. She was unable to care for Trish so Trish was taking care of herself.

While Eva was in the psych unit, Trish was sent to a foster home. Out of all the very good foster homes, Trish went to one of the bad ones. While she was in care, Trish was beaten and shaken by the foster mom causing severe head trauma that ultimately killed Trish. Eva was devastated. She attempted suicide multiple times after that. She was in and out of the psych unit and was not progressing at all. 

I hadn’t seen or heard from Eva in over six months when I was pulled in on a case of an infant abduction at Three Rivers Hospital on May 9th, 2015. At that time, the maternity ward and psych units were on the same floor in separate locked units. Eva managed to get from one unit to the other and took off with a baby. The only identifying information on the baby was that she was a newborn and had a distinguishing feature on her hand. One that looked like a giraffe spot. 

I snapped out of my trance when I heard the nurse yell, “Hey! You can’t leave with her!”

Eva was sprinting out the front doors. I, along with other staff, ran outside after her. The police were outside and cornered her as she clutched a screaming Taylor in her arms. The police instructed her to give Taylor to me and drop the gun. My eyes trailed to Eva’s side as she stood holding Taylor and had a small revolver in her other hand. Taylor’s expression was still flat and empty. 
Without any warning, Eva started to raise the gun to Taylor’s head. The officer took a shot at Eva and Taylor came crashing to the ground. I ran to scoop her up and hold her tiny, shaking body. Blood was spattered all over Taylor’s face as I took her in a different entrance to go call her parents. 

While Taylor was returned to her parents, Eva didn’t fare so well. Eva was brought back to a psychiatric hospital where she ended up committing suicide.

Even though Taylor returned home, Eva’s daughter never got the same kind of justice. No matter how badly I wanted the circumstances to be different, one family gained a daughter and Eva lost herself because hers was taken from her.

While I hate my job sometimes, someone’s got to do it.

I'm having trouble choosing between the two and would like your input. AT&amp;T is for the software engineering TDP internship while Epic is for a regular software engineering internship. ATT pays 23/hour with 2500 relo in Dallas while Epic pays around 29/hour with free housing in Wisconsin. Which do you guys think is better for improving my potential internship/job search in the future? As in which looks more impressive on a resume? I really want to maximize my ability to land big4/unicorn interviews next year. I think AT&amp;T is a lot more well-known but it doesn't necessarily have a positive impression in people's (or recruiters') minds. What do you guys think? Also, if anyone's interned at AT&amp;T or Epic before please share your experiences.

P.S. Also applied to Spotify and Coinbase but haven't heard back from either yet. Should I leverage these offers to try to make them expedite my application?

Edit: Would also like to note that I have relatives who live 40 minutes away from AT&amp;T's Dallas HQ so I'll probably commute from there. (If this is even relevant)"
7t8noy,1,2018-01-26,I need your guidance to find the best way out,Will-Isley,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/7t8noy/i_need_your_guidance_to_find_the_best_way_out/,"Hello everyone. 

I am a 24 year old Moroccan who grew up in the UAE. I had to leave the UAE when I was 13 with my parents for financial reasons and because they were breaking up. Unfortunately Morocco was not a good fit for me for multiple reasons:

1- Culture: Don’t like Moroccan culture and sensibilities. I grew up with a multicultural /western world mindset which made it hard for me to create lasting relationships. This is a partial reasons to why I haven’t dated. It also does not help that I am secretly atheist.

2- Education: I grew up studying in english with British schools. While English practicing schools were available in Morocco, they were unfortunately prohibitively expensive for my parents. I barely finished one year in an American school before I was thrown into the public school system which is in Arabic. I barely managed to graduate because of the language barrier. This of course killed my scholarship opportunities therefore my mother had to work hard to get me into college (thanks mom). The college was an American-Moroccan hybrid so it was fine since I was back to learning in English. 

3- job market: this is the most important reason. The job market in Morocco is downright abysmal. I got a Bachelor of Arts in communications studies. This turned out to be a bad move as my field provides few opportunities in Morocco. Add to this nepotism, employers in my field rarely posting jobs, the constant need for someone to recommend you and unrealistic expectations from employers regarding job experience and you have a quite depressing job market. 

For the past two years since my graduation I have been jumping between GRE prep, internships, under the table jobs in the U.S and call centers. I am sick and tired of my spinning my wheels. My plan for the past 6 months has been to prepare a skilled worker visa for Canada but I need  at least one year of work experience before I can apply and unfortunately call centers and internships don’t count. I can’t having trouble getting done since I can’t seem to land a stable job.

So I need to know if there any relatively inexpensive ways to immigrate and work in an English speaking country. Are there any interesting opportunities i might not be aware off? 

I would really appreciate any advice you kind folk can give me."
7t9in1,4,2018-01-26,Defense contractor internship question,sir_archman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7t9in1/defense_contractor_internship_question/,"This post may be a bit long but I really need some advice. First I'll give some background and context.
I'm currently a sophomore at a large state university studying software development. I currently work for my university as a member of the undergraduate research faculty. I've worked as an undergraduate researcher since my second week of school (almost 2 years now). Basically, I'm paid by my university to do research for professors; this will be relevant later. We have a bunch of career fairs and lots of employers come out, mainly consulting firms, government/defense contractors, and smaller companies.

Anyway, I was working in my office one day when my coworker from last year's project came to talk to me. He encouraged me to go to a Lockheed Martin recruiting event and talk to some of the recruiters. He had just interned there last summer and had recently accepted a full time job with them. I figured, what the hell, why not; so I went. Long story short I talked to the recruiters and within a few days I received a letter of intent followed by an offer. I accepted the offer, which didn't specify a position, with the assumption that I would be put on the software engineering team.

Here's the catch, I don't really want to work for the government or defense contractors. My ultimate goal is to work as a software engineer at one of the big 4 (Google, facebook, Amazon, Microsoft). I like working on applications that can be customized by the user. Take Spotify for example, each user can customize their experience and interaction but it's still one mass application; that's the kind of stuff that really sparks my interest. Defense contracting doesn't really fit my interests and I don't feel like Lockheed will help me get to where I want to be.

Now for the questions:

* 1. Will interning with a defense contractor hinder my ability to get an internship at a big 4 company? *Side note: I have an interview with Microsoft mid February for a summer internship in 2019.*
* 2. If Lockheed's final offer isn't software engineering, is it acceptable for me to withdraw from their internship? *Side note: I don't really want to do IT work or consulting*
* 3. Will interning with a defense contractor hinder my ability to **work** at a big 4 company out of college? *Side note: My first assumption is yes because why would I intern with a defense contractor if I'm looking to work for an innovative tech company.*
* 4. Will larger companies assume that since I interned with a defense contractor I'm not interested in their area of work?

I don't really want to work at Lockheed but, as of now, I don't have any other offers. I'm just worried that their final offer isn't going to be software engineering, which is really what I want to do. I'm honestly really confused and stressed about this whole situation. I really want to work for a big 4 but I don't want to take any steps that will hurt my chances to work there. I feel like I never should have gone to the recruiting event because it has only brought more stress to my life. I'm really looking for advice from those who are either already in industry or had an experience similar to my current one.

7t9iz8,1,2018-01-26,I'm a sophomore. I need some advice.,iamthedonquixote,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7t9iz8/im_a_sophomore_i_need_some_advice/,"I’d love to go to an amazing school like UChicago, Georgetown, Yale, or UMich. I've been thinking a lot about college lately, and I’m wondering if I’m on the right track, and what I can do from here on forward to increase my chances to get into one of these schools. 

Right now, though I don't know my exact class rank, I know I am in the top 10% of my class. However, my UW GPA is only about a 3.85, and my weighted is a 4.1. Currently, I am taking 3 AP classes, and the rest honors, except for one class, and last year was mostly honors with one AP, as that was the only one offered for freshman at my school. 

Though I got a few A-'s this semester and last year, I think that next year, senior year, and this coming semester should end up being all A's, as my work ethic and study skills have improved. Also, I've been in recovery for an ED, which has caused some issues relating to grades in the past, but is now okay. Ideally, my UW GPA should go up to a 3.9 - 3.95, and weighted should go up to a 4.4.

My next years schedule is this: 

* AP Calculus AB
* AP Language
* Sociology
* AP Comparative Government
* AP World History
* AP Chemistry. 

I'm taking the ACT in April, and hoping to score at least above a 30. I'm also taking the US History SAT Subject test and am hoping for above a 750. Next year, I am hoping to also take the Math II test, and the World History test. 

EC's:

* I've played the violin for 5 years so far, though no awards. 

* Debate team. I've been a semi-finalist at the State tournament 2 years in a row, along with being a national qualifier. I'll probably end up being captain by senior year. 

* I volunteer regularly at the library. I have around 30 hours now, but it is steadily increasing week by week. I really enjoy it and am hoping to continue to do it throughout my 4 years. One of the things I also do with the library is help organize a summer reading program for underprivileged youth. 

* I'm a power lifter. I regularly work out and have been in a few competitions. My numbers aren't competitive now, but they should be soon. 

Next year, I am planning on applying for my state's Youth Council, who works with the legislature when concerning issues relating to youth in our state. I think I have a pretty high chance of getting onto this council. This summer as well, I am looking for research internships with local professors relating to economics and political science, though the search is still ongoing. 

Next summer, I am going to apply for a government internship with a local senator of mine, the United States Senate Youth Program, and TASP. I **don't expect to get into each of these**, but at least one. 

All in all, I really would love to go to an amazing school, ideally UChicago or Yale. Maybe Georgetown. I want to double major in economics and political science. 

Mainly, with this post, I'm looking for advice and feedback on what I should be doing, and how I'm looking so far. Thanks. "

7taamv,1,2018-01-26,Those Tide Pod memes are hitting a little close to home,Disera,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/7taamv/those_tide_pod_memes_are_hitting_a_little_close/,"So, I'm 21. My boyfriend and I are currently living with my parents. I have a part time retail job where I'm getting less and less hours. My boyfriend has a bachelors in Computer Engineering and hasn't been able to find a job (in his field or otherwise) in two years. Despite our lives falling apart all at once, things have actually improved a little...for me.

I don't hate myself as much. I'm actually working my way off Prozac right now. I've been very easily irritated and my emotions are out of wack, but I've managed not to lose it for two straight days. I feel like that's going a little better. 

I also manned up and got us out of a really bad situation. See, we were living with my boyfriend's dad. Who is not a sane person. Bipolar. Unmedicated. Smokes a lot of pot. Lives in squalor. He was a constant stressor and the whole squalor thing was difficult to live with. Eating every day is nice, ya know? So, one day I was just like, ""Fuck it. I'm moving back in with my parents. You can come or you can stay,"" And he came. Was too depressed to put up a fight, really. I packed everything and we moved two days afterward.

I like the job that I have right now. My boyfriend might even have a job. I don't know. They told him he passed the interview process and they would get back to him this month. ""be patient"". It's the 26th and we're all thinking the worst. This certainly wouldn't be the first ""sure thing"" to fall through.

Problem is, when you get right down to it, our lives are going nowhere and they haven't been for a while. Well, there have been baby steps, but clearly you see what I mean. When I graduated high school and moved into my boyfriend's apartment he had a good paying internship and a guaranteed job after he graduated college. I didn't even HAVE to work. Then the plant idled and here we are. Losing more hope day by day. If life were anything else I definitely would have deemed it too hard and quit by now.

So, once again, I'm probably going to claw out of my comfort zone....and go to college! Yay! But, no, not really, because the thought makes me want to die a little bit. Not because I wasn't good at school or because I would hate the work in general or because I hate learning. I actually love learning and have a lot of academic interests. History. Biology. Linguistics. Culture. Art history. Psychology. Basically all falling into the field of Anthropology, with which I will use exactly none of that knowledge because I live in fucking rural Ohio and the options are slim to none anyway. The careers that follow such an interesting field of study are shockingly boring.

That brings me back to my plan A. I love history. I don't hate people completely. Why not be a history teacher? I've already looked into all the course work aside from gen. ed. and I definitely think it's something I could do. Unfortunately, the education in history I'm likely to get is extremely underwhelming and generalized. The language arts department is lovely. History, not so much. 

Do I REALLY want to be a teacher? No. I want to stay home. Be a mom, decorate my house, write a book (or 10), maybe adopt a few farm animals. Of course, I don't think I'll hate being a teacher. I'll probably like it, honestly. And it gives me plenty of time to raise a family and be present. Its just kind of painful that I can't even LEARN what I want to learn. Ya know? 

From an outside perspective, life is horrible. Like, what is all this? Why is it worth it? I'm convinced a person stops feeling alive around the age of 15, maybe two or three years after that if they're lucky. I'm just hoping I do this and it doesn't suck and I can become the person I want to be without wondering if my future is entirely doomed."

I googled and it's apparently a hackerrank test I'm not sure how hard those are. Basically I have 7 days from when I open the link to start the test, however it should ideally be done in 90min and they will ofcourse track my time. 

I'm a first year CompSci student and only started to pick up my coding around Sept this year, I'm not too confident with it yet. I was planning on doing some practice before I start it, and also be able to practice for other intern selection processes which ask me to code. Basically get confident enough for interviews and such, while also becoming a better coder.

I currently only know python, however have started getting into Java."

I ultimately want to be a full-time software engineer at a large company (Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) but it's been difficult getting internship interviews from these companies. I really want my 2nd internship to be the extra boost on my resume that will land me more interviews when I go for my 3rd and final internship before grad.

My choices:

- Software developer position a small company recruiters haven't heard of.

- Software developer position (not QA) at a large company (70000+ employees), but the job description sounds like I will be writing a lot of automated tests for testing performance in the company's cloud product.

@ Recruiters, or people with similar experiences, which do you think would make my resume look better in terms of being noticed by recruiters at large companies or unicorns?"

But I know I am not as strong as I need to be. Such as I don't know how I'd specifically get a software project idea into an actual application. I know for a fact that the people on the architecture team were extremely skilled and knew their design patterns, libraries, and so much more inside out and backwards; which in turn made my job significantly easier.

I know I need to raise my game, and I am hoping I can be pointed to the actual ways to achieve this. I want to learn the best standards and practices for SWE and architecture and how to just become a force to be reckoned with. I am not intimidated by research papers, blogs or textbooks.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say right now I am so driven that I'm fine with prettymuch any suggestion made. I want this. I want this bad. I have a lot to learn and I know it.


In terms of language I am fantastically comfortable with: Java, C++, C#. 

I am passable in Python, I've done some small scripts here and there and past coursework in it. 


*I could start random personal projects right now, but I know that all I'd do is that I'd basically perpetuate the things I already know.

I'm a 3rd year Computer Engineering student with an internship starting this May of 2018 for 12 months as a Software Developer.
My goal is to transition from dev positions into PM or Product Development positions, where I'll be able to take full responsibility for a product/project and guide my team to deliver.


My thought process was that having a strong dev background will give me an upper hand on being the best PM I can possibly be, by having a better understanding of the types of skills required by my team to get the job done.


Any advice on specific jobs I should be looking for to develop a project management portfolio? 

I've made sure to focus on internships where my team would essentially ""own"" products or work on projects from start to finish, so I will be exposed to the entire process from being presented with a problem, to delivering a solution.

Looking forward to your responses, thanks!"

7tbic3,1,2018-01-27,What are my employment prospects?,tapetrovich,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7tbic3/what_are_my_employment_prospects/,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here on a throwaway account. I apologize if this post violates any subreddit rules.

I am writing this post to seek opinions on my employment prospects and what I should do going forward.

&amp;nbsp;

Background: I am 28 years old and I live in Southern California. I graduated from college with a Bachelor's degree in Economics and a minor in Accounting in 2011. I interviewed for accounting jobs and internships during my time in college, but I only worked part time as a tutor.

Immediately after graduating college, I got a job as an accountant, which I quit after 1 month; I left on bad terms.

After that, I had trouble finding work for about a year. In 2012, I found a job that was advertised as an accounting position in a small manufacturing company. The job turned out to have nothing to do with accounting and I was instead tasked with office management duties and responsibilities. After about a month at this job, the employer let me go because I was deemed a ""bad fit"".

After being let go from my second job, I once again had trouble finding a job. For the next two years (mid 2012- late 2014), I had no success landing a job or even interviews. Throughout the entire time, I lived at my parents' home (still do) so that is how I was able to get by even with no income.

At this point, I was very disappointed in and unhappy with myself in general. I stopped looking for work and in late 2014, I started working on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform (mturk). For those who are not familiar with mturk, it is a platform where people can work from home. The work consists of many microjobs, which are often short, low paying tasks that require few specialized skills, if any. From this work, I was able to make $16,000 - $18,000 per year. The income is not much, but it is somewhat stable and at least I can start paying my own bills.

&amp;nbsp;

Current situation: I have been working on mturk for the past 3-4 years. I live at my parents' place to save on expenses. I have no friends and no professional network. Lately, I have been looking at job postings again, but I seem to qualify for few jobs considering my non-existent work history other than mturk.

&amp;nbsp;

What are my options? Am I unemployable? What kind of jobs should I be looking at? How should I talk about my past experience if I am lucky enough to get into an interview? What are my prospects like if I do not want to get into public accounting?

Thanks for taking the time to read the lengthy post.

7tbrfh,15,2018-01-27,Career with Excel and Organization,vpoz,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/7tbrfh/career_with_excel_and_organization/,"*English is not my first language. I am a male, mid 30s, living in Western Europe (EU).*

I finished law school about three years ago and am currently working in tax. My company is not a big4, but still in a worldwide network and multiple locations. In my department, we work with expatriates, prepare their tax returns and advise employers. 

In university, I focused on tax and accounting. I did an internship in audit, but didn't like to travel 48 weeks per year, so that wasn't for me. 

*What I would like to work with:*

Excel - My skills include pivot tables, macros, index/match, vlookup. Also tried to learn Swift development, which was very interesting, but too much at the moment. 

Organization - I like to organize, track, manage stuff and I do this a lot in my personal life. Doesn't have to something special. Anything that can be quantified gets my attention. 

*What I don't like:*

Time tracking - As I am currently working in a tax firm, I have to keep track of every minute that I work and my performance is measured by this. Hence I would rather work for a private company and just do my stuff. I think I would be much more productive if I had the freedom to just work and not have to reach hourly goals, which lead to demotivation and underperformance when reached in my case. 

Clients - It is ok talking to clients and helping them, but I don't like to always be the one providing the service and feel like the punching ball whenever something isn't right, our fault or not. I understand that in industry, the other departments are the clients and I am very diplomatic, but I think it is much different working with coworkers from other departments than being the service provider to clients, who don't even hire us themselves (we get hired by the employers and their employees have to deal with it). My team leader is a people pleaser outside of the company and I am not allowed to even blink when a client yells at me or I get in trouble. 

Exams - I did my masters and I really liked studying. I am still eager to learn and love to find solutions, but I don't want the pressure of having to pass a professional exam in order to get my career started. Currently, I am attending training for the equivalent of CPA in my country and I feel that I just want to do my work, not having to do this to get promoted or to be an employee of value. I wouldn't consider this for my career as I am thinking about not taking the exam. 

*Personal*

I can be very diplomatic, deal with different personalities and always try to please. My family is from working class and I was a truck driver before going to university. I know how it feels being the last piece in the chain and what manual labor is, not afraid of getting my hands dirty and loving the smell of diesel.

Justice is big thing for me, I can't stand people being treated unfair. I know life sucks from time to time, but nobody should suffer from others being assholes and treating people like shit. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and as a human being, no matter of heritage or education.  

Also, I have ADHD (inattentive), so I am not very good at repetitive tasks. I am medicated, but filling out forms 40 hours per week is not something I could do without making a lot of mistakes. 

*Thoughts*

My ideal work day consists of sitting at a desk, working with Excel, tracking and organizing stuff, crunching some numbers and talk to others occasionally. Some business travel is ok, conference calls also. 

I don't want to become a CEO of a multi-national corporation earning millions. However, I think that I could be a great general manager is a mid-sized business, leading employees, optimizing processes and organizing the business activities. As this might not be an option at the moment after finishing university just recently, I would keep that in mind for the future and love to hear your thoughts on possible career paths."

Not sure how to think about life after undergrad.  I am not worried about employment prospects, but I don’t know if I should pursue higher education abroad, or stay back in my country and continue to explore the market, and take things as they come.

Moreover, I don’t know whether to narrow my focus onto either design or pol for greater proficiency, or try to find work that fits either bill - or better yet, both.

Let me begin with a little info about myself, I'm an immigrant who came to USA for pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science and am officially graduating on 1st Feb. I came here directly after completing my undergrad and in my home country there isn't a concept of Internships as such so I have no work experience in my home country. Last summer, however, I got lucky and landed an internship at a good company in Bay Area but unfortunately none of the interns in our Unit got any return full-time offers. My MS GPA is 3.3 and I think I do have a decent profile.

The problem: I'm having a real tough time getting any interviews. To give a rough estimate, I'd say I must've applied to around 350 - 400 companies now and got 1 call from a Big Company while 2 coding challenges from 2 others and that is it. I have put my resume in today's Resume thread and I'd appreciate feedback on the same as well. I had an amazing team where I was interning and am in touch with my Manager who is still trying to get funds to recruit me. I have made other connections as well but since my manager is trying to get me a full-time offer in the same team I don't want to ping others to help me land a gig elsewhere because I think my manager wouldn't like it if he comes to know? 

The question: I'm currently living in a place where the tech scene is average-below average. I have 3k$ in my account, saved from my previous internship. I'm planning to relocate to SF bay area for job hunting. Do you guys think this is a good idea? I probably would be able to support myself only for 2 months Max with that money if I count the rent and food. My manager has offered to let me stay in his house for a few weeks if I plan to move to Bay Area for job hunting. I don't want to work for Big 4/N. I'm ready to work for start-ups too but the place I live right now, I have no call backs from applied start ups as well. Would moving to Bay Area prove beneficial? How do you aggressively hunt jobs in a new location? Meetups etc? 

Any help is appreciated. Thanks guys!

One is a suppport role while the other is a system engineer/Technician role. I am having a hard time deciding which I should go with. 

Here is a little information about me. 
-I am a senior undergraduate student who will be graduating this semester. 
-I am currently an intern at the company
- I have about 2 and half years of suppport experience. ( 6 months at the current company)
- I will have about 6 months experience in a systems engineer role( I currently work with the systems/networking team

Based on my experience with the company so far I can determine the following
- suppport will be easier and more laid back. I can also see myself becoming bored with this however. I would however be able to work 4 days a week as opposed to 5. I would also have the fee time to pursue what I want in my free time. Basically as long as tickets are covered I can do whatever I want. Potential for a raise every year as well 

- with the systems role it will definitely be more challenging. I will admit that I am still learning and I feel like it would take me a bit of time to catch up to my counter parts. The company still seems willing to accept me despite this fact. The pay would probably be more than the suppport role but I would not have as much freedom. 

Well Reddit, what do you think? Which would you pursue? Are there other factors I should consider? Any advice and help is greatly appreciated. "

I'm a recent graduate of a very good school with a Bachelor degree in CS and math with a very high GPA. However, I have had trouble finding work in my field as I feel like my degree did not really prepare me for software engineering or things of that sort. I did have 1 internship in software engineering, and I know some languages like Java, Scala, C, some Python, a little SQL, etc.

However, probably 95% of jobs I look at, I'm not qualified for, even entry-level ones. They want experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, .NET, RESTful, Angular, Django, Docker, so many things I can hardly name them all. I didn't learn any of these things in school. And on top of that, I feel like my experience with Java etc. in school was mostly for academic projects, not actual software, so I don't even know the Java stuff you need for a real job. Is it possible my peers had all been teaching themselves all this extra stuff along the way?

I understand that CS =/= software engineering but I guess I thought I'd be more qualified. I also understand this may be because I took more courses on the theory side because that's what I was interested in at the time. I also struggled with mental illness throughout undergrad so I mostly just did my coursework and got good grades. So I didn't have any friends on campus, networking, connections, extracurriculars, etc. Most of my free time was spent reading or with friends outside of school. I also have no side projects or anything like that.

So I guess my questions are (1) are there any job types (software engineering or otherwise) that I *am* qualified for that I should look into? and (2) if I want to get to the point of being qualified for these software roles, how do I get there? I assume I'll have to teach myself a lot of stuff.

Thanks."

I've been submitting applications (~50) for about 3 months now but only two have replied to me and those quickly went no where. I've changed my resume about 3 times also. 

IT doesn't seem super interesting, at least from the interview. Sounded like yanking a system replacing it and wiping and flashing the ""broken system. Sounds more like a help desk not too technical. 

I think I want to eventually get into systems engineering, embedded software, defense industry, C++ stuff.

Let me give you a little bit of a background first, I'm currently studying CS with a GPA of 4.748/5.0 and I'm graduating in May. I had an internship this summer but most of the work was more managerial than technical. I have entered a few CS related extracurricular activities and competitions. I have a nano degree in Android Basics Development. I am passionate and a fast self-learner. My programming project portfolio is varied... but sadly I personally don't feel like any of my projects were particularly challenging, I know I can do more. I speak fluent English, most people think it's my first language.


Ideally being a CS major I would want to go to SV but I don't have the money nor the experience. I'm thinking of moving to Mexico because I absolutely love Mexican culture, the people, and the food. How possible would it be for me to find a good job in somewhere like Guadalajara or Mexico City?

Are there any other countries with good tech companies that are more migrant-friendly?

So, I have graduated Bsc. in Electrical Engineering and at the moment I am doing my Master's degree again in Electrical Engineering (Computer Engineering as a specialization). In my master's program I have an internship and I was considering of looking in the field of IT. I have had a couple of courses on communication networks and I found them relatively interesting, however, I have also had a great deal of embedded systems subjects and I found them exciting as well, so this makes my decision relatively hard. To top it all of, I am currently working as a web developer and I am mainly working with python, so I am kinda familiar with it (from what I have read it is a requirement in the IT sphere). So I have practical experience in a Computer Science field, theoretical experience in Electrical Engineering and interest in IT. I am also relatively familiar with the Linux operating systems, as I am using Fedora 27 on my laptop.

After the brief introduction my questions are:

1. I have read some radical comments, that the IT sphere is dying (partly do **not** believe this). Is this true? Should I stick to web development or electrical engineering?
2. As I already mentioned I am familiar with python, Linux OS, git, C/C++, nginx and probably some other small things. What other skills/languages do I need to learn to be prepared for the IT world?
3. Can anyone share some of his/hers experience on the IT market in Europe? (I am not specifying a country, as I am open to moving) I have read great things on this subreddit about some states in the US, but relatively nothing about Europe. :/

So I started an internship at a comic book store a week ago and I came up to the place and asked to startup myself, bacause I'm a customer and I obviously do enjoy comics myself, but obviously getting behind the scenes also shows you the rough edges in the store.

After being there the very first day and since then, I found out ""the hard way"" that my boss /store-owner is too honest with what he thinks and he feels superior to the co workers and some customers and their opinions on what good entertainment is and manages to create tension in every discussion. Now let me point out that this is not a matter of disagreement, but the way he talks down to people and call them stupid for being into stuff he personally doesn't find good and he'll let you know in a very rude way.

Let me give you an example of something that happened the second day there:

So I was sorting some DC Rebirth comics and I saw an ad on the back of an issue and I showed it to my boss and asked him ""Have you seen this TV show?"" which he replied to with ""Yes I have, it was interesting"" the show we're talking about here (Powerless) which got cancelled because it didn't do well enough. So after he told me he liked it, I said ""Personally I didn't really enjoy it"" and he replied to me with ""Well, it's one of those shows you have to be intelligent to get"" And I thought ""Woah...Did he just call me stupid, because I didn't agree with him?"". I then replied in a matter of seconds without even thinking about it twice ""Well, there's a reason why it got cancelled..."" and yes I know I probably should've kept my mouth shut, but I don't tolerate behaviours like that, when there's no reason to be like that.

This example is just on of many other. Anyways so to give a few more examples of my boss being a dick is, he will also put customers down and tell them that they're stupid for doing things that he wouldn't do and he has even gone as far as calling other people ""retards"" - I think he thinks it's all in good fun but I can see that people are speechless and kinda just get quiet for a few seconds and just let him bully them without really doing anything about it. He seems like the type of person who has very strong beliefs and whoever doesn't agree with him are stupid.

I see myself as a person with a lot of selfcontrol and I love studying personal development (I'm an INTJ) and I have some ideas of why the man is acting like that. However, I would like to get some ideas and advice from you guys on how I can handle 2-3 more weeks at a store I love and would like to keep buying my ""fix"" from, but first of all if I leave my internship I don't think it'll be easy to visit the store without an awkward moment between me and him, so leaving is not really an option. And second is that it's really only just an internship I'm doing to keep myself busy while looking for a full time job and to get exprience - I don't get paid for it.

As a last note I will say that him and I do get a long in terms of work, he seems to like my commitment to comics and how efficient I am while I'm there, so it's not really a matter of ""disliking each other"", but more a problem that seems to come from attitude, opinions and him being too blunt.

What do you think I should do moving forward, how should I deal with him, or should I? :)"

It’s my first time posting here but I read this subreddit a lot so thank you for the help thus far with everything!

As the title says I’m graduating in May with a Finance Major and a CS minor, wishing it was the other way around. I see a lot of posts like this, but most of the time it is STEM majors or people who are early enough in college for them to switch majors. Since I’m graduating in May it is too late for me to switch so I’m graduating with what I have. Here are the 5 classes I have taken just to give you a feel for my current experience:

- 2 general Java Courses for learning Object Oriented programming
- Data Structures (Java)
- Web Development (Javascript, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS)
- (Current Class) Operating Systems (C )

Work Experience:

- Mainly SQL and Excel
- Some SAS
- I also requested Python with Pandas at my work which I play around with it when I’m bored.

How close am I to being employable as an entry level software role or internship? I am considering doing a bootcamp to get more specific, job ready skills that I would have gained in an internship (all my internships thus far have been in Finance). I know bootcamps are not a replacement for a degree, it would just be to get started in the industry. Eventually I want to try to get a Master’s degree in CS to make up for the lack of an undergraduate but I really want to get a job first. 

Any advice as to what path you think I should take and what I should do is much appreciated!

tl;dr: All experience is in Finance but I want to be a Software Engineer. What is the path I should take to make the transition?

Thank you!"

We all think we could've done much better, gotten higher grades, prepared for apps sooner, known this or that tip, chosen the right school,... 

Luckily, it's not over. You're not a loser, you still have a long way to go, no matter which college you go to this fall. You still have 4 year ahead, and graduate school for some people. Not trying to comfort you guys or anything, but that's a fact. If you don't have a wake up call this soon, you'll have to pay a much bigger cost later in your life. This is nothing. You should embrace the failure you get, and make it become motivation to never make that same mistake again in the future. 

To me, I just don't care about the college application stuffs anymore. I'm a CS major, so since the day I realized I'll have to go to a mediocre, big research uni instead of a tier 1 school like CMU or Stanford, I stop giving a fuck. I started researching everything about CS, self-studying and coding a lot, lurking r/cscareerquestions, taking notes of what I should do to get a head start, interview, internship, etc. I don't know how well I'll do in college, but I'll probably do my fking best and not regret anything.

I am a 26 y/o male who will be graduating this May with a bachelor's degree in health care administration. I am currently doing a 15-week internship at a major VA hospital in a major city. I am assigned to the Director's office, and have access to all of the top level management of the facility. I attend the morning reports, my desk is steps away from the director and other leadership in the front office, and I will be doing rotations through a number of departments as well as undertaking a capstone project that will be my main focus of the internship.

It appears that the capstone project will be in the engineering department. I worked as an agricultural mechanic for 5 years before returning to school, so this is a department that I am interested in. 

The hospital currently has over 2,000 open work orders. They range from emergency orders that are taken care of immediately to orders that are older than 30 days and keep being put on the back burner. I am being tasked with shrinking that number of long-standing open orders while not inhibiting the ability to address emergencies.

Beyond that, I know that this internship is a great opportunity, so any advice on how to just generally make the most of it is also appreciated.

7tqjb5,2,2018-01-29,Sent an angry work email &amp; apologized immediately to my boss - steps afterwards?,leloar,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7tqjb5/sent_an_angry_work_email_apologized_immediately/,"So I started a paid internship straight after I graduated from college this past December. I was thrown into the midst of my job’s big three days event that they’d been preparing months for. Despite doing numerous part-time jobs and internships while in college, none were on the same stress level as my new internship has proven to be. I tend to empathize too much with people because of my teaching background, and unfortunately, allowed the negative energy from the temps and interns fighting to cause me to send pretty much my whole department an angry email demanding for an immediate action to resolve the issue. The tension has been weird at my work since they’re hiring rapidly because they got more funding, so all of the temps and interns are naturally anxious about it.

While I care about my career, I also know personally that I don’t have enough real work experience to be particularly picky about my job choices just yet. After getting yelled at justifiably by my family and sending an apology email to my boss, I’m curious about what my next steps should be. My mom already advised me that I should just do a short response without excuses if the rest of the staff ask me. But considering that I’ll still need to work with the interns and temps, how do I deal with their toxicity without being as close as before? I want to distance myself but not to the degree where I’m not doing my work at all just because I don’t like them."

I’m 28. I live at home with my mom and brother. I’m still attending university and I’ll hopefully graduate by December.

I was unemployed for most of 2016, after I was let go of a job that I hated, but paid incredibly well. I spent that year searching for another job and I ended up finding one in August of 2017. It was in the same field as my previous one, so i knew I wasn’t going to like it. Mainly because they were both call center jobs. 

After that, I ended up being called to interview for an internship I applied to months before, for a professional sports team. A major team. I was offered the internship and started working there. Only bad part is that it only paid minimum wage. 

The first few months were ok financially. But as of late, I’ve been feeling a bit more anxious and concerned about money. Mainly because I have bills to pay and I feel like I can’t cover them. 

It’s all essential stuff. Car, phone, tuition.

But my issue is this. Should I keep going with the internship, that pays horribly and potentially get a job offer? Or look for another job that will pay more? I have maybe 2-3 months left in the internship(playoffs are a lock which will extend my time). But after that, I have nothing. 

I know it sounds like a stupid question, but the financial aspect of things is starting to affect me a lot more than I want it to. 

I’m doing a great job at the internship and I feel like a job offer can potentially happen, but it’s not guaranteed. I’m just unsure about the future and whether or not I’ll land on my feet. 

I need outside eyes looking in. Here goes. "

1. Worked in Procurement and Logistics department for the annual fest of our college (one of the biggest in my country).
Was Procurement in-charge of 4 other major departments as well as the Compliance in-charge of the entire department.

2. Worked for a NGO that aimed to bring awareness of government health schemes to the underprivileged urban population of the city as well as provide monetary support to micro entrepreneurs.

3. Was bassist for a local indie band. Got enough recognition in the local underground scene to get weekly gigs. Released one EP so far.


Honestly, I really don't see myself  devoting time to pursue further ECs related to 1 and 2. I don't see myself working for a non-profit, let alone being part of the board for one like so many of you guys here!

 As for music, it's just a hobby of mine and even if I do continue to play live and go for recordings, I don't know if it's something I can add to my CV. It did come up once in an interview once for a summer internship and according to the interviewer, it was the first interesting thing I've said about myself. It maybe the only reason I've got the internship despite bombing the interview in a very catastrophic manner.

Sorry for the lack of coherency in the post, but my question is, can I overcome a lack of/ weak EC solely through WE and Gmat?  My GPA won't be that great (3.2) but my undergrad is in the top 3 business schools of the country . I'm not aiming for a top 20  US school. My goal is to work in the hospitality industry and the goal of a MBA for me is to be considered eligible for upper management posts in the industry.

1. Does Georgia Tech factor what college you are applying from? For example Alabama is ranked 100 for undergraduate engineering, does Georgia Tech take that into consideration? 
2. Will I be able to participate in clubs such as ecocar and fsae if accepted? 3. Also will I be able to get internships if I arrive at the beginning of junior year?

2 years ago, a family member of mine saw potential in me to work for a contracting firm he worked for as a software developer. I was a junior in high school at the time, and performed very well over the summer, earning a wage of ~17$ an hour for software development work. I worked in a team with two other interns who were entering their last year in University as Computer Science majors, and later learned they were earning a decent amount more than me. No biggie, I was younger, I understood.

Year 2 in working for the firm. I work alongside a new intern group, all incoming college seniors or grad students. Again, 17$ an hour. Find out they're making $25+. Fine. I'm younger, I get it.

Continue to this year, I continue working but on a client contract doing work alongside developers making 80k a year. Getting paid what, you ask? 17$ an hour, even after asking about pay changes due to my new responsibilities. Fine, I'm young, whatever.

I find out that my skillset makes me marketable to work freelance for ~$50 an hour. I've just signed my first contract to start working on a private contract freelance for nearly triple what I was earning. How do I quit my professional internship to work freelance without upsetting the family member? Can I tell the company I'm just too busy with school, or should I be honest?

I apologize for the long and slightly irrelevant pre-story, I'm just very very very excited about this new opportunity and haven't had many people to tell so far. What should I do here, reddit?"

These writings contain true accounts of the unusual and often highly-classified medical conditions experienced by astronauts during and after their space missions. Following the defunding of the clandestine medical program after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, the majority of these accounts were left, forgotten, on tape drives in a NASA storage facility. In 2016, a former intern, whose job was to clean out one of these facilities, discovered them. Two years later, he is ready to release what he found.


**A Dentist’s Discovery**


Arnold F. A*******, DDS

August 4th, 1989


I met the astronaut after a half-year mission on the Russian space station. He’d gone through his preliminary post-landing physical but complained about pain in his jaw and gums. His health, aside from those complaints, was fair.


It was my job to find out what was wrong with him before moving him on to the next specialist. The urologist, I think. The order always changes.


The patient was in decent spirits when we met, although I could tell something was on his mind. We chatted for a little bit. It turned out he’d been working on the Feng-Lee Discovery. My heart sank.


When Feng and Lee discovered what they initially called “the Venus tic-tacs” in 1982, no one in-the-know was surprised. Just another alien organism to add to the list of hundreds. A team was formed to conduct research and determine its risks and benefits, and there were no expectations that anything would come of it.


Well, as is so often the case, those in-the-know knew nothing. Give those Venus tic-tacs an electric shock in the right place for the right amount of time and what do you get? Pluripotent stem cells. They had the potential to be a game changer in the field of regenerative medicine. I don’t think anyone expected to discover them when we did; all the data we had showed we were at least a decade away from inducing pluripotency. Hell, we assumed civilian doctors might figure them out first. This was Big. Capital B.


In dentistry, it meant we might be able to regrow missing teeth and reverse jaw deterioration. I followed the studies with great interest.


The animal tests were successful. New teeth, better jaws, nice smiles all around. Success. Good. Great. 


The researchers moved onto human subjects. Failure. Nothing. Zilch. 


No reason. No god damn reason whatsoever. No one could figure out why there was 100% success with animal subjects and 0% with people. The cells wouldn’t grow AT ALL. 


Then, a doctor named Franco T******, who’d been on the team since the beginning, suggested they try using the tic-tac cells on people in space. He didn’t give a reason, and I don’t think he had one. It was probably something like “well fuck it, it doesn’t work here so let’s try it up there.” 


So we did.


And it worked.


Sort of.


The effects were different for everyone. Sometimes cavities were repaired. Sometimes jaw bones grew again. Then again, sometimes teeth fell out. And jaws collapsed. That’s what happened to Jose G********. No one wanted to use Venus tic-tacs again.


That’s why, when this astronaut came to me with pain in his gums and jaw and told me he’d been working on the Feng-Lee Discovery, I was less than thrilled with what I’d find. There’d been a six-year moratorium on Venus tic-tac human experimentation since the Jose incident. It had only been lifted a year ago. Apparently someone on that team wanted to pick up right where they’d left off.


While I talked to the astronaut, he informed me that there’d been new research on the tic-tacs. I frowned and told him I wasn’t aware of anything new. He filled me in.


Apparently there’d been some civilian advances in stem-cell technology that ended up contributing to our own knowledge of the science. New experiments were drawn up, plausibility was determined, and one of the team leaders impressed the brass at NASA’s ethics division.  That, combined with the limited number of Venus tic-tacs that’d been recovered and the uncertainty surrounding how much longer they’d live, ended the moratorium.


That was all well and good. At that point, I still hadn’t looked inside the astronaut’s mouth. Before we’d started chatting, I had my assistant do some x-rays of his jaw. They developed while we talked. Now they were ready.


I’m going to digress for a second. Have you ever seen what a child’s skull looks like before their adult teeth have come in? It’s unsettling. [Look at this.](https://i.imgur.com/4LeLgGy.jpg) That was all of us at one point. I’ve been a dentist for the last 36 years. I’ve dealt with a lot of crazy stuff, but just thinking about all those holes makes me uneasy. Some things just stick with you, I guess.


Why am I mentioning this? This astronaut - this grown man - had what looked like new teeth forming above his adult ones. I consulted with the x-rays we took before his mission. There was nothing unusual about them - just the filled cavities and mild bone-loss in his jaw that had made him a test candidate for the tic-tac cells. 


Now, as I stared at the new x-ray, I saw the cavities were still there. The jaw was still decaying. But those dark smudges on the x-ray indicated new teeth deep in there. I’d never seen anything like it.


I remained professional. I asked him to lean back and open his mouth so I could begin the examination.


As soon as I took my first look, I knew something was dreadfully wrong. His gums were puffy and bled at the slightest touch. His teeth looked gray, as if they’d never been brushed. It didn’t make sense.


I swung the magnifying lens over and brightened the light. I think he heard me stifle my gasp when I looked through.


His teeth were covered in infinitesimal holes. They were much smaller than regular cavities. I looked closer. Each of the holes had a tiny, pink hair sticking out of its center. I touched the tip of my instrument to one of the hairs. It recoiled back into the tooth.


At this point, I was getting uneasy. I asked the astronaut if what I did hurt and he told me it did, but not badly. 


I decided to numb the gums around his top front teeth. While I waited for the novocaine to take effect, I studied his molars. Those had bigger holes with thicker growths. When I reached for one of them with my instrument, rather than slip back into the tooth, the hair extended about a quarter of an inch and wrapped around the metal tip. The astronaut didn’t seem to feel it.


I gave the instrument a gentle tug. Nothing. I pulled harder - but still barely using any force. The molar came out. My patient gasped and I apologized profusely. I stopped what I was doing and put the instrument and the tooth out of his line of sight.


I decided to level with him. I told him there was some severe damage to his teeth and I didn’t know what it was. I said I needed to do more exploratory work and it would likely be very uncomfortable. 


The astronaut did his best to take it in stride. He told me he knew something was very, very wrong from the moment he was brushing his teeth on the space station and the bristles would get caught inside the holes. The thought made me shudder.


Anyway, I numbed his mouth the best I could and got to work. By the end of it, I’d accidentally caused nine of his teeth to fall out. All that remained in their place were those bizarre, pink hairs.


I sent him back to base with an appointment for the next day. It was going to remove the rest of his teeth. I felt terrible for the guy. 


I got a call in the middle of the night from the Head of Medicine at the NASA hospital. I had to come there right away.


The astronaut’s roommate had called emergency services an hour or so ago. He was in excruciating pain and bleeding from the mouth. I arrived at the hospital in ten minutes.


I expected to be able to go right into the room and see the patient, but I was stopped by security and the Head of Medicine. He instructed me to put on a clean-room suit. Right then, I knew something was deeply wrong.


I donned the suit and followed the Head into one of the two observation areas above a hermetically-sealed operating room. I looked at one of the television screens showing the astronaut’s mouth. My stomach churned.


All the man’s teeth had fallen out. In their place, growing out of his gaping, bloody gums, were swirling tangles of the pink hairs. I watched as a surgeon grasped one of the tangles in a pair of forceps and pulled. And pulled. One doctor held the astronaut’s head while the surgeon put his weight into the effort. With the sound of a heavy piece of brush being torn from the ground, the tangles gave way.


They writhed at the end of the forceps. The ones still in his mouth stretched out, as if they were trying to take it away and bring it back. The surgeon dropped the veiny clot into a bowl and the camera zoomed in on it.


At the top of of the tangle was something solid. Something that, I realized, looked very much like one of those new teeth deep inside the astronaut’s jawbone I’d seen on the x-ray that afternoon. Now, out and exposed to the light, I saw it wasn’t a tooth at all. It was a brand new Venus tic-tac -- the first we’d ever discovered outside a Venusian meteorite.


So the issue of pluripotent stem cells and whether or not they’ll benefit human subjects is still a mystery. And, after hours of surgery, my patient is in a coma. As a human being, I write this with a heavy heart. As a scientist, though, I have some hope. Maybe even a little excitement. Thanks to that poor astronaut, now we know how to breed new Venus tic-tacs. Perhaps, someday, we’ll learn how to use them.

My classmate and I sat down and discussed on a class project. We then implemented the project (differently). Somehow, there were like 10 lines of code of ours that look identical. The rest looks completely different. The function was really simple that I didn't think I would intentionally copy someone's code. Everyone can do it in 2 minutes. (Yes, because it's easy I might overlook it and just copied it, and then focused on implementing the rest of the project by myself. Everyone does this all the time, do you?). So I got accused for the 10 lines of code.

I didn't really know what to explain because I ,in fact, did collaborate with the classmate. It was just not big enough that I think I deserve to get a mark on my record.

Ok, so that was the story. There is a chance that the incident will show up in my background checks if the companies want to check that deep. Internships are coming up and I just always have the fear that companies will see this one day.

Will companies (Facebook, Snapchat, Google, Uber, Lyft, AirBnB, ...) understand and give me a chance to explain what happened? Or will they just terminate the employment when they find out?

Has anyone had the similar experience?"

Possible offer for a part time job that would look great on resume, but still isn't what I want to do, also no guarantee on benefits. 

Bit of a long read so I apologize in advance.

 I currently work for a city run community college in a paramedic program. I have been a paramedic for 12 years and I decided I need to transfer to a job that will not kill my back or worsen my health. The paramedic program I work for is a degree program, so they follow the college hierarchy. The positions are as follows: Professors, lecturers, and College Lab Technicians (CLT). Due to my initial credentials, I was unable to secure a professor or lecturer spot. I accepted the college lab technician spot in hopes of gathering the rest of my credentials, and moving into a teaching spot. A CLT has to work 40 hours a week, 8 hour days. It's considered a white collar professional position, so we do get some perks in the role. The room for advancement in that line are Senior CLT and Chief CLT (you need a PhD for this position for some reason). I am currently a Senior CLT. I have also reached top pay for this line ($68,000). 

Due to my past debt and to maintain experience, I still work on the ambulance twice a week minimum, usually overnights. This is a part time position, and I do receive benefits through this position. The yearly for this job is approx. $26,000 before taxes. They are rotating shifts so I work every other weekend also. 

What's burning me out currently is there are days where I'm working 9a-5p at the school, i go home and sleep for 3 hours, then I work on the ambulance till 7A in the morning, and then drive over to the school to work another full day. I'm also unsatisfied at the school position because I saw myself as an educator, not a logistics manager. The school is very strict about people adhering to their roles, so I am absolutely not allowed to teach students currently. I spoke with the director of the program, and he states that there may not be another open education position for 2 years. He thinks i would be crazy to leave though because he claims that once one opens up, I would be first in line to get it. 

So here are the pros to the full time job currently: 

it's a government position, so I do receive government benefits and will receive a government pension.

I have currently enrolled into a masters program, and the school will pay 6 credits a semester for me to take the program. At this rate, i will probably finish the program 2 years later. 

It's guaranteed income, and the job itself is low stress. It's honestly just dealing with inventory, a bunch of shipping orders, and managing the simulations. 

The program itself as a great reputation, and some of the best instructors in the area teach here. They are all rooting for me to get a position with them also. 

The cons of this positions:
I cannot advance any further without getting a PhD. 

I am at top pay, so I won't be able to increase my salary further

The teaching credentials I obtained may end up expiring because I am unable to teach a course here. 

I feel underutilized and frustrated because I am nto allowed to teach

I would be earning a lot mroe working as a full time paramedic. but then there's the risk of injury and disability in my field is pretty crappy. 

Recently I was offered to interview for a part time position at a private university. Again it's a non-teaching position, but it's in a different role. The job entails dealing with clinical sites directly and monitoring students as they perform their field internship. There would be a lot of traveling during the work hours and i would be in contact with the higher ups and help make decisions on whether new clinical sites are needed and what student performances are. The job is going to be only 20 hours a week, and the pay is substantially less, but I'm willing to negotiate. They have not relayed if there are any benefits to the job itself.

Would i be crazy if I considered leaving the government education job for this part time position? I was planning on supplementing the difference in income by working more shifts on the ambulance. But this puts me back to the higher risk of injury. I'm really torn as to what to do."

I am at top pay, so I won't be able to increase my salary further

The teaching credentials I obtained may end up expiring because I am unable to teach a course here. 

I feel underutilized and frustrated because I am nto allowed to teach

I would be earning a lot mroe working as a full time paramedic. but then there's the risk of injury and disability in my field is pretty crappy. 

Recently I was offered to interview for a part time position at a private university. Again it's a non-teaching position, but it's in a different role. The job entails dealing with clinical sites directly and monitoring students as they perform their field internship. There would be a lot of traveling during the work hours and i would be in contact with the higher ups and help make decisions on whether new clinical sites are needed and what student performances are. The job is going to be only 20 hours a week, and the pay is substantially less, but I'm willing to negotiate. They have not relayed if there are any benefits to the job itself.

Would i be crazy if I considered leaving the government education job for this part time position? I was planning on supplementing the difference in income by working more shifts on the ambulance. But this puts me back to the higher risk of injury. I'm really torn as to what to do.

7tubv7,447,2018-01-29,Hey Juniors! Here’s your very own Nitty Gritty List of Stuff You Should be Thinking About This Spring,admissionsmom,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7tubv7/hey_juniors_heres_your_very_own_nitty_gritty_list/,"So, Juniors, I don’t have to tell you that this is an intense year for you, and next year really doesn’t get much better. Each of these items on the list requires their own post really, and I will be posting and responding about them all in more detail throughout the spring, summer, and fall, but for now I’m gonna just write out as much as I can think of for you for this spring. 


TESTING
 
SAT and/or ACT -- take at least one of these this Spring if you haven’t already. Practice around with some tests and see which one feels more comfortable to you. Sometimes, super Mathy people will prefer the SAT and the wordy people will prefer ACT, but that’s just a little something to consider. Each test has its pros and cons and you really do have to go for the one that fits you best. I recommend that all my students be finished with testing before senior year.  Or at least have those last tests done by October.

*  The Next SAT test is March 10, with the deadline coming up on February 9. 

There is an ACT on February 10, but the deadline for registration has passed. The next one is on April 14.  Deadline to sign up is March 9.  

My thoughts: I don’t like to see kids spending all their time doing test prep, so I generally advise not to spend more than three Saturdays taking tests, but I know lots of kids will do far more than that, so you will have to figure out what works for you.  If you haven’t taken one of these tests yet, please, sign up and study and take it this spring. It will make your fall so much better

SAT Subject Tests -- Take at least two this summer if you haven’t taken any yet. If you know you are an all-STEM kinda kid, then go ahead and take just two STEM Subject Tests, but I’d rather see you take two STEM tests and one humanities test. Every year, kids come on to A2C and they haven’t even heard of subject tests.  While many colleges are now saying they are optional, the tests can only help you. If you are taking an AP class and will be prepping for the AP anyway, you should take these tests if you are at all considering applying to the most selective schools. They are offered in May and June. I recommend to my students that they do a variety of practice tests to see which ones they will do the best in.  

Here are some of my testing hints:

I’m a big believer in cramming for standardized testing.  Go to the subreddits, get books, go to Khan Academy and any other place and study every day for a few weeks before you take  the test.  If you can afford a class or a tutor, awesome. Do that, but if you can’t don’t despair. There is tons of info out there waiting for you to find it.

Eat fish 🐠 the night before your test (grilled or baked, not fried). It’s powerful brain food. I’m not kidding. 

Get at least 8 hours of 😴 sleep the night before your test. Don’t cram the last night. 

Do the SuperMan Pose the morning before the test.  It’s a real thing -- google it! Stand in front of the mirror with your feet apart, your hands on your hips, and your shoulders back.  Just stand there. Breathe. Feel your superpowers take over.  

If you have a new calculator, make sure it’s the right kind and program it the day before the test. Don’t wait until the morning! My son had to his Math 2 test without a calculator because he took a new unprogrammed calculator with him! He did much better the next time he took the test with a programmed calculator :)

Put your ID, test ticket, extra #2 pencils and extra batteries for your calculator all in a baggy the night before -- with some snacks and a bottle of water.

Take a sweater that you can take off if you get warm.  

Arrive 15 minutes early and make sure you know where you’re going.  


GRADES: Keep up your grades. I know you know this is the most important year for you as far as grades go. That said, an A- or B in a class isn’t going to kill your chances of going to college. In fact, there are hundreds of truly amazing colleges that are looking for B students. Just keep doing your work. Go to tutorials if you need tutorials.  Meet with your teachers after class.  Ask the smartest person in the class to tutor you if you need help. Watch Khan Academy and other Youtube videos if you’re struggling.  Don’t wait and get far behind.  Be proactive and start trying to bring up those grades now.  


SUMMER: What to do? What to do? This is an important summer for you, but there is no magical formula of what you need to or have to do to get into any colleges-- even the most highly selective ones.  Sure, you can research in a lab ( you get those positions by emailing any and every professor you know or who you can find doing research you’re interested in).  Or you can get an internship (you get those the same way as research).  Or you can do a program somewhere on a campus or around the world. Those are all great ways to spend your summer.  You can also do independent projects.  But, don’t forget the good old fashioned summer job.  You can actually stand out from the applicant crowd these days by making a smoothie, flipping a burger, or scooping ice cream. These kinds of job allow you to learn about taking care of others and listening to what the customer wants, learn about organizing your thoughts and activities, learn to work with others and gain some experiences you might never have the chance to gain again.  

Here’s what William Fitzsimmons, Dean of Harvard Admissions, says about summer: “Bring summer back. Summer need not be totally consumed by highly structured programs, such as summer schools, travel programs, or athletic camps. While such activities can be wonderful in many ways, they can also add to stress by assembling “super peers” who set nearly impossible standards. Activities in which one can develop at one’s own pace can be much more pleasant and helpful. An old-fashioned summer job that provides a contrast to the school year or allows students to meet others of differing backgrounds, ages, and life experiences is often invaluable in providing psychological downtime and a window on future possibilities. Students need ample free time to reflect, to recreate (i.e. to “re-create” themselves without the driving pressure to achieve as an influence), and to gather strength for the school year ahead.”  link is here: https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/preparing-college/should-i-take-time


ACTIVITIES: Keep in mind that your activities for your college applications are whatever you’re doing outside of class time and homework time. Start making a list of all the activities you have done since 9th grade. Your activities can be family responsibilities, a job, high school clubs, sports, theater, individual pursuits, independent projects, self study, internships, research, or community service, just to name a few. Remember Common App only has ten slots for activities. Don’t worry about having tons of activities and running around like you’re on a gerbil treadmill never able to get off. Also, don’t be overly concerned about having all your activities point in one direction. It’s ok for you to experiment with trying new things and experiences. I like to suggest thinking about being star-shaped instead of pointy or well-rounded. Also, you will want to keep in mind that schools look for leadership, and that doesn’t only mean captain or presidents of clubs. There are lots of ways to show leadership: you can be the elder sibling in your house who is in charge of making sure homework gets done or lunches get made, you can have a position of leadership in your job, you can volunteer to help with youth sports teams, or you can run a youth debate club, you can teach computer skills to retirees. 

Keep this in mind: Regardless of what you hear in the hyperbole of college admissions angst, you DO NOT have to cure cancer or run a foundation or found a non-profit or have a shiny internship or research position to go to college -- not even the most highly selective colleges.  Kids get in with a wide array of experiences. That’s what colleges want.  


LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION: Now’s the time to start thinking about which teachers you should approach for LORs.  I recommend asking one STEM teacher and one Humanities because many colleges request or require that. They both must be from Academic Subjects - think Math, Science, History, English, or Foreign Language. You don’t need to actually ask the teachers until after Spring Break, but it’s a good idea to think about it now.  You should ask them in person, but then follow up with an email with a LOR Cheat Sheet.

LOR  Cheat Sheet has your resume with your most important activities on it, and then it also has your answers to the following questions:

What was your favorite part of the class?

What was your most memorable activity or project

What part of the class did you find most difficult?

What did you learn that you will carry with you after class and why?

Be sure to write a thank you note to the teachers who say yes. 


ESSAYS/WRITING: I know you hear so much about the Terrifying College Essay…. But guess what?  It’s not! It’s just not.  Even the most timid of writers begin to like writing the college essay and experiencing the soul searching. My advice is a little different than most college essay coaches and counselors in that I don’t think you should start working on your essays too early.  I DO think you should practice writing. Here are my tips for getting ready to write killer college essays.

Write Every Day.  Even if it’s just a sentence or two.

Read and listen to essays on www.thisibelieve.org. These aren’t college essays, but there are hundreds of amazing personal essays about all sorts of subjects.  I like that they aren't college essays. 

Check out www.collegeessayguy.com, and start perusing his stuff.  His website is brimming with tips, hints, and suggestions about writing college essays.  

Practice just writing in your voice--like you’re writing to us here on reddit. Admissions counselors want to get to know you in your essays, not be impressed by you.  Your application with your shiny stats and activities is for impressing. Your essays are for expressing.  

Try to avoid reading college essays or “essays that got in.” There is no set formula or way to write these essays and when you read those then you get trapped in the “this is what a personal essay should look like” mindset. It’s not pretty, and it causes you great amounts of stress and, quite frankly, a lot of repetitive boring essays for the reader.  I can’t tell you how many essays I’ve now read that start with “The sweat dripped down my brow as I (tortured my way through the math exam, debate tournament, community service project, track meet…..” You pick).  I will be writing a lot more about what I feel like you need to do for a strong personal essays and supplements. 

READ READ READ -- like real books -- both fiction and self help style books can get you into the personal essay mode.  You can see my READ section down the list.  Also, read this book book “Bird by Bird” by Anne Lamott.  It will make you a better writer.  

Use this super cool app/website that some of the A2C kiddoes have taught me about-- www.the mostdangerouswritingapp.com

Start asking yourself some hard and kinda silly questions: 

You can practice answering these in the mostdangerouswritingapp!

I’ve had students write stunning essays just by answering these questions:

What do you think about when you wake up in the morning?

What do you worry about?

What’s your secret sauce?

What’s your superpower?

What’s the last thing you think about before you go to sleep?

Who are your role models and why?

What’s your favorite comfort food?

When you’re in your room at night, what do you look at?

What makes you smile?


COMMON APP and COALITION APP -- You might want to make an account (Keep your login info safe and handy!), just so you can explore.  No need to really get started on anything yet. You have plenty of time!


SCHOOL LIST AND FIT -- Now’s the time to start coming up with your preliminary lists. If you can visit colleges, that’s the best way to learn about them, but also you can lot on the internet, social media, and  by reading books

Reddit: A2C, colleges’ subreddits, and reverse chance mes.  

Colleges’ websites.  Sign up to receive more info and get on their mailing lists. (and you get to demonstrate interest!)

Colleges’ social media accounts. They are putting tons of info out there on instagram, twitter, facebook, snapchat, and some are even posting on tumblr and pinterest.  Clean up your account and use your real name and then you get brownie points for interest -- also super helpful to know more as you write your Why College essays!

Colleges’ newspapers and news feeds.  

Niche.com

“Colleges that Change Lives” by Loren Pope (book and website)

“College Match” by Steve Antonoff

“The Best 382 Colleges” by Princeton Review

“The FISKE Guide” by Edward Fiske

“Insider’s Guide to Colleges” by Yale Daily News Staff

“Where You Go is not Who You’ll Be” by Frank Bruni

As you read the books and research colleges think about these kinds of fit, and what you think will fit you.
	
Social -- What kind of social life are you looking for?  A quirky, creative kind of experience or  a more well-rounded stereotypical kind of college life?

Geographic -- What parts of the country interest you?  Do you need to be above or below a snow line?  Does cold dark weather affect you?  For many Southern and Western students, going to the Northeast or Midwest can be a shock to the system in the depths of February.  Think about that.  For many, it’s no big deal and getting a dose of seasons is exciting and fun.  Are you a mountains kinda person, or beaches, or cities, or small town, or rolling hills?  Do you want a college town? 

Size -- Do you want a small population or large?  Do you want large lecture classes where the professor might never know who you are or do you want small discussion based classes where it will definitely be noted if you don’t attend class?  

Intellectual/Academic/Creative Vibe -- What kinds of conversations do you want to hear around you?  Parties, football, and weekends?  Pursuits of philosophical depths of the mind?  Stressed out kids talking about how much work they have to do?  

Financial-- Do the net price calculators on the colleges websites.  If you can’t afford to attend a school, then it’s not a fit.  

SOMETHING TO CONSIDER…  Your Sure Fire Safety School -- Make sure you have at least one sure-fire safety school and a selection of other colleges with a variety of levels of selectivity.  A sure-fire safety school is a school where your stats, scores, and grades qualify you for automatic or direct admissions AND you would  like to go there AND they are a financial safety.  Any school that does holistic admissions is not a sure fire safety until you have been admitted. I like to see kids apply to a few schools with rolling admissions early on, so they can have that safety  out of the way. You must LOVE your safety.  Research it and imagine yourself there.   


READ BOOKS 📚 -- Seriously, reading is the best way to write well, write deeply, have good interviews, and be prepared to do your standardized testing. You should make yourself read every night or day. Even for just five minutes.  Reading good fiction and also self help books will help you learn to discover your voice.  Here’s a list of amazing books to read that I’ve just copied and pasted from my post to Seniors.  Some just for fun and others to help with stress, but all of these writers have a strong voice in their writing and you feel the person on the other side of the page. That’s an important skill to think about as you prepare to write your personal essays.

TAME THE ADMISSIONS STRESS MONSTER--(copied from my post to seniors because all this definitely applies to you…) Dealing with your stress as you go through this next year is key.  There will be times you feel overwhelmed, frustrated, angry, and sad.  So, how do you deal with it? What do you do? Besides post and comment on a2c??? :))

Be involved.  And be involved for you and what you want and like to do, not just to create a list for your apps. The kids who are the most disappointed and stressed out are the ones who feel like they’ve sacrificed their lives for their college apps.  

Get a job. This might be a good time to get a job and start saving money for the things you will need in school. An old fashioned job where you earn just a little, but learn a lot from the experience of taking care of customers or working with others who might never have the chance to work with is invaluable at this time. It also can help you with time management.  

Practice gratitude 🙏. Make a daily list of things you are thankful for. Even during all your stress, what is good? Are you happy for air conditioning or heating?  Are you grateful for ice cream? Or for that amazing teacher who sparked something in you. There’s nothing too small here, but when we stop and think about it, it can take away some of the anxiety and stress.

Be like Elsa and Let. It. Go.  --If Disney Cartoons aren’t your style, maybe this story about monkeys and coconuts 🥥 will resonate. Hunters attach a coconut to a tree, cut a hole in it, and place a banana 🍌 inside. A monkey 🐒 comes along and puts his hand through the hole and grabs the banana. The unfortunate thing is the hole is too small for his fist to get back through, so he is stuck sitting by that tree holding on to the banana. To be free, all he has to do is let go of the banana.

Horses 🐎 with flies. This is a silly one, but it can help! So, you know how horses make their skin quiver when a fly lands on them? That’s what you do here.  It’s a super quick tension reliever.  First shake your hands, then your arms, then your head, then your feet, and your legs, and your belly. Raise your hands up high over your head while shaking, and then quickly drop down and reach for your toes and come up. Make sure you make a silly noise when you drop down!  Then, feel how alive your body feels and pay attention to that smile on your face!

LEAN IN.  Lean in to your fear, frustration, anxiety, and stress.  Right now this is what it is, so tell it to come on in. Sometimes, just saying that makes it ok. Knowing that this is just what’s happening right now and it’s ok. It’s ok to be stressed and worried. It’s normal. Don’t try to run away or suppress it.  Lean in and face it and embrace it.  Think about it.  Assess it.  If something is making you afraid, that can often be an indicator that you’re doing the right thing! I know this drives some of you up the wall bat-shit crazy when we say it, but remember this experience really is so much about the journey and not the outcome.  And you will learn more about yourself from any perceived “failures” or disappointments than acceptances to a certain school. It’s true. It pisses you off when we say it, but it’s true.

Mindful Meditation.  Take three minutes every day and focus on your breathing. That’s all. No need to clear your brain. Just focus on your breathing.  Be mindful of what’s happening to you.  Is your mind wandering? Cool!  That means you’ve been successful with your mindful meditation because you discovered that your mind had wandered away from focusing on your breathing.  It’s no biggie.  Just come back to your breathing. This is such a simple practice, and so many people get caught up in the “I could never clear my brain. Or I can’t relax” part, but that’s not what it’s about. You don’t have to clear your brain or relax. There are no rules. Just focus on your breathing for three minutes. It’s that simple.

Move. Exercise. Go outside. Get Fresh Air ⛅️. Eat Healthy Food🍐🍎


SET SOME FAMILY LIMITS -- Make a No College Zone in your House or Time of Day.  Otherwise, your house and family will be consumed with talking about college admissions from dawn to dusk in every room in your house for the next year.  That’s not healthy for any of you.  In my house, our kitchen table was a NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE. That’s hard to do when you’ve got a mom who’s pretty obsessed with college admissions, but we worked at it.  


OTHER… If you are a low-income applicant, I want you to be aware of and explore these amazing programs and possible options, if you’re not already:

Questbridge Program: https://www.questbridge.org/ 

Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholarship Program: http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/

The Posse Foundation: https://www.possefoundation.org/


Juniors, you are in for the journey of your life. By this time next year, you will know far more about yourself than you ever thought possible.  Keep in mind that failure, disappointment, frustration, and feelings of being overwhelmed are all part of this journey -- just as much or maybe even more so as the excitement, anticipation, and dreaming.  Every stumble, and bump in the road will make you stronger. I’m looking forward to watching your transformations; you got this!

💙😊
~admissionsmom

Tldr; Juniors this is what you need to do this spring: read, write, prep for and take standardized tests, think about summer, ask recommenders, research colleges, keep up your grades, exercise, have fun, and breathe.  I mean, yeah, it’s a lot, but you can do it!

Now I've graduated and I'm left in the weird position that nobody is willing to give me a chance because of it. Ive had a few interviews that went well but in the end they went with someone who had more experience. I don't know what to do anymore I'm struggling to break into the field and it's depressing.

I graduated college a year and a half years ago with a degree in computer engineering. I went into a two-year internship with the church that I attended throughout my time at school to see if ministry would be a career path I wanted to consider. I think I've decided against that and want to start a career in software development. I have internship experience from when I was a student and my degree, but what are some things I should be doing now to get back into practice and be a competitive applicant? My internship goes until August, but I would like to start applying for jobs in the next few months. 

Thanks!"
7tv54i,11,2018-01-29,I am being underpaid for the work I am doing?,Superdupercudder,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/7tv54i/i_am_being_underpaid_for_the_work_i_am_doing/,"Hi all,

I wanted to bounce some thoughts I have been having about my current role. For context, I started my first ever gig out of school, little less than year ago where I was hired as a Junior Software Developer. As you might think, the role was going to involve your basic Java development on various projects across the team. 

However, because of my previous experience (as an intern) with Ansible, AWS, and Jenkins, one of the first tasks I was put on was making changes to the deployment framework we use to deploy our applications to AWS. Since then, I was absorbed into a ""Devops"" role for the team, where there once was none (or at least a full time one). In short, my responsibility have grown exponentially, since I've become their “CICD/Devops” lead across two time zones. Some examples of my responsibilities include:

* Sysadmin of Jenkins, Jenkins Build Machine, Legacy servers, cloud native servers, AWS admin

* Understanding and Managing of networking. Creating VPCs, Route tables, Nat Gateways/Instances, Security Groups, transit vpcs

* Understanding Docker and Dockerization of applications as part of the cloud native migration from legacy.

* AWS extensively (EC2, Lambda, ECS, S3, ELB, **elastic beanstalk**, RDS, DynamoDB, VPC, Route53, SNS, SQS, API Gateway, **Cloudformation**)

* Infrastructure as Code: Ansible for configuration and deployment, maintaining and writing Jenkinsfile/Jenkins Share Library, **Cloudformation**

* Improving our CI/CD pipeline (build infrastructure, static analysis, automated testing, developing new deployment frameworks )

* Knowledge Monitoring and logging tools, debugging them, automating their deployment, creating dashboard.
* Researching and implementing CI/CD best practice (Devop Handbook is my bible) and educating developers/operations who just like to ""throw it over the wall"".

* Contributing to the design of cloud native migration of legacy components (due to my knowledge of AWS)
* Production/Outage calls

* Managing cost of cloud infrastructure, my automation has saved us roughly $20000 a month. Providing visibility into spend. My current task is recommending how many RI's we should purchase across our 6 AWS accounts.

* Involving our operation guys more into our automation goals, rather than just have them be glorified monitors.

* Solving the problem of day in two time zones.

I can't tell whether I am complaining about work that is to be expected, or whether am I doing more than enough knowing my background. Don't get me wrong I love the principals of Devops, but I hate the title of *Devops Engineer* and don’t want to pigeon holed into this role. So feel like so many people claim the title but do way less than me and make more than me. I am stupid for doing all this work. I greatly appreciate the experience and exposure I have gotten to these tools and technologies. I was even able to **reinvent 2017**, which was a great time. But sometimes I think it is too much work for me, or I deserve more compensation, or I can get a higher paying job somewhere else. My fear is that my lack of experience (year wise), no real shop will consider me for a devops role. A lot of my knowledge is from hands-on work, watching youtube, reading reddit/blogs/books, and google. 

my salary is **65,000** in the New York City Metro Area for context. 

Sorry for the rant, and grammar mistakes. I know I probably sound whiny and entitled, but I want to make sure I’m not being screwed.  I appreciate your feedback and criticism.

Thanks!

7tv6xx,0,2018-01-29,What does it take to get an interview for an internship.,Mkerian10,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7tv6xx/what_does_it_take_to_get_an_interview_for_an/,"Hey guys, I had a question or two about getting an internship. Obviously once you get to the interview portion of it, a lot of that is based more upon how good you are during the interview rather than your resume or anything like that. But what I'm concerned about right now is getting myself into a position to hear back from these companies.

Ideally I'd like to shoot high, I'm currently a freshman and I'm hoping that next year I can land a solid internship, that way I can kinda propel myself into just about any job I'd like.

But something I haven't seen much here is what it sort of takes ona. resume in order to get that interview. Obviously the first thing I thought about is a solid GPA, however is GPA a cut-off most of the time or is the difference between a 3.6 and 3.9 negligible?

If I have the chance to TA one of the classes next semester would that be beneficial? I'd like to get a major project done this summer/spring so that I can have something to show, but I feel like getting an extra experience would help.

I just don't really see what seperates the people that are getting interviews at google, microsoft, or facebook from everyone else. Do they have a 4.0? Do they make some insane projects or anything like that? What can I do to get myself into the top 2 percentile of graduates?"
7tvvsx,1,2018-01-29,Data Analyst Internship?,prions,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7tvvsx/data_analyst_internship/,"I'm a MS CS student, and I've been offered a data analyst internship for this summer. I'm honestly not too thrilled about this prospect, since my primary focus is on software engineering. If I have to do this internship, how will the skills I gain help (or hurt) me in my full time job search after the summer?

My impression it that the position is more focused on analyzing and reporting, rather than a more data engineering oriented role. The core skills appear to be SQL, R/Python, ETL tools, data analysis, and reporting. I believe it also involved setting up databases, creating models, etc. 

My goals after my degree are to work as a software engineer - particularly in backend development. Will taking this internship benefit me at all? I don't want to have my skillset pigeonholed into data analysis, although I'm not opposed towards full time data science/engineering roles.

More of a quick question, for those of you with experience in the Data Science, Statistics, Statistical Learning, Data Mining, Machine Learning etc fields, are there certain companies that would be a better bet at getting an internship with as an undergraduate? Not talking business analyst type roles, but actually getting to utilize data science.

If the answer is ""there's no good answer"", is research a good replacement for internship work during undergraduate studies if the goal is to attend graduate studies for the same interest? Essentially, I'm getting to do a lot of really cool language processing and machine learning apps during summer research with my (rank 40) university, but I'm wondering if I should continue attacking the internship applications.

I'm more or less desperate for any entry level software jobs and as I am now going through some final interviews for software positions, I am beginning to wonder whether it is possible to negotiate entry jobs with 0 experience + 0 competing offers.

I'm afraid that if I try to negotiate, I will get potential offers rescinded and as I don't really have any backups in the entry software field, I don't wish for such to occur.


I hear from others though that ""you should always negotiate"" but at the same time, I hear ""I got my offer rescinded because I tried negotiating"". I would be happy to get an extra $5~10k starting as it seems some of the companies I am doing the final interviews start around $90~95k (which I am already very happy with but would like to have that extra bump if possible). It seems most 'negotiating' reddit posts are ""I have this XXX experience I can bring to the table"" but as I have none, if I were to get an offer, should I just accept or is it worth still trying to negotiate a bit regardless?"

My company experienced downsizing about a month ago (almost half of engineering got laid off). Fortunately I was not affected, but I'm in a situation where I'm obviously unsure of my job security. I'm still a relatively new graduate (graduated with a B.S. in Comp Sci May 2017) and have been thinking of starting to apply to other positions. The main factor behind doing so is the job security, but I also believe I am being paid below market value or right at it as I'm earning $92K a year in the Bay Area. Any advice on whether it makes sense for me to start looking at other opportunities, and how to best do so if I'm still at my current job? I'm not planning on telling my manager or any colleagues at work about my plans and am planning on doing all of my job related stuff outside of work (don't want to risk company tracking my browsing history/others seeing my screen when walking by). Hopefully this makes sense, I'd definitely appreciate feedback from others who were in similar situations and what type of jobs I should be applying for. I figured I'd still apply for Software Engineer - New Grad positions mainly, but some of them restrict applicants to December 2017 - August 2018 graduates so I'm not sure I qualify :/. I don't have enough experience yet for most regular Software Engineer roles that I've seen (2 summer internships + 6 months at current job)."

  I am a junior in college . I am an anthropology major and so far have had two paid internships in the field. The first was close to my house and I made my schedule in a certain way where it wasn't an issue and I was only allowed 10/15 hours a week. 
.
Now, I have this other internship in the city closer to my campus and have had it for about a year now. It's a job researching and writing and I'm an assistant to my boss who gives me these assignments where I'm unfamiliar with the subject matter and I have to research and after that, write. 
.
I can do it, it's just now I have taken my class load down from five classes to three this semester to balance everything more. Also last semester when I was taking five classes I barely made it by and simply just strived to pass my classes. However my mental health was out of whack and I was constantly depressed and then would have anxiety and used heavy drinking on the weekends to cope with everything . ...
.
This semester I'm trying to be nicer to myself and not push myself to the edge of giving up on school altogether as I have already come this far. So like I said , I am taking three classes. 
. 
However , these classes are now heavily discussion based and require me to actually do the reading to get points in the class. And the readings are pretty heavy and not always digestible . Not to mention, I actually want to understand what the fuck I am learning in class and remember it to a certain extent. I think honestly my profs were nice to me and passed me to a certain extent because I kept in communication with them about everything but last semester a ton of my assignments were late or I was given an extension. 
.
I don't drive right now as school is plenty expensive on its own without a car And I only get loans . So I take the bus and I have to be at the bus stop with the way my schedule is this semester at 6 am to get there by seven then take the bus from work at 11 to get to school by 12. However, I have no classes on Fridays so I can actually work a full shift, as I do on break. 
.
I'm seriously losing my shit right now cause although that works in theory in real life that's too much because of just having time to work out / sleep/ eat/ read / do homework takes a bit of time. I'm trying to take better care of myself this semester and the semester has just started and I'm already feeling myself get into this space that I really don't like. .
.
I just emailed my boss and asked if I can work remotely at school on my breaks between classes , and after school, then come into the office on Fridays to present my work and also to work one full shift then . This is really feasible because there's no real reason for me to have to be at work other than her seeing my physical body working. But with writing you have to be in a good headspace to write and when I have to commute in the early morning and feel like shit from reading at night and being sleep deprived I can't write; so my productivity at work is low. 
.
I work best around the afternoon when the gears have already been turning for a bit . And I am in a space where I can write....... Being in an office where people are gossiping and things or answering calls, etc. Is a hard environment for me to work in. 
.
If my boss doesn't take my proposal I'm not sure what to do . I like the job and it's a good job I'm not willing to just like lose my shit though to keep it. I live at home still and my parents support me for the greater extent of my needs except for when I have the money to help out ( books/ I buy my own food/ buss pass/ phone bill/ help with groceries for them / pay people I carpool with, etc) oorrr last semester I spent a lot of money on alcohol but now as I have been working out more and using that and yoga as an outlet and also lightening my load of classes ; I have lessened the drinking and now hardly do it at all unless it's a social thing and I find myself there .

These writings contain true accounts of the unusual and often highly-classified medical conditions experienced by astronauts during and after their space missions. Following the defunding of the clandestine medical program after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, the majority of these accounts were left, forgotten, on tape drives in a NASA storage facility. In 2016, a former intern, whose job was to clean out one of these facilities, discovered them. Two years later, he is ready to release what he found.

Thus far, the following report has been released: [A Dentist’s Discovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7ttlyc/the_secret_doctors_of_nasa_a_dentists_discovery/)

*Releaser’s Note: This report is an annotated interview with an American astronaut which took place in 1981. His name has been changed. The psychologist self-refers as “Interviewer.” The report was originally found at the location of the interviewer’s death.*

**A Psychologist’s Suicide**

*Interviewer’s Note: The patient is a 42 year-old astronaut. It has been two weeks since his last mission. Up until that point, he had been in perfect physical and mental health. During that recent mission, he spent 31 days in low-Earth orbit conducting various experiments pertaining to inorganic chemistry. His condition has not been determined to be the result of any of his work in orbit.*

Interviewer: Good morning, John. Do you know who I am?

John: I was told a psychologist would be visiting. Are you her?

Interviewer: I am. I’m Doctor ****** **********.

John: I’m happy to answer any questions you have for me, doctor. Maybe I can save us some time and tell you that I know you want to hear about my eyes. So let’s start there.

Interviewer: Thank you, John. And you’re right -- your eyes are at the top of my agenda. What happened? 

John: Can’t you see? I’d be shocked if it weren’t obvious.

Interviewer: I see you’ve turned them backwards, yes. I’ve seen the x-rays and imaging. You managed to avoid significant injury, which I think we can both agree is a great thing.

John: More than great. 

Interviewer: Why is that?

John: Because now I can see everything I’d missed. 

*Interviewer’s Note: John returned from space complaining of headaches and blurry vision. Examinations yielded nothing. His symptoms persisted. The pain grew unbearable and his vision diminished. John declared himself blind two days later. Further tests were inconclusive. Even if he were in perfect health, which the tests showed, doctors believed he could not see. All specialists were at a loss.*

*Five days after John’s return from space, he mutilated himself. He dislodged his eyes and stretched the optic nerves enough to turn his eyes to face the inside of his head. Every doctor on staff was baffled by how John had managed to do this without severing the nerves and blood vessels.*

*All John’s complaints about headaches and blurry vision ceased. He has been in psychiatric care since then. No attempts have been made to fix the direction of his eyes.*

Interviewer: Can you explain what you mean by “see everything you’d missed?”

John: Ever since I was a kid, I looked up at the stars. They fascinated me. They called to me. I knew when I was four that someday I’d walk among them. The books I had said it would be possible in the future. That was all I needed. Lo and behold, I went to space for the first time when I was 36. It was beyond anything I could have expected.

Interviewer: But something was missing.

John: Yes. I’ve been to space twice since then. This last time, when I performed a space walk to fix something outside the shuttle, I discovered I was wrong to be excited. My dreams had been misplaced.

Interviewer: Can you elaborate on that, John?

John: I think so, yes. But I need you to trust me. Will you?

Interviewer: I’ll listen, John, and I will give you the benefit of the doubt. As for trust, we just met. I don’t think either of us have earned it from one another.

John: That’s very fair. And I appreciate your candor. I’ll elaborate for you.

Interviewer: Please.

John: The universe curves in on itself, doctor. I could look on and on and on, through the stars and galaxies and void, and if I could see everything - if my eyes were powerful enough to have an unbroken line of sight - you know what I’d see at the end of it?

Interviewer: Tell me.

John: I’d see the back of my own head. No matter where I looked, that’s all I could ever see. All our exploration - all we might find - all terminates right there. We watch ourselves watching ourselves for eternity.

Interviewer: I have to admit, John, that’s a pretty interesting theory. Did you come up with it while you were in space? Or did you get the idea at another time in your life?

John: No. No, I didn’t think of it myself. It was whispered to me during my last space walk.

Interviewer: Whispered? By whom?

*Interviewer’s Note: I should remark here that I noticed the first change in John’s physical appearance after asking that question. The blood vessels in his eyes swelled and his optic nerves pulsated. He gave no indication that anything was wrong, however, and I believed it was appropriate to continue our interview.*

John: The universe sent me an emissary. She wanted me to know the truth.

Interviewer: Are you referring to an alien intelligence? Were you able to determine whether it was one of the species we’ve already encountered?

John: I don’t think so, no.

Interviewer: Was it something new?

John: No. Not new at all. I believe it was the universe herself.

Interviewer: Can you tell me what it said? The universe?

*Interviewer’s Note: John was silent for a stretch of nearly four minutes. I did not disturb him. He appeared in deep thought, though given the condition of his eyes, it was difficult to say for sure.*

John: The whisper said, “Suiversal vastation.”

Interviewer: Suiversal? My latin is a little rusty, John. Is it like “the universe of the self?” I know “vastation” but I’m unclear on how those words connect.

John: Suiversal vastation. And the whisper showed me. It was just a glimpse. Just a peek. But that was all I needed. It was when the headaches started and my vision started to go. My mind had been rewired to the new way of seeing. Turning my eyes to face it was the necessary step.

Interviewer: Can you see, John? 

John: I can. I do.

Interviewer: What can you see?

John: I see the purifying of the chaos that had been inside me. In its place is the real universe; the universe I’d been wanting to see since I was a child. And it’s where the answers are. Every last one. You mentioned the aliens, doctor? The ones who stare through space, just like us? It’s a terrible anthropomorphism. They are not like us. They stare, yes, but with purpose - although one they don’t yet know. What they want to see is what I’m looking at right now. The echoes of human thought. The cycles of dominating our volition onto nature, rather than nature being raped into us. We are the only ones who can do that, doctor. And the aliens know it. And they’ll find us. 

Interviewer: I just don’t understand, John. The aliens want our control over nature? Is that what you’re telling me?

John: It would be easier if I just showed you.

*Releaser’s Note: I was able to piece together the subsequent events using the abandoned log entries from NASA security personnel and medical officials. I cannot guarantee that all the information was logged and there may be gaps in the timeline. Below are the relevant excerpts:*

**Security report:** The astronaut held out his right index finger. It began to elongate. I, as well as *** ***** rushed to intervene, but the psychologist waved us away claiming “I want to see.”

The finger grew to approximately five feet long, spanning the table where the astronaut and doctor were conducting their interview. The finger pressed against doctor’s left eye. She made a sound that suggested pain and *** ***** started toward the astronaut again. “Do NOT interfere,” the doctor ordered. I demanded *** ***** to stay back.

For a moment, the finger did nothing but press on the psychologist’s eye. Then it moved lower and slipped under the eyelid. The eye became dislodged and fell against the doctor’s cheek. *** ***** and I watched as the finger appeared to grow longer and pushed into the doctor’s head.

There was a space of ten minutes when no one spoke. Both the doctor and astronaut were motionless, aside from the eyes of the astronaut swelling and pulsating. After those ten minutes, he withdrew his finger. I must remark that there was blood on about eighteen inches of it. 

The doctor made one articulation, which sounded to us like, “oh.” She then spent two or three minutes resituating her eye. She got up and left. I had *** ***** follow her back to her apartment, but she did not allow him entry.

End of report.

**Medical report:** Doctor ****** ********** was found deceased in her apartment by a security officer. According to his notes, it had been three hours since he had been turned away at the door of her apartment following an incident with astronaut ** ****. The second visit had been for the purpose of checking her wellbeing after phone calls went unanswered.

Emergency officials deemed her death a suicide, but parallels between her condition and that of the astronaut cannot be overlooked. Her left eye, which had been involved in the interview, had been turned to face the inside of her head. Her right eye, however, had been torn out.

Written in blood on the dining room wall, presumably with the excised right eye, were the following words:

“Fixating and turning in mass direction. Now they know why they look.”

I'm ending my college career and it's time to start applying for internships and I have a resume and personal statement that I would like you guys to look at if you can. Any corrections or notes are very appreciated and I think you for doing so as well. Also I went in and removed any personal information about myself and the company I will be applying for, so if it seems like there is a proper noun missing in a few spots that's why. Final little note, the personal statement has to be under 200 words as well.


First, here's my personal statement:


I am interested in an internship with Information Systems at so that I may understand how a professional animation studio selects, installs, and maintains the technology needed to create their films. As a Lab Monitor in the Animation Department I gained experience building computers while also maintaining and troubleshooting an array of artist machines, tools, and software. I would like to gain a deeper understanding of computer systems and the decision-making behind choices that affect the machines campus-wide as well as individual machines as well as to go beyond just plugging in cables. I am eager to learn how individual hardware can compliment different software and tasks as well. To go with that I would like to use my customer service skills in an entirely new setting, working with and understanding the expectations of artists and what they need for their setups. Finally I would like to work with people from diverse backgrounds and experience being part of a team that supports world-class filmmaking because I believe I can be a strong aid to the team.

Here is my cover letter:


I am a student graduating in the spring of 2018 with a Bfa in Animation and I would like to be considered for your Monitor Calibration internship for the summer of 2018. I have studied many different artistic and technical aspects of not only CG filmmaking, but art and design as a whole. In addition to that I also have two years of work experience in a fast-moving and creative environment supporting artists, system administrators, and general users with day to day work. I have a strong work-ethic and I am eager to contribute knowledge, support the team, and learn from a variety of artistic and technical individuals in the best filmmaking studio in the world. 

I have two years of experience working in the Animation Lab as a Support Monitor. While in this position I gained numerous technical skills, troubleshooting skills, and interpersonal skills that allowed me to work well and communicate with peers and colleagues. An average day in my life includes helping artists troubleshoot errors, supporting the renderfarm administrator with the renderfarm, and being a facilitator to the department as a whole so it can run as smoothly as possible. I have experience calibrating displays and projects, setting up new workstations with multiple displays and peripheral needs, and helping people take full advantage of what we have here at.

I am diligent, communicative, and strive to deliver my work in a timely manner at the highest caliber possible. On top of that I learn fast and thrive on challenges, and can adapt easily to new teams and environments, whether they are artistic or technical in nature. I have the energy and enthusiasm of a new graduate, ready to share and learn. If you have an questions or concerns I am more than happy to answer them, and I am looking forward to hear from you.


Thank you guys again, I really appreciate it."

I am a fourth year student currently in my winter term. If I continue with my classes I can graduate essentially ""on time"" by taking my three final classes during the summer. This works perfectly with my housing as the lease ends in August. I could have an internship opportunity this summer though and have to make a decision quite soon. Obviously the internship option could be quite positive for finding a job after college and give you valuable knowledge to succeed at your first day on your job after college. If I was to take an internship, I would be here at my University finishing up those 3 classes in the fall and have to figure out living situation for next year, despite my college town not being the city I want to settle in. 

Pros of graduating next year:
A lot of my friends are graduating late
I would be applying for a job next winter when there are less applicants 
My GF is a year below me
Intern Experience
My parents are in Corvallis, so commuting if I have to for a term isn't bad, despite my friends wanting to live with me next year in Eugene.

Cons of graduating next year:
Housing for another year
Graduating in 4.5 yrs
I'll be forced into working in my college town or commuting if I can't get a sublease after I graduate.

I did an internship involving big data and then a full-time job working on C# desktop application development and a little ASP.NET development.  I got a new job working with an ERP cloud based system mostly developing automated tests using Selenium.  I am considering a career in Software Development in Test after this new job for the following reason.  

Coming from an engineering degree background I missed some courses in the traditional computer science curriculum.  I am not that bad with data structures and algorithms but my main thing at developing which I am terrible at, is developing applications.  I was so disheartened when first starting out, I didn't know what IIS was, how a web server really worked, didn't know anything about web.config files, what web services are, or application config files, or manifest files.  Didn't really know what .DLLS were.  I taught myself most of everything I could find via youtube and online resources.  

I taught myself some vanilla javascript, the basics of web architecture and how they work, REST APIs, design patterns, such as MVC, MVVM.  But I keep finding that other developers just seem to know this material innately and I always have to keep asking for help.  The job is super stressful also but when I changed to automated testing, it's a lot easier and a lot less stressful.  Do you think SDET would be the right direction for me to head in my career or should I try and stick to development?  Honestly, I do enjoy software development, but learning all the facets and ins and outs of application development in general is difficult for me.  Does it get easier?  Does it get any better?

I'm 26 years old.

I went to college and graduated with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering back in 2015.  While I was somewhat interested the subject matter, I never really had a ""passion"" for engineering; I never built anything, programmed anything, or worked on any projects in my spare time like so many other engineering students seemed to do.  My primary motivator was that everyone told me getting this degree would guarantee me not only a job, but a well-paying job right out of school.

Needless to say, it took me almost a year after graduating to finally land a 4-month internship that I hated, but it was my first job, so I thought nothing of it.  That led to a 6-month mechanical design job that I also hated, but again, could be a coincidence. 
I finally got a permanent job as a project engineer at a small company, but I slowly grew to hate that job too and ended up getting fired after 8 months.  

Now I'm searching again, but this time I'm having doubts as to whether I should keep pursuing engineering.  The whole application of engineering just doesn't appeal to me because it's really not about building cool things, but about getting x products out in x amount of time and solving other peoples' stupid problems when they complain, including your bosses who don't know jack about engineering themselves!

So I'm probably done with engineering, but the question is, what do I do now?  Because I legitimately have no idea what I want to do in life, and I'm worried that if I just jump into something, I'll get fired again because I'll just do the bare minimum and not ""go the extra mile.""

I know work is not supposed to be fun, but how do I find a job whose negative aspects I can handle mentally?  How do I find my so-called ""passion?"""

The High Performance Computing (HPC) community here at the University of Illinois is looking to assemble a team of undergraduate students that will design, build, maintain, and utilize a high performance compute cluster to compete in the Supercomputing Conference's (SC) Student Cluster Competition (SCC) in the Fall 2018 semester. SC has been the premier HPC conference since 1988 and features the presence of the world's leading industry and academic organizations in supercomputing. The Student Cluster Competition itself is a high-profile, nonstop 48 hour competition where various teams from around the world build custom cluster computers and compete with each other to obtain the fastest benchmarking scores.

The Illinois team is sponsored by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and the Parallel Computing Institute (PCI) at Illinois. If the team is accepted to the competition, students will travel to Dallas, Texas in November to compete in SCC. The team will be meeting through part of the current spring semester and throughout most or all of the summer and Fall semesters to plan and prepare for the competition.

Students who apply to the team are expected to be familiar with or interested in Linux system administration, parallel computing, and HPC architecture, and are also expected to invest 8 hours a week during the summer and fall semesters. Students will have the opportunity to apply for anywhere from 1-4 independent study hours through the ECE or CS department. There are also opportunities for summer internships and research experience for members of the team.

I've been offered a position where I would be constructing a CS/STEM department for a private school over this summer, and teaching it upon graduation. I'm currently a junior, so there would be a year in which someone else would pilot the program. 

The position would allow me to do what I love, which is teach, and coach basketball on the side. Although I'm a CS major, I've never really wanted to sit behind a desk coding all day. That said, my dream is to work in sports analytics for an NBA team and I feel as if taking this position would close that door.

I'm currently waiting on hearing from Under Armour and the OKC Thunder regarding my internship applications, and the timeline for the teaching position decision is two weeks from now.

I'm lost, and feel like I'm about to make a huge decision which will impact my life forever. Any words of advice about teaching CS, vs. working in industry would be greatly appreciated. It's not often you get an offer to be a head of department out of college.. I just want to make the right decision. Thanks."

As a background, I go to a top 10 CS school in the US and currently a sophomore. I came to the university as an undecided major, and I decided to become a CS major last summer after taking a couple of introductory cs course in my freshman year. Last fall, I did not have anything on my resume that is related to CS stuff except for one computer club I joined in the early fall. I did not have side projects, work experiences, CS-related activities to show for, alongside a gpa of 3.21. Also, even if I somehow make it into the interview stage, I thought I wouldn't be able to handle interview questions with just two introductory CS courses I took in my freshman year. Thus, I did not actively seek out internships last fall because I thought I wasn't ready. I regret slacking off during the summer and last fall. I should have built some side projects and solved leetcode problems at that time. 
So it's almost februrary right now. I know that a lot of companies finished recruiting college students for internships but there are still spots. My plan until the fall semester of my junior year right now is to work as a research assistant over the summer, puff up my resume with side projects, join some CS clubs, contribute to open source code, and study hard for leetcode and hackrrank problems. After all that, I will start applying for internships at the start of my junior year.      
So my question is, should I still apply for internships right now even though my resume is empty and I am not ready for interviews?
Is not getting an internship summer after sophomore year really hurt my chance of getting one summer after junior year?

Thank you so much. I am sorry about my grammar errors as English is not my first language.

I had to do two 1 hour interviews along with a 3 hour programming assignment on top of the normal application and cover letter, and I already have homework and research to do for school. I was rejected on the grounds that I took too long to solve the algorithm in the final interview (even though it took me 55 of the 60 minutes). It was a dumb-ass 101 level algorithm that any sophomore could solve for homework, and if you've already got a BS in computer science you fucking obviously know basic java.

I'm worried about taking 3+ high level CS classes a semester so I want to become a part time student, take 2 CS classes a semester, work hard and get all As.

I got a 3 on the AP Human Geography Exam. My superscore for the ACT is a 28 (no essay). As you can probably guess, I suck at standardized tests.

Academic stuff:

Class rank: 107/433
Weighted GPA: 3.89
Unweighted Numerical GPA: 88.6%
HOPE GPA: 3.47

Current courses I'm taking: Calc III, DiffEq, and Principles of Physics II (Dual Enrollment)

I've taken 16 Dual Enrollment (DE) courses since junior year at my local university, not including the ones I'm taking now (they're not a community college, so the credits transfer anywhere in Georgia):

-English 1101 (B)
-English 1102 (A)
-U.S. History I (C)
-U.S. History II (B)
-American Government (B)
-American Literature (A)
-Precalculus (B)
-Calc I (A)
-Calc II (A, really proud of myself for this one)
-Principles of Physics I (B)
-Stats (C, awful professor)
-Microeconomics (A)
-Environmental Science (A)

The other DE courses I took were electives, so I didn't list them.

EC's:

I was in the Student Leadership Program (SLP), sponsored by Gulfstream, for freshman and sophomore year. During that time, I won the Leadership Excellence Award.

I was in FBLA for sophomore year, where I designed my chapter's t-shirt and sold over $240 in chocolate bars. We never got to go to competition, which really sucked.

I became a math tutor last semester for my college, where I worked over 100 hours so far. I also got CRLA Level 1 certification.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I only applied for Georgia Tech so far, because I'm trying to see if I can get an engineering internship with Gulfstream for this summer. If it doesn't work out, then I want to transfer ASAP to another college for the summer. If I do get the internship, then I'll start in the fall.

For my Georgia Tech essay, I wrote about how math used to be my biggest weakness for my freshman and sophomore years of HS, and how the work ethic and quality of professors/peers helped me become proficient enough to help others become better at math.

What are my chances?

I went to college and got a four year degree in business administration and graduated with a 3.9 GPA. Up until graduation, the only job I had was working for my dad’s tree removal company in the summer. I tried to get an internship, but the one I tried was door to door selling and I was terrible at it lol. I’m super outgoing, but not the one to be aggressive with a sale, so I was let go after the one week trial period. I should have pursued internships harder in college, but I didn’t and that is my fault. I was very dedicated to my studies in college. I studied 40-60 hours a week, 7 days a week. I never partied, took a day off, etc. after graduation, I was lost. I continued to just work for my dad because I honestly believed I was too stupid to be able to highly perform at any other job (odd thinking as I’m clearly somewhat smart because I graduated with a 3.9). After a year, my mom just started applying for jobs for me. I wasn’t hearing many responses for 6 months, but then got hired by a grocery store as a store associate for 13 an hour in December. Even though it’s not a lot, it has significantly improved my confidence in my ability to highly perform at anything I do. It started off as a part time job, but they have already promoted me to full time and the district manager said “everyone speaks very highly of you.” However, of course I find a way to beat myself up. I look around and all the people I work with are young kids who haven’t graduated college yet, so it makes me feel way behind. In addition, I see all these kids who fucked off in college and partied all the time with these high paying jobs. This is very frustrating because I put all my effort into doing the best I could in college and not partying, so I feel like my hard work hasn’t paid off while everyone’s lack of hard work has. I’m overly competitive too and place way too much of my self-worth on my salary. I read that the average college graduate right out of college makes 50,000, so i feel worthless since I’m only making 30,000. It is weird I place my self-worth on money because I often preach to others that money doesn’t buy happiness anyway, it is very likely I will become a supervisor within 6 months and I’ll be making 18 an hour. A lot of people call off, don’t care about standards, milk the clock, but I show up ready to work as hard as I can and often stay longer everyday to provide additional help. People say I’m so energetic and POSITIVE lol. However, 18 dollars an hour is still below that 50,000 dollar threshold. Luckily, I was blessed with great parents who make a good amount of money. They let me live at home rent free, so I have no bills and can save all my money. I’m very frugal with my money and try to save as much as I can for future investments, retirement, to chase my dream, start my own business, etc. I already have 18,000 saved up. I can’t wait to be make supervisor, so I can give my mom 500 a month for my student loans. If I’m ever making 50,000 a year, I will gladly give her 1,000 a month and pay for the family vacations and stuff. I’m very grateful for my parents and want to start giving back to them because of the great life they have given me. After work, I still try to be productive for a few more hours. I force myself to read a “self improvement” book for an hour and then study a certain topic for an additional hour, then I go to the gym for about an hour toensure I’m physically healthy. I just feel like I’ve been pretty dedicated and hardworking, but see the kids who only cared about partying and getting girls in college succeeding more than me and it it infuriating. Will I make it in life? Any motivation will be appreciated. Also, I don’t want to work a regular job my whole life. My dream is to become a stand up comedian and I’m going to continue to save as
much  money as I can to possibly chase that dream in the near future. It just seems that my gift in life is making people laugh and nothing makes me happier. Every time the attention is on me, I find someway to make people laugh their asses off. Should I chase that dream? Passion over money right? Thanks for all the advice!"

I’m in a dark cloud of depression. Kids three years younger than me are getting internships in Silicon Valley. Everyone at my college in the CS lounges are in groups, huddled over code. I feel stupid and feel that I’m wasting my time by being here.


I can’t learn on my own. The ONLY thing I am good at is being in school, as the fear of getting bad grades forces me to study the material. My GPA is a 3.96. But from reading the posts here, companies don’t give a shit about GPA. 


I don’t know what to do at this point. All my free time is spent studying for physics and bio that I’m taking this semester so I have no time to self study. 


I don’t know whether I should take a semester off and learn frameworks on my own. I don’t know whether I should finish school first and then take some time off to learn frameworks on my own. I don’t know if I should just drop out of school altogether as I’m clearly not very good at what I’m studying.

Near Christmas, I texted her, if she wanted to go to a newly built mall and buy some presents, since she said she still had nothing for her family.
She declined the date, because she had to meet up with her professor for her thesis on that day, which was mandatory and I understand that.

Background: CS Major, no-name university, 3 internships under my belt, about to graduate. 

I've been presented with a job offer from IBM to work on their blockchain team (Not using hyperledger, using Go language). Job title would be Application Developer. 


The issue is I've been an intern for the past 8 months at Lockheed Martin (doing boring work in a team I wouldn't want to stay in) but have been able to build a network of coworkers. These connections have led to an offer for a data scientist position inside Lockheed Martin. Data team mentioned they use Machine Learning algorithms to forecast ordering of different parts for aircraft, pretty interesting. The issue is there isn't much software development in this role (not surprising since they deal with data all day). Mainly analyzing/cleaning data sets which I see is pretty common for data scientists. Mentioned they'd really like to develop a front-end for all of this data which I see myself being assigned to do. 


The reason I'm torn is because both positions are very interesting to me, but what do you think the landscape of these positions will look like in 5 years? Will blockchain technology not take off? Will I pigeon-hole myself by not doing much software development in the data science role? I have another offer potentially with another team at LM that does a lot more software development but it's more involved in the military, something I'm not a huge fan of morally. These are questions I would really appreciate any insight into. 

Category   |   IBM  |  Lockheed Martin
----------|------|----------------
Role   |   Application Developer  |  Data Scientist 
1-way Commute   |   45 mins  |  21 mins
Technologies Used   |   Go, SQL |  Python, R, Tableu, SQL, Oracle
Compensation | Upper 80s | Upper 80s

A big thing is commute time, at 1.5 hours round-trip for IBM it would be quite a toll on my car. I will be moving in a few months reducing this commute time down to just 25 mins each way. (IBM's new policy isn't a fan of working from home unfortunately). 

I have dreams of working for one of the Big 4 someday, after already having Lockheed on my resume (since I've been an intern) would it make more sense to do IBM? I feel like it carries more weight in the job market no matter how much reddit likes to bash it. Thanks in advance.

In November, I received an offer for a software engineering internship at a decently well known tech company for this summer in Boston. However, I am from NJ and my parents are concerned about the cost of living in the city for the summer (as I need to come up with a certain amount of money to contribute to paying for my tuition each semester). They think that I should renege on my offer (I already signed the hiring documents) and take an IT internship at a pharmaceutical company in NJ and live at home instead because it's all the same to them. I know that I can find a way to make things work financially in the city (picking up extra hours at my part time job ect.) How do I convince them that the SWE internship (I *already* have) is valuable experience for working in this field and a necessary component for my resume when I graduate next year and need to start applying for jobs?"
7udb8a,1,2018-01-31,Prestige of university vs. a university experience,thebenjohns,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7udb8a/prestige_of_university_vs_a_university_experience/,"Hi all, I wanted to talk about a pressing matter that has been on my mind for a while. Currently, I attend a satellite campus of a top, prestigious university in Canada (especially for cs). So far I seriously disliked most of my experience since the commute for me is terrible and residence is not much of an option (since the satellite campus is so small). 

My main issue is that right now I want to transfer to a uni where I can be able to experience a uni life instead of the drab version where I commute, go to class, and commute back home. The only problem is that being part of this university gives me the prestige/ name and has the potential to open myself to lot's of industry opportunities. 

That set aside, I have been trying to make the most of my experience here but to no avail. I can never come up to the enjoyment or fun that my peers have at other universities by living the res life and doing well in school. I can work hard, but here it's really tough, and it's hard to find much of a life especially with my commute (4 hours in total a day). There's no option for off or on campus residence since it is extremely small and only open to first years.

I wanted to ask this here since it has been a personal dream of mine to be an intern in Silicon Valley/ Bay Area companies. I feel as though if I were to transfer to a much less prestigious institution it would hinder my opportunities. Have companies in America heard of care for other universities apart from Waterloo and UofT? This includes Big N companies.

For those wondering, no it is not possible for me right now to transfer to other top uni such as Waterloo, or even the main campus of the school I attend (Toronto). 

I don't know what to do. Life seems unfair. Or maybe I just complain too much.

TL;DR - I hate my satellite uni campus (due to multiple factors) even tho it is extremely prestigious. I want to work in/for Silicon Valley/ Big N. 

Should I transfer to a different less prestigious uni for a real experience and do really well or stay and struggle and be depressed.

EDIT: I apologize if I was misleading but by 4 hour commute I meant 4 hours every day (2 one way). I bus most days but travelling by bus is usually a terrible experience (not on time etc.). Getting a vehicle right now isn't plausible. &gt; 90% of students on my campus either live really close or have access to cars. The others I feel do not care about an actual university experience."

7udwky,108,2018-01-31,Hella long rant about trying to get a new grad position.,sharCSstudent,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7udwky/hella_long_rant_about_trying_to_get_a_new_grad/,"I worked hard to be able to finish my CS degree a semester early (December 2017 rather than spring 2018). The plan was to accept a job offer, and to be able to travel this spring and start working around May with the rest of the 2018 grads. I don’t know if this will happen anymore, because I’ve been job hunting since September and am now sitting at home in late January with no offer in hand. 

**For 3.5 years dozens of people were like “omg you’re a girl studying computer science at a top 25 school?! You’re gonna have such an easy time finding a job!” But I’m not and I don’t really know why.** It can’t be my resume—because I am getting interviews. Right? 

I’ve done interviews at places like Snapchat, Khan Academy, Reddit, Youtube, Asana, IndieGogo, Uber, Yelp, and some smaller startups as well. I know the formula is “resume + interview performance”; but I’ve been getting better at technical interviews as I go along and every single time I’ve ever submitted a coding test I’ve passed onto the phone interview stage. Still, every time after I complete a second phone screen or the onsite round I get that unfortunate email. 

I feel like I keep being rejected for not having enough experience, though I’ve had internships and have some projects listed and online. I admit: I didn’t do side projects really, since my coursework was demanding so my big projects were for school (My projects however are fairly large and use common technologies like Java, React, ).
 And when interviewers ask questions about my internship at a well known tech company, I talk in detail about what I did but honestly my team was a shit show (manager handed me to another team, left the company halfway through) and basically didn’t give me shit to do (even though I asked for real projects). Not ideal but there’s nothing I can do about it now. I guess I’m not sure whether I should bullshit it to make it sound like I did more, or admit that my team sucked. 

I get it: I barely know anything (which makes sense, I’m a new grad). Now that I have time on my hands I’m trying to work on learning more web development, data science, and databases. **But everyone says they just want junior engineers to be quick learners and have problem solving skills. I feel like I demonstrate that and then they decide they actually want a new grad with 2 years of experience.**
I’m frustrated. Why did I spend so much money and time grinding through a BS degree that required like multi-var calc and linear algebra and 2 physics courses? Would I have been better off doing online courses and bootcamps and side projects for 3 years?  Is it really just my performance on Leetcode type questions that’s failing me? Or maybe they’re like “well she did okay on the interview but actually did nothing at her internship so it’s a no”?  Or am I only getting these interviews in the first place because they need to say they interviewed a certain number of girls? 

On the positive note: yes, I know I’m not in a bad position in life and I’m lucky to get the opportunity to be considered at these companies. I do have a growth mindset and know that I can/need to work hard to learn and improve and open more doors for myself. But it’s like, all these companies are telling me that I am **almost** good enough but not quite for them. And if I’m able to get onsites at places like Uber and Google, why am I not making it through interviews for less competitive companies?
**I don’t know what this rant will produce. I guess I’d love to hear any thoughts or advice or wisdom or related rants from people with similar experiences. I feel like I did what everyone said would set me up well and then they’re like “oh you got to the top of this hill? No you were supposed to be climbing that hill over there this whole time”.  And it fucking sucks.**

7udxhh,2,2018-01-31,Is it true that most jobs require travel?,silverkitten1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7udxhh/is_it_true_that_most_jobs_require_travel/,"Background info: just got married in November. Husband graduated in May with BS in Computer Science. Knows several programming languages and worked paid internship as Android developer.

My husband has been applying as a programmer. I know nothing about programming but I think he wants to work in ""C++"". Anyway, he's had a lot of interviews. They all go like this:

Advertisement has 0 mention of travel.

1st phone interview - no mention

2nd phone interview - no mention

3rd interview - surprise this job requires 40% to 50% travel

My husband was a little taken aback, and has declined several offers because of the 6+ month travel requirement. Today, his interviewer told him that all IT jobs require travel, and if he doesn't want to travel, he's in the wrong field.

I guess my question is, what now? Are they right? We just got married in November and haven't even had our honeymoon yet. We wanted to go house hunting too. Having him away for half a year when we're newlyweds scares me. Or is he looking at the wrong advertisements? Are there clue words we should be looking out for?

I want to do software engineering when I graduate. I would like to do this internship because of the city it is located in and the experience seems like it would be fun.

What is the perception of the ""technology analyst"" title at banks like Goldman, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, etc? Do the big silicon valley companies respect it as valuable experience? I'm worried that since the title isn't ""Software Engineer Intern"" and it is in the finance sector, a lot of recruiters will think it is not relevant experience. Where do they rank in terms of prestige?
