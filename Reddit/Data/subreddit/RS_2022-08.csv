wd2zdf,2,2022-07-31,I have a friend who's struggling mentally and is considering making bad choices,SummerMountains,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wd2zdf/i_have_a_friend_whos_struggling_mentally_and_is/,"My friend (21M) is feeling very depressed but is unwilling to admit that he has a problem. For the past 3 years (college), he has been unable to find a girlfriend or lose his virginity and that has been making him feel like he's ugly and unattractive and is destined to never find a partner. This summer he is working at an internship in another state, and has been unable to find any in-person connection or friendship there. I feel like this has been contributing to his depression and he's running out of ways to cope.

A couple weeks ago, while there, he had a moment of desperation and he fell for one of those Tinder blackmail scams where they videotape you masturbating to them. While luckily she (the scammer) hasn't yet posted or sent that video to anyone else, the fear has been killing him every day. Everything has really just gone to shit. He wanted to move back home near friends and work remotely but his employer didn't allow it since they want to give him a proper internship experience in person. Right now, he's alone, isolated, very depressed, and in denial.

He's unwilling to consider therapy because he's still trying to cling onto some form of self-esteem and pride (""I don't need therapy"" or ""It's not a big problem""). There's nothing I can do besides push him to do therapy whenever I get the chance, which obviously hasn't been working. I am reaching out to you guys right now because he's considering trying out cigarettes or weed in order to cope and feel relief. I don't think this is healthy and I don't want him to become addicted or dependent on this stuff (or worst-case scenario fall into the rabbit hole of harder drugs).

I won't get the chance to see him again in-person until early September at the earliest. What can I do *right now* to stop him from relying on unhealthy coping mechanisms, and how can I convince him to seek therapy? If you have any advice to make him feel better,"
wd3n18,0,2022-07-31,I enrolled a computer engineering university now what?,GaSkia,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wd3n18/i_enrolled_a_computer_engineering_university_now/,"As you read in the title I am a computer engineering student and my goal is to make it in the game industry.
I've tried to learn a little bit of unity from their website but I have still a lot of doubts about what I am doing. By this i mean that I don't know if unity is a good place to start since I'm aiming to get hired to AAA companies when I get my degree (or even sign for an internship during my student path). So my question is if there's something that is more important to learn rather learning to use a game engine with its API because most of AAA game studios use their own game engine (except for epic games I guess), 343 uses the slipspace engine, Ubisoft uses the cry engine etcetera."

I‚Äôm also in SOC and I know a lot of people, peers included, go after FAANG, unicorn companies etc. However, I found myself the happiest in my first internship at the startup and learnt the most there. I also received very good mentorship there. 

Currently interning in a big tech company and I feel like big tech doesn‚Äôt really appeal to me. I‚Äôve also had a few internships at these larger companies and I realise my personality suits smaller companies more. I don‚Äôt really care for the free meals, free stuff etc. I also don‚Äôt really spend a lot of money, don‚Äôt have expensive hobbies and $4k a month is sufficient. I just want to build software. 

I plan to return to the first startup. Would it be career suicide to do so?"

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.

wd5qwj,3,2022-07-31,I desperately need someone to help me.,Few-Classic-690,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wd5qwj/i_desperately_need_someone_to_help_me/,"I want to live, but feel so much pain that all I can think about is killing myself to make it go away.

Here is my story.

When I was a young girl, I was sexually abused by a man. He used me to film child porn, and would sometimes let other people have sex with me. For these times, he would always hold me in his lap or hold me down while the other men had sex with me. I don't know what happened to the pictures or videos or even what was filmed and what wasn't. I don't know if he was prostituting me or just letting other men use me for fun, so he didn't feel so bad about having sex with me himself. Regardless, I think about it all the time because I worry that people will see the videos and that everybody is watching them, because apparently, Im that worthless and fun to hurt.

Later, in my first semester of college, I was brutally raped by another guy who went to my school. He strangled me and hit me. This left me with lasting injuries that took years to fully heal. It caused me to get brain damage and a brain disease. I was a collegiate athlete and had to take multiple seasons off to heal, couldn't work, couldn't do internships, and barely passed my classes and failed one of them. I also tried to kill myself afterwards and ended up in the psych ward and sick from swallowing cleaning materials. It cost thousands in medical bills and lost income. 

The guy who raped me was an alt right nazi type, and even though I know he was lying I can't get what he said out of my head. He told me that all women were just fuck machines with no souls who were entirely worthless. Also said he liked when I tried to fight him off, because he was turned on by me not being able to. And when he raped me it was like he was proving that everything he said was true.

I battled really hard to get through what happened. And slowly i got back to myself. I received medical treatment and healed my brain injury and disease, which took more than a year. I got my grades up so that I could graduate. I worked from rock bottom to get back on the track/xc teams and actually placed second at the conference championship in my event. I graduated college a few months ago.

But when I graduated, I broke up with my boyfriend of 3.5 years. He was a good guy, but I felt like I wanted more and wasn't ready to get married just yet. I wanted to grow professionally first, and maybe travel. So I broke up with him, and hooked up with one of my best friends (it was a great experience) and then carted off to go back home for few months while I tried to find a different job and place to live, not with my boyfriend.

When I got home I downloaded a dating app. But when I went on a date with the guy from the app, he started raping me with no condom. So I offered him a blow job so he wouldn't get me pregnant, bc I wasn't on birth control. Then, after a few days, I told my doctors and got the copper iud as emergency contraception. At the clinic the cops were there and they tried to do a rape kit but I wouldn't let them. They tried to set me up with a therapist, but i couldn't have make any of the appointments during the work day, because of work. So I'm basically alone now in this.

I'm spiralling. I can't access professional help because its too expensive. I'm constantly reminded and paranoid about what happened when I was a girl. I'm professionally unprepared for the field I want to go into and am not a competitive job candidate. I suffer from nightmares and feelings of extreme worthlessness because Ive tried so hard to make my life better but I still get treated like I'm nothing. And I can't talk to my parents because theyve always blamed me for what happened to me. And even though my ex would help me, i refuse to reinsert myself in his life and cause him pain. And my friends would be so worried and upset. Ive told them what happened but I don't want to be a burden, which I know i am. I feel like im running out of energy. No matter what I do, everything goes to shit. Because I am shit. No matter how much I try to be anything different, I will always be nothing."

wd7wdb,2,2022-08-01,I'm scared,Stunning-Issue2763,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wd7wdb/im_scared/,"Hi, so I just graduated college and I had an amazing internship that paid really well and then I lost it. It's been a really hard summer. I've struggled with depression for a long time and the worst it ever got was a year ago. I had suicidal thoughts, I wouldn't go to sleep until 8 am, it was so hard to keep up with school. A year ago was the covid year so it was easy to never show up to class and still pass. The internship was a really good opportunity that I fucked up and I feel like I'm always fucking up. This summer, all the days blur together and it's hard to keep track of them, life doesn't feel real, and I just have this overwhelming feeling of wanting to disappear. I just don't want to do it anymore. I'm scared that I'm always going to be like this. I'm scared I'm always going to be sad. I'm scared that I'm always going to fuck up the good things and the good opportunities that come my way. I'm scared that I'm going to grow up to be really unhappy. 

There's so many things that have happened this summer. I got my heart broken bc it was getting too real and they weren't ready. And I miss him. I miss his voice, his laugh, I miss seeing the tiktoks that he'd send me everyday. I don't know. I just feel like disappearing and never coming back. I'm scared it's never going to get better for me. I'm scared I'm never going to like myself or that I'll always struggle with depression. I just needed to put this out there where nobody in my life would see."

I want to get into big tech for the experience not only for the money, I'm not looking for the pro's and con's to work in those companies.

I have 11 YoE and never worked for big tech (or big companies) before and have a 'uncommon' career-path :

No CS degree. Self taught 12 years ago.

\- 1st job  *: france 1.5 years in a small web company (worked mainly on a website generator with high traffic, PHP, Javascript frontend)*

*- france 2 years in a small startup (worked mainly on interactive browser video players, mainly with Javascript, worked on some backend with PHP, Symfony framework*

*- france 2.5 years as a freelancer, worked on a multiple SAAS (sometimes from scratch, sometimes features in complex ones, some clients names are big companies in France, used PHP Symfony and javascript, typescript, angular) a bit of java for an android app*

*- france 1.5 years as a lead software engineer small company but big clients (worked on a saas with php symfony, android app, api connectors, data pipelines, etc.)*

*- france 1 years as a freelancer for a huge saas and ionic mobile app, developed myself (famous client in france), hired interns to work with me, etc.*

*- Actual job : South east asia : 3 years senior then lead software engineer in a fast growing startup (tech department is 11 engineers) : huge saas, multi country, nodejs, nestjs, typescript, microservices, etc., I'm also manager of the team and work with the CTO all the time on the department strategy and processes.*  


I consider myself to have a good OOP, Design patterns skills, code architecture, system design, best practices, testing, i have also good soft skills, always worked closely with founders, product teams, etc. I'm super efficient and professional, never had any issues in my career with companies/clients/teams.  


I'm not afraid to spend multiple months to prepare for big tech interviews. I'm motivated!  
For the interviews, I would like to use Javascript because this is the language I know the best, BUT 80% of the job offers I see ask Java experience.

**Do you think my Resume will be able to pass the first screening?**

**Do you think my lack of Java experience (even if I'm really confident I can work and learn really fast based on my OOP experience) will be an issue ?**

**Should I focus to learn java a lot and if I got selected do the technical rounds with Java?**

Any big tech recruiters here who have an opinion? Or anyone who can help with some advices ?

*I know i can just try to apply and see the result, but I don't want to do it until I'm ready, and asking advices first is part of it :)*   


Thanks!"

So a recruiter with a private equity firm reached out to me on LinkedIn and I‚Äôve started the interview process.

First step is hacker rank and then a live code interview.

I‚Äôm not overly worried about the hacker rank, I‚Äôm decent with Python and can work through most problems.

But, I‚Äôve never done a technical interview. Got a return offer from an internship that had a low-ish barrier to get in, so I‚Äôve never needed to do one since. 

I‚Äôm currently a senior data analyst - who does machine learning from time to time (is that a data scientist?) 2YOE. 

What do you recommend for interview prep? Do these firms only care about ML or does my analytics/automation/RShiny experience make a difference?

What does pay look like in the industry - what should is ask for if I get that far?"

Last fall I landed my first software engineering internship. And on the contract / job application it states that interns will complete five modules within the duration of one year. I am now on my last module and my manager is barely giving me any work to help speed up the process .She keeps telling me  that I don‚Äôt need to finish the entire module within one year because she can extend my internship duration until the end of the fall semester . The problem with this is I don‚Äôt want to keep interning at this company but I don‚Äôt know how to tell her that I am not planning on interning during the fall without her freaking out. Because she keeps mentioning that it is part of her work initiative to have all of the interns complete all 5 modules before leaving the company and if she doesn‚Äôt achieve her goal she won‚Äôt get a rise. 

FYI: The fall semester starts early September and I am still at the beginning of my 5th module and on top of that I will need to present what I‚Äôve been working on all year."

I‚Äôm an engineering intern at a fairly large company and lately I‚Äôve found myself slipping into depression which has been negatively affecting my work and productivity. None of my superiors have mentioned that they‚Äôve noticed a change in my work, but I was wondering if it‚Äôs better to ‚Äúconfess‚Äù the loss of productivity before they say anything. I‚Äôve developed a very good relationship with my superiors during my time at the company, but I‚Äôm worried that my loss of focus and struggle with mental health will ruin the relationship. This is my first job in the field, and I‚Äôm very worried about ruining any connections I‚Äôve made at the start of my career.
So what do you think? Is it better to broach the topic before anyone says anything? Or just to leave well enough alone and work on myself?"

As title suggest there's (i think somehow) important decision for me to make. I'm turning 20 in few days and going to a extramural studies in 2 months (idk if this is correct translation so just to clarify: it's regular college but I would go there only twice a month during weekends so I can also work. I will get degree etc.). Because of summer and lots of free time I also took helpdesk internship to make some money, gain experience and expand my CV but it ends with this month. I have to admit that reading this sub and some other pages got me thinking about all of it and it got me worried a bit about my future because how will networks and hardware help me with CS career? Wouldn't it be almost worthless for companies? I didn't have any CS internship before but I've been learning Python and C++ in my free time since beginning of high school so it's not like I don't know anything at all. So here's my question:

Should I try to get hired at helpdesk for at least a year so I will have safe source of income to pay for my college and also actively look for other opportunities or risk it and try to get CS internship that will pay me enough for college but also let me save some money and try to stay in this company?

I'm still living with my parents but I want to become somehow independent."

So I am a Mechatronics Engineer fresh grad.

I am still stuck in my mind couldn't find what my passion is in yet I had done many projects in Uni like self driving car ,hand mimic robot using image processing etc, but couldn't find any opportunity in mechtronics in my country (most the available opportunities  are embedded system and the demand is not big and so competitive plus I had done an internship in car maintenance and don't think its the right place for me )although I like it I am thinking to switch to software for example back-end or to learn machine learning need advice , Beside all of this I am dreaming of starting my own startup or a small business so I want to learn or work something that might give me experience in the future when I start my own thing I kept looking for any online internships in mechatronics but found none as i live in Egypt so I am so open to listen for your advice.

Sorry for this long text but I had spent some time in this page and had seen how usefull the community is and I think I might find some help here 

Thanks in advance"

I've only been involved in Computer Science for 2 years (started undergrad majoring in fine arts), and most of that time was spent learning to build supercomputers. 

This summer, after I graduated with an interdisciplinary degree, I interned with an HPC center at a large company, and they cut my internship short to hire me on full-time as a sysadmin with a 6-figure salary.

I feel immensely lucky, but also proud that my hard work has paid off. And I wouldn't be here without great mentorship along the way. 

 I'd love to answer any questions y'all might have about changing career paths, the HPC job market (niche but HOT), or anything else. :)"

Among other things, I got asked to do a simple task that required some data structures knowledge (part of their training), spent like 45 minutes on it, and still did not manage to solve it. I feel kinda dumb since I am almost a CS graduate and I got stuck solving a string manipulation question. How do you bounce back from this sucky feeling? And is it normal to feel insecure about your skills? How to cope with that??"

I don't have anything I need to do, I just finished up a summer semester of school(trying to get ahead), and I'll be continuing next month. As of right now, I don't have much.

However, chances are I will not be eligible for a COOP program at my school, because my GPA will not meet the requirements. My GPA will be around maybe a 3.0/4.0. It was the math courses that made my GPA low, I did well in the programming courses. The problem was that they were all introduction courses, so they are nothing special. One of the reasons I did pretty well was because I have a tiny bit of experience with Leetcode.

My question is, what can I do this month to increase my chances of getting hired next summer as an intern? I know one month of preparation will not be enough(considering I need to get better at interviews/improve my resum√©). But I figured I could at least try to increase my chances as much as possible. I have no projects. I am willing to put in \~5 hours of studying/preparation a day.

I was thinking of the following:

\- Leetcode (But this is nothing without a solid resum√©)

\- Maybe take some Udemy courses?

\- I could try to go with an online free course, but would it be better to try and advance my current skills?

I am not too sure, any advice would be appreciated. I am not sure if I am thinking in the correct way. If it helps, I do have a PT job where I can use the money for resources, however, I have always noticed free alternatives always being offered, so I figured it was not wise to spend money.

Thanks for reading!"

wdhddi,58,2022-08-01,Dezamagit de internship,RdKgR,programare,https://www.reddit.com/r/programare/comments/wdhddi/dezamagit_de_internship/,"Salut.

Am prins un internship pe React la o companie mare pe perioada iulie-octombrie, dar simt ca nu am invatat si nu am contribuit cu nimic pana acum. Mi-am cunoscut colegii, am intrat in cateva call-uri, am primit acces pe codebase si cam atat‚Ä¶ in rest ei isi vad de treaba lor si eu continui sa aprofundez React si sa imi fac mici proiectele pentru a fi pregatit atunci cand (eventual) o sa fiu bagat pe proiect.

Din cate am inteles ei vor sa continuam din octombrie cu un contract pe perioada nedeterminata si atunci ar urma sa intru ‚Äúin paine‚Äù, dar mi se pare ciudat ca nu comunica nimeni cu mine si toti sunt ocupati cu task-urile lor. Mai mult decat atat, pe baza a ce ma vor evalua si vor decide daca sa imi ofere sau nu un post pe perioada nedeterminata, daca eu nu am facut nimic pana acum?

Asa este la toate internship-urile? Chiar vreau sa ma dezvolt si sa adun cat mai multe cunostinte si sa profit cat mai mult de oportunitatile mele. Nu ma ascund dupa deget, vreau sa invat si sa fiu util pentru echipa, dar deocamdata sunt in stand-by‚Ä¶

Orice sfat si/sau pareri sunt binevenite. Mulumesc!"
wdhvz0,5,2022-08-01,This may not be the right place but I feel like I'm going crazy,Front-Fig236,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wdhvz0/this_may_not_be_the_right_place_but_i_feel_like/,"I'm  f26 years old and I live with my   parents. I've struggled with my  mental health for the majority of my   life and didn't hold down a job  from 2019 to 2021, though I did try   several times. Throughout that  time my parents supported me financially.   I never asked for anything  extra so I didn't really have new things or   money to go out and do  things, but I always had a place to stay and  food  to eat. There were  definitely moments where my parents made it  clear I  was being a  burden, but for the most part, they were  supportive.

This   last year has  been a huge change in me and my parents even mention  that  suddenly I'm  laughing and smiling and I'm like a different  person. I  went to school  and got some certificates, and for the last 6  months I've  been  completing an internship. Soon I'll be interviewed  by the company  to  see if they want me to stay for a year long contract  and if I'm not   being modest, I'm really good at my job and I'm fairly  certain I'm first   pick out of all of the interns. There are 2 or 3  seats available so  I'm  confident I'll get one. The salary would be  about 50k before taxes.  I  intended to stay with my family for a little  while after this, maybe  6  months at the most, that way I could  finally contribute financially.  I  figured I would pay my portion of  rent and also contribute for  things  when I can, gas, groceries, things  for the house, etc. until I  could  move out and finally give my  parents some space.

Last   weekend  though, my mom took me and my brother aside. She told us that   my  stepdad had gotten very drunk the night before and threatened to  kill   himself because of the stress of taking care of our family all of  these   years. She asked us to give him a year where we would cover all    expenses so he could heal ""to save his life."" That would be 2k a month    in rent alone, each. She said this is the only way he would ever truly    heal, because if we didn't, he would always have it in his mind that  we   weren't willing to help him when he needed it. He would still be   working  but he would spend his money how he wants without having to   worry. He  has definitely been very depressed this past year.

I   really love my family and I really  want to help them. But I live in a   tiny makeshift bedroom that doesn't  even have a door. I'm turning 27   this year and I feel like I've never  actually been able to have a  life.  Now it's possible and I crave it so  bad. I crave independence,   relationships, intimacy, the agency to do  what I want when I want. The   ability to sit in a room in my own place  and do nothing, to clean my   own things, to invite friends over, to take  pride in my life. I want it   so bad. I've been working for it for so long  and it's just within   reach. The thought of spending another year in  this miserable room is   absolutely killing me inside.

I'm    completely overcome with guilt for feeling this way after my parents    supported me financially all of these years. I want to do what's right.    But lately I feel myself falling back into the depression and anxiety   that held me back for so  long. It's starting to affect my work and my   friendships. I'm fighting  it, hard. But I'm so conflicted. I confided  in  a couple of close  friends and they think my parents asking this of  me  is ridiculous,  especially the way they went about it. They aren't   parents though, and  they also didn't support their adult child for   several years. I can't  help but think, are the overwhelming feelings  I'm  having right now what  my stepdad has felt for all of these years?

I    don't really know what to do or what to think. I feel like I'm being    ripped apart and it's driving me crazy. One side of my really wants to    stay and help, and the other side of me wants nothing more than to    leave. Lately I feel terrified and get panic attacks. I'm completely    willing to own up to everything and do what's right and if that means a    year taking care of my family I understand. I can't believe I'm  posting   all of this on Reddit, but I don't know anyone to ask. I would  really appreciate an outside perspective. Sorry for the  novel."
wdirq8,0,2022-08-01,How normal is working past 5 and on weekends in this field?,Kaboolan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wdirq8/how_normal_is_working_past_5_and_on_weekends_in/,"I'm currently doing my 2nd internship at a large bank and I've noticed that many of my team members work past 5pm everyday as well as on some weekends when there are releases. My previous internship was at a smaller company and had a very balanced WLB. At my current internship, my team is small (5 people) and some have to work multiple weekends in a row. I didn't think much of this until I was checking my email this morning and was looking at the timestamps from some of the emails my teammates and manager had back and forth and they were well into night \~9pm-10pm on both Saturday and Sunday. 

During our day-to-day standups, our manager seems to encourage and promote this culture by giving praise to those who worked 'extra hard' over the weekend and during the week. As an intern, I do my 40 hours a week and I'm not really pressured into this team culture, but I know that I would not enjoy it as a full-time employee with these other expectations. With how normal this work culture seems, I wanted to ask is this common practice in the tech industry? If you've been in a similar situation, how have you navigated it to find a better-suited WLB? I was holding out on asking this because I've heard that culture can be very team dependent, but I've spoken to many other interns on other teams and they have had similar, if not worse experiences. I realize that I could probably coast by doing 40 hours a week as a full-time employee but it seems like it wouldn't amount to any promotions or career growth. 

 

TL;DR: Teammates work past 5pm on weekdays and up until 10pm on weekends for releases. This behavior is encouraged by my manager and seems like the common team culture here. Is this a good representation of the tech industry?"

In KCL I would be taking Business Administration and in RSM I would be taking International Business Administration. 

This decision has been extremely tough for me as both unis are very appealing to me, so I have created a quick pro and con list for both and would love if anyone on this thread had any feedback. 

KCL: 

pros- more internationally recognized, better rep. 

London is a bigger city with more networking opportunities 

Study abroad opportunity or year in industry. 

cons- very very expensive 

RSM: 

pros- the university is not thatttt well known (or so i've heard) but their business program is among the top 10 internationally. 

The campus has more of a campus feel than RSM 

SO much cheaper than KCL 

cons- i've heard that the classes are packed with 600 plus people and it's hard to get in touch with teachers 

Rotterdam is not as big and business oriented 

Would have to learn dutch for many internship opportunities (apparently)"

I'm lucky that I get to kick the can down the road with a comp chem PhD (not CS I know, but will involve a lot of scripting, and probably some algorithm development). Among my graduating peers, I'm seeing shittier outcomes for the same merit/skills/effort and it is just depressing me. Hence, a lot of my college peers are also choosing to hide away in grad schools.

My highly rigorous, 1 sample perspective of the situation (/s): 

Before 2019, my undergrad had enough namebrand and network for people to be landing DS jobs at very solid jobs right after graduation with bare minimum stats, linear algebra, and light programming skills. Now these same positions require PhD for pretty much every employer (while still paying the same lol). And independent of the hiring freezes in SWE, I've heard talk about salary cuts for new grads, while FAANG offers and internships increase in rarity. I think the best interpretation of this trend is that name brand clout is being diluted as employers realize that drifting through some HYPSM doesn't translate directly to talent or work ethic (as an HYPSM, I want to be on the record for saying this would be good if true). Alternatively, these trends are cyclical and it will all bounce back? Someone help me understand the free market of jobs; I'm scared."

At the time I was a bit unsure if I wanted a career in this field combined with the fact that I was burnt out I decided to work in the family business for a year then decide what I wanted to do afterwards. With a combination of Covid and my dad needing my help I stayed for a bit longer than I planned to. I don't want to work in the family business anymore and want to give honest try in getting a job in the field. I am just unsure where to get started.

I understand that it will take a lot of time and work and I am ready for that but I am just unsure what steps to take. I don't have any work experience or personal projects. During university I was only a CS major for about two years. I was first majoring in IT but I did not like it and switched to CS which I really did enjoy. The thing is I was so committed to graduating in time that I sort of rushed it. I was taking a lot of classes and had no real time for internships or personal projects. I was always taking the maximum amount of credits and worked part time as a programming teaching assistant. I did do well in my CS classes and graduated with a high GPA. 

The past few years I did not really have any extra motivation or time to work on projects or refine my skills. I was going through some shit and I have recently made some steps to improve my mental health.

So yeah I just wanted to see if I can get any advice as to the proper path I should take. I wanted to first refresh on concepts and then start working on a few personal projects and finally do some leetcode to prepare for technical interviews. 

Is there any recommendations on what books I should read to help refresh my knowledge but also to refine my skills? Any ideas on what kind of personal projects will look good on a resume? Also any idea on what lanagues would be best to work with? I mainly worked with java, python and some c but as I am starting new again I am willing to take on whatever languages are most suitable.


I appreciate you taking the time to read this. Thanks!"

I went to Spain for a foreign internship and there I was introduced to a roommate of one of my friends there. She is the most amazing, kind and wonderful girl I‚Äôve ever met. We went out a few times and really clicked, before she went back to Italy we sat at her house talking for hours and when I had to go she got emotional (so did I haha), the days following her leave I was sad and had some regrets about not being honest with her about my feelings.

I went back to the Netherlands and the last few weeks we have been talking more and more via whatsapp. I know it might sound cheesy but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her and every time I meet a girl I compare her to Mart (the girl that I met in Spain). 

The things that make it more difficult is that we both have different religions, live in different countries and have different goals in life.

What should I do, this December I‚Äôm going to Italy and meeting with her again and we both are really exited , should I be honest with her and tell her how I feel?
Or should I try to get over her and if so, how?"
wdl44s,1,2022-08-01,My (19F) best friend (20F) of 5 years broke off our friendship last year and I'm still not over it.,specialgarbageart,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wdl44s/my_19f_best_friend_20f_of_5_years_broke_off_our/,"**TL;DR: My (19F) best friend (20F) of 5 years broke off our friendship last year, after some arguments went little to no contact, reached out last month and she wants to completely drop me. Appreciate any help provided.**

**tw: abuse/selfharm/violence? long read, i'm sorry**

I (F19) am unsure how to start this, but I know I have to get it off my chest somehow. I am writing this because I'd like to know if I did something wrong, or if I'm misunderstanding things, or if the way I feel is justified (and if I'm not alone in feeling the way I do). Perhaps it's childish and immature, but I would still appreciate any feedback anyone is willing to provide.

I've never written one of these before, so I apologize for anything I miss out/do wrong, or if I wrote on the wrong r/, please let me know. (I'm terrified she'll be able to find this, hence the throwaway account).

My best friend (F20) of 5 years ""broke off"" our friendship last year in June, and I'm still not over it. I'm not going to lie and be ignorant to say that I was not partly to blame for this. Not that this matters, but perhaps it provides more information but I've never been in a proper long-term relationship romantically with anyone (up until this March).

Additionally, I have had best/good friends that have spanned over the course of childhood to now, but no one as close as I had been with her. She called me her platonic soulmate. I'll give you some context on our friendship, how it started, the issues we'd have, problems we'd go through, the text messages she'd sent me last year, and 4 weeks ago the last conversation we had.¬†

Let's call her Jane. I had met her in,,, I want to say freshman year-ish, around 7 or 8th grade? I sat next to her in Math, and we'd had started talking. Yeah, I was young (a year younger than the people in my grade), and the school we were in was pretty hush in terms of anything controversial I want to say. I had a friend group at the time, whom I was very close with, which had 4 other girls in it. I keep in relatively okay contact with them, as I'm in the states now (for college) and 2 of them are in Canada for college (the school was in the Middle East).¬†

One of them passed away from cancer 3 years ago, and one of them is in Japan. At the time, we were all pretty close but I didn't like feeling constricted to 1 friend group and enjoyed meeting new people (our school had new transfers from different countries every year or so), so I'd hang out with as many people as I could as I enjoyed getting to know various types of people.

And this girl clicked with me. Jane was incredibly open and trusting, and told me some of the darkest things that had happened to her. We spent a lot of time together, hanging out, and facetiming after school talking about whatever it is that 13?14?-year olds talk about. This lead to my primary friend group getting incredibly jealous, and they made me feel bad about wanting to meet new people or even hang out with Jane. I remember one of my good friends in that friend group confronted me several times to say that I was making them feel left out and replaced, and I was confused as it hadn't taken any time away from them? But back to Jane.¬†

I was pretty sheltered as a kid (up until 14), and she was the first person that I had known that was lesbian (I'm sorry if this is the incorrect term). At the time, she had identified as bi, but 3 years later she had identified as a lesbian. I didn't really know how to take that, or the fact that she had told me about getting m-worded as a child by a family friends dad. I was incredibly worried for her and I had never dealt with anything like that before.

A year later into our friendship, what had happened every so often was that whenever she felt incredibly upset she'd punch herself or harm herself in some way. And I had told her I don't want her to hurt herself or ever be in harms way. I remember the first couple of times I had told her I was upset with her for smoking at 15, she had told me that earlier in the day she had excused herself to go to the bathroom and punched herself. I don't remember how the hell I responded to that, because why would she tell me that? Why would she do that?¬†

I was worried for her and her telling me that made me feel bad for telling her that I was upset she was harming herself by smoking so often. She'd call me up sometimes in the middle of the night, to tell me that she self-harmed and some days would be better than others, and sometimes she'd be clean for 43 days and then the cycle renewed. I wanted her to feel safe, happy and loved. And she did get better, she stayed clean for a really lengthy amount of time, I believe it was 140 days?

I think a year and a half into our friendship, she confessed she had a crush on me, which made me really uncomfortable. I don't know why, but I really do not like it when people like me more than that. I feel as though I am not seen as a person? Or being taken advantage of (in terms of friendship wise), and that there never really was a friendship? (This is more so due to the past 4 years, where some of my guy? male friends think that my platonic friendships with them can be something more, I feel as though I was not being seen at the same level? as I saw them). I don't know how to explain it, I'm sorry, being LIKED like that (when I don't reciprocate it) it just makes me really uncomfortable. Does anyone else feel this?

I told her I wasn't comfortable with that, and she understood and I backed off for a while, and later she told me she didn't have feelings anymore and we got back to being best friends. Now, in the 10th grade, my dads job changed which meant we'd have to move to Canada and it wasn't confirmed up until a couple weeks before I had to leave school mid-year. I hadn't told any of my friends until a week or two before my flight. I think my parents told me not to tell anyone because it wasn't confirmed yet. I remember having a conversation with her where I told her I recalled her telling me she gets really fixated on one person.¬†

She had a childhood best friend who she saw as an older sister and was obsessed with her, but then also had feelings for her and those subsided and she no longer obsessed over her. I think her parents thought Janes childhood bestfriend was a bad influence, although I don't remember why. I told her, at 14, that she shouldn't have to depend on me so much, that she has to love herself before anyone else because at the end of the day that's all you have. I told her that I'll always be there for her, and she told she was scared I was going to leave her and I said no, regardless of wherever I'll be, I'll always be there for you. And I did mean it, I want to say I still do but it makes me upset and I'm conflicted.¬†

About a week later-ish I told her and my friends I was leaving in a week, and she was distraught. We all hung out a bit more than usual that week. But Jane and I made our friendship work, I wasn't as close to the others, and I was more than happy getting to talk to my best friend when I moved to a completely different country (Canada). I finished my last 2 years of high school there, I was put a year ahead (due to some circumstances) and graduated at 16. It was rough, I personally felt awful as it was a predominantly white tiny town and I'm a POC woman. Looking back on it, some of my teachers were most definitely racist and the microaggressions went undetected at the time.

My dads job was super stressful, which caused even more stress on our family dynamic and a ton of other family issues. My mental health was at an all time low, as I was in the same grade as my older brother which caused resentment within me (which is MUCH better, but still work to be done towards), as he was infinitely better than me (primarily academically). I always felt like I'd be the disappointment and while my brother didn't even need to try for school, I had to work hard to be able to catch up to him. We had both been taking IB classes (similar thing to AP), and I hadn't known half the things in some of my classes. I discussed repeating a year but my parents said it's okay.¬†

I vividly remember in my English class, my teacher saying that it felt like I had been here for years with the way I was making friends and getting well-adjusted. I feel like it's easier to make acquaintances than it is to make actually good, sustainable friends, and I think I felt the loneliest I had been. My last year at that high school was better, I actually did find a group of friends I felt good with but we've drifted apart. In those years, I had spent times figuring out when to facetime or message or snapchat Jane any time I could. And we made it work.

Around 2019ish, I was in the States for college and Jane was finishing up her last year of high school. I remember better times than other, but we'd gotten a little bit less communicative in 2019 September, but because of COVID and my parents moving again (because of my dads job) to the States, we started talking more because I was away from campus and all the friends I made there. Around 2020-ish, we had started getting in an argument or two (we rarely ever did), and it was because I didn't want to constantly be on my phone as I had school and a job, and the time I found in between that was helping out my parents either around the house (which was rented at the time), or coworkers I became friends with.¬†

I didn't like the way she'd phrase our friendship whenever she'd talk about US, I'm unsure how to explain it but she'd basically imply it was a relationship. I had a problem with her wanting to know EVERYTHING I did EVERYDAY, I have no problem doing/telling that to my boyfriend right now. I felt like I was being suffocated, and I explained that to her and she took it the wrong way and was upset with me for a bit. Fast forward to her first year of college, and my second year. It's a bit rocky as she just moved to the States from the Middle East and it was in the middle of COVID too, so it was harder to make friends as her dorms wouldn't allow people to leave to meet each other.¬†

So I invited her to a discord server consisting of my college friends and online friends, who I played video games with. She was really happy about it and meshed pretty well with them, and they all made her feel incredibly welcomed. There was one incident where I was in a call with a friend and she was in it as well, and in the heat of the moment I had raised my voice at her, resulting in her getting upset. I apologized, and I was embarrassed as we've never raised our voices at her, and I get pretty competitive in sports/video games, etc.

At this point in time, I believe this is 2021, February ish. She had been started to pile some situations that had been going on with her, and I was trying to be patient and a good friend and I wanted to make sure she felt like she was being heard and understood. I shouldn't have said it was okay, but after 4 years of conflict on whether I was okay with the emotional exhaustion of hearing about her self-harming, or some sort of situation that was negative for her every other day. I felt like I had a social battery and it felt like it was being sucked up dry so quick every day. She'd tell me she was drinking on a facetime call (I don't drink), and told me I don't talk to her anymore, and she'd constantly complain how I don't open up to her, how I'm a best friend yet I don't TELL her anything.

I don't know, it's hard for me. She told me it's been days that she hadn't properly heard from me, and that she explained she's been naggy because I won't ""tell her anything"". I wasn't sure how to respond to that, and I definitely was very angry but it's on me, I think that entire conversation I should've handled better because at least I'd still have my best friend. I'm going to wrap this up real quick, because I just noticed how long this entire post has been, my apologies.

She had met a girl on tinder and they started hooking up immediately, and she told me one too many details. I felt kind of uncomfortable with the amount of detail she'd go into, and what they'd been up to, but regardless I was incredibly happy for her. We had drifted apart for a bit, and I remember her trying to set up a facetime call for us to meet; her bestfriend and her girlfriend meeting. It was awkward. I personally can be extroverted with the right people (who isn't?), and pretty shy too, but this girl was giving me nothing to work with. It felt like an interview rather than a conversation, with me asking questions and her giving one worded responses.

I absolutely understood she was in a relationship, and a partner should be a best friend, and I backed off. This was also the time I had met my boyfriend and we'd hit it off, and I spent majority of my time either doing schoolwork (online courses)/ going to work/ spending time with my family (at this time I'm still away from campus)/ or hanging out with my boyfriend. Last year in June, she sent me a massive paragraph basically saying she thought that I did not value her as much as she did, that she thought I never felt the need to reciprocate that, that we can't have different ways of showing affection, how nearly everything I did was not enough for her.¬†

If I don't update her about my life, she felt neglected even if it was suffocating for me. I made time for her, she made time for me. She said we have different priorities, and placed this emphasis on ""best"" in best friends, and always described our friendship as something more. My friends from my old high school would tell me how she'd always talk about me somehow, at the time it was endearing but it was kind of weird to think now. I'm not dead, but I'm not physically there and I doubt anyone would want to hear about someone else who's not even in the country all the time. She placed pressure and too many expectations, with the warnings I gave her, that it was difficult for me to reciprocate as she had. I was moving again, I was just starting my internship, and I had several other family issues at the time.¬†

I told her conversations with her had lately started feeling taxing, that it made me feel like crap because I felt she deserved better and I wasn't good enough. I told her I'm so grateful we've met, and I'm so happy that she's in a loving, healthy relationship, that she's made new friends at college, and she's doing great. I told her things like this paragraph is important, why over a text? Call me. I would much rather communicate that way. I still don't know what went wrong, I told her, I said maybe it was the gradual decrease in talking or that one argument over the video game, or the boundaries I set over being uncomfortable with how she described our friendship. I told her it's her choice if we talk again or not, I'll respect it either way, and that I wish nothing but the best for her, and that I'd be okay with whatever she wants; to cut me off, or keep me.

So, really the only reason why I'm writing this is because for the 8 months after that I was okay, I kept myself busy and I was back on campus, new friends, new job, and only talked to her maybe 1 or 2 times in that duration. But the last 2 months, I miss her and I'm conflicted if I even should. I reached out to her to ask her if she'd be okay with being actual friends again but she said we had one too many differences and that I would not be able to provide her with the friendship she feels she wants, which I respect. It makes me really upset because we both really liked writing, and she often posted on this website that I hadn't checked up until a month ago, where she last wrote on this year in February. She last wrote of ME, last year on this website to upload anonymously to wish me a happy birthday (she didn't wish ME directly), and that she's sorry for hurting me.

I'm confused and upset, and I miss her, but I don't know if I should. Should I feel regret in what I did? I loved her very much, but the stress she put me in times felt suffocating at times. But I still miss her, she was like an older sister to me."

All is well so far, I help this person with their website and their social media marketing/SEO/SEM needs. 

However, when this person, whom I'll call Liz asked me to apply to conventions to sell her goods, I did NOT say no right away. I told her it was an intriguing idea, and I was wishy-washy with my answers. 

Two weeks ago, I told Liz that I thought it would be best if she hired a sales intern to handle the conventions. She wasn't mad, but she discounted my idea and told me to keep on searching for places, that marketing is the same as sales. When I told her it wasn't, she argued with me. The thing is, I like this lady and I don't want her to be upset, but I doubt I would be very good standing at the conventions. Plus, I have so many obligations, including trying to find a non-retail job that I can't handle this extra task. 

My friends and sisters tell me to drop this person, but I didn't want to do that! I just wanted her to understand. What should I do? Is there a way where I can persuade her that my idea is the correct one?

It is perhaps a 5th of the work and has none of the quality or name power that a CS major or CS + X major has. This is coming from a graduating IS major. However, that does not mean that it is a poor major in any way. This is a 2 year old program and I don't think many people take that into account when they choose to shit all over the IS major. It's still growing. It's still finding the track that it wants its majors to take, and that does mean that it needs to grow its technical courseload if it wants its students to be more STEM based. Of course it will never be a CS major, but that's not the point of the major (So be quiet CS majors who seem to take every chance to shit on it). But that doesn't mean that IS majors can't get great jobs. I had a FB internship last year, and am returning as a technical product manager at Facebook. I worked my butt off to get the internship, and took a lot of extracurricular orgs and networked to get it. So yeah, getting a good job at a company like Facebook is possible. However, the iSchool has a couple issues, it is lying to get more people to apply, and I think it is letting a lot of naive high schoolers believe that it's a CS major. It's not. It never will be. But that doesn't mean that its going to stop great companies from hiring IS majors."

I made a few poor career decisions during this time and some good ones, for this reason I thought this post might help some people.

**Job History Timeline:**

May 2019: Graduated college with a B.S in Information Technology. I had an IT internship during my last semester which I don‚Äôt count as experience anymore, but it helped me land my first real IT position post-graduation. 

May 2019 - September 2019 (Service Desk Analyst, contract to hire, $23/h): Worked as a service desk analyst for a large hospital chain as a contract to hire. The contracting company was TekSystems. The position was absolutely awful, it was basically a glorified call center job where all I would do is reset passwords and install the same 3 software everyday. The floor manager would publicly humiliate you if you made a mistake, he would yell at people and shit talk them in front of everyone else. There was no room for growth and eventually I got so sick of it I called my recruiter and told him I‚Äôm about to quit this position without having anything lined up. He talked me out of doing that and ended up finding me my next position.

September 2019 - September 2019 (Windows Migration Technician, contract, $23/h): The same TekSystems recruiter found me a position at a military equipment manufacturer as a Windows Migration Technician. Basically I was just there to help them migrate their laptop and desktops from Windows 7 to 10. Unfortunately after 4 days I was fired from this position for ‚ÄúAsking too many questions‚Äù. I later found out that this company hired 10 contractors and after 4 days fired 5 of them on the same day. The recruiter told me he didn‚Äôt have anything else lined up, so I was fucked in that regards.

October 2019 - December 2019 (Windows Migration Technician, contract, $25/h): About a week after I got fired a recruiter from Apex Systems contacted me about an opening for the exact same type of contact that I was just fired from, only at a different company. This time it was a telecommunications company. I didn‚Äôt tell the recruiter that I was just fired from the same position, and I got the contract. The work was pretty chaotic, the inhouse IT staff‚Äôs asset management software was completely disorganized, they did know how many devices were Windows 7 or Windows 10, we literally had walk to every cubicle and ask the user what their operating system was. Nobody was keeping track of what the contractors were doing, one of the other contractors who was hired with me would show up to work in the morning, pretend to work for about a hour, then would disappear for the whole day only to come back at the last hour of the work day and pretend to work. I found out on the last day of the contact that he was working as an Uber driver simultaneously while ‚Äúworking‚Äù at this contact. The inhouse IT staff never found out about this, they thought the reason they never saw him was because he was somewhere else in the office working. I could go on and on about how mismanaged this project was, but overall I liked my boss and coworkers, so I didn‚Äôt hate the position. The contact ended Dec 31st and I was unemployed again.

February 2020 - May 2020 (Windows Migration Technician, contract, $20/h): I moved to a new state and found another contact position doing Windows migrations. At this point I absolutely did not want to do another short term contact, but I had no choice because it was either that or being unemployed. This contact was actually well managed compared to the previous one, everything was organized and we got a lot of stuff done. I knew this contract would end eventually so I decided to start actually applying to full time positions instead of waiting for my contract to end. 

May 2020 - September 2020 (IT Consultant at MSP, permanent, 50k/y): The way I got this job was actually pretty unusual. I previously interviewed for this position before I started working at my last Window Migration job, the MSP owner chose to go with another candidate, but I later found out that he fired that guy for some unknown reason. While I was working at my last position the recruiter who set up this initial interview called me to ask if I was still looking for a job, she then told me I should contact the owner of the MSP because he doesn‚Äôt work with this recruitment company anymore. So the next day I found the owner‚Äôs LinkedIn page and sent him a message basically asking if he had any positions available. He wasn‚Äôt planning on hiring anybody else but for some reason he decided on the spot that he wanted to create a position for me, two weeks later I was working for him. The position was essentially desktop support for an MSP, I worked from home and would travel to client‚Äôs offices. Unfortunately I was laid off from this job due to Covid-19, the MSP lost a few of their big clients who went bankrupt, my position had to be eliminated because there was very little work to assign me. The MSP owner apologized to me, said it was his fault not mine that I am being let go, and he left me a recommendation on my LinkedIn page.

October 2020 - January 2022(Help Desk Technician, permanent, 42k/y: A few weeks after my lay off I was offered a position as an IT Tech/help desk at an engineering company. The company was paying me less than what I was making at my previous position, but I was unemployed so I took it. The position was alright for a help desk job, I like my boss and coworkers. We were understaffed and that made the workload pretty bad, but it kept me busy and they let me work from home 4 days a week, which was pretty cool. This position was also cool because they invested in career development for their staff and let me get basic hands-on experience with Windows Server, Azure, Nutanix, Proofpoint, etc. This helped me a lot in getting my next and current position. After I got one full year of experience at this place I got really burnt out and knew I really wanted to get out of entry level support, so I started applying to cybersecurity positions.

February 2022 - Present (Technical Account Manager - Security, permanent, 105k/y): After months of applying, 30+ interviews, lots and lots of rejections, I finally got offered my current position. The company is actually paying me more than what I asked for. I asked for like 80k during my initial screening with HR, after I got offered the position the recruiter told me that 80k was to low for this position and they don‚Äôt want me to go looking for a new job when I discover I‚Äôm being paid less than what I potentially could make elsewhere, so they increased it to more than 100k. So far I am loving the job, it's fully remote and I genuinely enjoy what I do. I don‚Äôt dread going into work like I did at all my previous jobs. 



**Key things that got me the cyber security job:**

-While I was a helpdesk tech I tried to get involved in anything related to cybersecurity so I could put it on my resume. Our security guy sent us a message asking if anybody wanted to help him run our phishing/user training platform knowbe4, I immediately volunteered. After that, I built a relationship with our security engineer and he would give me simple tasks to do that he didn't feel like doing or didn't have time to do. I would then put that experience on my resume. A lot of the experience I built during this time was because I asked for it, nobody intended to give me access to Azure, after I bugged the sysadmin for long enough he finally let in and did it.
 
-The company that I work for currently is a vendor that sells a cyber security product. By coincidence the help desk position I had was with a company that used this product and gave me admin access to it. Because of this I became semi familiar with the product and was able to leverage that when interviewing for this company.
 
-Studied as much as possible about security. Everytime I went to an interview and they would give me technical questions, I would write down the questions I didn‚Äôt know and look up the answer later. I noticed that a lot of interviewers were asking the same questions, it was almost like they all googled ‚Äúbest entry level infosec questions to ask on an interview‚Äù and were reading off this list. After a while I became very comfortable answering questions.




**Mistakes I made/things I learned:**

-Avoid short term contracts at all costs unless you are desperate. Having a bunch of short contracts on my resume sucked, employers don‚Äôt like to see a resume with 3 years of experience with 5 different companies. I make it as clear as possible on my resume that these were short term temp contacts, but most don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt even list my contacts on my resume anymore, if anyone asks why there is 7 month gap from the time I graduated college to the first position I list on my resume, I just tell them i went backpacking after college, its better than seeing all my shitty contracts. Plus temp contracting sucks in general, you do basic tedious work, you have to be looking for a new job all the time, you gain little actual practical experience, the in house IT staff don‚Äôt treat you like a fellow employee because they know you are going to leave soon. Just don‚Äôt do it.

-When interviewing for your first help desk job, make sure to ask what kind of technology you will be exposed to and have access to. Not all help desk jobs are equal, some of them won‚Äôt let you do anything except change passwords and install adobe. Others will give you access to a wide variety of technology which you can then put on your resume. This is essentially how I was able to transition to cybersecurity, by leveraging the experience I built during help desk. 

-Entry level certifications are virtually valueless to 95% of hiring managers. I have a Comptia A+, Security+, and a AWS SA cert. Not a single time did anyone mention that on my resume or cared if I brought it up. In the case of the AWS cert, unless you have direct experience working with AWS in a production environment, nobody cares that you passed an exam. Certs are meant to prove existing knowledge you got on the job, not get you a job if you don‚Äôt have experience with that cert subject.

-Don‚Äôt post your updated resume on a job board if you are currently employed. I did this during my last help desk position and apparently the company‚Äôs HR found out about it and notified my boss. I had to have an awkward conversation with him and basically lie to him that I‚Äôm not looking for a new position. For the next few months I thought I was going to get fired any day because my boss thinks I‚Äôm about to leave the company.

**EDIT:** A lot of people seemed to be irritated when I said that entry-level certs are mostly valueless. Let me reexplain what I am trying to say. I am not saying that getting certs are valueless completely, what I am saying is that entry level certs do not substitute actual experience and people on this sub over value certs as a means to get their preferred position. This is mostly a response to the 1000s of posts on this sub that are like ""What cert will qualify me to become a sysadmin"" or ""Will an AWS cert get me a cloud position?"". From my own experience, if you have a cert but don't have actual work experience to go along with that cert, it is essentially valueless (the one exception to this is government security jobs, which do actually require a Sec+ or similar certification). Very few people will care that you have an AWS cert if you never actually worked with AWS in a production environment. Especially for entry level certs, anybody can cram for a test and pass it. I passed my CompTIA Sec+ exam after only 10 days of studying for it, and I am not smart by any means. This is why hirer end certs like CISSP, CISA, PMP, all require you to have years of documented and verifiable related work experience before you are even allowed to take the exam. Even on entry level certifications like the CompTIA A+, on the documentation it says that although there are no required pre-requisites for taking the exam, they recommend you have a year of work experience before you take it.

The point being, certs are meant to compliment existing work experience, not substitute for it. During my career I never once felt that a cert that I got helped me land a position, not a single time did a hiring manager ask me about the cert or even comment on its existence. It's as if it wasn't even on my resume. Actual related work experience was all that mattered, the bachelors degree helped get pass HR, but really all hiring managers cared about was how my previous help desk experience translated into the position I was applying for. I am not anti-cert by any means, in fact later this year I will be attempting the CEH exam, not because I want to but because having this cert is required in my master's degree program."

Hello everyone,

It‚Äôs my first time in this subreddit. I am almost 24 years old M.  Here‚Äôs my story: 

I just moved to a new country to pursue my double degree (a master‚Äôs degree) in quantitative finance. Being in a completely different country, away from my family had a huge negative impact on my mental health. Consequences: 1- Severe Depression, 2- During the whole year, I only passed one exam.

I feel a little better now so I m trying to find out how to save my career‚Ä¶ My program is meant to last 2 years. However, with this completely wasted year, it will last 3 ou 3 and half years depending on my internship.

My question is: How bad is this for my future career? Will the recruiters find it sketchy to take 3 or 4 years to complete a 2 years master? What about passing one exam in the whole year? Isn‚Äôt graduating at 26 or 27 years old late.. I am planning to follow an MBA later on which requires a minimum of 3 or 4 years of work‚Ä¶I am completely lost and feel guilty of not giving it my best this year‚Ä¶

Any same personal experience? 

Thank you in advance"

Currently I have a 2-in-1 Laptop that works as both. But over the past two semesters, using the laptop as a tablet while also plugging it into a monitor has gotten very annoying. I was thinking of buying a mini PC to use at home while using my laptop for note taking, but my dad also said that I could just buy a tablet and use the laptop plugged into my monitor as I have been doing for the past two semesters. That said, I'm torn as I would be using heavy software (Revit, Illustrator, Photoshop) that a mini PC would be helpful for. Opinions?

I live off campus and commute to school, if that helps with the idea of portability being a concern."

Here is the 125th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

wds1y6,2,2022-08-01,How should I negotiate salary?,techgirl8,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wds1y6/how_should_i_negotiate_salary/,"Hi everyone, I am pretty sure I will be getting a job offer tomorrow. Salary negotiation will be part of it. All the interviews went very well and I would be surprised if I dont get a offer. This is my first actual Software Engineer position I am still in college and leaving a fullstack engineer internship this week it is ending on Friday. But it is not an entry level position. It is a Software Engineer mid level type position. They told me that I seem like I have years of experience and it seems like I've been working in the industry for years when I did the technical interview, so I think I should negotiate for 90k at least. They asked me before what is my salary expectations and they told me they wouldn't hold me to a number they just wanted to know so I said between 80 and 90k. They said that was about in their range. I'm on the east coast we get paid more in my state than a lot of other places. On glassdoor it says they pay between 75 to 130k and a lot of people on the reviews said they pay below average. But they have good benefits and I hear the company culture is really nice.

I also have other interviews and potential job offers so I will definitely be negotiating because I do think I have options now because I have the skills needed. I really don't want to take less than 80k is that unreasonable of me for my first actual engineer job??"

Also I have done some coding and data cleaning related tasks before so I am familiar with that side as well (web scraping for personal projects is the closest thing to data engineering I‚Äôve done). 

Anyways, my project was pretty much solely product analytics and marketing analytics and doing tableau dashboarding and SQL.

I didn‚Äôt go through interviews, etc. as a distant relative is the CEO. I had never met this guy, my aunt told me he owned a firm, so I applied. He put me on a team for an internship for a summer with no plans of hiring me. I have maybe talked to him a handful of times since then and mainly associate with the MD of my team. 

After interning over the summer and a few more months, the MD had a chat with me and said he‚Äôd like me on his team. I specifically asked him if this was because my family knew the CEO, but he assured me that it‚Äôs not. In fact, his analyst had left a few months ago, and he was already looking for new analysts. He said the skills I showed during the internship made him want to try giving me a Jr Analyst role. He had to speak to the CEO to hire me, and the CEO agreed. In all honestly I had absolutely no clue about bonds before I interned here, I have a management degree and barely had to learn anything about fixed income during my bachelor‚Äôs. This highly adds to my imposter syndrome.

I think I‚Äôve gained some trust of my MD who has now allowed me to execute trades and be the only ‚Äútrader‚Äù on our desk. I deal with all counterparties and execute all trades for my desk, but all bids/offers are made by my MD. I get set bid/offer targets when he wants to buy/sell, and I deal with the counterparties and execute. I‚Äôve learned a great bunch from this, but feel like I don‚Äôt yet have the liberty to buy and sell what I want, at my levels, although I feel capable.

My team is a small team managing a little less than 10% of the firm‚Äôs total AUM. The other Jr. Analyst seems to have much more knowledge than me when it comes to Fixed Income. I was put on the Corp desk and deal with plain old corp bonds, whereas he has knowledge in all other aspects of structured finance. He is only 5 years older than me. 

Due to being put on the corp desk and only working with corp bonds, I have next to no knowledge of all the other aspects of fixed income (clo,cdo,abs,cmbs,etc.). I understand the basics of what those products are, but nothing about how they operate. I feel it‚Äôs too late now to ask some of the questions I think of because my coworkers will think I‚Äôm highly under-qualified (which I think they already do), so I just google some things I hear on the desk that I don‚Äôt know about. 

This brings up the learning peak, is it a good idea to stay put on the corp desk, where I am still learning about the aspects of fixed income, but isolated from the other worlds of fixed income? Have I hit my learning peak on this desk? How do I start learning more about other asset classes and instruments?

The final thing is, as I have no prior job history, I don‚Äôt know what a typical culture looks like at a firm like this. The culture here is very relaxed in terms of being able to dress and say what you feel, but I also feel a disconnect between my team‚Äôs PMs and the PMs of the other teams. They treat our team like we‚Äôre not good enough for them, as they deal in all products and we deal in only corps. I sense hostility from the Senior PMs to the Senior Analysts towards my team and there have been numerous remarks that arouse my suspicion. This whole dynamic adds to my imposter syndrome as I feel like they think I‚Äôm not good enough for the firm or to be an analyst. I work as hard as needed, but being a smaller desk I have a lot less work than the other Analyst, stay earlier, etc.

There are days where I grind and learn things and feel like I belong, but there are some days where I am on a call and have no idea what some of the PMs are saying on there and feel like I just got lucky because a distant relative who I‚Äôve never met before owned a firm and decided to give me an internship. Although I grinded my ass off during my internship and the years following, proving myself to my MD that I can handle his tasks and am willing to learn, I can‚Äôt help but feel like I am highly unqualified and only have a job because the Corp desk is straight forward and easy compared to the other desks."

Colleges I plan to apply to until now: Urbana Champaign, Illinois-Chicago, University of Rochester, Boston Metropolitan College. My basic criteria is that it be a STEM program and have some courses on Programming Language.

My profile:

Work-Ex : 4 years as a Credit Underwriting Analyst at a US-based bank in India.

Education: Bachelor's and Master's in Economics from two Tier 1 institutes respectively. GPA in Bachelor's would be 3.6 and i have a Gold Medal but for Master's is 2.7. 

Certifications: None

Papers: None

Internship: Research analyst at a Policy Bank.

Could you please help me out with the following queries:

1. What are some of the colleges I should apply for as safe colleges? 

2. How will they evaluate my GPA? Will my Master's grades bring down my profile significantly?

3. I don't have any CFA certification and I'm unsure of whether I'd want to take it up later or not. Is that a make or break criteria for the course? 

4. This will be my second Master's degree. I also have a higher number of years of work ex compared to the class profiles for these unis. Is that a plus or minus point?

5. What is a safe GRE score I should target?

we1gly,1,2022-08-01,(Major TW) I (21F) was SAed by another child for 6 years when I was 5-11. Now I don‚Äôt know who I am or what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing,No_Construction_1373,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/we1gly/major_tw_i_21f_was_saed_by_another_child_for_6/,"Hi. Pretty much what the title says. I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs much of a question here. I‚Äôm just looking for general advice and support from people who understand how I‚Äôm feeling and have possibly been through something similar.

I was sexually abused and intensely emotionally manipulated for 6 years of my childhood by another child three years older than me, and I feel like it has shaped my life and taken away my sense of identity.

For some background on myself prior to the start of the abuse: I was one of those kids who showed signs of being gifted from an early age(taught myself how to read with no outside help or instructional materials at age 3, wide vocabulary by age 5, reading comprehension consistently far above my grade level) and I have a photographic memory. I was also very interested in music, but I never attempted to learn to sing or play an instrument. I just really loved listening to music and developed an uncanny ability to hear music and detect musical styles, if that makes sense. That‚Äôs about all I know about who I was before everything started happening. 

I won‚Äôt go into too much detail of the abuse itself. What‚Äôs important to know is that I was in constant fear of my life for the entirety of those five years and, quite honestly, for a long time afterward. My abuser had said that I could be killed and possibly my family as well if ‚Äúthings went wrong.‚Äù This resulted in my keeping the abuse a secret for nearly 15 years until I was 20 years old and was finally in therapy after developing obsessive compulsive disorder and adjustment disorder with depressive mood(meaning that it‚Äôs extremely difficult for me to adapt to life changes without being sent into a depressive episode). Now, my parents, partner, and therapist know about the abuse, but that‚Äôs all. 

I haven‚Äôt been to therapy in almost two years(there have been administrative changes happening at my therapist‚Äôs office resulting in it being difficult to get an appointment and I don‚Äôt live in the area anymore but I don‚Äôt want to find someone else and have to explain my history to them), but I don‚Äôt really think it made much of a difference anyway. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm affected by my past sexually. It‚Äôs more so that I find myself mourning who I could have become had I not been abused. I became extremely burnt out and suffered academically for a period in high school, which led to me attending a subpar but still extremely expensive university and racking up too much debt to even begin to wrap my head around. I‚Äôve gotten decent internship experience throughout college, but I don‚Äôt even know if the path that I‚Äôm on is right for me at all. I feel completely lost when it comes to my personal future and what I want to do with my life. 

And then there‚Äôs the past‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fucking haunted by my past. Not just the abuse itself, but the effects it had on my overall behavior as a young child. My OCD intrusive thoughts and my photographic memory are a lethal combination. I constantly play back memories of interactions I had with others when I was a child after the abuse started and wonder if I acted inappropriately and what the other people in the situation thought of me. One instance of this is that I remember when I, at age 9, explained in detail a sexual concept to my then best friend(which had initially been explained to me by my abuser), who told her mom, who told my mom. When my mom confronted me, I didn‚Äôt know how to explain myself. 

I worry that I‚Äôve suppressed memories in which I‚Äôm the bad guy. In which I‚Äôm the abuser. And the worst part is that there‚Äôs no way of knowing. I just have to live with this pain and fear forever. I‚Äôll always have to wonder who I was, who I am, and who I could have been. It kills me to feel like I could have done bigger and better things had I not been fighting this battle for so many years. It kills me to think about the child I was and not feel like I am that strong-willed, hardworking, intelligent person anymore. I don‚Äôt feel like I want to end my life; what I want more than anything is to turn things around and become the person I know I can be. I just don‚Äôt know what to do with myself as of now, and I could use some advice/support on where to go from here. Thanks for reading."

I am part of the problem, I've been depressed for about 6 years now. I only have 3 close friends, but one is also depressed, and the other two are busy working or going to school. So I'm stuck alone with nobody to talk to. I recently started University, and I  made a small friend group (although everything is online), but they only use me for the work I produce (assignments exams etc). I spent all of my Highschool years studying like crazy, and I got some amazing results academically wise, but I feel like I lost out on all my teenage memories.

 I've been to one party/event before (last week for work), I never went out with friends, I've never had a girlfriend, I never got to try new things etc. But that never really bothered me, because I focused on developing myself. 

But coming down to the end of my first year at Universty, stress had me going insane. I had insomnia, hallucinations, I started peeling my skin off, all kinds of madness.

I'm currently nearing the end of my summer vacation, and the repetition is killing me, everything feels like a blur, because I get up and do the same mundane bs every day. I got an internship and I thought that would bring some interest in my life, but it didn't change anything at all. 

Currently, I can't even be awake for more than 10 hours a day, not because I'm tired, it's because I'm fed up. I'm fed up of living. I have no reason to wake up, all I do is go to work and come home to work out. All kinds of thoughts have been going through my head recently. Today, I sliced my hand up with a compass. And tomorrow, I have no idea what other stupid thought will enter my mind. 

I guess I've basically ranted for most of this. But does anyone know how I can end this suffering? I just want some advice on small changes I can make to help me enjoy life more. I understand I can't fix all this at once, but any advice to help me fix my issues just a little at a time will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you."

I had my permit and I just didn‚Äôt focus on it at all.

I‚Äòve fucked myself out of an education. I can‚Äòt pay for anything myself because I don‚Äôt have a job and I can‚Äôt get a job because I don‚Äôt have my fucking license. I already need to retake 3 fucking classes because I failed them. I haven‚Äôt been to school in 8 months. Didn‚Äôt go at all the spring semester. Now my parents are dead-set on me going to a community college for the next two semesters to get ‚Äúback on track‚Äù but I can‚Äôt fucking go there because I can‚Äòt schedule any classes I need. My credits from the other college will not transfer no matter what the fuck I do, and I can‚Äôt sign up for classes because it keeps saying I don‚Äôt have the fucking prerequisites that I already took at the other college. They keep telling me I should go to this community college for a year, well what the fuck am I supposed to do?

And it‚Äòs not like I can get an internship. Who the fuck would hire someone with no fucking technical skills, a 2.2 GPA, and a fucking 8-month gap in their resume.

And what about my future? How did everything go so wrong in just 2 fucking years? Right now my GPA is a fucking 2.2 and I have 8 whole fucking months where I did nothing at all. No school, no job, nothing. I‚Äòd have to win the fucking lottery for that shit to not fuck me over the rest of my life.

Oh, and apparently that college I originally too fucking withdrew me. And I didn‚Äôt get any fucking emails about it. And now that classes start in like 3 weeks, that‚Äôs going to be a fucking headache to deal with.

Also I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm trans and my parents don‚Äôt really like me taking medication for it. I do take HRT, but it‚Äôs a low dose and it has done barely anything to me. No fucking changes except for swollen nipples. Every time I talk to my psychiatrist about this and want them to raise the dose, my parents fight back and the dose stays at its current low state. And they tell me and my parents, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll keep you at the low dose so you still feel like you‚Äôre being heard‚Äù. Well I fucking don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm being heard.

You shouldn‚Äôt feel sorry for me either because I get homicidal ideation a lot, where I start obsessing over what it might feel like kill someone. Just for the hell of it.

I think I should just kill myself. Should be easy, because apparently I can‚Äôt even get one fucking vial of blood drawn without passing out and almost throwing up, and since I‚Äôm on HRT I need to get like 3 vials drawn every few months.

I knew I wanted to do IT in high school when I read [Anon Does IT](https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/2121yw/anon_works_in_it_both_parts_combined_in_to_one/). I thought ‚ÄúHey I could do that‚Äù. I was halfway decent with computers from playing video games and was really interested in smart phones at the time. I wanted to be an Android developer. The only real experience I had was upgrading small stuff on my gaming PC and playing with some Lua code in Garry‚Äôs Mod. 

I decided to go to college for Management &amp; Information Systems. In hindsight I wish I would‚Äôve done computer science but it‚Äôs working out alright I suppose. I moved a few hours away from home for school and I needed a new job so I was looking for on campus jobs when I stumbled across a student technician job and applied. I had a phone interview and got hired from that. The job started before my dorm was available but I slept on my friends couch just to start on time.

Student Technician - University (9.15/hr)

I worked there for about a month before the one other guy that I worked with, the sys admin, accepted a different position at the same place and it was a cheap university so they never replaced him. So here I am 18 years old and I‚Äôm a sys admin for a department at a university. It was all pretty easy stuff but occasionally I had some nightmare moments where I just had to figure shit out on my own. Shortly after a couple of these I got promoted to Lead Student Technician and started making about 10.50 an hour. I felt pretty good about that. I got some good experience coordinating a department move from one building to another and assisting with technology in the renovation of our new building.

Lead Student IT User Support Analyst - University (12.50/hr)

After working for this department for a while I had an opportunity to link up with the guy who hired me at the university in his department. I got a 2 dollar an hour raise and thought ‚ÄúThis is awesome. I‚Äôm 19 and making more money than I ever dreamed of. I‚Äôm going to work here forever.‚Äù Shortly after I found out that tech internships paid pretty well. I always assumed that they either didn‚Äôt pay or paid worse than what I made. This job sometimes required that I work nights and because I was on campus in the evenings I joined an IT student organization that met in the evenings because they had free pizza. One day I was there and I hear a recruiter say they pay interns $20/hr and that breaks my brain. I come from a pretty small rural town and that was more money than my parents household income. At one place I applied for a networking internship which I thought was a reach and a desktop support position which I thought I was basically guaranteed since I had a few years of experience from my old job.

Windows Server Admin Internship - Fortune 500 Utility company ($20/hr)

I got turned down for both positions I applied for and was bummed because I really wanted to work here but continued looking. I had accepted an offer for an internship with a small start up at $15/hr, but randomly got called by this company saying that someone had backed out and that a Windows Server internship had opened up and they thought I might be a good fit. I went to to the interview and killed it but there was one hiccup. I went on the wrong day. I didn‚Äôt realize this at the time but being a dumb college kid working 40 hrs a week I got my days mixed up. My interview was on a Thursday but I showed up on Wednesday not knowing what day it was. They seemed a bit confused when I showed up but I assumed it was just a miscommunication or something. The interview starts fine, but at one point they ask ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you know to come today?‚Äù I replied ‚ÄúUhhh I got an email that said come today?‚Äù And they said ‚ÄúOh okay we had some scheduling problems, but that must‚Äôve been on our end‚Äù I did not realize my mistake until the next day when I got a calendar notification and and it all clicked. Thank god I was stupidly confident and never questioned myself once because I got offered the job 2 days later.

I interned there for a year and a half before graduating. I learned a lot of stuff and got decent at powershell. I was mainly just building new servers to send out to our remote sites but I got to travel a little which was fun. I was hoping to stay on this team when I graduated but there wasn‚Äôt a position open.

Monitoring Engineer Level 1/Level 2- Same Fortune 500 Utility Company ($62k-78k)

I got offered a full time job on the team that sat across the aisle from me in the office and liked me. I spent 2 years on this team getting better at Powershell, shell scripting, Perl and Python. All of this was to build out checks for our network operations center. I also got to do some very cool compliance monitoring that was interested to me. I got promoted to a level 2 and started making $68k. Along the way I got to lead a project to move off our current ITSM to ServiceNow. After this I was put in charge of implementing Splunk at my company. I learned a lot by just building out our environment and accidentally breaking it enough. I built good relationships with people that worked at Splunk and eventually became a Certified Splunk Admin. Somewhere in there I got a performance raise up to $78k. At this point I had some decent project experience under my belt and management kept changing around. I kept filling in as a manager, but never getting the actual position when I applied because I was too young. So I started mass applying to work at Splunk because that was probably my strongest skill. I applied to 50+ jobs there and ended up interviewing to be a Sales Engineer. I made it to the final round of interviews but backed out because it sounded to salesy for my taste. I had randomly applied to a one of job as a Lead Security Engineer at a different company, literally the only job I applied to outside of Splunk, thinking I would never get it because I had no security background. The biggest thing I learned from this job was that I could get project lead position if I told managers I was interested in leadership. They started giving me chances to prove myself which really buffed out my resume.

Lead Security Engineer - Fortune 100 Financial Institution ($125k)

Turns out I had the perfect match of weirdly specific qualifications for this single job. It was a Splunk Enterprise Security Admin that also had to do some compliance monitoring. I interviewed really well because at my previous job I had played interim manager long enough that I‚Äôd interviewed a lot of people and I essentially just flipped the script. I‚Äôm still in the process of learning a lot of new stuff, but I‚Äôm overall just shocked that I ended up here. I work hard, but really not harder than anybody else I just feel like I got lucky over and over again. So far the biggest thing I‚Äôve learned is that you just have to shit out imposter syndrome. 99% of the time you can do the thing if you just put your head down and get to work.

Tl;dr: I‚Äôm not that smart I‚Äôm just very lucky."

I've taken up two take-home coding assignments so far and both of them requested for a dockerized solution.

Both rejected my solutions

I'm not saying that I was rejected only due to not knowing Docker but is it really that important to learn at this stage in my career as a backend developer? I've got maybe 8 months of internship experience so I'm open to learning it but setting it as a hard requirement seems a bit harsh.

It was smthn that came to me when I was crying abt how I had to walk to the bus stop today bc we can‚Äôt afford to get our car fixed. 

I know that everyone who is low income wants money, but I was j realizing that I rlly don‚Äôt want to end up being so poor I have no car and having to take the bus all the time as an adult. 

I don‚Äôt want to be more depressed than I am, but I don‚Äôt want to be broke either. I rlly see no point in going to college j to end up in a low income job. 

I j rlly realized how much being broke makes me miserable 

I learned at my internship that I rlly like working w kids but don‚Äôt like having to idk walk through cobwebs especially when it‚Äôs rlly hot outside (I had to do this to count boats and it felt like slavery) 

I know that I honestly don‚Äôt want to be in school for a super long time, or that‚Äôs smthn that I can‚Äôt help but think to myself whenever I think about like college

I‚Äôm like unsure as to how good I actually am at working w my hands 

I know that on some days like today I have general anxiety in regards to just idk being around ppl or having to talk to ppl even tho I know that it‚Äôs healthy for me to socialize.

I have sleeping issues and can wake up w headaches bc of it, my family is dysfunctional and I have problems bc of it

I am good at following rules, I was good at completing tasks at my internship even if I didn‚Äôt like them.

I can have sort of social anxiety it‚Äôs what I felt today 

I am not a huge fan of math, it‚Äôs partly why I‚Äôm not sure abt engineering

I am more emotional than rational even tho I can be both? 

I have been depressed since I was around 9

I can get easily stressed out even if I won‚Äôt always say it. 

I‚Äôll be starting at community bc I struggle w depression and anxiety and also bc it‚Äôs honestly the most convenient. 

I don‚Äôt enjoy waking up early in the mornings at all.

There have been a few times in the past where I have looked at like idk a chord or plug and wondered how it properly works (like to my tv or computer) or wanted to figure smthn like that out 

I j know I don‚Äôt want to be low income 

My state is expensive to live in but I honestly might eventually move.

I‚Äôm currently leaning toward learning a trade (electrician, welder, or mechanic) especially since I rlly honestly don‚Äôt even want to do senior yr (I want to finish school as quick as possible.) 

I feel anxiety when taking the bus (like idk)

I feel just such heavy doubt in regards to what I want to do career wise 

I dropped pre cal in junior yr since I felt I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù the subject due to having not understood algebra 2

I wake up sick a fair amount and tend to be tired throughout the day I can have trouble on certain days not thinking of negative things. 

I‚Äôve been into MBTI for years 

I can get easily stressed out.

we6a90,1,2022-08-02,How do I (18F) slide into the instagram DMs of someone (19M) I‚Äôve only interacted with once?,Ok_Ingenuity_4386,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/we6a90/how_do_i_18f_slide_into_the_instagram_dms_of/,"There's a bit of a long backstory for this question, but I feel like it's necessary to encapsulate this situation. Also, it's amusing and I feel like some of you will enjoy lol, so here we are.

So a few months back, I was doing this internship for some volunteer credits I needed to graduate high school. My supervisor was this really friendly woman in her early forties or so, who had grown a liking towards me and vice versa. One day we were talking about how I was going to college in the fall, and she got all excited, saying that her son, who's a year older, is going to be going to the same college as me. Then she started laughing and asked if I wanted his number, saying that she ""wants to find someone for him"" because he's ""nice and a musician."" For context, I'm also a musician and going to college for music. I didn't really take the offer seriously, so I just laughed it off and the conversation kinda ended. Plus, I thought it would be weird if I had his number and texted him like, ""hey i got your number from your mom"" while not knowing anything about him other than that he was a musician going to the same college as me.

Now, fast forward a few weeks. My supervisor adds me on Snapchat, and I thought it was funny so I took a screenshot of the add and posted it to my private story with like 4 of my close friends on it, talking about how I loved this woman and how she wanted to set me up with her son. Again, for context, she has a really really specific last name that's pretty rare. One of my best friends of damn near 15 years texts me and says, ""I think your supervisor is my boyfriend's friend's mom.""

TURNS OUT, the son she was telling me about is super close friends with my friend's boyfriend. PURELY BY COINCIDENCE. Literally, what are the odds of that?

Anyway, since that moment my friend hasn't stopped talking about how she has hope something will happen, and has been trying to play matchmaker. For example, we were hanging out a few days ago, and she'd convinced me to come with her to stop by his house, where he, her boyfriend, and a few of their friends were hanging out. I was introduced to him, and we couldn't necessarily get a good read of each other because a) he was high and b) we were only there for 5 minutes because I had to go home to make it in time for my curfew. However, we joked for a sec about his mom trying to hook him up, and he seems nice. A few days later, I found his Instagram and followed him, and he followed me back.

Now, to get to the question: Where do I go from here? I've never been in a relationship, so I have no idea how to navigate potential interest in someone, and I don't want to be generic and hit him with a basic ass ""hey."" Also, I don't want to come off as desperate or creepy, so literally any advice would be helpful. Thanks :)"

webqkv,112,2022-08-02,Working is abysmal in India.,TerribleTyranny,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/webqkv/working_is_abysmal_in_india/,"Life as a worker is getting exponentially shittier in India. This is true for essentially all sectors but more so in corporate. I've worked in jobs entailing both MarCom &amp; STEM in Delhi and Bangalore. And it is beyond fucked in both of them.

&amp;#x200B;

*Edit: the pay isn't so much the issue as the general work atmosphere. im in frontend (webdev) and my ctc is 21, but even if it was 100lakh i would hate this fucking job. id be underpaid no matter what they pay me, because the work here is HORRIBLE. 5th job (9th, if you consider internships) and i FUCKING HATE IT BECAUSE NO MATTER WHERE I GO IT IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS.*

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - **READ THE FUCKING THING**.

Let's just start with the biggest reason I'm whining right now. SIX DAY WORK WEEKS? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? I look over into the European and American job markets and their proliferating FOUR day work weeks. FOUR DAYS.So why do I have to give the company that OVERWOKS me but synchronously UNDERPAYS me SIX days in a week? This doesn't end here. You might be thinking that India is a more socialist country and hence worker laws limit the number of hours you work in a week. NO.Modern companies quite swiftly evade these laws (which are more like guidelines anyway) by introducing the concept of ""flexible work hours"" - you work the same amount of hours, but can go to the office any time of the day. Essentially, if you work 9am-5pm, you could instead go at 1pm-9pm. You might think this is a good thing, but companies officially write off those hours you work after 5-6. This doesn't mean you get paid less or anything. It's only so that they can show an external Audit that workers are compliant with the rules and regulations.

This is why you're still eligible to work OVERTIME after a six day weekend. Oh did I mention fucking OVERTIME? WHEN THE FUCK DO YOU EXPECT ME TO WORK OVERTIME WHEN IM WORKING SIX DAYS IN A FUCKING WEEK ANYWAY? Oh and they'll give you, and I quote, ""Performance Based Incentivized Bonuses on Overtime"". Doesn't that sound so nice? So magnanimous of them, isn't it? Why are they being so acerbic when nearly ALL (and you should check your terms of employment) companies limit the maximum overtime bonus payout to same pathetic measly amount as little as 5-10k?Did I hear an unemployed fucker yell ""so don't do overtime"". haha, you silly fuck, you've clearly never heard of **bureaucracy.** A lot of people aren't aware that quantity is indeed over quality when it comes to bonuses and promotions. They don't give a fuck about you if you outright refuse to work overtime. Be prepared to lose credibility and respect if everyone else is busting their asses and you're sitting at home on Sunday eating kurkure. Don't care about credibility and respect? Well, with those, go your chances of a higher pay, bonus, prospective leaves, promotions and so much more.

Speaking of money losses, these companies higher such fancy lawyers that draft their salary structures for them. They knowingly reduce your base pay and HRA. Then they add all these fancy insulting conditionality like ""Flexi-Pay"". Are you for fucking real? Do I look like a fucking child? FLEXI-PAY? IS THIS A JOKE? Now some of you might think having a lower base pay makes me eligible for tax rebates and such nice things. WELL I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS THOSE. The more money a corporation spends on you aside from your basic pay (and lie to you by stuffing up your CTC with conditionals, incentivized variables and ""TELEPHONE INSTRUMENT BONUS"", the higher their working cost (other than employee salary) goes. This ALSO MAKES THEM ELIGIBLE FOR REBATE. THEY DON'T DO IT FOR US. THERE IS NO COMPANY THAT LIKES YOU IN INDIA.

But this is the technical aspect of working in India. The stuff that you see in offer letters and shit. Some offer letters look great, others look like, well, we know what they look like. The worker experience is different. And you might like to think that ""*But reddit user terribletyranny, some companies are nice right?*"" Well, you see kid, NO.

I've worked for shitty companies in India (whose names I can't mention. NOT WON'T &gt;&gt;&gt; CAN'T) and companies like P&amp;G and ONGC. These are big respected names. I'm not labelling the worker experience shitty as the sole responsibility of the company. It's US. WE THE WORKERS. All of us are such desperate assholes. We cant' tell our juniors to do something without vomiting out ad hominem vitriol. The work culture and environment has been sewn into our veins and we can't help but differently in those scenarios. You may be a perfectly happy and kind individual in your personal life, but professionally, you **KNOW** you have to be different. A worse kind of different. Being selfish isn't particularly wrong, but we're almost hedonistic in the kind of selfishness we display.

From the technical to the personal aspect, working is getting shittier in India. When I get a good salary, I get shitty working terms and colleagues. When I get a shit salary, I STILL GET SHITTY WORKING TERMS AND COLLEAGUES.

It's not all bad. I know. I'm being overtly pessimistic because of my personal experiences. Some of you may have had good ones and I'm no one to discredit those. But I don't think you can deny on factual grounds that worker laws, worker experience and working terms in India are far behind the modern standard. We're quick as squirrels to bounce on any new shitty trend that the west shits out on us but none of their successes are reflected in our experiences. They're different, we're different, but that doesn't warrant the line of thought that their solutions might not work out for us. We haven't even tried for fucks' sake.

I'm not looking to start campaigns or open Antiwork-india subreddits. I know many people go to a shit job everyday. And I'm not even speaking of remuneration. I, personally, am satisfied with my salary but that satisfaction doesn't last for a single minute because every single day I'm reminded of everything that's wrong with work culture in India. I'm scared because we don't speak out about it enough. I haven't even mentioned harassment and abuse, and those are often more rigorous and circadian than the things I talked about.

Why do you think we're so slow to develop. It's easy to blame geopolitics and our population and all these other factors that do indeed play a part. Don't you see all our top talent leaving this country as soon as they get their offers? The smartest Indians are rarely seen doing well in India. Things have changed a little, yes, but far too little to celebrate about.

I didn't leave when I get my PPO because the environment I grew up in instilled a pathetic sense of patriotism in me. I find myself feeling distant from that feeling as the day goes by. I'm just sad, man. I know you are too.

We're stuck, and there's nothing we can do about it.

Cheers to that!"

I'm not sure if it's because I am working full time, or I am just tired of college, but basically I am feeling incredibly lost. All I hear people talk about are internships and pursuing them, practicing code outside of school, participating in clubs, but I am just not feeling all that. I love programming and it's honestly fun to learn. I currently learned Java and a bit of Python. I think my biggest problem is the lack of focus I have right now in what I want to do.

I go to a university in Florida that offers a BS in CS and a BA in CS, I am currently taking the BA in CS where calculus 1 and 2 isn't required (thank god, i suck at math), however I still want to take them to challenge myself. Honestly my biggest problem is I have a terrible foundation in algebra and I haven't taken a math class in years. I don't know if I should take calculus 1 without brushing up on algebra and just learn the topics in calculus along the way. 

I guess I came here to rant sort of, but is this normal to feel? I don't want to drop the major cause I genuinely do love computers and programming, and I want to develop a game of my own one day, but I feel burnt out. I haven't pursued an internship and I have about 13 classes I need to take before graduating. Should I honestly just say fuck it and take calculus 1, and brush up on w.e algebra I need while taking the class? And also what can I do to feel driven about the major again?"
wefdcb,405,2022-08-02,You want to change images five minutes before the demo?,i_abh_esc_wq,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/wefdcb/you_want_to_change_images_five_minutes_before_the/,"Not sure if a developer catering to the inane requests of bosses count as tech support, but you be the judge. Also, I'm not on mobile, but on new keyboard layout, so ignore any typos.

The year 2018, I was in my second year of Bachelors. In the middle of being a depressed Maths student and a financially struggling teen, I got a part-time job as a web developer in a recently formed startup. The three co-founders were the CEO, CTO and CFO, and they were college students themselves, hardly two years older than me. So we were very friendly, and being an excellent performer, I was the only one allowed to WFH.

This startup was very new, and they had a product idea that wasn't implemented, but they raised some funds and were working with one ""mentor"" company owned by one of the VCs. They would provide us with funding and office space, and in return, they would subcontract some of their work with us. My job was in that department.

Mind you, we were tiny - about five employees and three interns. So, most of the time, I'd be the only one working on a project. I was the developer, DevOps, sysadmin and also intern trainer. But one day, we got a massive project. The entire company was pulled into the project. We were working with another team from the mentor company, and the VC was personally overseeing the entire thing. This other team had been developing the project for about a month when we came to the scene.

The project was to build a kid's clothing store. We were writing the backend in Node.JS to communicate in Magento and the frontend in [Vue storefront](https://vuestorefront.io/). Turns out that the other team had been working on the backend only for the last month, and the frontend is basically the default storefront installation. There's a demo in three days, and the VC will be presenting the demo himself. He says, ""I'll show them the default Vue Storefront UI itself. They won't understand."" Not sure if Vue Storefront has changed in the last four years or if we had changed something, but the default installation was a clothing store (Seems to be [still](https://demo-magento2-dev.europe-west1.gcp.storefrontcloud.io/default) the case, except UI was different.), so we were half good.

The day of the demo arrives. I'm sitting at home. 5 minutes before the start of the demo, boss calls me:

Boss: ""The [VC] asked if changing the front page images is possible. It's supposed to be a kids' store, and he doesn't like the obscene pictures"" (The ""obscene"" pictures were just some ladies :/)

Me: ""Are you kidding? Change the images? In 5 minutes?""
Boss: ""Yes, you can do it. I have collected some images.""

So I SSH into the server. I intended to simply replace the images on the server with new ones. But it turns out I didn't have write permission to the directory. But I had sudo access to a select few commands, nginx being one of them. This gave me an idea.

I put the images in a folder and renamed to match the names of the actual images. All the images were being requested at a specific URL, like /image. So I wrote an nginx rule to redirect /image to port 8000 and started a Python Simple HTTP server at port 8000, which served the new images and boom! The images changed! Day saved! All this time, the boss was constantly pinging and calling me asking if I can be faster.

I immediately closed my laptop and told my boss that I had done my job and my laptop was now broken, and I was taking it for repair. I went out for a much-needed walk."

I've been toying around with the idea of doing an AMA for a while now and finally have the time to do one. So before jumping in, here's a bit about my background:

I went to a public state university and pre-MBA I worked in a generic analyst role at big but no-name companies that I'd wager 99% of people wouldn't recognize. I've been wanting to do an MBA since senior year of undergrad after learning about consulting being a career but only recruiting from target schools. My plan was always to apply as early as possible and I finally decided to pull the trigger after 3 years of working. It was also around this time that I joined the r/MBA mod team as I was quite active on this subreddit as an applicant.

I ended up getting accepted into Tepper ($$) and Johnson (no $) and chose to attend Johnson at sticker. I dual recruited for consulting and tech, equally open to either. I was able to go to a FAANG for internship, re-recruited and will be heading to an MBB for FT.

Feel free to ask me anything about my MBA experience, r/MBA or whatever you'd like.

My IT background to date consists of a SysAdmin AAS, most of a BS in Cybersecurity, A+, Net+, Project+, some beginner webdev cert (CISW maybe?) and about 2.5 years in Helpdesk in general over two companies. First one was 6 months as a lvl 1 intern, another 1 year-ish as lvl 2 intern, 1 year as tier 1 - highly stressful, fast-paced environment that was chronically understaffed. Second place is a freelance gig that's ending this week, filling in as Tier 1 support for the last 4ish months. This place is well staffed and relatively low-stress, at least in comparison.

My insecurity stems from being unsure as to when I should start applying for Tier 2 and higher positions when I only have experience with two companies, whose definitions of Tier 1/2 are rather different. I'd compare my time as an intern with the first company to my time as Tier 1 with the current- other that the lack of AD access as intern, the duties are similar. I'd compare Tier 1 at previous company to maybe like a Tier 1.5 for the current company. I feel 100% confident that I could fill a Tier 2 role as defined at the current place, and mostly confident that I could have performed Tier 2 duties as they were defined at the previous place.

I see the postings for Tier 1 support and I feel like I'm over-qualified, but I also don't like the feeling of being in *way* over my head, and I'm afraid to reach too far too fast. Just looking for opinions, I guess."

1. Has anyone received a Software Engineer internship of 6 months at any company (stipend of Rs10,000/month or greater) by 1 month of preparations with only mastering the DSA Theory ?
2. Or, are there any companies (stipend of Rs 10,000/month or greater) which hire without asking DSA, where my 1 month of light preparation of Data Structures Theory would suffice ?

P.S.: My current state of DSA is like I am quite well versed with a few of Data Structures but I am not able to write programs of any kind of medium difficulty level coding questions. Also, I am not well versed with Algorithms."

The job starts at 80,000 a year and TONS of good benefits with the job. I haven't even graduated yet. I don't graduate until December with my bachelor's in Computer Science. I should graduate with high honors I have had a 4.0 GPA the whole time in this university. Although I dont think a high GPA matters much to companies it only really matters for internships. I think this is an amazing opportunity. I didn't try to negotiate. I just took it. It's actually a mid level Full Stack Software Engineer position. So I'm surprised I got it but I do know a lot even though my only work experience is a full stack engineer internship. They said that I seem to have the experience of someone who has been working as an engineer for awhile now. I do have the skills needed to do the job!! I am a 31 year old female and I finally have the dream career I've always wanted. I used to think this would never be possible for me. I always thought I was too stupid to become an engineer. Hard work, coding everyday and working on projects on my own has helped me get to where I am right now. This is the best day of my life. I have been in college for years and I've worked so hard to get where I am. I just wanted to share the good news. I want you to know your never to old to become a software engineer. Work hard and practice everyday and you will get there someday. I literally spend all of my free time learning even on the weekends. There is so much to learn and the more skills you have the more money you will make. If you are in school, internships help. I wouldn't have gotten this job without that internship on my resume. I could not get any interviews before this internship. The work experience matters the most. I am just so happy right now. I can't believe it!

I hope to inspire more women to join the field! And anyone who wants to become a software engineer! Also feel free to message me for tips. I have a lot of messages but I will try to get back to everyone.

Edit: I did not have to do Leetcode. Thank God because I suck at it. I would not have got the job if they asked me to do Leetcode. Tell me to build a fullstack project and I can do that but since I'm currently taking my data structures and algorithms class I don't yet know a lot about it. But I will get good eventually! Not all places require Leetcode. Also I live in the USA on the East Coast. I think my personality played a huge part in me getting this job. I was a bartender for many years and I have good social skills. I could tell they liked me right off the bat. I think if you are a candidate that has good soft skills that gives you an advantage over others. One more thing, FOCUS ON YOUR GOALS AND NEVER GIVE UP EVEN WHEN IT GETS TOUGH JUST KEEP PUSHING YOURSELF FORWARD. It is not an easy path to get here, it is hard. But it is well worth it!

Edit number 2: I went to community college for 5 years it took me that long just to get my associates degree in computer information systems. I did not know about programming back then. Also the reason it took me so long in school to graduate is because back then I was kind of partying too much and doing stupid stuff. I also have had to work full time the entire time I have been in school so that's another reason it took me longer. I have always had to pay my own bills and I did not have a college fund my parents are broke. I just had to take mostly online classes, some on campus and work at the same time. That is what I am currently doing right now as well. It has not been easy. Many sleepless nights lol. So anyways after that I went to an actual university and started studying computer information systems and security. It is an accelerated bachelors degree program. So takes about 2 years to graduate I started in January 2021 for my bachelors. Anyways after doing that for a year I took a python class and I fell in love with programming. Like I really fell in love with it lol. I found my passion finally. So I decided last year in November to switch my degree to Computer Science. So I really have been only coding for a little less than a year right now but I am a fast learner and I really spend every single day(when I am not working) coding or reading documentation, building my own projects. I have like 40 repos on GitHub. I REALLY went all in. I still am working just as hard because I just love it and I wish I had found my passion sooner in life but I am glad I finally found it! I graduate with a double bachelors degree in Computer Science and Computer Info Tech and Security in December of this year. Also I am getting a BA not a BS because that is all my school offers.

Edit number 3: Here is my work history. I started working at my dad's greenhouse when I was like 12 but I didn't really get paid for that. I ended up moving with my mother at 16 and I got a job at dunkin donuts made minimum wage. At age 18 I started bartending I made like 12 to 13 (whatever minimum wage was at the time) dollars an hour and barely made any tips because the bar was in a very rural area. I bartended for 9 or 10 years. So until I was like 27 years old. Then I worked at a grocery store for 2 years stocking shelves making 13 dollars an hour until I was 29. Then I worked as an office admin for a small business for 2 years making 18 an hour until I was 31. Then in May, I put in my notice and quit my job to take this internship (best thing I ever did) it was a huge risk because I knew I would be out of a job after the internship was over but I knew this experience was so important and I could not miss this opportunity. I have bills to pay so of course I was worried. You gotta take risks sometimes. So I made 23 dollars an hour at this internship. Now I'm 31 a couple months later and I've landed a job as a mid level software engineer making 80 grand a year. So that's like 40 dollars an hour. This is insane. I am beyond excited. I will keep working hard and learning as much as I can!

Edit number 4: I learned Python first, then I took a web programming class and learned HTML CSS and JS. After that I decided to learn C# on my own for like a month because I was starting an internship that required knowledge of .NET and C#. So during that internship I learned an insane amount in just a couple months. I believe I am the most skilled in C# and .NET now and I actually prefer it over other languages. I think it is more difficult to learn than Python. But well worth it to really know how to program. I feel I didn't learn enough with Python. I think a C language is more in depth or Java. Their similar. But yes it's more difficult but I think it's better to learn a more difficult language first. I also learned Angular and Bootstrap at my internship which also come in handy for lots of jobs that still use it. React is popular too. So I learned all this in 9 months which isn't the norm. I think it usually takes people like at least a year or 2 to learn as much as I have. But I really put my all into it everyday and that is what you have to do unless you dont mind learning at a slower pace. Consistency is key to learn in ths field. I believe it's important to code everyday and learn something new. There's just so much to learn in this vast field."

No internships (that could be a whole other rant, but it was essentially the same issue as I‚Äôm having now). I took a job with Deloitte consulting last July because it was quite literally the single job offer I got throughout my whole time in college. I never really anticipated staying long, I was just interested in the prestigious name on my resume, and lately I have been browsing for new job opportunities aligned to traditional software development.

The point of my post is, I have applied to hundreds of jobs at this point, and no exaggeration, I can count on one hand the amount of times I‚Äôve received an online assessment or had the opportunity to speak to a human being. My resume was probably really shitty back in school, hence why I never got any internships, but that unfortunately is in the past, and there is nothing I can do now. Is not having any software dev internship really that big of a deal? I‚Äôm pretty confident in my resume now otherwise. Recently, Software Development manager from FAANG commented on this subreddit that his team was hiring entry level. I chatted with him and shared my resume. My resume can‚Äôt be too bad considering how he referred me for the role after all the vultures in here did the same. But as per usual, I got auto rejected AFTER BEING REFERRED BY THE DAMN TEAM LEAD. I don‚Äôt expect to be instantly hired, but really, no chance to prove myself? Literally what do I do from here?

I know I sound a bit bitchy rn, but this definitely isn‚Äôt a huge issue right now. I make great money and am very fortunate for that, but at some point I would like to make it into software development before the window closes. It‚Äôs getting tough to keep up on my technical skills working 50-60 hours a week + applying to jobs and networking. At this rate, even if I managed to get an OA I would probably bomb it because it‚Äôs been so long since I reviewed DSA

Edit: 
Here is my resume https://imgur.com/a/zKw9y3o

Open to all constructive criticism. One thing I‚Äôve thought about is adding back personal projects, but that seems a bit unprofessional now that I‚Äôm out of college, and I‚Äôm also trying to keep it one page.

With that said, should I apply to internships along with full-time positions when I start my job search at the end of the month? In general, I feel way behind my peers and I worry a lot of how the job search is going to go for me. The thought of going straight into a full-time position without any prior experience is definitely frightening to me, and I feel that the expectations of an intern might suit me better for my first software development position. I've tried looking around online before making this post but I couldn't find a clear general consensus.

wemvmm,3,2022-08-02,Journey to a 140k TC new grad offer working remotely in MCOL.,Seedless--Watermelon,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/wemvmm/journey_to_a_140k_tc_new_grad_offer_working/,"I see a lot of misinformation being given to college students and am writing this to provide some insight on my journey. Before that some quick stats I feel would be helpful:

* Rising senior at a state school studying IT
* First-generation college student
* 3 previous internships
* The typical story got into IT by building my first gaming PC.

&amp;#x200B;

I mention the first generation part to stress the fact I had no prior connections within the industry before starting school, I am the first in my family to go to college, and both parents work min-wage jobs, the typical upbringing one expects from immigrant parents. I would spend my entire weekend working in restaurants to help pay for school and spend the week going to school/studying, during summers I would work full time during the week at my internships and then serve on the weekends.

With that being said, the number one factor that I have noticed amongst students, specifically those studying IT, is that they spend 4 years screwing around and not thinking about how they would like to shape their career. There is no reason you should spend 4 years studying IT, screw around and end up working at a help desk as a new grad. Not to bash on helpdesk,  my first internship was on a help desk team and it really opened my eyes to what IT has to offer. Moving into my internship experience

* 1st Summer Internship heading Sophmore Year - Typical help desk internship, learned AD, imaging machines etc. The key call out here, this was the first time I was exposed to Azure and I was hooked. From reading articles online and just hearing the buzz about the company moving to Azure, I knew two things at first, it sounded important, and anytime I googled salaries regarding Azure all I saw was $$$$. I just knew this would be a good path to research heading back into my Fall Semester.
   * Approx application submitted: 100+
* Sophomore Fall Semester - I was hooked on Azure, I would spend a lot of time reading any and every subreddit dedicated to Azure and set the goal of getting AZ 104 certified by the end of the year, and use that to leverage applying to any Azure/DevOps centric internships. Lucky for all of us, there are a ton!
* 2nd Internship Sophomore Spring Semester into Summer - After getting the AZ 104, and applying to literally over 200+ DevOps internships, I managed to land an internship in a cloud engineering team. My knowledge exploded here, was doing FTE work a couple of months in, naturally became a SME in PowerShell, Terraform, and just automating tasks and making life easier for the team. Key callouts here:
   * I knew what kind of role I wanted, literally anything with Azure in it, and did not stop applying till I got an offer. This involved refreshing LinkedIn job postings multiple times a day, hours into the late night applying to stuff etc
   * I had no idea at first what I was doing, I was a 20-year-old with free reign to our Azure tenant, lots of learning on the job, picking brains, etc
   * Very nice pay for an intern
   * Remote
   * Was during Covid so worked remotely and went to school remotely at the same time.
   * Extended internship multiple times, I was doing amazing work and I liked the team and vice versa
   * Towards the end of the internship, realizes I wanted to move into a more security-focused role, got AZ 500 certified and started taking on more security-focused tasks
   * Applications sent: 200+
* 3rd internship into senior year - moved into interning in cloud security. At this point, I had talked to enough people and done the research and knew the cloud was big $$, but hey, who doesn't like more money and challenges? Hence the move to cloud security, long story short here, busted my ass learning and networking in the company. Key callouts here:
   * New Grad Offer: 140k+ TC remote
   * Never stopped learning
   * Applications submitted: 200+ to get internship

Some misc bonuses from always seeking out internships, extending them and upskilling

* Lots of $$ for a student which meant:
   * Paid off school - graduating with 0 debt
   * Multiple trips in and out of the country - leaving the country for 2 weeks here soon
   * While I worked hard, it allowed me to party even harder on the weekends

&amp;#x200B;

For all my college students out there, here are my key callouts to sum everything up

* Apply, apply, apply then apply some more to internships, there is no reason you should spend a summer sitting on your ass when you could be out in the real world learning and getting paid
* Find your niche - DevOps, Cloud, Databases, Networking, Data etc. This one is hard. Lots of research to be done here, stalk LinkedIn, subreddits, salary for these roles etc. This point may be debatable but all successful interns I have worked with have found their niche and passion within tech
* Apply to more internships.
* Once you find your niche, UPSKILL. Whether it be certs or labbing around, find the time. Lets face it, most IT major classes are a joke, you can find the time this is what will separate you from others.
* Party hard - Between applying to internships, self studying, dealing with school and any job you may have, find the time to party hard, or whatever hobbies make you happiest!
* Apply to even more internships.
* Communication - Learn to effectively communicate with others, don't be the stereotypical IT nerd who can't hold a conversation with anyone.
* Apply to more internships.
* ""You pretty much won't get anywhere extraordinary if you only do things that are ordinary (following the advice %50 percent of people will follow, will by definition make you average)"

(more information about the program is posted below but no need to read it unless you want to)

My program opens up another workbook but this error pops up every time.

https://preview.redd.it/3hsnaa748df91.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53be9adc211b07f791035b350786d3682208d9db

I get an error about the links not updating. (photo posted of the error). I have two options, either continue or edit links. 

I would like to just bypass this error and have the program just continue without the user having to enter anything. Is this possible?

(and if anyone feels like explaining why this type of error happens that would be much appreciated haha)

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

(extra info on the project if interested)

Basically, I am opening many workbooks from different places around the company and copying and pasting some info into a master excel workbook that's used as a database. (I know excel isn't a database and all that but that's just what my company does). The code all runs from a button that's pressed on the master excel workbook. My code opens up the smaller workbooks, copies the data, pastes the data, and then closes the smaller workbooks."

Unfortunately, due to personal (mainly medical) reasons, I missed the email completely and missed the chance of getting scheduled for my interview.

I did email the recruiter back as soon as I saw the invite, but they apologized saying that the ""recruiting for this round was finished.""

Now there is a new posting for the same internship position. I was able to get an internship this summer and added a little more to my resume.

I was planning on emailing the recruiter my new resume (since I was able to get a response back from the last time I emailed them), hoping they see it live in case my resume gets lost within the digital submission void.

I am looking for some assistance on what to write in the email. What things should I mention?

I feel kinda screwed cus I ghosted the first invite, and am anxious that this ""behavior"" may decrease my chances of getting interviewed again at this company."

With that said, should I apply to internships along with full-time positions when I start my job search at the end of the month? In general, I feel way behind my peers and I worry a lot of how the job search is going to go for me. The thought of going straight into a full-time position without any prior experience is definitely frightening to me, and I feel that the expectations of an intern might suit me better for my first software development position. I've tried looking around online before making this post but I couldn't find a clear general consensus. I'd just like to make sure I spend my time as effectively as possible when I start looking for a job quite soon."
weqjri,1,2022-08-02,Am I too old to apply for an internship?,[deleted],gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/weqjri/am_i_too_old_to_apply_for_an_internship/,"Im 27 and currently unemployed and living in a developing country (3rd World to be more explicit) 

I have been struggling to get a job in the industry as a Junior, I have had multiple interviews and managed to go far but at the end I never get the offer, and of course some studios/companies don't answer me back. 

Im currently trying to apply for tech artist positions since I know how to code and also do art, my portfolio is quite decent too, but man it almost feels impossible to just get a job, first of all, Junior positions are scarce, most positions out there are for Seniors or Leads, and I recently had an interview with a big studio where everything was going so great and I felt confident about myself finally (I have imposter syndrome so bad) and I ended up not getting the job and someone with less skill than me (based on portfolio) got the job, Is a long story and I don't want to get into detail but I feel frustrated and bad about it. 

I believe my status as a foreigner makes thing much harder for me, I've read in some places that the process of relocation is more suitable for Seniors/Leads and is very rare for Juniors for that to happen. Game studios usually hire Juniors from local talent, not exactly from overseas. 

I've found many studios (Indie &amp; AAA) that offer Internships but I don't know if Im too old for that and still will be rejected. I have previous experience doing coding and ArchViz, but Im pretty much a Junior in the game industry since I don't have prior experience working on videogames (although I've worked on VR projects) 

These studios are located in Canada, and some of them state that I should have already a work permit from Canada to be considered in joining an internship. Before I start to do all this process, I want to know if I still have a chance to hit an internship or if the studios will reject me for basically being 'old'. I know some people started their game dev career in their 30s, some people even up to their 40s, but I really really want to break it into the industry before my 30s. 

Should I keep trying on getting a job as a Junior, or is it worth to give a try to internships since they pretty much give you experience. 

Thanks"

I will now have to take out a loan to pay my tuition since I failed after I took a certain amount of courses already. Overall the course was not that bad but it just got too hard to balance between college and the bootcamp that I ended up falling behind. Honestly, I really regret signup for the bootcamp. It taught me to be a full stack developer, which at the time, I did not realize was something I was not interested in. 

This won‚Äôt be the end of my coding journey though. I am now learning coding for games through udemy and am happier than ever (besides my massive debt lmao) 

Any tips going forward will be appreciated :)

Edit: some common questions i see
Why did I sign up for a bootcamp while still in college? 
- I realize now it was extremely stupid but back when I signed up a year ago, my friends were all getting internships already and I felt really behind especially since my major was not in that field at all. I really did not want to go into the med field at that point (covid-19 really showed how stressful and intense the med field was). So I went ahead and signed up for a PART-TIME bootcamp (I should‚Äôve stated that in the beginning) as the registration lady said many college students take this route as well. üòÖüòÖ now i know that there were many other options I could have done. It is a lesson learned."

Since working at my current job I‚Äôve basically forgotten a good bit of what I have listed on my resume because what I did learn I never use at my current job. Well an employer reached out to me and invited me to an interview. 

This job is a million times more complex than what I‚Äôm doing now and I‚Äôm really worried I‚Äôll look like a fool in the interview.

wes8am,2,2022-08-02,My experience living at The Wynwood,pepper_wheels_15,ufl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/wes8am/my_experience_living_at_the_wynwood/,"Hey y'all, I figured why not put a thorough review of an apartment on here for people to reference in the future. I had my lease from Aug 20, 2021 through July 31st, 2022.

\*\*This is just my experience and I'm very aware that everyone has, can, and will have their own experiences and they are just as real and valid!\*\*

**TLDR: I had a bad experience. Poor quality apartment, appliances, and neighbors. Amenities weren't great or accessible half the lease. Location and one super helpful maintenance man were the biggest benefits.**

Type: 2/1.5 upgraded

Monthly rent: $645 each

Utilities: Winter months: $85ish total Summer: $145ish total

My friend and I decided to live together after I had moved out of an apartment where the private owner decided to sell the place to someone who didn't want to rent it out anymore. I was away for the summer and my friend was the one doing the touring of apartments. It was coming down to the end of July and we still had no leads on places when he toured the Wynwood and they had a spot available. From the unit they showed him and the pics he sent me we felt it was pretty good for the price. Plus, if we signed within 48 hours, we'd each get some fees waived and a $250 VISA gift card. Not bad we thought.

Our move in date was Aug 20th, but the first month's rent wasn't prorated. Parking passes were around $30-40 for a place that has more than enough parking for residents and guests. We didn't know what our address was until the week before we moved in. They wouldn't accept our credit scores even though both of us have higher than the required credit so we had to get guarantors. Just a few little things before moving in that made me a little wary of the management.

Move in day rolls around and I pull up to ask where the building is and they don't know. So my roommate and I parked and walked around the whole complex eventually finding it and walked into a whole mess. The unit smelled like someone ripped through 6 packs of cigs an hour before move in. My asthmatic roommate started hacking up a lung as soon as he stepped inside. ""Upgraded"" meant having a washer/dryer in the unit. We weren't shown or told that the washer and dryer were going to be one machine, that was also kept in my half bath. The floors were all bubbled up from previous water damage, roaches scattered on the kitchen counters as we walked by, vents and windows hadn't been cleaned to where mold and algae were growing on both, and the place was furnished when we asked for unfurnished. We were convinced we were given the wrong apartment because in one of the rooms there was a move in folder with an entirely different person's name. So we walked over to the management's office where the management team except 1 person looked up from the table and ran away as we walked up. We explained our situation to the guy who stayed and he went inside the building and came out with our move in folder and told us we were in the right place. We explained the current situation and he told us that the best he could do was have maintenance come in and remove the furniture.

Once all the furniture was removed we did our best deep clean of the place and finally began moving our stuff in around 5pm. Our first two nights were horrible and as someone who has never had asthma symptoms, I felt like my lungs were closing in on me the whole night. Can't imagine how my roommate felt. We went back to management and asked about any extra cleaning that could be done about the smoke and they offered to do this ""OZONE"" treatment but that we'd have to vacate the place for 3 days. We weren't allowed to enter the unit at all during those 3 days. We didn't really have a choice as we both were miserable and were lucky enough to have friends we could bunk with.

4 days later we still had no word on when we could move back in. Our door was still taped over with a ""caution: do not enter"" sign and even after talking with management again we weren't any closer to moving back in. Finally after 6 and a half days we got the word it was safe to go back in and we found the smoke smell to be basically just masked over with a new, somehow musty version of a new car smell. This was the best we were going to get.

It didn't take long for our neighbors upstairs to start having parties past 3am seemingly nightly. Even after talking with them, management, and even GPD who had been called by someone else, nothing was ever done. Our dishwasher stopped cleaning dishes and flooded our kitchen 3 months in. Our all-in-one washer/dryer unit could fit about 2 day's worth of clothes and left them smelling like a hoarding grandma's guest bedroom - but moist. No natural light whatsoever so it was constantly dark and our rooms had no included ceiling lights. Just over the acceptable limit of roaches present in a 1st floor Gainesville apartment never went away no matter how much cleaning, roach spray and traps we used. The constant cigarette smell never went away to where my clothes started picking up the smell. Wifi connectivity was always an issue and I'd constantly have zoom meetings interrupted with bad service even with all my equipment in my room. The garbage truck at the neighboring complex would come at 7am sharp. Landscaping would start promptly at 8am. Latch was more annoying than helpful and I would have preferred a physical key or key pad versus having to have my door linked to my phone. The thermostats would never stay at the set temp you wanted for longer than an hour. The gym wasn't completed until a number of months in and then was locked up for additional months due to COVID restrictions. Around December, there was a water leak coming from our ceiling above our kitchen. I went to work the next day and came home to a hole about the size of a satchels pizza in the ceiling. Luckily I had an internship that took me out of Gainesville during Spring semester.

Out of all that, there is some good. The plaza area is pretty walkable to some restaurants and shops. The Publix across the street was in construction our whole lease so we never got to see the benefit from that but it will be a good walkable option for anyone who doesn't have a car. Campus and Archer Rd are reasonably bikeable for classes and work. Loblolly park wasn't too far for a little nature break. The neighborhood a short walk down 2nd Ave was always a nice and quiet escape offering some less visited park areas as well. The bus was usually on time and only took about 10 minutes to get to where I'd hop off to go to class. On the return trip, the stop you'd get off was about the 3rd or 4th one. I never had to go searching for parking far from my unit. My friends never had an issue parking over 3 days (we figure it's only an issue during football season). 

Super happy I don't live there anymore and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. I have read about some of the more actually ""upgraded"" units being nicer so I'd start there if you still plan on moving there in the future. Again, this is just MY experience and anyone who has had a positive experience living there is just as valid as mine. Compare! Contrast! Ask all the questions if you ever tour! If anyone has any questions I'd be happy to share more! Stay safe Gators!"

Mainly because of his mindset, he always feel like people have very high expectations towards him and he‚Äôs a perfectionist, so he gives himself a lot of pressure, which led to him feeling stressed out a lot and always thinking bout giving up.

So my boyfriend [24M] just started a new job in this company for almost a month, and he‚Äôs already thinking of leaving the job because he couldn‚Äôt handle the stress from it.

The problem is, this happened to both his previous jobs too. He got into a great company for internship and worked for few months, his boss liked him a lot and offered him a full time job there but he rejected because he isn‚Äôt happy with the boss and felt like the team is too small, and he felt stressful from the job. 

So he jumped to another company and worked for only 3 months, and left again because his didn‚Äôt like his boss. After that he joined this company he‚Äôs currently working at.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal to jump from one job to another like that after working for only a few months? I have a full time job and a few part time jobs and I am handling it well. Is it a problem that he has low stress tolerance or is it reasonable that he gives up easily because he‚Äôs not enjoying his job?"
wextem,5,2022-08-03,Any chances for getting into a US grad school for computer science?,Independent_Edge5481,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/wextem/any_chances_for_getting_into_a_us_grad_school_for/,"Hello everyone.

I am concerned about the possibility of securing a grad school admission in the US, so I decided to post here and seek some guidance as to what are my chances and how can I improve them. 

I'm currently an undergrad at one of the most prestigious institutions in my country; I'm not a US resident. I'm majoring in Management Sciences with a minor in Computer Science. I'll be starting my senior year this fall. I have a 3.65+ CGPA with a spot in the Dean's Honor List in every year since my freshman year. I have As and A-s in almost all CS courses that I have taken such as Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics, Data Mining, and a couple of programming courses. I have also studied Linear Algebra, Probability &amp; Statistics, Econometrics, and Game Theory with As in all of them except for Linear Algebra in which I had an A-. I'm also interning at a small US-based firm as a Data Science Intern.

I haven't yet given my GRE but I'm aiming for a 320+ score. I'll be working on a machine learning related capstone project soon. My instructor suggested that there may be a possibility of getting a publication based on the research for that project but I'm not too sure about it's novelty as I don't think it will be that ground-breaking. But seeing that I have no solid research experience, I guess that that would be at least a start. Would it be advisable to also become involved with some research that is being undertaken by a professor at my university? Or would a possible publication resulting from my capstone project suffice?

I have shortlisted around 5-6 US universities to which I plan to apply for a doctoral degree in computer science. All of these universities have QS rankings from 100 to 200. The things that are troubling me are my lack of research experience and whether or not these universities would prefer a CS degree for their graduate programs as my major is not in CS. I read the admission requirements to these universities and some have certain CS courses such as those in Computer Architecture as pre-requisites which I have not yet studied. I am also interested in machine learning applications and having a hard time deciding what course to take: the one in machine learning, or one in computer architecture. 

TL;DR: In summary, I have the following concerns.

* Given my profile, are there any chances of me getting an admission in a grad school for CS in the US? If not, how can I improve them?
* Whether or not it is necessary for me take a course in Computer Architecture seeing that I would have to forego a course in Machine Learning.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

I was a business administration major and had one operations internship and some student leadership  experience. My current job pays about 50k plus bonus and 401k which vests automatically so I kind of consider it like added money to my total salary. I love the company and have been here for almost a year and the role is interesting but I am interested in moving in a product management direction. 

I got a job offer from a company that is in the same industry (they reached out to me) but not the same market for an entry level product coordinator role but the pay is basically just my base salary and they would not really budge much. They also took a while to get back to me  but they are a solid more established brand. 

For more context, I live in a HCOL area (one of the highest in the country) and would like to move out of my parents home in the next year. It honestly seems like with a year out of college and some transferable skills that the offer should have been for more so I am thinking of turning it down and trying to go in this direction at my current company. Am I crazy thinking that that salary is a bit too low and is it a terrible idea to wait around? 

It seems like product is way more ""impactful"" than my current role and in general all the data seems to show it to be worth more to companies than my current role. Would you take the lower pay but job in a field you are interested in pursuing or wait for a role to open in your current company? I have not made many connections yet within my companies product area but I think they would be willing to let me grow, they have a good reputation in the industry (up in comer probably the best in 3-5 years ) and considering my current compensation I feel like they might pay better. Everyone around me also says that the salary they are trying to pay seems way too low even for someone who is basically a new grad but like am I just not being realistic?

I am a software developer with 4+ YoE. The main motive behind doing this course was to get a formal education in Computer Science as my bachelor's degree was in Electrical/Electronics domain. I have completed 6 courses by now.   
1. RAIT 2. GIOS 3. CV 4. CN 5. DL 6. HPC

I wanted to do ML specialization since I have some background in it through an internship I did while I was in college and liked it. But for last 4 years I have not used ML in any of my professional work. While selecting subjects the thought was to do 5 required ML courses to get the specialization while also focusing on some of the basic CS courses which in this case falls in the Computing Systems specialization. 

But, as I am nearing course completion, I am becoming unsure of how to make the best of this course in terms of job seeking in ML/AI domain. The main issue is while I will have a specialization in this domain, I wouldn't have any recent projects or relevant work experience to back it up. So, one year later from now when I will apply for ML/AI dev roles with 5+ YoE, how would it impact my chances? Will I have to settle for entry level SDE roles if I would want a job in ML/AI roles?

Have folks been in a similar situation, what would you advise me?   


TL;DR No work exp in ML/AI domain, doing ML specialization. How would it impact my chances of getting hired for ML roles considering I am a software developer with 4+ YoE and no work history in this domain."

I am a fresher computer science engineer who is currently working as a Jr. backend developer (I use python and javascript to debug stuff for clients using our product).

I don't enjoy the job. It's 6 days per week from 8 to 5 (Commuting 1+ hours). Leaving less time for me to learn. Especially because I live in a strict household forcing me to sleep early.

I work well with programming. But getting out of touch now. I like frontend development (ReactJS, flutter etc.) and would also like cloud engineering. And some time in the future would like to go into the blockchain industry.

My ambition is all over the place. No mentors to guide me. No friends who actively engage in conversations about the tech world with me. Basically, awkward. Like this post.

Am I doing the right thing by quitting? If I do quit, what should I focus on?  


Edit: If I don't quit, I have to give 2 year commitment to the current job

NewEdit: Thank you for all the upvotes. I will greatly appreciate anyone sharing good tips for upskilling in my case.

Edit#3: Thank you for all the comments. 

Gave me more clarity on what to do and the privileges I do have. It may have been a dumb question in some peoples pov but I am glad I asked this.

This is my first job and every 3 weeks, I have seen people quit from there looking for better opportunities. (They are all recruited on an internship basis with low salary)

 Majority of the opinions lean towards upskilling while staying in the job. And I absolutely love the tips and advices I got from here."

It's a bad habit that I'm trying to shake off but it comes and bites my ass every so often.

So,Im interning at this production house and I'm halfway through my internship. The production house had a rule of backing up all files after filming.So far it has been alright and the company got a gig to make a new smartphone commercial. And in order to plan for the shoot, we were given commercial modes of the phone to test it out. Due to it being an android phone, most features and apps gotta be logged into with a Google account to function and I volunteered my own personal account as a temporary solution. I got the confirmation that no one was gonna snoop through my stuff like emails and social media from my boss so I thought all is fine. The filming went pass by with zero hiccups and some shots had to be done with the phone to show off it's camera.I assumed the phone was given back to the smartphone company after the shooting. 

After the shoot, I asked by my boss to work from home due to my roommate getting covid and my bosses ain't risking me coming in. While at home, the other intern had his hands on the smartphone and accessed my personal stuff like my Instagram and Gmail. He even screenshoted it to me. I was shock and asked him to stop it,which he did. I,in the heat of the moment, thought in order to avoid it from happening,I just remotely log out of my phone through Google. It didn't work fully cause the intern then screenshotted my Insta to me after I asked him to. I then learnt you could remove all logins with the find my phone feature and erase all data. I, still not thinking it properly, decided I'll do that and all problems solved.

3 hours later and a phone call from my boss. He was asking why is the phone formatted and where did the footage go. I then told him there should be a backup and he said it wasnt made yet cause there was another shoot with the phone occuring later at night. After realising that,I told my boss that I nuked the phone cause my privacy but was scolded for not at least telling him before nuking it.

I was then told there was a meeting later with me,my superior and my boss regarding my future at the company.

TLDR: I formatted a smartphone used for filming with the footage still inside, thus in the process risking my internship."

I can't seem to find any open source tools for this task.

As a work around, I BLAST'd the first 500 lines of each of the sequences and compare their identities with the results. However, I feel that this amount of genomic data isn't enough to accurately separate them as they as the first 500 lines of their FASTA, but I think a lot of this could be coding for housekeeping genes and thus not going to be not that different between several species.

wf5d8x,58,2022-08-03,Formerly jaded engineer feeling the tug of learning...,Gingerbread_Uprising,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/wf5d8x/formerly_jaded_engineer_feeling_the_tug_of/,"Quick  history: I grew up in the US and was pretty decent at math and science in high school, but not  disciplined enough to be great (top ¬†5% but not top 1%). I did get  into programming though because I liked video games. I had a decent  academic strategy, some smarts, and some luck, so I still got into an  ivy league school, which I was proud of. There, I started in computer  science, but decided to round out my skills and switched to electrical  engineering. Circuits were fun and the I was developing an interest in  some of the mathematical aspects. I graduated late, after taking a  year-long internship. I then worked for a year as an EE at a small  consultancy to get experience. I enjoyed it overall, particularly the  analog stuff where I could flex the old math muscles a bit in filter  design, etc. But I needed to get out of my town. I made a big change in  my life, moved to Europe (I have German citizenship by blood, and using it to work in the Netherlands), and got a dream job working in a virtual  reality startup. It's been a little over a year since then, which brings  us to today.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I find that I identify less as an engineer than I used to. In school, I identified heavily with the applied side, but now I think that's more due to jadedness and an avoidance of traditional academia. I was was nearly crushed by the course workload, largely because I was spread too thin. I took classes solely based on what I wanted to learn and less on what I thought I could handle.

&amp;#x200B;

As life is settling down, I'm starting to wonder if I shouldn't make a life correction. To be clear, I enjoy my job usually, this country is cool, and I'm happy overall. This isn't an ""existential crisis,"" but I'm trying to formulate a plan for the future so I can get the ball rolling.

I'm mostly past the imposter syndrome phase of the junior engineer life, but I think it's a clash of personality. It seems like my favorite part of this job is always the ""understand it"" part and then I quickly lose motivation and interest in the ""make it work"" part. Unfortunately, nobody is paying me to ""understand"" stuff, which causes friction at times (I'm working on this for the sake of the job, but it's a grind)... All of this said, I'm starting to think, what if I'm an academic at heart?

I'm also seeing evidence in my everyday life. For example, in the evenings, I continue to study Japanese daily in preparation JLPT N1 (I started in university. It was a big time commitment that only made it harder for me to graduate, but I enjoyed it too much...). In the mornings I enjoy reading (lately it's Greek and Roman philosophy). When I workout, I listen to podcasts from exercise scientists who discuss recent studies and the overly esoteric ins and outs of strength training. On weekends when I have time, I like brushing up on calculus.

Do you think my personality would lend itself to science? It might seem dumb, but I've never done real ""research"" before, so maybe it's just a ""grass is greener"" thing. It seems I enjoy learning, but it would be presumptive to say that academia is synonymous with learning, so I'm unsure. I'm basically so deep in the dark I only have romanticized mental images to go off of. It seems it would be fun to go back to school for physics or math, but I don't know what that reality even looks like...  


And frankly, I'm afraid it would look like a repeat of my undergrad experience. I burned out hard at the end, and it left a sour taste in my mouth. I'm usually a very easy-going person and enjoy work-life balance. I don't want to return to overly long hours and ""grind hard"" culture (""Publish or perish"" pressure also seems toxic as hell). Even if I did apply to a grad program, I was jaded enough in my undergrad time to stop caring about traditional academic excellence. My grades were ultimately 'meh' (GPA \~3.3/4.0), it's been like three years since then, I never did research, and none of my professors really remember me I suspect... I don't know how I'd even get into grad school...

&amp;#x200B;

So TLDR:

&amp;#x200B;

What is grad school and academia really like?

Does a love of learning imply enjoyment of academia?

What strategies do I have available if I did try for school again?

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm much more mature and have better tools than I used to for dealing with stress and jadedness, but I don't want to invite these things back in either. Nor do I want to make a fear-based decision either. I need some advice from somebody with more experience and clarity than I have right now. Thanks in advance.

To give some background, I interned with a company last summer and virtually throughout the school year. I absolutely loved it - the job itself, the company, and the people at the company. At the end of last summer, I was interviewing for full-time positions to start when I graduated. I was more than happy to be returning. I received an offer from a manager at the company and gladly accepted it, without negotiating. I didn‚Äôt negotiate because it was sort of a weird situation of them flat out stating the amount without giving me an HR person to talk to. In hindsight, I *totally* should‚Äôve negotiated and that is **my first tip to you**. Do your research on what the market is offering and fight for what you are worth. The worst they can say is no. After learning from some of my colleagues after returning, they say the company doesn‚Äôt negotiate with anyone anyway (üö©).

**The second piece of advice** I would give is to ask important questions to *you* when you are in an interview. Of course, you can do a Google search on what questions to ask an interviewer and pick the ones that best relate to what you want to know. But, actually coming up with some intelligent questions on your own can make all the difference. Not only are you not sounding like every other candidate, but you are getting closer to the answers you are looking for. An important question that can typically be asked by anyone without sounding like a robot is ‚ÄúWhy is this position open?‚Äù In my current role, I am able to finish my work for the day in 2 hours yet I am required to come into the office‚Ä¶ so I just sit there for the other 6 hours. It would‚Äôve helped to ask that question because it seems like my position is not really needed.

**The third piece of advice** I would give is to not be afraid to leave a situation you are uncomfortable in. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean physically uncomfortable; mental well-being is also important. From the start of my internship to 3 weeks after I began my full-time role, nearly 10 people had left my team of approximately 25 people (another üö©), including the manager that had hired me and her boss too. While their positions had been filled by new people who I (for the most part) like, some of the management positions were filled by internal candidates with little to no managerial experience. In my new role, I‚Äôve been severely micromanaged and have had condescending remarks made towards me by our management. It‚Äôs not a good feeling.

After just 3 weeks on the job, I was looking and applying for new jobs in the area. After 6 weeks, I was offered a new job paying 50% more (a sign that I was getting underpaid, not that I‚Äôm now going to be getting overpaid). Am I going to be cutting ties with my current company for leaving so soon? Potentially. But if it means I‚Äôm getting treated fairly in terms of workplace relationships and pay, I think it‚Äôs totally worth it and acceptable. Be professional if you ever have to do this as it will make things less awkward and help minimize the impact your decision has on everyone.

I know this is long, but I feel that it is very relatable and valuable advice for most of us here. Take the pieces of advice that you want to take out of this. And make wise decisions from what you have learned from my ‚Äúmistakes.‚Äù 

**TL;DR**
1. Negotiate. If they don‚Äôt budge on salary, look into your benefits and negotiate there.
2. Ask the right questions to the interviewer for the information *you* are looking to get.
3. Stand up for yourself in the workplace and don‚Äôt be afraid to leave at anytime.
4. If something seems like a red flag, trust your gut. I ignored the things I identified as red flags."

wf81uu,2,2022-08-03,Should I change my job?,emscarstairs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wf81uu/should_i_change_my_job/,"So, I'm F 23, started working on a small company, it's an internship for Marketing, but I'm actually working as SDR, investigating leads and calling them through phone to qualify their buying potencial. The job sucks, calling other companies to see if they have interest to buy the solution my company offers isn't rewarding, people don't want to be bothered, and most of the times they hung their phone before I can even present myself, so when I imagined working with Marketing, It wasn't like that I imagined ""reaching"" the public.

I work 6 hours per day, the payment is reasonable, and the people on the company are friendly. But they did remind me this is just a period of test, to initially start as an intern, then if they like my performance they would promote to a more stable role. They also said because they are small there are plenty room for me to grow and nothing prohibits me of taking another role inside the company.
But, the SDR job does little to teach me about Marketing, and sincerely, even though I'm putting a lot of efforts, from 60 calls in a week, one person might have an interest or not, mostly not. So I'm being unable to reach their goal of getting more clients to their base. And it's already been a month, meaning that I only have two more ahead of me and Idk if they will want me to stay or just decide for someone else. They did say that what they want was someone that compromised and not just settle down doing a mediocre job  which I think I'm putting a lot of effort, but still also concerns me that I won't be able to get the job, they might decide for someone else, and I have my education and living bills to pay, so this uncertainty really kills me.

Then I decided applying for several other jobs,and got an interview this Friday for Trade Marketing Assistant in a company that I already applied before, so I know they are kinda small, the commute is longer than my actual job, and probably will be more hours than my currently working hours. But the payment might increase and if I pass I might gain some stability, besides working on my area. But I don't know if the environment there is healthy or toxic ( my currently one is very friendly), and sincerely, I'm done with toxic companies, besides it also depends a lot if I'll pass the interview or not.

So, I really would like an advice about this, if I should stay where I am, with the possibility of not getting effective inside the company, or if try this interview taking the risk of losing what I have now. I don't have any other person in life I could ask this, that's why I decided to make this post."

My prime query is, how important is the BCA college for someone like me who's going to do MCA after BCA inevitably. I'll appear for the NIMCET in 2026/27 most probably. 
I'm already a decent programmer and let's be honest, CS is less about the college and more about the internet anyways. I'm going to be more comfortable doing it form my hometown where I have all the amenities to learn and get internship, but the college will probably be one which you've never heard of. Good CGPA won't be a issue, but doe the UG college really matter? I'm aiming for the Top NITs for the MCA and I'm pretty sure I'll land myself in either the Top NIT or VIT V. What should I do?
Pursue BCA from VIT V,  where I know my personal projects will be lot less and other contributions will likely be less, pursue it from Calcutta where I'll face some. Problems bc the damn institutes are pretty much out of the city or do it from my shady  local college, where I'm sure I'll be able to keep a great CGPA and do a lot more personal projects, competitive coding and open source contributions? Btw again, I'm going to do MCA for sure so there's no point about placements and crowd cause ik they'll be meh except for VIT V, where I'll be close to them damn CSE students whom I'm trying to keep up with. What should I do?

wfao2x,1,2022-08-03,Deciding to Take a Gap Semester from College To Purse a Career Opportunity,neoud,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/wfao2x/deciding_to_take_a_gap_semester_from_college_to/,"I'm working at a FAANG company right now as an intern as I was just offered a fall position on a different team at the same company with the possibility to extend into spring. I have a couple issues that are possibly stoping me from taking this position. 

My first issue is that I'm on financial aid at my expensive private university and I will be making 'big tech money'. I'm afraid that the money that I will make will impact my financial aid since I will have to report my earnings in my CSS file, and the amount of money I will make might be enough to just mess up how much gift aid I receive. My family is not rich, we'd maybe able to pay a little more than before but we have no gauge of how much my tuition will increase because of this so it's dangerous. Also, my sibling goes to another private college, and their financial aid is contingent on the fact that my parents are paying for 2 kids in college. If there is only 1 then we are afraid that her school would also give her less aid as well since my parents would technically be paying for only 1 child. Does anyone know any way around this? Is this even a good idea at this point? Not to mention the fact that I'd have to find someone to sublease my space at my university apartment while I'm gone which will be difficult since the school semester starts this month (2 weeks) and my lease technically started at the beginning of this month. I'd also have to find new housing at the location of the internship, but I anticipate this to be less of a hurdle than the prior obstacles. Just to add more fire to the flame, my parents hate the idea of me taking time off of school (very old school parents). My parents are worried because I'm midway through college and I would be delaying graduation, also I wouldn't be in the same classes as most of my friends anymore, but these things don't seem like things I really care too much about. 

I really want to take this position considering I haven't been having the best time at college for a plethora of reasons, so it seems like a great opportunity. I had to move out of my home-state for the summer to pursue this internship and I really don't want to leave, I love it here. If I took this new internship with this new team, I'd be able to stay here for at least another season since the new job is located here too at the same company. It seems like such a dream. The team I would be joining is working on a project to help African kids, and as an African its something I'd be really passionate about. The role also fits my skills perfectly and the manager already really likes me. The company I'd be working for is amazing and the extra resume boost would be great. I wouldn't have the burden of going back to university, where I don't feel like I belong. I feel like I belong here. I'm in-between a rock and a hard place, my heart is telling me to take the job but theres so many hurdles. Not sure what to do, not sure what's best for me. Any advice?"

wfbsb3,102,2022-08-03,tips for finding a college that fits YOU,goingsomewhereihope,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wfbsb3/tips_for_finding_a_college_that_fits_you/,"Lots of people talk about the importance of ""fit"" when choosing a place to spend the next four years of your life, but that's a pretty nebulous goal. To get you started, here are a whole bunch of questions you can ask to find somewhere that's right for you!

SETTING: Don't rule it off as superficial, liking the place you live is a big deal.

1. **Weather**: Do temperatures over 80 make your brain stop working? Does a Midwestern winter sound like the ninth circle of hell? Is the leaves changing color the only thing that alerts you to the passage of time as the school year gets into full swing? Make sure you have an idea of what climate you'd be dealing with year round [https://weatherspark.com](https://weatherspark.com)
2. **Urban/Rural**: NYU may seem like the fulfillment of all your big-city dreams, but that doesn't mean that NYC won't smell like urine when it's hot out. Maybe milking cows far from civilization at Deep Springs sounds peaceful, or maybe it makes you want to hurl. What kind of activities do you like, and is not having them nearby a dealbreaker for you? If you want to get off campus, is public transportation readily available or will you have to find a friend with a car? How far is it to the nearest Trader Joe's?
3. **Housing**: Is housing guaranteed all four years? Are you permitted to live off campus if you so choose? What's the breakdown of singles/doubles/triples/quads? Can you pick your roommate(s)? If you don't live on campus, is nearby housing available/affordable/within walking distance?

ACADEMICS:

1. **Curriculum**: If your school has a core curriculum, are the required classes ones you'd like to take anyway? Is it difficult to get the classes you want or those that are required to graduate? Does the school have something that would frustrate you to no end, like a P.E. requirement? (Looking at you, Wellesley.) Would a school's core curriculum make it difficult to pick up another major or minor if you wanted to? Does the open curriculum at Brown, Wesleyan, Vassar, Smith, URochester, etc. sound more up your alley?
2. **Getting Credit**: The College Board sure won't give you your money back for any AP tests you took, so you might as well figure out where you can use those scores. Does your school accept them at all? Is it a 5s only deal? If you can get credit for your scores, will they let you put them towards core and major requirements, or just give you elective credits?
3. **Majors/Minors**: If you see college as mainly a preprofessional experience, verify that the school you want to attend actually has a department for what you want to study. Seems like a no brainer, but some people just assume, for example, that Harvard would have an undergrad business major when it doesn't.

FURTHER STUDY:

1. **Research**: Does the school have a focus on undergraduate research? Are professors known for being open to helping students find opportunities? 
2. **Study Abroad**: Do you want the chance to study abroad during college? If so, does the school offer a program in the place you want to go? Is applying for one of those spots competitive? Is there a language requirement for the program? Are you limited in the years/times that you can go?
3. **Internships**: Is the school in close proximity to the kind of internships you might want to pursue? If there are opportunities, are spots limited and/or competitive? For example, if you want to intern with a political campaign you'll have hundreds of choices and lots of spots at Georgetown, George Washington, or American.

PERSONAL:

1. **Counseling**: If you're someone who struggles with their mental health, how are the on-campus resources? Is there a waiting period to see a counselor if you're struggling? What do current students say about the support systems in place?
2. **General Health**: If you have health care, is it available in the area of the school or would you have to switch plans? Does the state the school is in have barriers to accessing birth control and/or abortion services? [https://reproductiverights.org/maps/abortion-laws-by-state/](https://reproductiverights.org/maps/abortion-laws-by-state/) 
3. **LGBTQ+ Services**: Check the clubs list, does the school have an active GSA or similar advocacy group? Has the school itself committed to anti discrimination policies? What avenue could you use to report harrassment?
4. **Safety**: Are there Safe Ride Programs (to prevent drunk driving) and/or Safe Walk Programs (to prevent having to walk home alone) that you could see yourself using? Are Campus Police viewed as helpful by students?

PEOPLE: Admittedly, the most subjective of these categories, but no less important.

1. **Demographics**: Outside of the standard racial/ethnic/gender diversity, what does a typical incoming class look like? If a school admits 90% of people from in-state, the odds are good that a lot of your college friends will stay in-state after they graduate. Would you be ok with the people you meet being scattered around the country post college, or would you rather increase your odds of ending up close to people you know?
2. **Greek Life**: What percent of students join Fraternities/Sororities? If you want to join one, do you have an option between the academic and social kinds? Are there established social alternatives on campus for those who aren't into Greek Life, but still want to have a good time?
3. **Vibe**: Hard to quantify, but I'd suggest scrolling through some of those public ""class of 20## admitted students"" Instagram pages and reading through some bios. In general, do you think you'd get along with those people? Are the bios trying a little too hard to be quirky, or alternatively, are they copy pasted from linkedin?

You're the only person who knows what kind of school is right for you, but hopefully, this can help you start thinking about some things to look for. Good luck!"

I graduated with a BIS major this past June, and have been thinking of applying to this program. I'm currently working at my second internship as a Business Analyst and am going to start applying to fulltime jobs soon. I definitely think a career in CS is applicable almost anywhere and the salary is definitely something that would motivate me, as well as job security (lol I just think a CS degree is becoming more and more important/useful in the current job market). I took CS161 and took (but dropped after a week since I was working an internship) CS162 (during undergrad). There definitely seemed to be a big jump from 161 to 162 but also I definitely did not give an honest effort.

Things I would like to know:

1. How long does it take to complete this course?
2. How was your experience taking it online?
3. Has it been rewarding?
4. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

I was thinking of applying to a master's program in Business Analytics/Data Science but I saw this program offers basically another bachelor's degree at the same \~$30k price tag. Assuming I would finish, I think completing this program (OSU post-bacc) would open up more doors for me."
wfexvf,1,2022-08-03,Need advice on a family issue,4---Throwaway---2,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wfexvf/need_advice_on_a_family_issue/,"Throwaway obviously. TLDR I am financially dependent on my family but my parents worsen my already fragile mental state by being quite toxic. What would you recommend I do?

So I am an 18 year old British man and I currently live with my parents, waiting on the term for my university to start in September. 

Over the past year, I have done a series of internships and intensive courses during a gap year in an attempt to get some experience in office jobs and to improve my Spanish. I've been pretty successful, and I've lived in a couple different countries to complete said internships, such as Argentina and Spain. 

Obviously this is a huge opportunity that any 18 year old would be lucky to have and I have to recognise the fact that my parents have financially supported me throughout these projects, and for that I am extremely grateful. Their generosity is extending to my future student expenses, where they have promised to give me a loan to cover tuition and cost of living at 0% interest. Again, this is incredibly significant and I can see that this type of financial support is not something that most people receive from their parents. I am well aware of the silver spoon in my mouth.

That is the situation on paper, a successful gap year funded by my parents where I was given the opportunity to work and learn a language.

Now for the issues that I need advice on. 

My relationship with my parents and particularly my mother, despite this incredible amount of support, is rocky to say the least. She always seems to find a way to make me feel worthless or lazy, and after having formed healthy friendships during my time away from my family, I am starting to see a lot of the problems in our home dynamic.

I have, since the age of 8 or 9, struggled with what I can only describe as feelings of intense worthlessness and anxiety. I have been contemplating suicide on a monthly/fortnightly basis almost all of my teenage life. I looked it up and the term that best describes how I feel is suicide ideation, I.E. I fantasise about suicide all the time but am too scared to do it. I have had a history of self harm. I worry almost constantly as to whether all of the people I love hate me and whether they would even care if I died. Worrying about things I can't control is par for the course.

Their behaviour doesn't exactly help this situation. I'll give examples

Eg1) Despite these problems my parents have never put me in effective therapy or given me any support. In fact, when school called my parents about me having a breakdown in school and threatening to kill myself (I was 12 and was being bullied on a daily basis) my dad screamed at me and made me feel like my emotions were a fault. After 3 weeks of state funded emergency therapy to which I didn't really respond, I was expected to just keep calm and carry on.

Eg2) I've always been a very good student despite problems with organisation, and generally exams are easier for me than they are for other people. That doesn't mean I'm smarter or better than other people, it just means I have a talent for academia and have been lucky enough to receive a good education. My style for most of the school year would be to coast and then to knock it out the park in my end of year exams. For this reason, my parents would often call me lazy, which made me feel like shit to be honest. 

This definitely peaked in my GCSE year in 2019. I revised 4-5 hours a day on non school days and 2-3 hours a day on school days from the beginning of March all the way to midway through June when exams ended. I worked what I consider pretty hard for a 15 year old. My parents did not see it that way, and between the start of study for exams all the way up until results day, they constantly said that I didn't work enough and that my peers were working 8 hours a day. They even said that I should have started study in January. When I got all A*s I thought it would shut them up, but no, they basically just said ""good job, but the only reason you got those grades is because you're bright"" essentially saying I'd got there on natural ability alone and had not worked enough. 

Eg3) I just returned from my internship in Buenos Aires where I was studying and working 4 hours of each a day, 8 hours in total, 5 days a week for 10 weeks. It was a fantastic experience and I made a lot of friends while I matured and learnt a lot, but I did work hard. Not 2 days after returning my mum comes into the living room, where I'm essentially just relaxing for a bit after walking the dog. She starts getting on my case about how I don't have a job and how I'm lazy. I tell her that I'm not currently looking for a job because I have to travel in 10 days to go and see a friend for his birthday and a festival (my lifelong friend who lives in a different country, hence the reason for it taking up time and it being very important to me) and that after I'm back from that there will be less than 3 weeks until freshers week and I want time to prepare for that. She says I should get and quit a job within those 10 days to make some money. Call me crazy but I don't think employers will be thrilled with hiring someone who will quit in a week. She continued to imply I was lazy and good for nothing. I felt like the hours I had put in meant nothing and that she bases her value of me off of how productive I am right now. 

That's all I can really think of for concrete examples because I'm not in the best place at the minute. I am stable but am definitely going through the motions of my anxiety and depression(?) (I have no way of describing the feeling other than that, I know it may not be clinically accurate but it's the closest I can find to how I feel, like I am worth nothing and that there is no point to continuing to live). I think they exemplify the main problems, them making me feel worthless and generally not taking my emotions seriously or getting me the help I desperately need. I know I should go to the NHS for mental health support, bit waiting times for state funded adult therapy in the UK are months, even years long and I do not have the disposable income for private therapy.

Overall, during my time away from my family, I learned so much. I learned how to regulate my emotions in a healthy way and I really felt that by the end of it I had figured out how to be happy without crashing all of the time. Then I came home and all of those negative emotions came pouring back in. I hadn't spiralled into suicidal ideation for 2 months, but as soon as I was back in the house and interacting with my parents it all came back and I feel like I'm stuck at square one. It makes me feel like my happiness is dependent on distance from my family.

Uni starts in September. I don't know what to do, and certainly don't want to keep living like this."
wff4wy,1,2022-08-03,Should I apologize?,OneofManyHere,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wff4wy/should_i_apologize/,"So this is a bit of an awkward situation for me. Not really an AITA type of situation, but regardless I'm not sure how to handle it. So I (24F) have been living with my parents and recently, we've been all trying to take care of doctor appointments since we'd been putting it off due to the pandemic. My mom is a chair at a hospital so it's kinda easy for her to make appointments since she knows the other chairs. I feel a little guilty about using her pull to get quick appointments, but I figured better sooner than later. Recently, I went to the gynecologist since I hadn't really seen one since I was 19. My mom is friends with the OBGYN chair so she managed to get me a super nice doctor. I was nervous since it had been awhile, but the doctor was really nice and explained a lot of stuff to me. Afterwards, she said she wanted to get some blood work done for me before putting me on birth control pills bc of super irregular periods I've had since my teenage years. She wanted to wait and see the results before prescribing me anything which makes sense. So I get my blood work done the next day and get my blood results back in a week. Some irregular hormone stuff so I may need the prescription. But can't get the prescription without hearing from the doctor. So I message her on MyChart since that's what the hospital uses. She says she's on vacation that week so I'm like alrighty I'll wait it out. My mom knows that the doctor wanted to prescribe me something but I told her she was out that week. My mom seemed kinda annoyed but I told her let's just wait. So we wait another week, still haven't heard anything back yet. By the end of 2nd week after getting my bloodwork, I got a call from her and she left a voicemail on my phone since I wasn't at my phone at the time. She apologizes for replying back so late since she just got back from time off. She tells me my blood work is fine  mostly other than the hormone thing and to let her know if I wanted to go on birth control to help with it. She said message me on my chart to let me know. I'm like 'oh ok cool' and message her on my chart if she could start me on the birth control since that seems like the next step based on what I was told. Don't hear anything after 5 days, so I send another message. Wait a few more days, and I send another message. Eventually it has been 1 month and I've sent 5 messages to her about whether or not I should start the birth control. I know I should have called her, but I got busy with a project at my internship and sort of tunnel visioned on that. My mom throughout the month kept asking me about it since she wanted to make sure if I was getting the prescription or not. Everytime I said no, I could see her getting more annoyed at the doctor, eventually saying it was unprofessional. And then last night I heard her calling the chair of the OBGYN department and ended up mentioning my situation to her friend. Today, I get a call from the doctor. She sounds super tired and is apologizing. Mentioning how she had to take some time off for personal health reasons and that doctors are people too before getting into the next steps with me. She mentions getting an ultrasound just to be sure and then gave me the prescription to go pick up later. She sounded more tired and stressed and maybe annoyed. I don't blame her and don't try to take it personally, but I also feel guilty. Like maybe if I had done something sooner my mom wouldn't have complained to the head of her department. Bc I'm not sure if the head of the OGBYN department maybe said something to her or reprimanded her, but if the chair did, I feel at fault. I'm not really sure what to make of this situation and whether I should apologize or not. Would I be throwing my mom under the bus if I tried clarifying that it was her who acted independently. Bc I never asked my mom to complain or message the chair. 

So yeah TLDR, after not hearing from my OGBYN doctor for a month my mom complained to the head of the department and now I think my gynceologist might be mad at me but is still treating me respectfully bc she doesn't want to piss off my mom. I feel really guilty about this situation and I guess I'm not sure if I should try apologizing to my doctor or not."

So I'm doing an internship at Microsoft this summer, specifically for Freshmen and Sophomores, and I have the option of being referred to either a SWE role for next summer or an Explore role. The explore interview is supposed to be much easier than the regular SWE interview, but both of my mentors (a senior software developer at Microsoft and a SWE II at Microsoft) suggest that I should go for SWE. I can complete most leetcode easies in 10-25 minutes, and with cues, can find optimal solutions pretty fast as well- so I' m pretty confident I'd pass the Explore interview. Not so much for SWE. But I don't want to be a PM- I'm entirely set on doing software development. But on the other hand Microsoft Explore has a crazy high conversion rate to SWE. Should I go for SWE or play it safe and take Explore?"

wfhyg0,6,2022-08-03,20 years as SWE at large tech corporation... can I switch to startup/contract,Leesmn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wfhyg0/20_years_as_swe_at_large_tech_corporation_can_i/,"I am having a mid-career career crisis/evaluation. I have been at the same large tech company as a (Software Engineer)SWE for 20 years. 

I am thinking about just doing something different for the second half of my career. My two current thoughts are :

1. Startup - the idea of making a bigger impact and just working somewhere smaller. 
2. Contract work - the idea being I would still work with a smaller group, but in a time limited way. I'd love to do like a 12 month project and take 3 months off between projects. 

My fear is that I am super duper rusty in interviewing - never was good. I got this job straight from an internship. I do best when I can think out a problem, not respond on the spot. I am an excellent SWE and am highly valued where I am at. So I am not worried about being able to handle a job - just getting one.

The other fear is that I would encounter bias at startups, clients etc.. I am a woman and I've always found many initial assumptions are made that I can overcome with time, but it does take time and is more than a little annoying. (Side note: literally had one startup tell me I was a bad cultural fit because I didn't play 'first person shooter' games - guess who is out of business now?)

Last concerns - need to continue to make decent money(200K). I have kiddos going to college. And I can't move, so probably WFH, which I've been doing since 2007 anyway.

Most of my work has been full stack: web applications, small database and REST APIs in Java prior to a few years ago. The last few years have been developing cloud applications in Python and golang, although I've been more tech lead the last few years too and less hands-on with the Python/Golang. Whenever I have fixed or dealt with the Pythin/golang bits, it's fine - at this point I find all languages are kinda the same, but I expect hiring folk may feel differently. 

Any advice? Am I being unrealistic? Has anyone else made a switch like this? Thought about a switch?"

&amp;#x200B;

Yup basically as title states, been doing this for almost a year now. 

&amp;#x200B;

My official title is in cybersecurity, but I was hired from Help Desk. I was promised with my promotion they would get someone in soon to replace Help Desk (never happened, instead they hired one intern who started in June and will be leaving here in 2 weeks). We also had our one and only systems engineer quit around the time I got promoted (you guessed it, I covered it as well). Now we finally have a new systems engineer in who is learning the role and slowly taking things off my plate. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I am still in charge of managing IT equipment stock, server support such as phones/accounting/prod/qa, laptop support (yes all of it, for about 250 endpoints). I still occasionally have to find laptops to order and put through a PO, including triple bidding and all those hoops. AD/O365/Other internal application support and maintenance (yes, I am the only fucking one who is in charge of cleaning up AD, O365, and other applications such as MDM software, centralize AV dashboards, etc.) for \~300 people. Server performance monitoring I was tasked with expanding our current coverage since we were only monitoring \~4 of our 9 servers at the time.

The boss also tasked me with implementing new support system (when am I supposed to find time for this????????? Thankfully the new systems engineer took this one).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the intern is leaving in 3 weeks, leaving NO ONE for imaging laptops either, which means I know who gets it back :)))))))))))))))

&amp;#x200B;

So helpdesk roles I will be in charge of - Imaging laptops, and support. Responding to tickets related to all kinds of issues not even just related to laptops. (They even force me to support users on a fucking end machine that isn't managed by us, and when they have home networking issues I'm expected to figure it out!!!!!!). Helping manage 250 work stations through out the office at the whims of whenever these ass\*\*\*\*\* decide they're going to be in the office and I just have to be there (2 days in office, 3 days WFH), that includes phones, docks, monitors, keyboards and mice (yep in charge of managing these as well, I just fucking hand them out like candy because fuck this), and all the shit in between. Printer support, print server support. Weekly meetings going over Help desk tickets that have been worked on.

&amp;#x200B;

You know I can keep going but at this point this is becoming a wall of text.

&amp;#x200B;

FINALLY we get to the cybersecurity ROLES I HAVE TO DO AS WELL - Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, and Bi-Annual audits that require us reviewing all different kinds of access, such as physical access logs, user account reviews, firewall change reviews, Accounting server change reviews, I am in charge of leading and making sure they get completed as needed (all of these audits require changes in multiple places if anything changes). I am in charge of monitoring firewall activity for attack attempts, monitoring our AV through the dashboard for any issues. We are preparing for a more advanced audit this year compared to the previous audit we went through, which means collecting evidence for multiple more controls, organizing it all, updating and reviewing business critical docs such as BCP, BCP members, Disaster recovery plan. Monitoring server back-ups and fixing issues that arise there. Monthly meetings reviewing the reviews/audits we did that month, monthly meetings to report on log changes and server monitoring. Weekly meetings explaining what I am working on for the week. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am quickly losing my temper at this point when I get bothered for help because I have other shit I am required to have done, and all for 55 fucking thousand a year. Am I crazy in thinking I am being used and abused at the moment?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: doing 3 roles for 55k, I need raise right?"

wfkj5o,1,2022-08-03,Should I Take a Gap Semester From College For This Career Opportunity?,neoud,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wfkj5o/should_i_take_a_gap_semester_from_college_for/,"Hi y'all.

I'm working at a FAANG company right now as an intern as I was just offered a fall position on a different team at the same company with the possibility to extend into spring. I have a couple issues that are possibly stoping me from taking this position.

My first issue is that I'm on financial aid at my expensive private university and I will be making 'big tech money'. I'm afraid that the money that I will make will impact my financial aid since I will have to report my earnings in my CSS file, and the amount of money I will make might be enough to just mess up how much gift aid I receive. My family is not rich, we'd maybe able to pay a little more than before but we have no gauge of how much my tuition will increase because of this so it's dangerous. Also, my sibling goes to another private college, and their financial aid is contingent on the fact that my parents are paying for 2 kids in college. If there is only 1 then we are afraid that her school would also give her less aid as well since my parents would technically be paying for only 1 child. Does anyone know any way around this? Is this even a good idea at this point? Not to mention the fact that I'd have to find someone to sublease my space at my university apartment while I'm gone which will be difficult since the school semester starts this month (2 weeks) and my lease technically started at the beginning of this month. I'd also have to find new housing at the location of the internship, but I anticipate this to be less of a hurdle than the prior obstacles. Just to add more fire to the flame, my parents hate the idea of me taking time off of school (very old school parents). My parents are worried because I'm midway through college and I would be delaying graduation, also I wouldn't be in the same classes as most of my friends anymore, but these things don't seem like things I really care too much about.

I really want to take this position considering I haven't been having the best time at college for a plethora of reasons, so it seems like a great opportunity. I had to move out of my home-state for the summer to pursue this internship and I really don't want to leave, I love it here. If I took this new internship with this new team, I'd be able to stay here for at least another season since the new job is located here too at the same company. It seems like such a dream. The team I would be joining is working on a project to help African kids, and as an African its something I'd be really passionate about. The role also fits my skills perfectly and the manager already really likes me. The company I'd be working for is amazing and the extra resume boost would be great. I wouldn't have the burden of going back to university, where I don't feel like I belong. I feel like I belong here. I'm in-between a rock and a hard place, my heart is telling me to take the job but theres so many hurdles. Not sure what to do, not sure what's best for me. Any advice?"

As this is my first post, I apologise if its too long or rambly. Anyways, Im sure somebody has already run into a similar situation.

**TL;DR : advice on getting someone to act right / social battery and patience running out on vacation at my parents house with friend**

I (22) invited a friend from university to spend some time at my parents house over the summer. She (21) arrived on Monday (two days ago) and Im already regretting having her over for such a long period of time. The thing is that **I dont know if this is my social battery running out or if she is being rude and Im in need of advice.**

First of all, she is not helping much with the daily chores like cooking and dressing up the table. My parents are both retired and as a result spend a lot of time home or around the garden. My friend has to work remotely from 9-5, 5 days a week because she is doing an internship over the summer.  This is no problem as it was agreed upon before but its getting more and more awkward for the reasons that will follow. As a result she is spending plenty of time on her computer in the living room and the terrace, but also taking hour long breaks in the pool while my parents are there. 

Tonight, I arranged a sunset picnic at the beach so we could both have a good time and take cute pictures, which I now would be something she would like since she loves posting on her socials. (I also love taking pictures and getting ready, so that definetly wasnt all for her.) I gave her one of my bikinis, a skirt and shared my makeup with her. Since it was already pretty late, we gave up on our idea to get takeout and decided to cook pizza at home and take it to the beach. We agreed to do that during the afternoon but when the time came to cook she was in the bathroom getting ready. I prepared the pizza alone, put it in the oven and did my makeup while it was cooking. When it was ready, I gave half to my parents, packed the rest and got upstairs to pick up my beach gear. All I got was a ""thank you"" followed by a ""when are we leaving"" when I told her dinner was ready. When we arrived at the beach she complained that the pizza crust wasnt cooked enough, smiled like two times the whole time and answered a facetime call from her long distance bf while we were taking pictures. I took over 60 pictures of her and got like 20 in exchange. Before leaving we bought dessert and she let me pay for my own as well. Last night I took her for a nighttime sightseeing tour of my town and when we went out for drinks after she got a notification that she had received 50 euros out of the blue from a random twitter moneyslave maniac. We had good laugh about it, but when time came to pay she let me pay for my own drink, which was about 8. **This might seem petty but she lives at her parents and has no living expenses to pay**. Almost all her money goes to travels and hobbies, while Ive been living on my own since 18 and had to work every summer to pay for things. She knows that and knows I am having some financial problems but still. Theres also this event Ive been talking about attending with her on Thursday since we made plans for her to come months ago which she doesnt seem too keen on going to anymore now that she's here. Overall bad vibes keep piling up, and with university deadlines approaching, job interviews to do and a new appartement to hunt, I am finding it very hard to keep my cool and feel very bad. I am also quite tired because because of insomnia so that might play into my perception of events as well. 

I have never run into problems with that friend before. Back in uni we get along very well and see each other pretty often with no fighting or tensions of any kind for the whole time we have known each other, which is more than a year now. She is not a bad person but I guess you dont really know people until you live with them for a while. Or maybe after two months of not seeing each other we have grown in different directions (which is totally fine) but the whole stuck at my house situation makes it super awkward. Reading this it seems like im painting such a bad portrait of her but everything is factual. Despite being a fun person to be around all year round, **she almost feels like a burden since she got here.** I feel so bad writing this because I like her but its true. I want to mention that she is quite stressed out with her internship and also going through a bit of a rough patch with an emotionally abusive boyfriend which might explain why she is acting strange. 

**We are a 5 hour train journey away from our university town where she lives and she still has a whole week before leaving.** Before that I had two other friends from uni spend the weekend over to attend a festival in my hometown and things went well. We had a good time and my parents were pleased as well, enjoying making small talk with them. They cooked one meal, helped with cleaning up and bought them a bottle of nice rhum the second day they were there as a thank you present. 

This afternoon my dad pulled me aside and asked me what ""conditions"" I had agreed to with my friend before taking her to our home since he doesnt see her doing much, and she hasnt brought them anything yet, nor offered to do any cooking. He reminded me that when my sister and her bf also arrive later in the week, I will have to share my bedroom with my friend until the end of her stay. He seems to have picked up pretty quickly that she wasnt offering to pay for things. Her attitude is so different to that of my friends who were there this past weekend and he seemed pissed off, which I find quite reasonable. I also have been over at that friend's parent's house before for a night only and bought dessert for her whole family. 

The vibe is off and its already getting to the point im happy to go to bed at night because I get to be alone in my room and chill. I want to apologise to my parents for inviting her. I am not putting the blame entirely on her because I am aware that the one who got myself in this situation, but ***I would at least appreciate some tips on how to confront her about her idleness and unwillingness to do the things I planned as I am not a confrontative person.***

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post ; just writing it has gotten things of my chest and I wish you all a great day/night :)"
wflinq,14,2022-08-03,Tired,University102,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wflinq/tired/,"I'm just tired of the never-ending comparisons.

I know it's my problem. It most definitely is. I should stop comparing myself to others, but I simply can't resist to do so.

The motivation from continuously comparing myself to my counterparts in the same group is what brought me to this point of minimal level of achievements.

Comparing myself to other students in high school gave me the acceptance to Berkeley. Comparing myself to other students at Berkeley gave my opportunities at big research labs and startup companies.

With 3 more years to go, however, imagining myself continuously seeking to be the top within these groups, for something more just burns me out.

Seeking for top-tier internship for the summers to come, either getting accepted to top tier grad schools or top tier companies after graduation, publication at top conferences or making high salaries, and more comparisons to come as I enter these new groups of people just tires me so much.

Any advice?"

wfmeuo,1,2022-08-03,"Counselor disregarded my symptoms and says I'm just not ""mindful"" enough.",oNikkio,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/wfmeuo/counselor_disregarded_my_symptoms_and_says_im/,"TL;DR - Counselor says ADHD is only about focus troubles and tells me to get a habit tracker to solve my problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am 35 and I only got diagnosed with ADHD in January of this year. Before December of last year, I had no clue I had ADHD and the thought never even crossed my mind, mainly because I didn't know anything about it.

Getting diagnosed wasn't too difficult, which I'm grateful for, given the horrible stories I've read here about trying to get diagnosed. I filled out a self-assessment for anxiety (I have been diagnosed with anxiety for years and take Zoloft for it) and depression, took the TOVA test and an IQ test, then I was officially diagnosed with ADHD. I was so happy to be diagnosed. And I was especially excited about the idea of getting treatment. 

One if my biggest issues revolves around not having enough motivation to do things or to see things through to the end. This has had the most serious negative impact on my life. There are, of course, other things, but this is what I feel has been making my life the most difficult and unfulfilling, and it's been getting worse lately. Last year I had my wedding and I skipped doing things for it that were important to me because I just couldn't work up the effort to do them and then I had no time to do them.

For a while now, I've wanted to make a career as an artist. I have never had a ""real"" job and I had been unemployed for a long time. After I got my bachelor's degree (after 7 years and a LOT of struggling!!), I tried to get a job, but no one wanted me. Every job required a couple years of experience in order to obtain a fucking internship. -\_\_- I applied, but never, ever got any responses. I even got a certification in my field, but it meant nothing. And during this time I didn't have even a part-time job, but my fiance had a good job that supported both of us. I was home all day and I did nothing all day. I would get so upset with myself for not having done anything productive that day, but for some reason, I just couldn't and I didn't know why. I hated being that way. I wanted to be an independent artist, and I had the great opportunity to devote all of my time to making it happen. But I couldn't ever stick with my plans. I would make lists and lists and lists about what I needed to do and how I needed to change to improve my life, but I could only follow them for so long before they were abandoned, often forgotten. I had chores around the house to do and I didn't do them. I often don't even make art because I can't get the motivation to, even though I love it. Which, of course, means I will never improve and I will never build up a portfolio.

Anyway, I'm trying to describe how not being able to do things has made me miserable and stagnated my life. I have so much more I could say about how this has screwed me over, but that would make this into a book. Once I found out more about ADHD, I finally found an answer! For so long, I just thought I was too lazy to do anything. That I must really not care that much because I can't follow through. That if only I could find the right app or planner to help me, I could finally stay on track and actually accomplish something. But finding out that that's not the case and that I really do have a legitimate reason for my life full of failure has really helped me. I'm not as angry or disappointed at myself as I used to be. 

So, I was very excited to get treatment. I wanted to FINALLY be able to accomplish my goals. I had read lots of good stories in this sub and others about how medication changed their life around. Well, I was first given Strattera and it made me so drowsy that I could barely function. I could not stay on it. Then, I was given generic Adderall at 20mg. Nothing happened. Not just that it didn't help with my symptoms--nothing happened. I might as well have been taking a pill of water for all it did. Once day I got desperate for it to work that I took two pills at once for 40mg. Again, nothing happened. Not even an elevated heartbeat. I've tried asking around or looking up why stimulants don't work for me, (coffee, energy drinks, and the feel-good effects of alcohol don't work for me, either) but I can't find anything. Everything is about building up a tolerance to it, not that it never works to begin with.

I was extremely disappoint. Especially since stimulants are the go-to treatment and considered to be the most effective. When I next spoke to my perscriber, he told me that it was very unusual for me to not feel ANY difference on Adderall. He raised the dosage to 30mg (which I still don't have access to yet and have not started) and said that if I still didn't feel any difference, then we would have to look into causes other than ADHD for my problems. This frustrated me greatly. I am sure I have ADHD and I have read many experiences similar to mine.

So, I've been quite upset lately that this isn't working for me. Especially when I see threads in this sub every day talking about how people are crying because their medication has turned their life around. I've been so frustrated and upset that I scheduled an appointment with my counselor--the same one who diagnosed me--after I hadn't seen him in a while. I have a lot I feel I need to let out about my sadness and frustration over this whole thing. Over my whole life, which has been a repeat of the same thing over and over and over no matter how hard I try. Even my husband was telling me that if I just \*actually\* tried to follow the habit trackers or the schedules or the routines, then I would be able to do things because then I would have the habit. I was so sad to hear him say that. As if for my entire life, I just haven't been trying hard enough and that if I just put in more effort, I could fix myself. I tried to talk to him about it, but I don't think he understands.

That was what I wanted to talk about with my counselor. About my frustration and sadness with the medication not working at all, my frustration and sadness over never being able to do the things I want to do, my frustration and sadness that no one seems to be able to understand what I go through. I tried to start explaining it to him.. but then he just told me that ADHD medication just helps you to focus and doesn't help you with motivation. I told him that even when I start some art pieces, I end up never coming back to them to finish them. He asked me if I could focus on the art while I was doing it or if I was constantly getting distracted. I told him I could focus on the art while doing it and he said then that isn't ADHD. ADHD means you can't focus. Not feeling like doing things is depression.

Then, he went on about Mindfulness--being aware of your feelings. Recognizing that you don't feel like doing something, and then *just doing it anyway*. He talked about apps to help you keep track of your goals (I already have four on my phone and lots more I've deleted because I didn't use them.) He talked about asking my husband to help me by reminding me what to do and helping me keep track of things (something that my husband already does constantly and he hates having to do it and wants me to do chores without having to be told to do them). I felt like he knew nothing about ADHD. I didn't try to argue. I just nodded along until I was able to leave. I wanted to cry. No one around me understands. I have looked for help around where I live that specializes in ADHD, but the only place that does focus on ADHD only accepts patients up to age 25. Ya know, because 26 and over people no longer need help with their life-long disability that will never go away.

I don't know if this all makes sense and I explained it cohesively, but I really felt like I had to get this out of my system. It's like people think I've never thought about trying to build up freaking habits before. I've spent my entire life not knowing that if I just did the stuff I couldn't do, then I would be fine."

As the title says, I'm looking for some type of advice/tips that I should do during this upcoming academic school year in regards to preparing for internships, creating projects, or just overall getting a better handle in CS. 

For the past two years, I struggled with my classes and on homework assignments. I would usually get the core idea/concept down (for example in data structures, or getting the big picture idea of an algorithm like dynamic programming), but when it came time to writing that code I just couldn't translate it properly. I heard that trying to ""decompose"" the problem into smaller steps was the best way to do that but how can I go about that? I heard projects was a good idea and that leads into my next question.

Should I try and focus on creating projects for my resume or just grinding out leetcode? I feel like I wasted my summer by being a bit too carefree and not developing my skills when in reality I really should have done so. Now, my semester is about to start in a couple of weeks but I'm pretty much scared of my classes because of the struggles that I mentioned beforehand and also because I am not prepared for technical interviews and don't have anything to show for in my resume but a bunch of other jobs that don't really relate to CS (being a receptionist, Sales Associate, couple of IT jobs). 

What should I put my time too? What is the best way to improve my problem solving ability? Should I spend my time on creating some projects or put my time into leetcode or just have no life and attempt to do both because of my incompetence? 

Any advice is appreciate and God bless your soul!"

I know how to code at a fairly decent level. 

Are there remote research opportunites? Unpaid internships? Ill take anything!

I‚Äôve been told it would be okay to put ‚ÄôApple‚Äô as well as the startup name on my resume, so I am wondering how much of a difference a FAANG name (if at all) will make when it comes to searching for 1st year summer internships?"
wfqz46,708,2022-08-03,Should I confess to my dad helping me in 2 classes last fall?,Steven0710,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wfqz46/should_i_confess_to_my_dad_helping_me_in_2/,"I'm a CS major going into my last semester. As I approach my last semester I have been feeling alot of guilt for what I did in the Fall 2021 semester.

For various reasons(one of them being I found the transition back to in person classes very difficult) I was in one of the top 3 lowest moments of my life. Whenever I woke up I would be sweating, gasping for air, I lost 15 pounds in the span of 2 weeks, I couldn't open my laptop to do homework without suffering a panic attack and crying, etc. To ease my anxiety, my dad, who is a software engineer, would zoom with me and guide me through my Data Structures labs, which were 60 percent of my grade.

Towards the end of the semester I became so sick that I had to get hospitalized. Before I went to the hospital our last compilers project, worth 5 percent of our grade, was due. My dad also helped/walked me through that.

The guilt of what I've done has been eating me alive since around December 2021. What's more, I somehow managed to get an internship and apparently did well enough of a job that they extended my internship to part time for this fall, after which they would want me to work there fulltime(I ended up taking an extra semester, part of the reason for my fragile mental state was the pressure to graduate ontime).

I've been considering coming clean to those 2 professors and confessing and talking about what happened. Everyone I have talked to has said I shouldn't, but I wanted to get some advice from people in academia. For context, I have diagnosed OCD and depression, and part of my OCD involves a compulsive need to be honest, which has at least played some part in my inability to get past this whole situation.

Please help.

Edit: as to how he helped me, he would do the assignment before me so he understood it, then walk me through it. He would give me hints as to what to do, and when I was really stuck, he would show me how to do it."

wfs6q3,12,2022-08-04,Advice for gap year international,Finite_Resources,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/wfs6q3/advice_for_gap_year_international/,"Hi fellow international students! I have decided to take a gap year after I received all my decisions this admissions cycle. I was unable to get any affordable offers so this is the only option.

Now things are going to be very tricky because I'm honestly lost at the moment. Obviously I'll have to change alot of things if I want to change the outcome for the coming year. 

Firstly I applied as a CS and a Computer Engineering major and I'm an asian who needs a fullride so this is probably part of the reason I got rejected the first time around. I've been thinking of switching to another less competitive major but I'm not sure which to switch to and need some advice on that. I did Further maths, physics and chemistry for my ALs so the major I do will probably have to be stem. I haven't really done that many STEM ECs or any ECs at all for that matter. My only stem EC is that I'm a member of my school's IT society. I'm struggling to pick a major so if anyone can help me out that would be great!

Secondly I'm not sure what to do during my gap year. I'm planning on taking the SAT and getting an internship but other than that I can't really think of anything to do. It seems like I missed the deadline for most summer programs so that doesn't really help. So if anyone has some advice on what I should do during my gap year that would be great!

Finally I know that not everyone has a happy ending with these things. I don't know whether the US will work out for me so I was planning to apply to universities outside the US. I have heard of HK, SG and Korea giving fullrides to international students and heard it's a good option. If anyone has some experience applying to unis in these countries or has any friends that got in with a fullride to unis outside the US, if you could tell me how competitive these scholarships are as well as the process for these scholarships that would be much appreciated. Also if y'all know any other countries other than the one's mentioned, please let me know.

Thank you so much for your help!"

* MUN Awards - Outstanding delegate at medium convention, best position paper in school convention, honorable delegate in school convention
* National Merit Semifinalist (haven't gotten this yet, but I will get this)
* 1st place at a Speech Tournament

**Extracurriculars** (sorry this section is so muddled, there's a lot)**:**

* **School Paper** \- Online Editor Junior year, Editor in chief senior year
* **Debate Team** \- Vice President Junior year, President Senior year (also coach since my school doesn't have a coach)
* **MUN** \- Executive Board Junior and Senior Year
* **Student advisor to the school board** (selective position, only 3 chosen at my school)
* **Scholastic Bowl** (Academic team/quiz bowl) - Varsity all 4 years
* **Deputy Campaign Manager for a county board candidate** \- junior spring to senior fall. I do everything for this race, from speechwriting to social media to fundraising, and I designed almost all of the strategy.
* **Paid staffer - outreach associate** \- (only around one of ten and only one of two in high school) for a consulting firm that works with a slate of female local candidates - junior spring to senior fall. I do various things, not just outreach, but I ran my candidates' texting outreach for a highly competitive primary, help plan events, oversee volunteers, do lots of messaging work
* **Paid staffer - idk my title but it's definitely a leadership role** \- for two countywide candidates - junior spring to senior fall. I also do a wide variety of things for this race. I'm pretty much the head field organizer, I write scripts, speeches, and social media posts, and I train interns from local orgs to help us
* **Internship coordinator/intern with local political org** \- rising junior summer to junior winter. Idk I just did a lot of basic intern stuff here, nothing special. I did a lot with communications, though, and helped write newsletters and social media posts and things like that. I started as an intern, before getting promoted to intern coordinator after a few months, where I was in charge of the internship program
* **Youth outreach director/intern for Congressman** \- rising sophomore summer to sophomore fall, then rising senior summer to senior fall. I started as an intern when I was 15, where I did basic intern things, like phone calls, post cards, and other voter outreach. Then, after being involved in lots of different positions over the next two years, I was offered the position to direct a new program out of their office for recruiting young volunteers and turning out the youth vote. I supervise interns in that office, run social media accounts, and communicate with high school officials to organize events for them.

**Other stuff about me/what I've done:**

* I run a sort of successful political social media account for a candidate. It's on the rise, and getting pretty high with the help of some political friends. It's not a meme or parody account. I'd call it educational, but also campaign-y and political. It's not an official thing, just a strange passion project (being vague on purpose)
* I'm crazy about campaign finance reform and ethics reform in government. I read a lot about it in my spare time, from books to articles to legal documents. It's something I'd consider myself to be passionate about.
* I also got really obsessed with redistricting when Illinois was redistricted after the 2020 census. I created a map of all the districts in my county, along with information about each elected official. It's hard to explain. Also, my county took a really long time on releasing interactive county board maps, so I drew them myself.

**Essays:**

* CommonApp - I'm decently confident in this . I write a lot (in case that wasn't clear in my ECs and all that), and I like my topic, and think it works pretty well. I finished my CommonApp essay, and I like it. I've had some people I know read it, and they like it.
* Supps - I think these will be okay too. I don't really know. I looked at the prompts and I've started brainstorming and working on some of them. I honestly don't know how they're turning out. I think they'll be good, since I've been working really hard on them, but I'm not sure,

**LORs:**

* **APUSH Teacher 11/10** \- My APUSH teacher is amazing. She's also been the debate team supervisor all 4 years of high school. I think (hope) she really likes me. She also wrote me a really good rec for one of my in school positions I hold. Also this teacher has been said to write amazing letters of rec. A friend of mine with a similar profile to me got into an Ivy with her as a letter of rec, and I've heard really good things about that letter. Also, she helped me deal with some serious issues with my work and family this year.
* **AP Lang Teacher 7/10** \- I think this one will be good. I really liked Lang and I worked hard and participated in that class. I didn't get as close to my Lang teacher, but I still was able to talk with him some and I think he likes me
* **Counselor 4/10** \- My counselor probably hates me. I've spent 4 years arguing with her about how many AP classes I could take and whether or not I should be allowed to drop lunch. I think it will be very mid. I also had a bit of an argument with her over my English class senior year. I just really hope it all works out. I am very passionate, and she knows how much I love politics, and does sometimes send me opportunities in politics. Hopefully that shines through, but I'm not hopeful.
* **State Senator I worked with 9/10** \- I'm not 100% sure if she's who I'll ask for my extra letter of rec, but I think she's the best. I don't know about her LOR-writing skills, but I know she really likes me, and even asked me to try for this one high up position (trying to be vague also it's hard to explain) a month or so back. I didn't get the spot because of a lot of bad politics, but it still means a lot that she asked me, and she always talks about my political potential.

**Schools** (I know, I know, it's pretty long)**:**

* Harvard (REA)
* UMich - Ann Arbor (EA)
* UNC-Chapel Hill (EA)
* UVA (EA)
* UIUC (EA) (in state)
* Princeton (RD)
* Columbia (RD)
* Yale (RD)
* UPenn (RD)
* UChicago (RD)
* Georgetown (RD)
* Wellesley (RD)
* Boston College (RD)
* Tufts (RD)

University Selection MS CS or Data Science

I'm planning to apply for fall'23 for MS CS or Data Science. I've shortlisted the following universities:

CMU, UCSD, NYU, UMich, John Hopkins (data science)

UCSD, NYU, Purdue, NEU, UIUC, Stony Brook, northwestern, uni of Maryland , UWM, GTech, UMass (CS)
 
Was also considering UPenn's MCIT (if MCIS is ambitious)

Profile-
Electrical Graduate (2022) from IIT (8.1/10 GPA) 

GRE: 321, 169 Q

Work Ex- joined an MNC as a data scientist (1 year of experience till fall'23 term start)

Research - worked under a US University professor last summer (ML project). Undergrad thesis under a CS professor (ML project).
Working on a DL-CV research project (without a prof) with a team. Came up with the idea by ourselves. Paper hopefully by Dec-Jan

Papers- none 

Intern- 1 ML (NLP) intern of 3 months
Toefl- expecting around 110

Good ranks in national level hackathons and competitions. Good with competitive programming (&lt;100 CodeJam rank)


Open to applying to Universities with ECE programs that have a ML track (something like CMU)

Are these universities too ambitious, and can I add another ones if not these? My gpa isn't that high, will this high GRE quant score compensate for this? Having worked on different domains of data science, does it improve my chances or makes it weak (univ assuming I couldn't work in one domain so kept experimenting with different ones). TIA"

This segways into my next question do companies like volunteer experiences and should I include them in my resume? 

So ya let me know in what ways I can improve it : )

The thing is, if I accept this offer I many not be permitted to sit for companies coming to campus offering an intern+FTE role as I would have to withdraw from my existing internship part way, which would lead to immediate withdrawal of my candidature from all other campus placement process (college placement rules dammit!). I don't want to live with uncertainty for a whole year worrying about my full time prospects at the same time I also need an internship for this semester( course demands it).

I learnt that data science position at fresher level is hard to get, which makes me even more troubled about choosing what to do.

Quick facts:

* Biomedical Engineer, masters in hardware/software for medical applications completed last year

* In practice: jack of all trades, master of none. Have toyed with everything tech-wise under the sun, from programming micro controllers in assembly to high level machine learning, plus have a bunch of knowledge in health-related areas like physiology, biology, chemistry, etc.

* Come from low-income European country, always wanted to leave

* During my thesis I realized I loved playing with data, models, cleaning, researching and tweaking algorithms, basically data science

* Tweaked my CV to market myself as aspiring data-scientist. Applied to dozens of positions throughout the world, specifically avoiding my country b/c low wages and personal desire of living abroad

* Got rejected everytime

* In desperation, sent a few CV's to national companies, to any position remotely connected with data

* Landed a ""paid internship"" working as a database analyst for big company

* Not really what I was looking for, but was hoping SQL and IT experience would pay off by building up resume

* First few months, everything cool, learning a lot by the day

* Haven't applied to anything since or worked on personal projects b/c lazy

* Last few months, they offer me a full-time contract with benefits, health insurance, the works. Pay is still ridiculously low, but higher than median wages for country. I accept tentatively

* Simultaneously, they start using me for production modifications that have to be done at dawn, even though it's illegal according to my contract and menial tasks where I no longer enjoy or learn anything from

* Lack of capacity in team basically trickles down to me, and I get these interventions every day for a week. I hate it and feel like shit the following day b/c of lack of sleep, but do it nonetheless out of fear of reprisals or pulling my contract from under my feet


My question is, which of the following two options should I choose:


A) Demand increase in pay, benefits, vacation time or paid course in software/IT (potentially threatening to report illegal breach of my contract) and resign if conditions aren't met. Spend free time looking for better jobs and on personal data science projects or;


B) Meekly chug along, build enough experience to market myself as full-blown database analyst, and always have that B-plan of a position in DevOps, in case breaking into data science reveals itself to be harder than expected.


My risk-averse personality leans onto B, because idk how long it will be before I land another job, and in the mean time I have to dip into my meager savings to pay rent. I have ~2 month window if I quit now and before it really starts to affect my finances. No friends or family to help me financially.

So I am in my third year of undergraduate studies for a bachelor's degree math and last semester I took a course regarding programming with python and  liked it a lot. Since then I have been looking into software engineering and have recently started learning web development on my own through a website called The Odin Project (it teaches you full stack web development). I have to say, the more I progress the more I enjoy it!

What I want to know is, since my university does not have a lot of courses on computer science (other than a data structures one and an algorithms one) is it possible for me to break into the field of software engineering (by maybe finding an internship at first) with just a degree in mathematics as a mainly self taught software developer? 

Thank you all for your time in advance!"

MIS is a mixture of the business side and technical side, and I‚Äôm MUCH more interested in the business aspect of it, what‚Äôs the optimal route for me to go for (business wise)

The reason I went for MIS it‚Äôs because it was the safe route for me, with how technology and such, MIS looked quite appealing (still does and I don‚Äôt regret my decision).

Here is the thing, I like coding from a viewing standpoint, but actually doing it? No, it‚Äôs just something I was always a fan of, but as soon as I had my first programming course, I knew this ain‚Äôt the path for me (it doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt understand it or I‚Äôm getting bad grades, I just hate it in general). 

Im more into the business aspect of it, what should I go for when it comes time for that internship?

I‚Äôm the only person doing this gig at my organization, and I simply can‚Äôt keep up with my workload because of the sheer volume of tasks and responsibilities, coupled with a mountain of seemingly irreparable internal dysfunction at the organization.  I‚Äôve been wanting to leave for years, but it‚Äôs a safe gig, the money is ok, I have a lot of autonomy, lots of vacation time, and a really flexible work schedule. 

So, this former intern, nice guy but not the smartest and certainly not what I‚Äôd call a ‚Äùhigh performer‚Äù, sort of stumbled into the job of being my ‚Äúassistant‚Äù despite having no real qualifications for the job.  He‚Äôs been doing this ‚Äújob‚Äù for a few years now. 

He helps, but he‚Äôs not capable of doing the total job I need him to do. I find myself taking on most of his workload because managing, teaching, and constantly checking the quality of his work adds *more* work to my plate. 

So I‚Äôve mentioned this to my boss and I‚Äôve been given the opportunity to create a new job description and put the job on the market, forcing my current ‚Äúassistant‚Äù to reapply and compete for the job. 

Sounds great but, trouble is, because of severe budget constraints, I‚Äôm barred from including on the job description the primary tasks, skill set, and qualifications I require of this assistant. So, inevitably I‚Äôm going to have to sort through a slew of under-qualified candidates for a fairly low salary - then pick the ‚Äúleast bad‚Äù one, then once onboard spring a bunch of work on them they didn‚Äôt anticipate or have prior experience with.  

I also honestly don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúinvite‚Äù a new unsuspecting and under-qualified employee into an organization that‚Äôs this dysfunctional, in a situation where I may jump ship soon.

So, what do I do?  Continue treading water with my current workload, or hire a new ‚Äúassistant‚Äù and saddle them (and myself) with the likely additional burden, all the while with the likelihood that I‚Äôll leave the organization sooner than later anyway?"

ADVICE NOT FULLY RECEIVED. I agree totally with the comment of the person but MORE ADVICE PLEASE!

So, I am in a selection process of an internship and we have sessions everyday. And for my own convenience, I record the entire session so as to reflect later if I miss out anything.

And today was my last day of selection process (tmrw it would be announced if we are hired or not) and I was assigned a team and a project today to work with and on. And during the session, the CEO was talking about some finance stuff that was going over my head. So, in my PERSONAL notes, I wrote things such as ""I dont understand SHIT. all's going over my head, wts!?"" things as such (nothing tooo bad but just such ""shitty"" thing). And later, after the finance-thing teaching, the CEO and I (with another team member) had a talk on my project in another breakout room. He gave us a lot of inssights and stuff on our project but my team leader wasn't there due to internet issues.

After the session ended, like after 1 hr of talk with CEO (when he left), she (the team leader) came and asked us to summarize in brief. The other member recommended that we do so tmrw as the CEO talked A LOT and it would be tough to summarize (I did summarize but the CEO talked A LOT) and my stupid ass blabbered that I can share my ""PERSONAL"" video recording with her. She said yes, ofc. Now, the video recording of that specific part of the session (the CEO and my talk) had many scenes where I am noting down what he said (we are supposed to do that) BUT it also displays the ""SHIT"" things. So, if I share my video with her she sees the bad words.

What do I do?

I am trying to blur those out but the recording is 1 hr and the shit is spread out and I dont have A LOT of time. So, should I just email her and ask if she would be ok with the unprofessional words and apologize in advance or do I just EDIT the shits out and then send her the recording?"

wg896q,123,2022-08-04,Feel as if I was scammed during my internship. Do I report this woman to HR?,greengrass419,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/wg896q/feel_as_if_i_was_scammed_during_my_internship_do/,"I am really upset as I feel like I was scammed by a woman I worked for during fashion week in Paris. I was hired by an international sales director through the website fashionjobs for a week long internship for a showroom during Paris fashion week to work for a few high end brands. We had a zoom interview where we discussed the terms of the internship, which included compensation of ‚Ç¨50 a day for work  and a free product from one of the brands. Later in an email I was given, I was offered an internship. These terms were not stated in the job offer, it was basically just a clarification that I got the job and would be working 6 days for this internship. There was never any contract for this position, which I didn‚Äôt think would be a red flag at the time as it‚Äôs common for Paris fashion week internships.

So, skipping to the first day of the internship, I thought it was a huge red flag that this woman brought her own daughter and her daughters boyfriend on as interns as well, without telling us (me and the other intern hired online). There were 4 of us interning in total. She assured us that ‚Äúeveryone would be treated equally.‚Äù This was not the case. Her daughter was very young and clearly didn‚Äôt want to be there, but wanted a free trip to Paris paid by her mom. And ironically, she got to wait on the top buyers while the rest of us sat in the back of the room doing nothing.

This isn‚Äôt even the bad part yet. There were a few things. She told me to go to the brand website and pick out a dress from a certain section on their page. This dress was about ‚Ç¨200, and she had brought up multiple times during the internship that I would be able to pick out a dress from the brand (the other intern and I hired online). This was apart of our agreement, and this was even advertised on the initial job posting (which I still have a screenshot of). We just had to tell her which one we wanted and we would get it. 

Onwards, the last day of the the internship, this woman went on to say that we would be paid 250 for the week. I thought this was a little strange as I had worked 6 days, and was expected to be paid 300 euros for all 6 days. I brought this up to her (in a non confrontational way) thinking maybe something had been miscalculated, and her whole demeanor changed. She got mad at me, asking if I thought I deserved to be paid the last day of the internship because we were only working a few hours that day. I said I was a bit confused because I didn‚Äôt know, I thought the terms of our internship were 50 a day, and she tried to go on and say that I was only working a half day. She tried to say that the first day of my internship was a half day, but I replied that we almost worked 8 hours that day and it wasn‚Äôt a half day. She got mad and told me to go downstairs and wait for her to come down if I was so concerned about being paid. 

She paid me in cash from the atm like an hour later, but her demeanor was completely negative the rest of the day I was with her. Our goodbye was super quick and she ended up paying us 300 each. I apologized for the misunderstanding and she said ‚Äúno, there shouldn‚Äôt have been one.‚Äù She said we would have a follow up call about everything, and after that, she ghosted me. I asked her if we would do a follow up soon since I hadnt heard from her in 5 days, and she said ‚Äúyeah we can next week.‚Äù I also asked about the dress that I had picked out from the website, and she replied ‚Äúunfortunately I cannot accommodate to that.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe it! The following week, I heard nothing from this woman. 

While I have tried letting this go, I feel as of I got scammed and used, but I thought, hey, at least I can use her as a reference? I reached out to her again to see if she could be a reference for the jobs I am applying for now, and I have heard nothing.

I know I did a great job during my internship. I was attentive, hard working, punctual. This woman even reminded me several times during this internship how great I was doing, so for her to switch up completely last minute due to this discrepancy is insane to me. Especially when she was extremely unprofessional, bringing on her daughter and her bf to do the same internship, giving them more important roles and unfair treatment. I feel sick as I gave up another internship opportunity with a high end menswear brand because I was told I was going to learn lots from her, only to be scammed and discarded. There was tons of more details to this but I could go on forever, so this is the gist.

So my question now is, do I bring this up to HR at the company, or do I let it go? Ideally I want to report her and what she‚Äôs done. But, I don‚Äôt want this to evolve into something huge, and I don‚Äôt want it to hurt my career. I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I feel like what she did wasn‚Äôt even legal. I really would appreciate any advice given. 

Thanks."

 Being native to Lucknow, got an opportunity at HCl technologies, they be asking 1.5L+taxes as training fees after which guaranteed placement at HCl Lucknow for 2.7lpa.
So here is the confusion, should I choose this hcl or should I keep preparing for various exams like TCS NQT/DIGITAL etc.
I've a feeling that I could easily clear TCS ninja profile that gives 3.5lpa as I have already done that during clg placements, I could do it again, it's a simple test. But parents are a bit sceptical, they are saying that you should grab whatever opportunities you have in front of you. 
There's also this thing, HCl has a bond of 2 years and I'll be posted in Lucknow campus only which is a BIG DOWNSIDE for me as you can easily understand, living with parents and no freedom.

The people are super nice, everyone is friendly and it seems like a really good work environment. 

However, I‚Äôm not sure whether I want to become a project engineer as that is the kind of engineers this company has. They have said that they are short 1-2 engineers and the vibe I got is that if I want the job after graduation they‚Äôll give it. Which is an opportunity I am extremely grateful and privileged to have but part of me wants to explore other maybe more technical roles. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve been having fun with the tasks they‚Äôve given me here; I‚Äôve done some 2D CAD drawings, simulations, and going out on the field to look at various project sites is common. But I‚Äôm not sure if I like the job or if I just like the money and experience I‚Äôm getting from it.  

I‚Äôm going to become a mechanical engineering senior this fall and am planning on working part time here while I finish school but would it be rude if I didn‚Äôt take the full time position after I graduate? Like would they expect me to transition into full time if I want to work part-time during the school year? Part of me having apprehension is that I don‚Äôt want to be stuck being a project engineer especially in the place I live. So would I tell them that I would potentially explore other offers? Or would that make them retract their offer of a job after I graduate. Ideally I would want this company to be a backup of sorts so I could explore other companies. I live in Hawaii which also complicated things more so. Cheers"

Schooling: I was homeschooled with tutor/ teacher and parents. Tutor gave and graded all exams and taught me all math. 

 I am taking gap year because Covid deprived me from having a lot of learning experiences that I wanted to have when homeschooled, such as internships, and was a big reason I was homeschooled.  I got a congressional internship in D.C for gap year and am pursing other impressive internships as well. 

I have no hooks, homeschool could be double edged. Is homeschool a possible hook? I know Stanford MIT Harvard and Princeton admit many homeschoolers and can view homeschooling quite positively,but Yale and others are known to be more harsh so I guess it depends.

Grades:

3.95 unweighted 4.5 weighted GPA

APs: macro 5, micro 4, gov 5, APUSH 4, world history 4. Took AP calc, AP psychology, and AP stats as junior but missed exam registration date due to me being really sick with covid. For what it‚Äôs worth I took the official practice exams overseen by my tutor which I scored 2 5s and 1 4 on. My tutor writes this as well as whole situation in LOR. I am taking the real exams in gap year .

5 EdX certificates in different financial courses

SAT 1470, 770 math 700 English. This was first time taking it. Predicting very likely 1510+ on retake in August and or October. I am scoring over 1510 on all practice exams should be higher but am assuming I will at the very least be able to super score to a 1510. Retake would be in gap year. I decided to start taking sat so late cuz I am taking gap year and if I took it before colleges could have viewed the score as dated/ not representative of my current academic ability. Do you think I made the right call?

ECS: 
1. really complex quantitative and macro economic trading system I invented to take advantage of vast inefficiencies in small and mid cap stocks. Also made money in oil etf strategy I invented. I made 43k in all and 60+ for parents . Started with 4500. 1000s of hours of data analysis and research. Considering Submitting part of research and strategy in supplemental documents . Also considering submitting transaction history to corroborate this. 9th-12th

2. Congressional internship for 2 and a half months. Likely LOR from congressmen, people close to him said as much. Gap year

3. Internship for technology start up . CEO really famous sports trainer. Worked right under him. Did a lot of consulting, profit and scale optimization. Have LOR. 12th

4. Internship for nonprofit. Organized and managed events with 200+ people. Handled staff of 12 . 9th and 10th

5. Made and organized presentation in front of local group of local business people, local commissioner, and concerned citizens, about the need for street lighting to help deter crime. 12th

6.  Organization(non profit status pending) promotes financial literacy among America‚Äôs youth. Online content for all age groups. In talks with 2 schools about potential partnership. 12th

7. Founder and president of club that discusses financial and government news and policy 9th 10th 11th

8. 2200 rated chess player on chess.com 99th percentile 11th 12th

9. Tutored kids in math and history 9th 10th 11th

10.Amazon seller business: 75k sales, 22k profit. Middle school,9th,10th


Essays should be pretty good. I have a lot to write about and I think I write well ( at least that it what I am toldü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

Letter of recommendation. 
10/10 from tutor

Congressman will likely give me a good one

2 great ones from my bosses at the companies I interned for.

Before I apply I have a pretty decent chance of getting an internship for Morgan Stanley (looks like real interest from somebody with hiring power). However nothing is set in stone. It would be in winter but would still write that I got it in application.

Thanks for reading. I appreciate all feedback

My issue is that this current job will allow me to work remotely and have complete control of responsibilities. I could pentest, blue team, work with the networking team. Probably do devops work If I wanted to. Literally anything, they're extremely flexible and willing to let me learn anything. It could be great experience if I were to stick with lower pay for a year or two.

It‚Äôs been affecting my mental health badly and the project is too big to complete by the expected timeline. What should I do about the rest of the internship?


I was fortunate enough to have a Meta software engineer internship this summer. I am currently in week 7 out of 12. My manger just gave me midpoint review that I am currently not on track for a return offer because I‚Äôm so behind-even after they reduced it. The thing is I think the project is unrealistic for an intern (who won‚Äôt do crazy hours). This is my second time interning here and this is x2 the size of my project Iast year. It‚Äôs strange because they keep on telling me that they don‚Äôt expect me to work extra hours and that I shouldn‚Äôt feel pressured to skip intern events to work on the project. However, the have no leniency when I tell them that I‚Äôm not blocked on anything and that the project is just taking more time than expected due the codebase/tools I must use. Not to mention, working extra hours have caused me to get bad migraines and overall isn‚Äôt worth it in terms of productivity. 

Meanwhile, at this point I think Meta is not the place for me. I don‚Äôt like how fast paced it is and I don‚Äôt like how they expect you, at least in the department I‚Äôm in, to code consistently all day. I‚Äôm the type of person who can code for at most 4 hours a day. Honestly, this internship has caused me to hate coding and l think I may need to switch careers (or at least take a long break from it).

That leads me to this question, how do I go about the remainder of the internship? I don‚Äôt want to have a bad rapport but I don‚Äôt want to stress myself about a project I don‚Äôt care about. Should I just go at a pace I‚Äôm comfortable with even if I get more and more behind on the timeline?"

I've been applying for about a month now, and I'm failing to hear back from most companies, which I believe is normal, but I'm confused as to why I'm not receiving some of the automated ones like Goldman Sachs/JPMorgan, or the ones that supposedly everybody gets like Jeff Bezos Company (I have not received OA's from any of these, nor been rejected either).

FWIW, I had had some trouble with ATS scanning earlier in the application season, but I believe it's mostly resolved now. I know that I'm not a particularly attractive or impressive candidate for companies but I take it that even just my grad year would be enough to get an OA.

With that being said, I am in the interview stages with IMC, Palantir, and C1, so I'm probably just overreacting/ranting, especially this early in the process. But I'm struggling to figure out why I'm not receiving OA's or being autorejected, or even more importantly, what there is to do about it.

well so my arms are in pain, the pain started at the beginning of last year when my semester started i remember my first week of uni i had to write to introduce myself and i couldnt write, but if i let my dominant hand (right hand) rest for like half a day i could go on with my normal activities. then it evolved to my wrist hurting at the right side and the pinky and ring finger in pain, figured out it may be carpal or ulnar nerve syndrome and started immobilizing them, the pain grew, went to the doctor, took vitamin b for a month and told me just to rest my arm after finishing the treatment and that was it, the pain started to grew but i started to get used to it so i really didnt notice the signs. last two months of the semester i noticed my main hand began to get weaker and it reached the point where i legit couldnt cut vegetables or do any kind of heavy lifting, since my main hand was in pain i started to use more my left hand. while in those two months of finishing my semester i was doing homework and finals like crazy plus me being the person who feed and cooked for my family.

anyways, my semester finished my hand were numb of pain and i was so glad i could step away from the computer i avoided for ten days any use of devices and only used my phone to chat with friends and meetup, the thing is that the pain didnt go away it got worse to the point i ended up with no strength in BOTH arms now and i couldnt do shit, i didnt feel any pain if i did nothing but if i started doing any sort of activity that required my arms/hands the pain came back.

i went to the doctor for the second time, gave me a treatment with injections of anti-inflammatory and other vitamins, the pain whiles resting disappeared but once i started doing something with my arms the pain came back. i went to specialist, told me to do like 10 blood analysis but the twist here is that they are too damn expensive, my mom got involved and now im a week away from uni starting, i go to another doctor gave us less blood analysis but they were still too expensive.

currently uni started im not enrolled yet talked to my university and they directed me to another specialized doctor from uni and checked me out and gave me another more affordable analysis and another one which is the most expensive so far... and while checking me out he said i could enroll this semester with no issues, after that i talked with the head of my faculty about my situation and since they had the same issue they recommended me to not enroll this semester because this kind of injuries are very delicate and i still havent done my other analysis so i dont know exactly how severe is what i have and money is short, and also while talking with the head of faculty they told me that i also have to do two internships before graduating and technically i had to start doing since last semester but since the situation of my main had was happening i decided to not do it...

I haven't had much improvement with the treatments ive been having, both arms are weak and useless, apart from studying and doing homework that requires me being on the computer all day as any modern day designer i have to do TWO internships before entering my last semester which is the graduation module and time is ticking because i can enroll till august 12, im trying to get money from god knows where to do my analysis and im not even sure if i'll have it, doctors are telling me im ""fine"", the pain hasnt stopped (writing this post has been hell for me)

if i enroll i have to study and work in the awful state of my arms and i dont know which it is, but i can graduate with no problems since im in a really small class which increases my chances of graduating with honors

if i dont enroll i can let my arms rest properly and i can get my analysis with more time, but i'll be joining another class more bigger than mine, losing my chance of graduating with honors, good thing is that i can do my internship in this time while i let my arm rest and probably study more theoretical things about art/design/etc.

tl;dr my arms are in so much pain i cant do shit, im a semester away from graduating, doctors tell me i can enroll this semester, head of faculty recommended me to not, if i enroll this semester i can graduate with honors, if not i lose my chance of it. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO please help me i need advice üò≠üò≠"

But, I also have another opportunity that's like a tech internship that I learned about just today. I think I might take the tech internship over the small business since there's more room for growth, I think.

I think it'd be kind of rude to call him the morning of and tell him I'm actually not going since I would imagine he's told his team I'm coming in already and he's probably set time aside since he said he wanted to train me a bit for a project he has which he thinks I could help with.

Life has thrown many curve balls at me, which have opened a myriad of opportunities for which I want thoughts and advice. For background, I'm a pretty good student (3.94 gpa), learned to program as a kid and have had experience in a variety of levels, have a few industry certs (AWS Solutions Architect Associate) and had some mostly insignificant internship experiences with small local tech companies.

I am considering applying to one of the masters programs at EPFL in Switzerland, or going to school in the US. The first options works for me as I have family there, am Swiss, and would be spending less than 2k a year in tuition.

EPFL has 4 computer science related masters programs:
- Computer Science
- Cyber Security (Dual-Degree with ETH in Zurich)
- Data Analytics
- Communication Systems

How do I pick between those? Is it just interest? Are there ones that will open more doors/opportunities? Is a catch-all Computer Science degree better for being more general, or lacking due to lack of specificity? Does a dual-degree with a school having a stronger reputation justify picking Cyber Security? All thoughts are more than welcome.

Also, in general, what difference can I expect in terms of career opportunity from a top US school compared to a school like EPFL? I have a greencard, so work visa isn't an issue for me. I obviously consider going into a professional career in the US, or startups, or whatever life offers me. Unfortunately my school has few computer science faculty (and they aren't necessarily the brightest) so it's hard to gather advice for large decisions."

wgjdgx,1,2022-08-04,What are some statistics based Python projects I can do that will teach me a lot of new Python concepts?,dcfan105,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/wgjdgx/what_are_some_statistics_based_python_projects_i/,"I'm a EE major, data science minor, and I've found I really like using Python to analyze and visualize data, but I also want to learn more advanced programming stuff.  In my DS class that taught me Python and R basics, we mostly focused on using pandas, numpy,  matplotlib, and similar libraries, and we read in data from files, cleaned it up, and did basis statistical calculations and tests and made various types of graphs. e.g. I grouped data, calculated summary stats both by group and for the entire data set, created bars and histograms, and did tests comparing how similar the distributions of data grouped data were.

I want to go to the next level from here.  What else can I do with Python, specifically in regards to statistics/data analysis that's not _super_ advanced, but a little above what I've described, where I can reasonably teach myself as I go without stuff going way over my head?  

Background knowledge: I'm just finishing up a firmware internship that's been a lot of low level C programming and a little C++ programming, so I'm pretty solid on procedural programming -- I'd say I'm probably at the intermediate level in regards to procedural programming and at a beginner level in OOP.  I understand conceptually the basics of OOP (oddly, it was C that got me comfortable with it, because C structs are a _very_ limited version of classes and using such a simpler version made the most fundamental OOP concepts finally start to actually _stick_ in my head, so the explanations of more advanced concepts made more sense) and even the general ideas of some more advanced stuff, like inheritance and polymorphism, but haven't had much opportunity to actually use any of them.  

I've also done some basic statistical programming in R."

In May, I graduated with my Bachelors and am starting my masters degree in mechanical engineering this fall. I just completed my internship for some good work experience and updated my resume. My mom and dad were saying at dinner how great I have been doing and I will be successful and I should be proud of my achievements.

Here is the problem, In the last week or so the news has been depressing me. These goddamn idiots passing bills jacking up tax rates and making it so I will have less purchasing power, and stupid unnecessary spending that wont be good for debt. And the scary part is this November is so uncertain, we literally could be handing the government to fascism. 

I opened my roth IRA awhile ago and put some of my internship money in it. I also bought a few bonds as an investment. I want to be successful and own a home one day. Its why I went to college.

As I look at my future and my investments and see what these jackasses are doing in government, it makes me really scared for my future. What is the point? What is the point of getting out of bed and working on grad school, when it wont even benefit me? Why bother getting a job when Ill just end up living in a car anyway because I cant buy anything. I called my mom and dad to tell them about this, and they admit they didnt have this problem when they grew up because the world was a little less of a shithole (just a little). the part that makes me super angry is that Im powerless to stop it. Nothing I say or do matters, so I have to just sit back and watch as everything I build goes down a sinkhole.

How do you all do it? How do you keep going when things look so bleak for the foreseeable future? I am scared and uncertain. Especially since this is such a volatile point in my life when I have so many important decisions to make."
wgo4ft,260,2022-08-05,Deathworlders united front part 1.,FORTEHEMPERER,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wgo4ft/deathworlders_united_front_part_1/,"This is war leader Versvesh of imperial highfleet Ziconium.

We were on out way to investigate FTL rupture's near our established space. To say that everyone was on edge would be putting it mildly. Why wouldn't we be? We have just come out of our war with the Valore who we later found out was backed by an entire galactic community that wanted nothing more than to wipe us out. Why? Because we were and I quote ""dangerous and violent deathworlders"". 

Apparently being born on one the harshest habitable worlds in the universe and making it to being a space faring species wasn't a right of passage but a sign that we were a threat. Though the claims did hold some water even with a technological advantage, supplies and mercenaries from other species and a larger fighting force the Valore did not gain much ground. As a matter a fact the war was a massive stalemate with the enemy taking 40 casualties for every one ours.

Still it wasn't justification for genociding our whole species. Ultimately the Valore forces withdrew 5 years ago for unclear reasons. However we knew there was still a threat to the great Zicon empires existence. Though we had hoped to never encounter any members of this ""galactic community"" or any other aliens for that matter.

That is why we were sent out to investigate the FTL ruptures. Surely the third largest fleet in the Zicon armada could ward off any aliens that threatened our existence. However when we reached the system we were shocked. We saw a massive fleet of enormous vessels. We had them outnumbered 2 to 1 sure but that likely wouldn't have mattered since the ships we saw had more guns the guns were bigger to and as we later found out a lot more advanced in design. 

Everyone began to panic many already heading to the escaped pods and dropships. I quickly order my fleet into attack formation and ordered all strike craft to be launched defensive measures activated and weapons trained on the unknown fleet. 

As we prepared for a fight the unknown fleet which was still on the other side of the solar system did the same. I ordered all the ships at my command to hold position and I quickly contacted the Ziconian emperor and the bureaucratic assembly. We were told to continue holding position and scan the unknown ships to see what lifeforms were onboard while they discussed how best to handle the situation.

As we began the scan we noticed the unidentified fleet was also holding its position as well. What was more surprising was many of the lifeforms on board bared resemblance to us. Bipedal very muscular even more so than us with smooth skin and slightly less durable bone structure. They also appeared to have non-sapient and very hairy quadrupeds on board nearly half of their own size.

We relayed this information back to the throneworld. Ultimately we were still frightened. We thought it might be a intentional enemy deception tactic or something to get us to let our guard down. Though some began to think they might be ""deathworlders"" like us.

Only time would tell and boy did it take a lot of time. We were there for 45 cycles and even had to have resource ships bring new rations as we had nearly run out. However the unidentified fleet had not received addition supplies for another 8 cycles. This was of course their larger warships containing larger food stores.

After another 12 cycles one particular shipmaster named Hofiba decided she had enough and was about to move to attack the enigmatic fleet before being sedated by the crew and put in the cargo hold until this was all over. 

Some 23 cycles later one of the unnamed vessels moved to attack us and even fired a shot. We were about to retaliate before strike craft of its own fleet clipped its engines and boarding craft moved in to detain the rogue crew. At this moment it became obvious these alien didn't want war any more than us.

After these incidents many more came to the conclusion that they were outcasts like us and that we need no longer face the void alone. I chocked this up to wishful thinking at the time. However after continuous protest for the next 3 cycles to contact them I ultimately relented.

It went as smoothly as you would expect at first language barriers and all. However eventually our new acquaintances began to show images on the monitors to convey messages and we started doing the same. In the end or rather the true beginning I became a believer pretty quickly. 

They were indeed fellow outcast who had also just came out of a with a galactic community member known as the Sangians who were blood red reptilians who had appeared as mercenaries on our own battlefields. Both sides were certainly still suspicious and both sides tried not to let to much info slip at first but in time we pieced everything together. 

We were supposed to fight. Of course they expected us to fight each other on first contact. They viewed us as little more then violent, primal and territorial they were expecting us to tear each other apart so they could swoop in to kill whoever was left standing. This was the revelation that broke down all the barriers. 

We began to learn everything we could about our new friends who were apparently called humans. Culture, politics, transit, concepts, technology, traditions, history and language. For 240 cycles we shared all the information we could about ourselves and intern they shared all the information about themselves and their pets that we had previously picked up on our scanners as well. They were apparently called ""dogs"" and had both civilian and military applications especially when it came to boosting morale. 

Though it wasn't all good there was initial conflict about our conflicting governing systems. However we came to realize the humans little ""democracy"" was what best worked for them and our monarchy best worked for us. Beyond this we found the humans very agreeable even down to a shared hatred of slavery of other sapient beings. Something the galactic community had been very fond of.

After another 42 cycles we were having full on conversations in each others languages. This was only helped by our standardized alphabets being somewhat similar in the shapes and number of letters. All of this information of course was broadcasted back to our respective governments and eventually the wider populations.

However at the end of the day most of conversations were about military and boy were those conversations fun. We talked espionage and strategy all day. We talked weapons and defense systems all night. And a very distinct trend emerged while human were certainly no slouch's in any department our strategies, tactics and defensive capabilities were undeniably superior. Yet when it came to logistics, espionage and firepower or as one human put it ""more dakka"" it was clear the humans held the edge. This boded well for the future as it was believed that we could standardize on a combination of human weapon, espionage and logistics platforms and Zicon strategies, tactics and defense platforms. 

Truly it was a better outcome than any could have hoped. After all how long would it be before the galactic ""community"" came knocking own our doors after they realized the humans ""tamed"" us the same way they tamed their dogs. That's how'd I imagine they would rationalize it after all we're just a bunch of violent predators to them.

Eventually both species came to wear our titles as deathworlders and so the birth of the Deathworlders United Front was complete. And so we built up and advanced and built up some more and we made a few breakthroughs here and there. We carved up all the space near our respective star states but the system we had first met in was under a joint occupation. It was our cultural exchange system and where all our joint military training operations would take place.

In the end we found out we had simply waited for an attack that was not coming. Why? Because these high and mighty xeno's thought our species so primitive that they didn't bother keeping an eye on us once our fleets had trained our guns on each other. 

Still someone would come looking sooner or later. Mostly slavers looking for exotic merchandise to sell. Imagine the shock on the fools faces when instead of finding  post apocalyptic wasteland after post apocalyptic wasteland with plenty of battered and bruised deathworld slaves to plunder they found bustling metropolis's and massive fleets moving to apprehend them.

In the end all was good but the humans thought it could be better if it costed revealing the truth to the rest of the galaxy. The humans with their excellent espionage technology intercepted and translated a message about another pre spacefaring deathworld species that was being invaded and was far behind enemy lines. They were called Inauditus and they were insectoid creatures with what the humans described as chameleon skin which is to say they would be even better as espionage than humanity.

Ultimately there was yet another debate the first major one between humans and Zicon's since the government debate back during first contact. However when the humans said they would rescue the Inauditus with or without us in order to protect the rights of all sapient beings. Well even the emperor himself was impressed with their conviction. 

So here I stand in the bridge of the possibly the largest warship in the galaxy ever built well at that point bigger ones were already on the way. I am now supreme war master of the combined fleet of hope based in the system where I and my second in command human fleet admiral Jacob had met all those cycles ago. We were ready to launch our first true operation into the heart of the enemy.

Was it dangerous? Yes! Was it insane? Of course! But as the old human saying goes no pain no gain. So now we power up our FTL drive's and head towards the homeworld of the Inauditus in the heart of enemy territory so that they to would not face the void and the horrors of war alone."
wgpdyq,17,2022-08-05,"Got rejected for answering ""where do you see yourself in five years?"" honestly. And the interview was a cringefest.",rinkiyake_papa,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/wgpdyq/got_rejected_for_answering_where_do_you_see/,"I recently applied for a tech internship and got through all the rounds of the process (test, technical interviews of three rounds) and finally got to the HR round of the interview. And it is said in my uni that whoever makes to the HR round has most certainly got the offer. So I was confident. My technical interviews were good, answered most of their questions, they were looking for someone who had a similar profile that of mine. So I thought, what could go wrong?

Well, in the HR round, it started off with the normal introduction etc., the interviewer seemes laid back and friendly, it was more of a conversation and less of an interview...and after a while the age-old question popped up : ""where do you see yourself in five years?"" So, as confident and comfortable I had become, I said : ""I think I'd be looking for my own startup/business as I'd have enough experience of the industry in 5 years or so."" Then he goes : ""yeah no but, what is your short-term goal?"" Me : ""as of now, I want to get into the tech industry and learn more about tech as I have zero experience."" Him : ""then why do you think you'll be a good fit for &lt;insert company name&gt;?"" This is where I started to get what he was trying to get out of me. And I was hell-bent on not giving him what he wanted. So I went on : ""I think that &lt;insert company name&gt; would be a good fit for me as the profile you are looking for matches my interest, so I'll be able to see what's the real-life experience is like, working with those technologies. I'll have an experience as well."" He tried asking me the same question by turning it up and down and reframing it multiple times, but got the same answer. I'm not gonna start larping for your company and start entertaining you about why would I be a good wage slave to your corporation. I'm not gonna say I'll stick to your company as if I owe something to them, even before actually getting into it. I was nothing but honest about my goals and plans of the future, of *my* future, and told you because you asked."

I'm in my last year (months) of my thesis, hope to defend it have gone since I wrote about 20 pages since october 2021. Prior to this, I did good during the internship and let's say the first year was'nt bad.

---------------------

So my question is: how it went from success (master+internship) to failure ?

My response is that I had a core environment (and behavior) that allowed me to succeed. And most of it was based on some pillarssuch as:

- Working with other people and helping them, being part of a group

- strict schedules and premade plans due to courses and exams

- Having rewards or feedback at least

- Being under pressure, thanks to a paradigm that basically was ""no master/thesis, no job"".

---------------------

But now all of that changed, and have been destroyed by time, work culture, long term goals and less rewards, rejection of stress,  autonomy in planing things as well as incertainity and changes in the planning...

So, I'm just curious: what are your pillars that makes you functionnal or even better, successfull ?

Do you have suggestions on how to rebuild or even change these pillars/principles ?

thanks for the reading, I hope it does not sound to mysterious."

As was everyone else in his fleet and in the entire galactic community for that matter. Why wouldn't we be it seems like we are on the verge of exterminating 3 whole deathworld species in a matter of a few thousand cycles an unprecedented new record. The savages truly stood no chance not when those ugly half hairless mammals and green skins had already presumably nuked half of each others worlds to oblivion. Sure they wouldn't get to terraform a lot of worlds and slaves would be even harder to come by than was usual for a pacified deathworld species by who cared?

They were the most dangerous savages we had seen in a century it was only natural to just let them duke it out.  Once their fleets had locked all weapons on each other we knew they would destroy each other. They were simple aggressive primal's after all and of course the crown jewel of my achievements outside of my perfectly maintained jet black scales. Personally leading a fleet to wipe out a pre-spacefaring deathworld species and take some 200 to be sold as exotic slaves to any buyers interested in those sorts of toys.

Though these ones were interesting they were grotesque insectoid's with a powerful natural cloaking ability. It was 95% effective across all light spectrums making them near impossible to see under any circumstances. Unfortunately for them near impossible is not the same as truly impossible. Which is why we had lost only 15 soldiers per every beast neutralized. A very high casualty rate under normal circumstances but none at all when dealing with deathworlds. Just look for their silhouette and shoot sure its hard to see but once you do spot them they're dead.

So here am I searching for the latest galactic news and as it turned a Quin'tq system with a fleet of more than 500 ships had gone dark. Certainly interesting but I and many others found no need to the worry as the colonies were left unharmed those many colonist did report seeing what looked like a battle in the skies. As well as all communications technology ceasing functionality during the event.

Indeed there was wreckage of the entire fleet and all of the orbital defense stations we chocked it up to an enormous spaceborne creature with an electromagnetic pulse. That did not explain the fighting but everyone just went with it. 

For a while everything quieted down and as a planned my next moved against the buggy barbarians a similar story popped up. Within less than a quarter of a cycle 3 more Quin'tq and one Valore system had gone silent to. Same story in all of them fire in the sky electronics busted wrecked fleets. Except the Valore system in which a major industrial zone was hit with orbital bombardment before the attackers left. 

We chocked it up to vengeful pirates the Valore were tough on space piracy after all. However the sheer magnitude of the projectiles and energy bolts fired indicated something much more powerful. More stories of systems going dark and having their fleets wiped out with no way to tell the outside galaxy while it happened. The Valore and the Sangians were the only ones to get hit with orbital bombardment though and the yet unseen foe never seemed to target the slave pens.

I starting realizing where they were heading. Right for me and my fleet. Were they here to ruin my glorious conquest? Everyone else though quickly picked up on the more important detail, where they were coming from.

It was the quarantine sector where the ""humans"" and ""zicons"" lived. It couldn't be they would have wiped each other out they should have wiped each other out. Yet as we sent specifically Emp hardened stealth probes to survey the areas that we had previously known as human and Zicon space.

Instead we encountered humans far outside of their original and zicons far outside the region we encountered them in as well. Small packs of each also lived among the larger populations of the other. We didn't know what was happening nobody did. Did they never fight? No no deathworlders are far to violent. It was worse they had already fought and recovered one had clearly conquered the other. Yet we could not discover who was conquered and who was the conqueror. Our state of the art probes where picked off one by one as they entered deeper into the savages space.

We had very little intel on the barbarians new state. Yet they seemed to have a good idea of where they were going. Low and behold they continued to march on towards my position only taking detours to enact  their primal vengeance against the respective species that had been responsible for trying to exterminate them. Needless to say the galactic community was in a panic. No doubt they wanted to bring the disgusting bugs into the fold as well.

More than 200k ships came to reinforce his already formidable fleet of 85k. They had begun to ramp of extermination efforts against the feral bugs and intern the  Inauditus had began to resist more fiercely casualty rate jumped up from 15 of our sacrificial pawns for 1 bug to 92 of them for 1 bug turning one the lowest casualty deathworld campaigns into one of the highest.

I guess the other deathworlders could sense their opportunity dwindling.  The savages arrived with a fleet of 10k large ships against my 285k sure their ships were bigger but advantage was to great for even death worlders to overcome right?

Well no. They probably would have still won if that was it but with a much higher casualty rating. but as my fleet moved to engage roughly 20k FTL ruptures appeared behind us and and seemingly fired at will cutting off any chance at escape. Turns out 2 thirds of the fleet had taken a detour to a neighboring system and waited for the perfect moment to jump in right behind us not 1/1000 of a cycle after we began moving toward the diversionary force. 

In the end the deathworlders lost barely 3k warships and 8k strike craft while my entire fleet was eradicated with my command ship being the only thing left and even then it was very damaged and the enemy still strafed the hangers to clear out the last few damage strike craft that had landed for repairs.

In the end I had no choice but to dishonorably surrender to the deathworlders I hope I can be forgiven in the land of the night once I finally pass away."

Pe scurt sunt anul 2 la Facultatea de Matematica si Informatica din Brasov si sunt in cautare de un internship sau un job. Simt ca mi ar prinde foarte bine, ca ar putea chiar foarte mult sa ma faca sa inteleg ce inseamna sa lucrezi in acest domeniu, facultatea efectiv nu stiu cat de mult te lasa sa ""gusti"" din ce se intampla cu adevarat intr o firma. Cam astea sunt nedumeririle mele:

1. Cand esti considerat Junior? Multe anunturi de juniori cereau destul de multe tehnologii plus ceva experienta (1-2 ani). Anunturile de internship la fel, multe invartindu se in jurul unui an experienta sau unui internship de min 6 luni in spate.

2.Care ar fi un site bun unde as putea sa gasesc niste anunturi ceva mai potrivite pentru ce caut? Folosesc LinkedIn mai nou, acolo am si gasit Anunturile despre care am zis la punctul 1.

3.Ce vor angajatorii sa vada pe CV? Proiecte extra? Alte cursuri extra pt programare? Am aplicat la niste firme la care chiar simteam ca indeplinesc cerintele si totusi niciun semn de viata de la ei. 

 Daca doreste cineva sa discutam mai mult in privat despre asta puteti sa mi dati mesaje, poate va arat concret CV ul ca sa va faceti alta parere.

Pe parte de Skilluri am niste baze bune in C++ si C#, am folosit pentru un mic proiect ASP.Net. Ma descurc bine cu structurile de date, algoritmica si programarea pe obiecte overall. Pe partea de baze de date am mai lucrat in MySql si SSMS

Fel

Fel awoke to find herself back in the Freatathay home, having slipped into the bed with Leo and Cauladra last night after she spent some time gliding high above the home, alone. It was partly to keep guard, but she mainly didn't feel like confronting Leo directly after her rampage, knowing that he would want to have her talk about it. But they knew each other too well for that, and her absence would convey more than any words.

It wasn‚Äôt that she felt any deep remorse for killing all those soldiers, in actuality that was part of the problem, she was numb to it. The real issue that was plaguing her thoughts, was that part of her was fully willing to let everyone else in that room die if it meant saving Leo, even Cauladra and herself. They were all going to die anyway, so why not risk it?

It was impulsive though, and could have gotten them killed. ‚Äò*Probably another reason I was set off‚Ä¶*‚Äô Her thoughts became somber as she shifted around in the soft quilt.

Looking to her left, she was met with the sight of a slumbering Leo being held close to Cauladra, his head to her chest as she looked almost protective. The elf was awake and running a hand through his long dark brown hair, his skin still a little sickly from the mana depletion.

Fel hoped the arch mage would catch up to Leo in knowledge, that way she wouldn't have to constantly worry over him. She still didn't trust herself with what the man could teach her, but if a situation like she was in ever came up again, which would seem likely, then she would need to learn a little.

‚Äò*At least enough to slip out of that situation‚Ä¶ Maybe some illusionary magic? Can't hurt anyone with light and sound-*‚Äô The thought cut short as Leo cuddled closer to his student, the adorable sight making her smile.

If the world was as peaceful as this moment, then she could be content to lay in bed for hours. Unfortunately, it was far from that, the morning was young, and there was a bothersome shuffling and whispers outside their room.

A near silent groan escaped Fel as she listened to the fanatics of Sciesch‚Äôs family. They had been skulking around trying to get Leo alone for his entire stay here, and if it wasn‚Äôt for Sciesch‚Äôs immediate family corralling the rest away, they might have gotten their opening.

Fel was five seconds from getting out of bed to shoo them off when someone beat her to it, hearing them disperse at the sound of an incoming pair of footsteps. Her gratitude for the woman who dealt with them increased further when they began guarding the door, granting her however much time left to enjoy this peaceful moment.

Uri

Uri had awoken into a half lucid state, dried tears present on her face from her breakdown the day prior while she stared up at the ceiling in contemplation. This was not the first time she found herself like this, and it dredged up painful memories that she would rather stay buried. Her lips curled into a frown, and she shook the thoughts before they sparked any more unwanted emotions.

After some prolonged introspection, she chose to immediately have her discussion with Leo. The man seemed allergic to the practice of formality and tact, or at least with *her* anyway, so she would try being direct and blunt with her intentions, which meant talking about the council's intentions.

If he was as intelligent as all supporting information points to him being, then the man having a general idea would make things a lot easier for her, maybe. She already secured a deal via oath with him, showing that he *is* willing to allow dragons to settle in Telnar. The current problem is that she now needed to seriously make headway as quickly as possible, lest she get permanently hung out to dry. She would also not get much out of the deal during said talks if his attitude toward her continued to worsen.

How she was going to go about doing that however‚Ä¶

‚Äò*His personality I'm starting to understand, but his goals... I'm about to go against everything I learned and worked for back home, maybe even betray the council itself, not that they haven't already turned their backs on me‚Ä¶ Gods I hope I'm right*.‚Äô She contemplated while traversing the large home to meet with Leo, but slowed down as she approached at the sight of an anxious looking tiefling pacing back and forth near the human‚Äôs room.

The crimson skinned woman froze, and a moment of recognition dawned on the dragon. ‚Äò*Hmm, Sciesch was it? She was the whole reason we're here and not in Zalyvia. I probably should offer a formal introduction if-*‚Äô

Sciesch spun around and darted away and down the hall, out of sight and out of mind in moments. ‚Äò*Or not‚Ä¶ Wonder what that was about?‚Äô* She thought while making a mental note to eavesdrop on her a bit more, just in case it was of actual import.

Yesterday's conversation about the new company, Freatathay Enterprise, was intriguing in only as much as what was used to mass produce things on such a scale. She had no interest in the logistical and personal planning that was constantly being discussed by the tiefling family. Thus she, for the most part, focused on listening to Leo and his lovers. Well, his lovers anyway, because he often used an annoying privacy spell.

Although, it was interesting to discover that the human could bear a child with an elf, and that bit of information could be useful if she played it as much as possible before it became public knowledge.

Knocking on the door, she waited, having to suppress the reflexive compulsion to compose herself. It wouldn't do to start the conversation off poorly.

Expecting to be called in, the door opened to reveal Fel, and over the other dragon shoulder she could see Leo laying in the elf's embrace while he slumbered. His skin still looked a little pale, but not by much.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù Fel remarked a bit pointedly, hinting that it wasn't a good time.

‚Äò*But when is? I can't waste any more time.*‚Äô The irritable thought only cemented her determination.

She needed to be blunt. ‚ÄúI need to talk to Leo about Telnar's future, and his potential supporters.‚Äù

The reaction her response elicited from Fel was that of hostility, their posture and expression changing from a casual irritation, to straightened and on guard.

‚Äò*Well, if there ever was a confirmation‚Ä¶*‚Äô

Fel glanced back at the contrastingly calming scene to the current rising tension, then back to her. ‚ÄúHe's occupied at the moment.‚Äù She stepped out into the hall and closed the door, gesturing to follow her into the vacant room across. ‚ÄúWhatever you have to discuss with him, I think it's best that I handle it.‚Äù

This is probably the worst thing Uri could do, but whatever she would talk with Leo about would end up being discussed with Fel anyway, and it's not like they would start a fight here of all places.

She hoped‚Ä¶

Fel

A wide range of emotions permeated throughout Fel, from a deep fear of being confronted with her connections to Yez‚Äôs shadow rebellion, to blinding rage that Uri chose *now* of all times to have it.

Fel hated Uri‚Äôs constant kissing up and flying around the subject as much as Leo, and having them interrupt the little bonding time between him and Cauladra irked her. Something changed about Uri though, she seemed different, more direct. Whether that was good or not was yet to be seen, but Fel hoped that this could be resolved peacefully.

There had always been an unspoken acknowledgement between the council's representative and the rest of them. They knew she was spying on them and wanted to gain some sort of authority in Telnar, and she knew of the reason behind Leo‚Äôs summoning.

‚ÄúThis works out too I suppose, because I wanted to discuss the reason for you summoning him. As well as who trained you to do so.‚Äù

Fel‚Äôs anger spiked over the fear, because they were indeed going to have a conversation that should have happened ***before*** the trip, and after closing the door to the side room, she rounded back on her with visible disdain. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had *months* to broach this subject. Are you seriously pulling this shit now?‚Äù She hissed in a low growl, and held back the desire to wring her neck.

Uri‚Äôs lips thinned into something between a wince and a grimace. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve‚Ä¶reached my limit for etiquette, so I‚Äôm going to follow Leo‚Äôs example.‚Äù She replied while calmly stepping back to take a seat on a nearby couch.

Fel scowled at the raven haired dragon before huffing and taking a seat opposite of her. ‚ÄúOut with it.‚Äù She spat, but there was a hint of worry in her voice.

On the one hand, she could finally put to rest that one lingering thread to her past, having already cut all ties with Yez after the stunt they pulled. On the other hand, it could devolve relations instantly, but there was only a small chance of that happening due to Telnar being the growing center of power on the continent.

It would be a hell of a lot more beneficial to strengthen relations than crash it.

‚ÄúFirstly, you're no longer connected to a certain group that seeks to undermine the council, is that correct?‚Äù The dispassionate and direct bluntness of the question seemed more like a statement than a question, her amenable and placating facade utterly absent.

‚Äò*No bullshit then? At least this'll be quick‚Ä¶*‚Äô - ‚ÄúNo, that relationship was mostly cut before the massacre.‚Äù A shake of the head accompanied another much deeper scowl, this one more indirect as her thoughts flickered between Rak, the sadistic monster, and Yez, the manipulative bitch.

Uri visibly untensed, showing that the woman was as worried about that particular detail as her. Neither of them wanted to start something over that, not to mention all the messy politics that would accompany it. It would be hell for most of the continent if word ever got out to the wider public that the dragons were so divided as to have a shadow war, and even more so if they found out why.

‚ÄúThen are you willing to talk about what relationship you *did* have with them? Maybe even provide the locations of-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, and if you want to continue this conversation, then I suggest dropping any such requests.‚Äù She interjected with a hard tone, her gaze boring into the woman across from her.

While Fel hated Yez for what she did and how much of a cunt she was, it was another matter to out all of her friends who still worked for her, not to mention ruining the restoration effort back on the island.

That wasn‚Äôt to say that she couldn‚Äôt tell her about what *her* role was. ‚ÄúBut as for what I was doing for them‚Ä¶‚Äù

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Uri

Uri intently listened to Fel go over what was *supposed* to happen before Leo took control of the small rebellion, like she assumed he did. She asked the odd question concerning his rapid proficiency for magic, but everything lined up with the months-long investigation that followed after the *incident.* That, on top of the agonizingly slow arguments, was why it took so long for the council to initially react.

She also had to fight back a scowl at how badly Rak had truly fucked everything up for the council, having spearheaded the attack and teleporting the mages in, giving no warning to the rebels. Then again, if he didn't, then she wouldn't be where she is today, a conflicting thought as the position of council head would have been a very alluring prospect.

But given recent events, there is a hard emphasis on *would have.*

Fel leaned forward, and the tension clearly rose as her gaze hardened. ‚ÄúAlright, I think I‚Äôve humored your curiosity enough. It‚Äôs my turn. We all know you're reporting on everything you find out here to the council, and we have an idea about your *role*. So, what do you want, what's the endgame here?‚Äù

This was it, the moment that she would betray everything she worked for, but it wasn't like she had much of a choice. ‚ÄúWe wish to gain control of Telnar, and use it as a way to control the other kingdoms indirectly.‚Äù There was a drawn out moment of silence, Fel slowly raising a brow as her expression became more expectant.

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm to be the inevitable leader once I‚Äôve established some power in Telnar.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll likely spread out our influence to kingdoms farther west? Near the wastes.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don't understand what you want me to say.‚Äù

Fel‚Äôs face was contorted into confusion and frustration. ‚Äú*Okay*, I already know what the council wants, Leo too. What *I* want to know is where does the council see Telnar in its plans, say, two thousand years from now?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell we keep it going in the direction as is, and simply use it to-‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what direction is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off with no obvious answer, because the status quo was always the main goal. Keep the dragons in power to ensure their safety. There ***wasn't*** anything they were actively working toward.

Fel sighed and threw her hands up in frustration. ‚ÄúAnd this is where the problem lies. The council‚Äôs goals are control and suppression, often through using the other races like game pieces. Telnar is the exact opposite.‚Äù

Uri understood that, it was the whole reason why the council wants/wanted Telnar. They would be the hub of influence and power that could be used to expand their control without having the messy management of the academies. ‚ÄúIt's a waste of power. How can you simply let the other kingdoms benefit from your efforts? You should at least leverage it to consolidate more power, or else you might find yourself being usurped by another.‚Äù

Fel barked a laugh. ‚ÄúYou're seriously not fucking getting it. It's not about power, it's not about control, it's not even really about undermining the council. Leo already gave you the reasoning, but I‚Äôll spell it out for you. **He. Wants. A. Better. World.** Not because of gaining power or control, he could do that over night if he wanted with just his magic, but because it is what he *wants* to do-*No*, because he feels obligated to.‚Äù

Uri scoffed. ‚Äú*Obligation*? Does he see himself as some sort of savior?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat else is power used for than to enrich and protect what you care about?‚Äù Fel bit back with a cross of her arms.

Uri had to concede that point, it was the whole reason the council existed, but even the act of generosity itself is propped up by selfishness. ‚ÄúIt is natural for a person or group to benefit off the backs of others. To simply expect that someone won‚Äôt eventually desire the power you have for their own benefits and protection is not only ignorant, it's blind stupidity.‚Äù

Fel sneered as her tail whipped the couch, the furniture listing from the strength. ‚ÄúAnd how did that work out for the council, of spreading chaos and death across the continent? What exactly did that earn them? Control, sure. But has anyone really benefited? No! Not even our people have benefited from everything they‚Äôve done!‚Äù

Uri‚Äôs blood boiled from the blatant dismissal of the efforts put in to make sure their people weren't subjected to being hunted again, especially hers. ‚ÄúNothing!? If not for the original members, we wouldn't have established ourselves as the powerful force we are today. They have kept us ahead of-...of‚Ä¶‚Äù Her mind blanked, as they already controlled the magic and were united as a people, for the most part.

Fel barked another laugh, this one full of mockery. ‚ÄúExactly! Who the fuck were they keeping us ahead of? They had more than enough time to strengthen our people after Terra, they didn't need to back a genocidal war. And even after the light born, they already controlled the magic! Why the fuck do they have to go around starting wars!?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo prevent them from developing enough strength to combat us! Have you forgotten that we were hunted!?‚Äù She spat back, knowing that at least that was justifiable.

‚ÄúFucking-‚Äù Fel drew in a long breath before exhaling. ‚ÄúYou really are a dumb short sighted bitch.‚Äù

Uri was about to spit back another response when Fel held out a hand to stop her. ‚ÄúHas it occurred to you, that spending so much time focusing on keeping everyone else down, locking away and hoarding knowledge, not using any of that time and power to wisely strengthen our people as a whole, and intern the world, is what led to the council‚Äôs loss of power and mad scramble to get ahead of Leo in the first place?‚Äù

The question was like a slap to the face, and never before had Uri felt such frustration. Fel was right, logically she was right, but that would mean‚Ä¶

Uri‚Äôs shoulders slumped as she realized what path she was on all this time, and the inevitability that a situation like Leo was only a matter of time. She wouldn't have made a single difference, and wouldn't have really changed a damn thing, even if she did become head of the council. 

‚ÄúA dead end‚Ä¶‚Äù

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Lilathe

It was early in the morning, and only a few hours until the family was to head out and finally leave this god forsaken place. All there was to do today was to check and double check to make sure everything was settled and every one was packed.

Having already finished with things on her end, Lilathe was running out the clock with her sisters. As well as trying to help Sciesch get over whatever irrational thoughts were preventing them from confronting Leo.

Lilathe was in Sciesch‚Äôs room, watching with Nytra as their sister paced back and forth. ‚ÄúYou're overthinking it sis.‚Äù She tried to reassure the frantic woman from her position on the couch.

Lilathe had never seen her sister in such a state before, or any tiefling for that matter. Their tail was flicking around constantly, she scratched at her horns like a scared little child hearing the whispers for the first time, and for some reason, her eyes seemed to have a stronger glow about them.

‚ÄúMom‚Äôs told you what we are, what he told her, we‚Äôre succubi! Human myths make us out to be manipulative demons that use our abilities to entrap men. How can I *not* worry about it?‚Äù

Nytra snorted, an action that has fit well with her constant beaming from finally settling her own business. ‚ÄúYeah, he told her. Then went back to fucking her with even more gusto.‚Äù She chuckled. ‚ÄúBesides not being initially honest with him, I think you're good. And even then, he seems like someone understanding enough to know why you didn't tell him.‚Äù

While Lilathe agreed that it was a simple thing to straighten out the problems by confronting the man, she was still on the fence about his character. She knew that it was unfair for her to be biased against him on the grounds of inadvertently affecting their family by simply existing, but she couldn't shake the fact that he ***is*** the linchpin for it all.

‚ÄúYou don't understand. I feel‚Ä¶ Agh!‚Äù Sciesch pulled at their hair in frustration, and now Lilathe knew that her eyes weren't playing tricks on her, her sister's eyes were glowing brighter.

Glowing eyes weren't a visual indicator of the voices, but anything physically magical was something that was definitely a red flag. ‚ÄúSis‚Ä¶ You don't hear any voices? Do you?‚Äù She asked worriedly.

Although her gaze was on Sciesch, she could feel Nytra‚Äôs piercing eyes dart to her, likely having the same thought.

Sciesch gave her a questioning look, but there was a far off expression that overshadowed it. ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù

Lilathe tensed. ‚ÄúNo!? What do you mean no?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I don't know! No! I don't hear any whispers at all!‚Äù There was an assured look in those glowing eyes, which were at least two to three times their normal illumination.

‚Äò*God is it really that bad‚Ä¶?*‚Äô Lilathe stood up and began taking off her clothing. She would not let her sister succumb, but she stopped undressing from a hand on her shoulder.

It was Nytra‚Äôs, and their expression stern as all previous amusement from her successful revenge was gone. ‚ÄúSciesch, describe it. And don't leave out any details.‚Äù

Lilathe slapped Nytra‚Äôs hand away. ‚ÄúAre you fucking insane?‚Äù She spat angrily, because it was basic knowledge that delving into those feelings would only worsen their affliction.

Nytra gave her a sharp look, one that was usually reserved for those who really fucked her over. ‚ÄúYou and I both know how it's supposed to look and feel. And that-‚Äù She pointed a finger at Sciesch, who had a painfully confused expression. ‚Äú-is not it.‚Äù

Nytra was correct, if anything, their eyes became more vacant and they would lose themselves in a twisted greed. This level of hesitation and over cautiousness was definitely something else. But even still, doing this was the most reckless thing imaginable, and Lilathe had to bite back a particularly sharp response.

Her head darted between the two with worry, anger, and deep apprehension plain. ‚Äú...Fine.‚Äù She conceded through gritted teeth, trusting her sister's judgment.

Nytra nodded for Sciesch to start. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ It's as if my every being is against the idea of confronting him. Logically I‚Äôve come to terms with it, but I don't know why I feel this way. There isn't the usual tug at the back of my mind from thinking about our magic, or history. Just a strong aversion, and it doesn't even feel emotional‚Ä¶‚Äù

Nytra sighed heavily. ‚ÄúMom was right then. You‚Äôve been screwing him too long.‚Äù

Lilathe scowled. ‚ÄúThis is **his** fault?‚Äù She hissed, realizing what Sciesch had been hesitant to tell her on the ride in.

‚ÄúI don't think so. At least not entirely.‚Äù Nytra stared at Sciesch with concern. ‚ÄúI have a guess as to what's happening, but you need to talk to him. And you have to be *sure* that you trust him.‚Äù

Sciesch‚Äôs expression hardened. ‚ÄúI do. But‚Ä¶‚Äù She reverted back to her apprehension, and Nytra turned for the door.

‚ÄúThat's all I need to know. Wait here.‚Äù

Confused, Lilathe followed after Nytra. ‚ÄúWhat was that about, and what do you think was happening?‚Äù She asked while they walked down the halls.

‚ÄúWhat do you know about how our people were freed?‚Äù Nytra responds, as if to answer her question.

Lilathe was never one for studying history, because most of it would be caked in religious rhetoric. What books that weren't, were usually based on those texts. ‚ÄúOnly some speculation based on those who studied stuff from the fanatics and cults. The human broke the bonds that enslaved us to the other more powerful demons, and not just ours here on Sinum, but supposedly all of our kind across existence.‚Äù She answered skeptically, not sure if she should put stock in any of that being true.

‚ÄúAlmost everyone knows that. I asked *how*?‚Äù Her question was met with a casual shrug, Lilathe not sure where this was going. ‚ÄúYou're right, it's all mostly speculation. And the two groups that know are both nuts, but from what the more sane of us had put together is that he made a deal or some kind of pact with a demon that had power over us. The details behind it are a mystery, but suffice to say a blood oath was involved, and I think that this might have something to do with it.‚Äù She explained while they made their way upstairs, and Lilathe couldn't help but scoff.

‚ÄúAre you seriously saying that our entire race is affected by a blood oath? And somehow Leo is triggering it?‚Äù The very idea was absurd, even if the effects line up with how she was reacting. This had to be something else.

They stopped in a hallway short of Leo‚Äôs room. ‚ÄúYes and no. I only said it has something to do with it.‚Äù She turned to her with a mischievous glint in her eye. ‚ÄúAnd of all the things that have happened so far, with a human and two dragons under our roof no less, you really think it‚Äôs *that* far-fetched?‚Äù She asked while giving her a playful tap on the cheek, then moved on to the human‚Äôs room.

Lilathe stood there trying to come up with a retort, but her jaw slowly hung open as she realized that pretty much anything was possible given the current circumstances.

‚Äò*And my family is in the middle of it‚Ä¶*‚Äô - ‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Cauladra

Cauladra sat up on the bed with Leo laying back and resting between her legs, the two of them having started up a conversation on his world's entertainment and general mythology.

‚ÄúSo we're based off this *Norse mythology*?‚Äù She had to admit, the light elves contrasting with the dark sounded vague enough to resemble her people with the drow.

‚Äú*Eh*‚Ä¶ Not really. The only real differences are the ears and skin color, otherwise they would look like any other human. And the ears are nowhere near as long as yours. Not to mention that I've seen a few other variants outside yours and the drow that fit more with a few different video games‚Ä¶ Actually‚Ä¶ With your eyes starting to tint green‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off in thought, and she flicked him on the head to get his attention.

‚ÄúI would rather be based off legend than fictional entertainment. At least then I know there is a chance of it being true, if what you told me about the tieflings is anything to go by.‚Äù She grumbled with a little annoyance, having already come to terms with the fact that her people‚Äôs sexual plight was due to a pantheon member being lazy. She didn't need another thing to mull over.

‚Äú*Uh*, right‚Ä¶ Change of topic then?‚Äù He offered awkwardly.

‚Äú*Hmm*‚Ä¶‚Äù There was a near limitless number of things she could ask him, but given recent events she wanted to have a casual conversation about anything other than magic, as much as she wanted to. For his sake of mind as much as hers.

Her cheeks flushed as an idea came to mind, even if it was way too early to decide. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ How about coming up with a name for our child?‚Äù She meant to sound only a little hesitant, but it came out almost meek.

‚Äò*Gods, what is wrong with me? We need to talk about this anyway.*‚Äô

Leo was silent for a few moments before he let out a long breath. ‚ÄúHonestly? I have ***no*** clue. But, I would prefer them to be named along the lines of your people's naming scheme, because I‚Äôm not giving an elf a human name. That just feels wrong to me‚Ä¶ So I‚Äôm open to suggestions.‚Äù

It slipped her mind that he would name them something ostensibly *not* elven, but it felt even more weird for her to be the one coming up with them. For elves, it was the man who came up with the names.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ If it's a boy, then how about Mehlar or Ardelan?‚Äù She asks and he takes a moment to consider.

‚ÄúI like Ardelan. And I assume we‚Äôll be using your last name too? Never liked mine‚Ä¶‚Äù His reply confused her greatly, because a family name was usually held with pride unless there was some kind of friction.

‚Äò*Or maybe it's just a human thing? But I guess that it works out with him being the only line of his family on this world. Still‚Ä¶*‚Äô - ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ Sure? But I‚Äôd like to have *something* of you included. What about giving them your middle name? Surely there's a good story behind it.‚Äù She proposed.

Leo snorted. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I *guess* we could use Alexander‚Ä¶ But the story behind it is that there isn't one.‚Äù He answered in a slightly amused tone. ‚ÄúYou see, my mother was one hell of a dreamer. My first and middle names were in reference to famous people in human history. They had nothing to do with my family directly, it was just her believing that I'd somehow change the course of‚Ä¶the‚Ä¶world‚Ä¶.‚Äù He trails off, apparently catching on to the fact that his mother had been correct in some way.

‚ÄúWell shit‚Ä¶‚Äù He voiced in a mixture of annoyance and disbelief, causing Cauladra to try and hold back from chuckling. ‚ÄúIt's not funny!‚Äù His mock offense resulted in her breaking down in a small fit of laughter.

‚ÄúAlright, Alright. How about you offer up a name if it's a girl?‚Äù He pressed while slumping a little dejectedly in her hold.

‚Äú*Heh*, okay‚Ä¶ Hmm‚Ä¶ How about Tyrande or Sylvanas?‚Äù She offered, and he glanced up to her a little slack jawed.

A knock on the door prevented her from inquiring as to his reaction.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Leo

It disappointed him to leave Cauladra behind to have a private discussion with his close friend. But it at least had him thankfully avoid a conversation on why certain names would be poor choices.

Leo knew that Sciesch needed a push in order to get her to open up, but for her own sisters to fetch him was‚Ä¶concerning. Even more so when Nytra refused to elaborate on the specifics of what she thought was wrong with Sciesch, while Lilathe had returned to giving him the stink eye.

He didn't think that it was his fault for Sciesch‚Äôs hesitation, until he entered the room and saw the woman stare at him like a deer in the headlights. Only those lights turned out to be her own eyes, which glowed sharply upon seeing him,

‚Äò*Oh what the fuck did I do now?*‚Äô He mentally sighed, closing the door behind him and taking a silent seat  on the couch.

Sciesch bit her lip, her eyes darting between him and the couch opposite, and he realized that they momentarily glowed brighter every time they landed on him. ‚Äò*Yup, definitely my fault.*‚Äô The thought caused him to inwardly groan, and he tried to use a little gravity to coax her to move by giving her a tug in his direction.

‚Äò*Maybe a simple heart to heart will fix thi-*‚Äô

Nothing happened.

He tried again, but a little harder, enough to mimic a shove.

Nothing happened.

‚Äú...What?‚Äù Was all he could say before she leapt at him, the couch listing backwards and falling to the floor with a thud.

He grunted when they hit the floor, and he gazed up to see that Sciesch had a near manic look in her eyes, as if she was unsure about what she was doing. ‚Äú\~Please\~ \~forgive me\~ \~Im sorry\~‚Äù She begged in a tone that seemed layered with another.

‚Äò*Oh what in the fucking fuck is* ***this*** *fuckery!?*‚Äô

The voice was surprisingly at the bottom of the list of things he was currently alarmed by from the woman atop him, the foremost was that she was partially on fire. The next was that his body had become numb, and he was starting to break out into a sweat, but not from the fire that was burning away her clothes to reveal her bare naked form.

‚Äú\~Please\~ \~forgive me\~‚Äù She looked like she was on the verge of tears, but now he felt the pain of her nails digging into his shoulders.

‚ÄúFuck, yes, alright! I‚Äôll fucking forgive you, now please stop scaring the shit out of-‚Äù Sigils glowed across her body in areas without rhyme or reason, the shape almost reminding him of something out of doom or some other demonic cult.

A faint smile settled on her features, as all the runes began to burn brightly. He tried to use his magic on anything, himself, the floor, and the air around them, but pushing out the mana was like moving a mountain.

The door flung open to reveal Fel, who stormed in and paused at the scene, her face the definition of *what the fuck*, an expression he was sure to be mirroring. He was also feeling a moment of relief at having some backup to get out of this situation.

It was short lived.

Sciesch scowled and let out a growl that could only **ever** be described as demonic, while swinging a hand in the dragon's direction. Fel was then smacked by something unseen and sent flying out the room, the door slamming after her and locking on its own.

‚Äò*Fuck fuck fuck fuck‚Ä¶*‚Äô Was the consistent thought from witnessing something out of an exorcist movie, and considering what he knew about demons in mythology across all cultures, he was now ***thoroughly*** freaking out, both for himself and Sciesch‚Ä¶ But more for himself.

Then he felt a calm over take him, as if the panic he felt simply slipped through his fingers. Sciesch caressed his cheek, her expression soft and loving, and a stream of emotions filled his very being. He felt love, adoration, jealousy, lust, hesitation, fear, and a deep need directed at him. Was this what she was feeling, or what she wanted him to feel?

She leaned down to kiss him, it was tender, loving, and she had a pleading look in her eyes when she pulled back.

All of his reservations about the whole situation grew distant as he lost himself in those yellow eyes, and for some reason, he just wanted to accept her in that one moment. Both of them were so lost within each other, that neither was aware of Fel failing to smash her way into the room, nor the chain of fire that was forming between the two of them.

A ring of fire encircled her neck, connected via a chain that crept down to his heart. When it reached his chest, it burned away the clothing, and similar sigils to Sciesch‚Äôs formed in a ring around the entry point. Then a clang of metal rang out as the fire, the chain, the sigils, and his numbness vanished with the return of both their senses.

They both stared at each other, speechless and utterly confused. Then Fel outright ripped the door off its hinges, a panicked look on her face as she rushed in, followed by Cauladra, Uri, and the rest of Sciesch‚Äôs family members.

Everyone was sort of just staring at one another with questioning looks when someone started slow clapping from across the room, near the window.

‚Äú*Oh*, and here *I* was hoping to be the first to bond with you.‚Äù Said a tiefling who was entering through the window, gliding to the floor with grace, yet Leo felt no mana being used.

‚ÄúForgive the interruption.‚Äù She curtsied. ‚ÄúMy name is Lilith, daughter of hell and mother of the succubi, all other titles long relinquished.‚Äù

While most of the people in the room were eyeing the newcomer with confusion and weariness, Leo stared at her slack jawed for a moment. Then slumped his head back with an audible thud and a pained groan.

‚Äò*Never mind, I would have much rather had that conversation with Caul‚Ä¶*‚Äô

For most of the time I was working with one other person, who was my supervisor and we had 3-4 larger projects we would work on.

Last month my supervisor quit, leaving me to work on these projects alone. For now I've been able to handle all the most critical issues, but there is a growing pile of less vital work that I don't have the time to do. I am also the sole representative of our company in the weekly meetings with these customers.

We hired a new person who will be taking over the ""team management"" role of my previous supervisor, but I am still going to be responsible for the meetings and 90% of the actual development work. 

Should I ask for a raise in this situation?"

I'm interested in traditional quant roles perhaps try and break into investment banking but am aware that those jobs require more experience. I have a background in computer science, a year of experience in that field along with 3/4 months of unpaid finance internship where I was basically filing documents for them, so not really relevant work exp.

I've asked around on linkedn and other places and they say that the interns are offered ""competitive"" salaries during their internship, but what is a competitive salary for a place like London? The salary ranges given on glassdoor or indeed are so large that they almost seem implausible. How can interns be offered anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 pounds?

However, during the interview ,the supervisor suddenly recommended me for another position, a infrastructure role . He said that he thinks it more suitable for me but I try telling him I prefer the cyber role but he didnt really listened. He then sent me an offer for the same infrastructure role. I have been trying to communicate with him about my preference but he isnt backing down.

 The thing is that I actually do have some knowledge for the both roles as I have taken modules related to them b4 so it is not exactly the end of world but I really want the cyber role instead of infra one as cyber security is  what I want to do in the future. What can I do now?"
wgx53x,8,2022-08-05,How exactly do you select ECs if you intend to transfer to a different major?,mandalorian-22,TransferToTop25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/wgx53x/how_exactly_do_you_select_ecs_if_you_intend_to/,"Ill be a freshman this fall at a large state school majoring in CS, honestly simply because I've normally been a stem kid and I want to make a lot of money.

I want to give my uni a chance but i dont know that CS is really what I want to do unless I go to an average school because I know its still quite possible to get a high paying job in tech regardless of institution.

I intend to transfer, and will be applying to many t20s, but I will not try to transfer as a CS major, as I am essentially a complete beginner and will simply not be competitive enough. Because of this I am not sure how to sort of choose what ECs i should pursue during the fall semester. If I intend to transfer into polisci or econ should i pursue internships and research related to such subjects, or should I still try to get CS projects and research?

If I try to do the former, I run the risk of setting myself back on the CS side of things in the event I am not successfully able to transfer. If I attempt the latter, this would probably reduce my chance of being a successful transfer since id be applying for majors that I would have no relevant background for.

How should I go about planning for the fall, and what is the general idea surrounding ECs when you want to transfer to a different major?"
wgxhn5,1,2022-08-05,"How to deal with a colleague you don't like, especially as a newcomer?",BigNovelDepartment,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/wgxhn5/how_to_deal_with_a_colleague_you_dont_like/,"I'm starting a new job soon and I'm super excited about it as it's in an area I like and I've gotten a promotion as well. The manager sounds like a great person and I'm actually really looking forward to starting in the upcoming weeks.

The issue is I recently found out that there's another new team member joining the team and it's someone I'm kinda acquaintances with and frankly I don't like them. The reason why I have reservations about this person is because of what they did in the past involving myself and a friend. My impression of this person is someone who's a leech, bootlicks and passes of other's ideas/work as their own.

Let's call this person Lobster for the sake of things.

Situation 1: When we were at uni, Lobster and I both had a mutual friend. My mutual friend coincidentally studied the same degree as Lobster but was in the year above. At first when we all met up we were all courteous of each other but the second Lobster found out our mutual friend studied the same degree and was a year ahead of them, they sucked up big time and started asking a million questions about the coursework and saying they didn't know how to do stuff. My mutual friend is a bit simpleminded and overall good natured so they gave Lobster loads of tips and tricks and notes. I am in firm belief that my friend got used and as a result Lobster passed the degree with honors.

Situation 2: When we first entered the workforce - I was privileged enough to join my company through an internship. The internship is known to be competitive and you'll need to pass through several interviews and assessments to get in. I never had much interaction with Lobster after I graduated: they never reached out and asked me to hang out, never kept in touch with me whatsoever - it was evident that our relationship was purely based on being at the same locale at the same time. We hadn't spoken for over three years and Lobster reached out to me me when they knew I had gotten the internship. Apparently they went for the internship in the same year as me but didn't get in so they're trying again this year.

And this is where I started to feel used. Lobster started off by praising me and complimenting me saying they were in awe of me and how smart I was to get the internship then they started saying how this was their dream job and they got unlucky the first time. They then started saying it would be a dream to get in and since we were friends if I could help them out and would be eternally grateful and is also keen to know how I'm doing and we should catch up. I was like fine - I'm happy to help. They started off asking me about what questions they asked in the final interview and what the assessment tasks were before slowly delving into more specific questions such as: last year they asked about xxx - what was the answer you gave, in the situation they ask you about yyy what would your answer be, if the assessment task is about zzz whats the correct procedure to do it, how should I structure my response and what key points do I need to include.

At this point I knew they didn't want my guidance - they wanted me to do it for them so they can copy and paste my answers this time round. They wanted to leech off my work and research and use it as a free pass and I knew this because 1. the company gives extremely detailed feedback regarding your application including how to answer the questions after you've been rejected (I know because I was rejected at first, I got talent pooled back in) and 2. the answers are on the internet - if you did a bit of digging the assessments and interviews are on the company website. Them asking me questions like this flagged to me they didn't do their homework as they said they were at a complete zero. I also asked them about the feedback the company gave them since they failed last time and they lied to my face saying the feedback was unhelpful. I also asked if they reached out to mutual's partner for help because mutual's partner is a hiring manager and they were extremely useful in giving tips on how to interview well. Lobster again lied to my face and said they don't know mutual's partner and I know this because mutual posted a photo of them on a double date. I ghosted them afterwards and they started to relentlessly dming me on every dm app possible to get answers out of me. I continued ghosting them.

To Lobster's merit they go the internship - whether it's through siphoning info out of another person or their own work, they got the internship. Good for them, they're in charge of their own career and frankly it doesn't affect me - just stay away from me because I now know what type of person you are.

I'm a bit upset that Lobster and I will be joining the same team. I think I'll be in a higher position than them but it's unclear at the moment how closely we'll be working with each other and reporting lines.

My question is: I don't like Lobster and I'm not happy I'll be working with them. How should I mange this relationship and how should I deal with them when interactions come up? Should i be wary? Am I overreacting and am I in the wrong for thinking about them like this?

Apologies for the novel - TLDR: I'm joining a new team and someone I know who is a bootlicker and takes other people's work as their own will also be joining. How should I manage our relationship moving forward?"

While I haven't had an internship at any FAANG-level companies yet, I've completed a couple of their early career mentorship programs (that require applications/interviews). Is it actually valuable to include this on my resume, or am I just wasting space? Should I replace it with more project descriptions that demonstrate my skills instead? 

 [https://imgur.com/a/hbjfG2l](https://imgur.com/a/hbjfG2l)  &lt;= link for reference"
wh0gmc,2,2022-08-05,"Feel like I was offered a low-ball raise, and now we have to go back into the office",Small_Book_of_Plans,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/wh0gmc/feel_like_i_was_offered_a_lowball_raise_and_now/,"Just got offered a promotion and raise at my job, which is great and what I've been hoping for but I feel like it's way lower than it should be and I'm not sure how to negotiate higher. 

Little overview of my position: 

I'm WFH at a small PR agency, and originally my position was to do PR outreach and content creation. It's an entry level role and I've been at it for 1.5yrs but I've picked up a lot of responsibility since then. Since last October a coworker that focused mainly on social media marketing was fired and I've taken on a lot of their tasks ever since.

 In January, I was put in charge of creating an intern program, and then onboarding and managing two interns for 3 months. I also on onboarded and managed a contract employee that was basically doing the same work as the interns (albeit very poorly, leaving me to do a lot of work to correct it). Meanwhile since we were short a person, I was spread thin to work on 6 different clients on a variety of tasks while everyone else on the team (all senior roles) had 3 or 4 clients.  

In June, another coworker that focused on marketing design quit and I've also since taken on her some of the more basic design tasks, like infographics, reports and small website updates. 

All together, it's a lot. I feel like the only way to get work done is by doing overtime (which we don't get paid extra for) 


So here's some of the cons I see about the promotion: 
+ it's only a 10% increase. Which to me, only really factors in inflation and not all the extra roles I've taken on, let alone the expectation that will now be on me to take on even more in this senior role.
+They want us to come into the office once a week now. Apparently the cost of commuting was factored into my 10% 
+Commuting to the office will take me 2hrs each way to get there (not thrilled about this, even if it is once a week) 
+The way the train runs, I'll either have to arrive 1hr early to work or ~30mins late 
+The city I'm in is currently having a lot of issues with public transit, one line is being shut down for an entire month for maintenance, and there's rumors that the line I'm on will be next, which will obviously affect my commute to the office.

I am a 22F working in HR for a pretty large company. I began as an intern last summer, and was invited to stay with the company part time as I completed my senior year, then was given a full time offer after graduating this May. My job profile is the same, but I was promoted from Engagement Intern to Associate PM - Engagement.

Even though I was an intern, I would not say my work was like the typical experience. I lead important projects, creating significant changes to aspects of the company (ie, lead a team to redesign the onboarding process, handle the transition back into office, etc.). Majority of my work was in partnership with senior directors and VPs, and I made myself known. My experience was amazing, and I felt like I was respected and treated just like any other employee at my company.

This changed when they created a second opening for my job profile. My coworker joined the team and has completely taken over - to the point where my boss rarely meets with me and encourages me to go to my coworker for feedback and new tasks. We are supposed to be sharing the workload, with both of us leading upcoming projects and keeping each other in the loop. However, my boss just hands my coworker everything and asks him to include me.

His way of including me is asking me to attend meetings he puts together and take notes, or create a presentation of my ideas that he shouts me out for putting together but presents himself, making it so that he gets the credit and praise.

I have asked my direct boss if I can be given more projects to handle as I now have so little on my plate. She has nothing for me but she still is giving my coworker details of upcoming cases to manage instead. I am genuinely sick of feeling like his assistant, just sending emails, taking notes, and giving him content to pitch, but never am able to pitch or lead myself. I feel like I have reverted back to an intern since he was hired, except even as an intern I had more responsibility than this.

I don't know how to push for more. My boss is so absent with me at this point, and wants me to treat my coworker as my superior instead, who excludes me from even having the information needed on projects to do more than send emails and take notes. 

It is making resent my job. I know I can do so much more - I was meant to do so much more."
wh1mmd,44,2022-08-05,Well... I finally did it. My success story and moving on to OMSCS,cineonizer,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/wh1mmd/well_i_finally_did_it_my_success_story_and_moving/,"Hi everyone, I did it! I'm a professional software engineer now.

This post is meant for future prospects contemplating about their career change. I hope my background and timeline can give you all a bit of a reference point.

TLDR: started career change 2020 while working as an engineer, spent $10,000 out of pocket and took 5 classes at OSU, landed an internship, dropped out from OSU, converted internship to full time, enrolled into OMSCS, and starting OMSCS this month.

Background: BS in mechanical engineering and had been working as a mechanical engineer after graduation. I took 5 classes (CS 161, 162, 225, 261, 325) before dropping out. Total cost: \~$10,000 actually a little less since I took advantage of the emergency grant they offered every quarter. I don't know if OSU still offers that anymore.

My timeline is:

* Beginning of the 2020 lockdowns (March 2020): I got a taste of WFH, but I knew my company/industry wouldn't allow it going forward
* Middle of the 2020 lockdowns (June/July), I entered my existential crisis and looked into many careers to pivot into (law school for IP, grad school for engineering, and finally landed on CS)
* From August 2020: Took Harvard's CS50 to get a taste of programming again (took a programming class for my undergrad but forgot everything)
* Around September 2020: Almost finished CS50 (didn't do the final project), and solidified that CS was in fact for me. I looked into many online resources and even learned basic data structures before just trying and eventually continuing with The Odin Project's (TOP) web dev course
* From Oct 2020 to Jan 2022, I did TOP little by little every day after coming home from my full time engineering job.
* Around March 2021: after failed attempts to break into my first job as a SWE/programmer, I decided to enroll in OSU.
* March 2021 to June 2021: took CS 161 (intro to programming 1) and did TOP
* June 2021 to August 2021: took CS 162 (intro to programming 2) and CS 225 (discrete math) and did TOP
* September 2021 to December 2021: took CS 261 (data structures)
* December 2021: thought I would be comfortable after having taken data structures so I decided to apply to junior and internship roles before I ended the class
* January 2022: took CS 325 (algorithms) and also applying and interviewing, but bombed many interviews and some people just did not like the fact that I did not have actual experience other than my TOP projects. I applied to an internship (that would become my first big break) that made applicants do a HireVue interview. I passed it with flying colors by finessing the questions beforehand ;)
* February 2022: I landed an actual interview for that internship after that, but I also got relocated to another project for my work. So I had to do my first video screening interview in my car lol. The engineering manager didn't mind and still liked me and moved me on. 
* February 2022 continued: Like I mentioned earlier, I got relocated and the longer commute just wasn't cutting it for me. It was long hours and the fact that I've been wanting a career change for almost 2 years now just really burnt me out since April 2021, so I put in my two weeks notice without anything lined up. I was really hoping that I can land the internship.
* February 2022 continued: I had a panel interview with 5 people on the team that I would be working with. The interviewers were actually interested in our conversation and wanted to talk to me. This boosted my confidence because other interviews were not like that. I was able to talk like they were my pals, make jokes, just show really great enthusiasm when I talked about my journey. It came off as really commendable. That's why I got the job (later I asked my manager what made them hire me). I had one easy technical question and it was about matching left parentheses/brackets (use a stack).
   * Also applied to OMSCS
* February to June 2022: had no job and was just building my mental health back up again. I worked on leetcoding just to prepare. I started the EPI book with Python and worked on problems every day until I started my remote internship in June.
* June to August 2022: Expressed that I wanted a full time opportunity if possible in the beginning of the internship. Manager said that he can't guarantee anything and that it's not really up to him. I just worked my ass off. Asked questions and showed great enthusiasm the entire time. Well now I am about to finish my internship this week. I was just verbally offered a full time position. 

That's it guys. Thanks for reading if you did. I'm not the type to post stuff like this, but man... I've been dreaming about this every day for 2 years and practicing behavioral interview questions in the car/shower/etc. It's been a long road, and I still got a long way to go. I just wanted to take a rest stop here and just journal my journey and share with anyone willing to listen."

For Context: I got a full tuition scholarship in 2018 for the college I attend currently which is 3.5 away from my parents in a neighboring state as a pre nursing major. I genuinely had no clue what I wanted to go to school for, but my parents said I had to go do something. 

My first year went well and I was acclimated to living on my own with some financial support from my parents. My 2nd year I became super depressed and I felt overwhelmed and I acted out more than usual (smoking, partying, drinking) but when I brought it up to my stepmom and my dad. They simply chalked it up to me being lazy and not wanting to push myself to get into a nursing school. About halfway into my second year I had a huge mental breakdown about everything going on and it felt like all of my trauma of childhood and everything that was mental wrong started to bubble to the surface which caused me to almost fail my sophomore year and my parents then decided to step in and offer counseling. 

After going to counseling, I felt better about being at school, but then the pandemic hit and I forced to be at home with my parents with made my mental health sharply decline again. My stepmom was constantly hovering over me, controlling my finances, and never gave me a chance to be a junior adult and it became unbearable. I‚Äôm therapy I learned that my stepmom liked having control over everything because it was a since of security for her. But I couldn‚Äôt stand it. I was a MAJOR people pleaser and as long as I did what my stepmom wanted and she got her way it was always smooth sailings. 

Around the time of my 3rd year I wasn‚Äôt happy with nursing and I hated the classes I had to take. So I decided to switch to psychology because I enjoyed it and my stepmom was against it because she didn‚Äôt feel like I had it in me to go to school a little longer. So naturally she always had something backhanded or something nice-nasty to say about my choices. By the start of my 4th year I was able to leave my parents house and stay in an on campus apartment and I had my own source of income and was very self sufficient as well as getting a internship that I fell in love with. I learned that I had to apply for grad school, but I didn‚Äôt want to apply just yet because I wanted to a break from school. I felt completely overwhelmed and started to feel burnt out. I lacked motivation, I often kept to myself and shut down my social life. I literally only did school work and went to work and I was always sleepy and depressed. I communicated that feeling to my parents and again my stepmom disregarded it and called me lazy and some other harsh comments. 

By the end of my fourth year I accumulated a balance which prevented me from taking the last semester I needed to graduate which put me at home for the summer (current) and next semester until I get it paid off. Over this time of being at home I have caught nothing but BS about how ‚ÄúI should be like my friends and finish school‚Äù and ‚ÄúI have my priorities mixed up‚Äù.  So I decided to see a new therapist and she helped me stand up to my parents to let them know I am burnt out from school.. I‚Äôm not even sure if I want to go to grad school. I‚Äôm learning to make me happy and live with my own thoughts instead of my people pleaser thoughts. My dad was super supportive and my stepmom was livid. She keeps throwing these back handed comments at me and not to mention she makes homophobic comments knowing that I am queer. I decided it was in my best interest to save money to move out while also saving to pay off my school balance. Once I let my stepmom know that.

I absolutely love working there, great team, stack, WLB is decent, and the internship pay was outstanding. I am slightly concerned about the return offer compensation though. I am not 100% sure they will give me time to decide if I wanna take the offer / gather other offers for leverage. The company is recruiting aggressively and I have a feeling they won't give me more than a month to decide (not enough time to get other offers). So I'll most likely have to negotiate without any other offers on hand.

My plan is as follows: gather up a bunch of posted offer compensation details from their COMPETITORS on [Levels.fyi](https://Levels.fyi). Create an excel, tally up the final compensation numbers and average them to get a final number I'll present to them during negotiation as market analysis. Only downside is I have no clue how fair this number is when stacked up against what they usually pay. It's a fairly small company that is recruiting aggressively just now, so there is barely any compensation data out there for them.

Is this a solid plan or could I do something better?"

Started engineering job last year (Nov). I have been there for 9 months now. I have been working ""on the line"" with operators ever since doing operator work with a pay equal or lower to that of some operstors. I hate it. I then started working ""on my own time"" on engineering projects to improve stuff on the libe. I improved many things. Now they keep throwing me more projects, yet expect me to do ""operator"" work still for 10 hours for 5 days a week. Despite all this, I still get paid the same. This is ""frustrating"".

So I applied and got accepted to Masters program (computational science), and was offered a TA position. It's in a field I always wanted to do and know a professor there really well (she was the one who gave me the LOR). 

I told my manager in my current job about the dissatisfaction I had. He seems to have understood my frustration and want to change this and start giving me more time to do engineering. I told him about my plan regarding masters degree and he said the company can offer me some tuition reimbursement. Of course, the masters I applied to is in another state so I would have to quit since it's in person. However, I am still a little salty about all the time I spend here, feeling unappreciated even though now it seems like they are starting to ""listen"". 

What is your opinion on this? Should I quit and go to graduate school?

I always wanted this and my end goal is to become operations research analyst. Should I quit my job and go for it?

The disadvantages are that 1. College is an expense, not an income. I only have 6k on my savings, plus 2-3k on my checking. Fortunately, the Univ I will be attending has low tuition so 4.5k a semester. 

However, my lease for my apartment hasn't ended yet (until November). To break it according to contract is 2 months of rent. That's $1390 (yes, I pay 695 pretty cheap). However, it requires 30 day notice and that means that it would extend until ""next month"" so basically 3 months of rent so $ 2,085.

In addition to all of the moving expenses. I am planning on selling some of my stuff like couch/sofa/table etc. To recuperate some money... But I doubt it's enough to cover all of that. 

Fortunately, the city where Univ is where part of my family lives so I can stay with them, however, it does feel sad losing all this money. 

Also, the program sort of guarantees an internship, and I have good relationship with 2 professors there. 

In my current job, there are some good coworkers. If I was a millionaire I would go to school, and in the perfect world, I would work remotely on some things for my current job as I really want to improve some things there and do find some value in it. However, this isn't the perfect world and I have to decide... Literally now... (Look at the date!!! I should be turning my 2 weeks notice today or this weekend if I go to graduate school). 

My eyes were set on quitting, but after talking to my manager and the things they proposed, now I got to reconsider some things. What to you all think ? I can always apply to an online masters in something else... But I am not sure. 

What do you all think? I already have written my letter of resignation, and am ready, but now I have doubts... 

This is the last reddit post I will post before taking any descion, I just want some sort of confirmation as I always suffered from ""analysis paralysis"". Just need some confirmation from my heart."

I am about to get my AS, as I am knocking out the first two years at a community college, with plans on transferring to university to continue for a BS is Mechanical Engineering. I qualify for direct admission into the college of engineering (just need to take two more classes that transfer as one: Differential Equations and Linear Algebra). I've been working the whole time through college, and started a full time job in manufacturing back in March, as I figured I might as well start early on getting the experience, as many jobs at my dream company require it.

So far, I made it through spring and summer with great grades, and am looking forward to Calculus II and Uni. Physics this fall. I really enjoy my job, I've made more money in just four month than a year at my previous part time job. I even ordered my first car (a Model 3!) and will hopefully be taking delivery this month or in September. I work about 10 minutes away from where I live, so commuting is going to be super cheap.

The predicament:

A few days ago I came home to an email after work from a recruiter from said dream company for a position up in Austin, which is where I want to work assuming I get my BS and relevant experience. I live in San Antonio, an hour and a half away. After a phone interview, I found out that the position is pretty much exactly what I do right now, but they pay is much better and in a completely different industry. This is automotive, I work in nanotech. Quite a jump in scale... The shift schedule is exactly the same as what I work now, (4 on, 3 off and 3 on, 4 off) 12 hour shifts, first half or last half of the week (this was relieving to hear), and I currently work night shifts. I definitely got emotional, as this is the company of my dreams, and I figure that once I get my foot in the door, more opportunities can present themselves, especially as I pursue a degree. Can you believe I am only 20?

I've done fine with work and school to this point, but I haven't started the higher-level engineering classes yet. I have accepted the fact that this degree will not be completed in four years, as most engineering degrees take longer. I do not wish to kill myself halfway through taking 18 credits a semester, so I've planned to go a little slower. One of my classes in the fall will conflict with one of my work days, so my employer made a very generous exception for me, swapping one of my work days for one of my off days, as the class falls in the evening when I work. I have proven myself as a great employee with who I currently work for, so this opportunity was quite special. With a AS in sights, I have the opportunity to move into a maintenance position, as they are desperate for more people, and an AS is really all they look for. 

The recruiter had my old resume, before I started my new job, as I attempted to apply for customer service based positions locally last year, so he was excited to hear about my new experience. This company will be offering a new program for students who are pursuing a degree while working, but it is ""still in the works,"" and does offer internships/ mentorships for graduates. This company also offers a free shuttle service for San Antonio based employees halfway in between the two cities, as apparently there are a lot of them who live down here. Great!

My mother thinks the commute time is too long, but likes to hear that the shift schedule is similar to what I work already. My best friend thinks that I'll never have time to finish school, or I'll get stuck in that position and never move up. My father and shift lead are super supportive, as they know how much this company means to me and think I am capable of the challenge. My older brother thinks I'll just become a worker drone.

I told the recruiter that I want to wait until I finish my fall semester before making any big decisions, but I really want to take up the offer. He was understanding and supported my decision (or lack thereof). This factory is still under construction, so the position will still be hiring by the end of the year.

I have five months to make a decision that could change my life for better or for worse. Of course I could wait longer, but big things are happening there in the next few months, and it would be amazing to be a part of it. I could work there now and work towards the mission I so whole heartedly support, or wait 5-6 years, assuming I get this degree for even more competitive positions I may or may not get.

Would love to hear some advice for and against, as I am stuck in between. 

Thanks!"

wh6mdf,88,2022-08-05,The Winter World Ch14 (Hellworld explorers),Objective_Campaign82,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wh6mdf/the_winter_world_ch14_hellworld_explorers/,"[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/u4r9gc/the_winter_world_ch1_hellworld_explorers/)

The mutineers roughly dragged Daniels away from the airlock and his last glimpse of Dr. Eliza Finch. She was desperately pounding on the hatch, tears streaking down her face. They threw him onto the floor of the command deck, they kept their guns trained on him but allowed Daniels to sit up to look around the room. Two mutineers were working away at the comms console while Mark looked over their shoulders, a massive bruise was forming on the cheek where the wrench had struck. Daniels was honestly surprised the kid was able to stand at all after that hit, he hadn‚Äôt wanted to kill anyone with his reckless attack, but he shouldn‚Äôt have been able to get up at all.

Mark turned towards Daniels, and he saw that even that little motion had made him violently dizzy, and needed a moment to let it pass. ‚ÄúI wan‚Äôned you toh  shee your failure‚Äù he slurred.

Daniels looked into his eyes and saw madness, not the madness of a truly insane person, but the madness of a man who had thoroughly deceived himself. A man who fervently clang to his own deceptions with piety, soothing his conscious with the delusion that he was in the right even as he hurt everyone else around. ‚ÄúI feel sorry for you kid‚Äù Daniels said as he stared into the young mans eyes. ‚ÄúYou seem like the kind of lad I would have liked to take under my wing, maybe help you work past whatever it is that has driven you so far. I did the same with Nelson, you know the man you mutilated.‚Äù Daniels said pointedly.

He saw some around Mark flinch at the accusation, but Mark‚Äôs eyes only lit up with anger. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk like you know me, pirate.‚Äù He spat, then turned to the men at the comms array console ‚ÄúSend the message.‚Äù He ordered.

The two interns who had stopped to watch the drama play out turned back to their work, their hands flew across their screens and then stopped suddenly ‚ÄúMark, someone‚Äôs jamming us, we just got hit with every possible jamming frequency all at once.‚Äù One said in shock.

Daniels let out a sigh as *Beelzebub* had arrived just in time.

Mark saw Daniels relief and began to panic ‚ÄúLook at the sensors, is their another ship out there?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe cant see anything, we‚Äôre getting hit with so much noise its hard to make out anything.‚Äù The man at the comms looked scared.

Daniels looked around and saw that the mutineers were beginning to falter. These weren‚Äôt trained sailors, they weren‚Äôt even hardened criminals despite all the bad things they had done, they were all just a bunch of scared shitless kids who got wrapped up in Mark‚Äôs insane paranoia. They thought they were the heroes in some treasure island like story, they hadn‚Äôt once stopped to wonder if what they were doing was wrong.

‚ÄúThis is your last chance‚Äù he said calmly to the room ‚ÄúThat ship is the *Beelzebub,* and its under orders to kill us as soon as its within weapons range. Surrender now or else, you and everyone else on this ship will die.‚Äù

Mark wheeled around on Daniels ‚ÄúYou think we‚Äôre stupid, why would you order this ship‚Äôs destruction if you were still on board?‚Äù

Daniels looked up at the madman and grinned like the devil ‚ÄúBecause a captain goes down with his ship.‚Äù

Blood drained from everyone‚Äôs face as they realized that Daniels wasn‚Äôt bluffing. In a blind rage Mark kicked out with his foot and smacked it Daniels side, he grunted from the pain but refused to let himself crumple in on the pain. The others backed away from both of them and looked like they were about to falter, one of the guys by the comms array cursed ‚ÄúFuck this, I don‚Äôt want to die for this shit.‚Äù He said as he began to type out a surrender.

Mark turned and fired blindly, the bullet hit the guy in his leg and he crumpled down in a heap, letting out a loud cry of pain.

Everyone stared at Mark in shock and horror, the mutineers who had been focused on Daniels pointed their guns at Mark, Mark in turn pointed his gun at them. Their standoff only lasted few painfully long seconds

The *Staff of Lore* shook violently, and Daniels cursed under his breath. His last chance to save his remaining crew had gone, now all that was left was to face his end with dignity.

‚Äú*Eternal rest, grant onto them, oh lord‚Äù* He said as another violent rattle shook through the ship and the sound of ripping metal and the acrid tang of burning metal filled the air.

\~\~\~\*\~\~\~

Eliza had pounded on the air lock until the ship was no longer in sight, Nelson had maneuvered them out of the Lagrange point and pushed the lander into an orbit that quickly took them far from the *Staff of Lore*.

‚ÄúWe have to go back immediately!‚Äù she shouted.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt, if we go back then all the captain‚Äôs sacrifices would have been for nothing.‚Äù Nelson countered.

‚ÄúBut he‚Äôll die if we don‚Äôt!‚Äù she pleaded.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think I know that!‚Äù he snapped back ‚Äúbut those were his orders, he made his choice, and we need to respect that.‚Äù

His words hit her like a shot to the chest, her breathing felt constricted as her legs went limp. Bra‚Äôtal rushed forward to help support her, but despite being a fellow deathworlder he wasn‚Äôt strong enough to support her weight. She slumped to the ground and silent tears flowed down her face. Some animal instinct within Bra‚Äôtal and Kun‚Äôee had them wrap themselves around her in an effort to comfort her. Their soft short fur and warm mammalian bodies made her think of the otters she and her sister had as kids, one of the few mammals that hadn‚Äôt been uplifted by reckless genetic tampering. They sympathized with her pain, and Eliza was forced to confront those feelings she had left unattended for to long.

She didn‚Äôt exactly know how she felt about Daniels, there was a basic animal attraction there, a very strong attraction if she were being honest. She enjoyed talking with him as well, even when they were butting heads. Despite his seemingly simplistic manner of speech, he was frighteningly intelligent, and always seemed to think about things in a different way than she did. He cared for everyone around him with a deep quiet intensity, and simply wanted to be there for people. At the same time though he was a space pirate, who had fought and killed other people, and he had lied about it this whole time. Even when she had directly confronted him about it he had deflected her doubts with more lies.

And now he was going to die.

There was a sudden jolt within the lander, Eliza sat up and looked out the window to see a pill bug shaped ship had latched onto the lander and was moving them towards the open hold of a massive light gray spaceship that had just appeared out of nowhere. Black lettering on the ship‚Äôs side proudly demarked it as the *BC-3 Beelzebub.* Dread sluiced through her veins as she realized they were being taken into the hold of a pirate ship, and that the coming of this ship signaled Daniels death. The Kunan‚Äôai unraveled themselves and let Eliza stand up and straighten out her clothes. The pill bug shaped ship gently dropped them onto the holds floor before reversing out of the cargo space, flying off to god knows where. The bay doors slid closed, and a greeting party assembled outside of the lander, they wore robes in line with the Edo era fashion Daniels and his crew had taken to. But theirs were in a different set of colors, reminiscent of a British naval officer‚Äôs uniform.

Two men holding crow bars stepped forward and wrenched the hatch off the lander with practiced efficiency. Eliza stepped out of the lander with her hands above her heads, she stepped out slowly so as not to spook the pirates. ‚ÄúPlease, we are unarmed and are hosting a diplomatic party from the planet below, we‚Äôre not the mutineers.‚Äù she said cautiously.

A big bury man stepped out of the ranks of assembled pirates. he was a massive beastly man, bursting with barely restrained cords of rock-hard muscle, his face almost completely covered in a thick black beard. His knuckles were crisscrossed with many little white scars, and there was tribal looking tattoo on the left side of his face. His very presence intimidated Eliza to her core, he was everything she would imagine a modern Blackbeard to be. ‚ÄúIdentify yourself‚Äù he ordered in a distinctive Russian accent.

‚ÄúI am Doctor Eliza Finch, I am also the lieutenant of the *Staff of Lore‚Äù* she announced.

The pirates all exchanged furtive glances with each other, the burly Russian looked surprised for a second before he regained his composure. ‚ÄúI am Lieutenant Michael Petrov, you may put your hands down, you are among friends.‚Äù

Eliza wasn‚Äôt sure how to feel about what he said, she wasn‚Äôt sure she would count any of these pirates as her friends, but they all relaxed around her, so she let her hands down. Behind her Bra‚Äôtal and Kun‚Äôee stepped out of the lander. Bra‚Äôtal padded forward carefully before standing at his full height ‚ÄúI am Minister Bra‚Äôtal, a representative of my people, I hope we will receive a fair treatment as guests‚Äù he said very formally. It seemed Bra‚Äôtal was also apprehensive about being around pirates.

Lieutenant Petrov chuckled ‚ÄúOf course, you will have the finest quarters aboard, and my apologies, but you are very cute‚Äù

Bra‚Äôtals ears fell into what she recognized as confusion ‚ÄúWhat,‚Äù

‚ÄúYour faces is like wolfs, but your body is like weasel, very cute. I would eventually like to scritch ears‚Äù The Lieutenant said plainly.

Bra‚Äôtal looked stunned and Kun‚Äôee chittered mirthfully, Eliza was also left a little out of sorts by what he said. She decided to set it aside and press on ‚ÄúLieutenant Petrov, I would like a word with your captain, I need to countermand the order Captain Daniels sent out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am confused, was he not in his right mind when he gave that order?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, but-‚Äú

‚ÄúThen his order still stands.‚Äù He said curtly.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she begged ‚ÄúThere are still good people aboard the *Staff of Lore*, Daniels is still there.‚Äù

His dark green eyes found hers and stared at her intensely before he shook his head, ‚ÄúMy apologies, but the captain is not here, she is personally dealing with the matter as we speak. His fate is in her hands.‚Äù

\~\~\~\*\~\~\~

Daniels had trained all his life for precise and practiced violence, he had the nature of close quarters combat brutally drilled into him as soon as he grew his first little wisp of chest hair. The boarders who burst through a quickly cut hole in *Lory‚Äôs* hull were well trained, they covered each other flawlessly, cleared rooms like clockwork, and quickly serviced anyone they saw\*.\* Armored boarders burst through the door and quickly dropped the mutineers with precise shots to their torso, they swarmed into the room and those who were unarmed and caught off guard were quickly slammed onto the floors and cuffed with minimal resistance. The one who cuffed the injured mutineer by the comms noticed the bullet wound in thigh and pulled out a first aid kit and began to triage his wound.

Mark who had been caught holding a gun was ordered to drop the weapon, and without any time to think the leader of the mutineers dropped his gun and was quickly slammed to the floor like everyone else.

Daniels remained seated as the marines from the *Beelzebub* took control of his ship from the mutineers and began to round up the stragglers. One of the marines turned to Daniels and smiled ‚ÄúI take it you‚Äôre the captain of this ship‚Äù he sound calmly, a hint of mischief in his voice.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me,‚Äù Daniels said as he looked about the room in mild horror. He had never been on the other end of a boarding operation, it was a jarring experience. ‚ÄúI thought I had ordered this ship‚Äôs destruction?‚Äù

‚ÄúAye, ya did mate, but our captain judged that to be an erroneous decision and overruled you. Lucky you.‚Äù He extended a hand ‚Äúnames Lewis, and the captain would like a word with you.‚Äù

Daniels took his hand and stood up ‚ÄúAlright, where is she?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight here.‚Äù Came the crisp English accent of Captain Bell. ‚ÄúThank you Mister Bailey, but I can take it from here.‚Äù She said in dismissal.

‚ÄúAye, been good to get one last job in before my transfer, see you around Daniels‚Äù he said before leaving the bridge.

Daniels turned a questioning eye towards Bell and she sighed ‚Äúhe hit it off with some of your old ship mates and is leaving us for the *Astaroth*.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see, but that‚Äôs not what I meant, my orders were pretty cut and dry. Destroy the ship on sight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, well it‚Äôs a good thing I outrank you or this ship might be an expanding cloud of slag.‚Äù She said merrily. ‚ÄúNow please explain to me how this all occurred.‚Äù

Daniels scratched the back of his neck ‚ÄúBunch of dumb kids got it into their heads that we were all space pirates who were going to kidnap and enslave the people down below.‚Äù

Bell‚Äôs face scrunched up in a frown, ‚ÄúAnd how did they come to this conclusion?‚Äù

‚ÄúBest as I can tell, they got a look at our marks and decided we were pirates. They also tossed my quarters and found some photos from the battle of Greyland.‚Äù He explained.

‚ÄúSo nothing actually substantial.‚Äù She said dispassionately.

‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù they heard from off to side where Mark was being held face down, ‚ÄúWe had enough to know exactly who you people are.‚Äù He spat.

Bell considered him with disdain before turning back to Daniels ‚ÄúI take it he was the ringleader.‚Äù Daniels nodded. ‚ÄúBring him here.‚Äù She ordered.

The marine lifted him off the ground and dragged him to stand before Captain Bell, he stood about a head taller than her, but her aura dominated the bigger man and made him look small and pathetic.

Bell looked him up and down before frowning ‚Äúyou are aware that mutiny and kidnapping diplomats are grave crimes, right?‚Äù

He struggled in the marines grip but found no give whatsoever, ‚ÄúWe were doing to save those people down there.‚Äù He said with a jerk of his head towards the planet.

‚ÄúSave them from what? We have already established that you had no real evidence.‚Äù

‚ÄúQuit fucking with me, you refused to involve the Union, your all marked with the symbols of demons, and your ships are far too heavily armed to just be freighters.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo strange tattoos and weapons for self defense are you need to know that we‚Äôre all criminals, you‚Äôll find that your logic wont hold up in a quart of law. As for your first claim, the *Beelzebub* and *Staff of Lore* are both certified as expeditionary ships of the Terran systems, just like the *Amaterasu.* We were charted by the Prime Minister himself to act as diplomats and negotiators on Terra‚Äôs behalf, and as upstanding members of the Union we reserve the right to initiate first contact if we deem it necessary. Like in this case where the inhabitants were living on a dying world, as established in the pivotal case of *Kec‚Äôitark vs. the Grand Union,* the case in which a C√®k‚Äôec merchant discovered an uncontacted world on the verge of extinction from an erupting super volcano.‚Äù

Mark seemed dumbstruck, and on the verge of realizing that he was in the wrong, Bell however didn‚Äôt care to maintain the moral high ground and charged onward. ‚ÄúWe also reserve the ability to deal with immediate threats to galactic safety like a hive of pirates, and put an end to a long reign of terror. In fact we also have the right to charge and transport individules caught in a direct act of piracy, as such you and your conspirators are now formally charged with mutiny, the kidnapping of diplomats, unlawful imprisonment of civilians, and interfering with diplomatic negotiations.‚Äù She said calmly. Her imperious British accent making everything she said sound even more damning.

‚ÄúAdd torture and assault to that list‚Äù Daniels growled angrily.

Bell turned towards him with concern ‚Äúwas it just yourself or was anyone else involved?‚Äù

‚ÄúMathew Nelson, a human variant with the DNA of bighorn sheep, they forcefully cut off his horns.‚Äù Daniels said with barely restrained furry.

Bell turned her eyes back to Mark ‚Äúwell then, congratulations, I don‚Äôt think I have ever seen a more atrocious list of crimes in my life. Your lawyers will have to fight an up hill battle the whole way through just to avoid the death sentence. Get him out of my sight this instant‚Äù she said, disgust swirling in her eyes.

The marines took this as an opportunity to drag off all the mutineers and left Daniels alone on the bridge with captain Bell. He slumped into his command chair and rested his head in his hands, now that it was all finally over he couldn‚Äôt help but feel several days‚Äô worth of exhaustion weigh him down.

Bell rested a hand on his shoulder ‚ÄúTake as much time as you need, you‚Äôve though a rough couple of days.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a fucking understatement.‚Äù He muttered.

‚ÄúYou did exceedingly well give the circumstances, no could expect any better. And the fact that you were willing to sacrifice your life for the mission is commendable, though I must berate you for a lack of faith in my men‚Äôs ability. Once you sent out your message we knew exactly how to dismantle it within a few minutes and were ready to board.‚Äù She said consolingly.

Daniels laughed derisively ‚ÄúYeah, I got the notion of self-destructing the ship stuck in my head and didn‚Äôt really consider any alternatives.‚Äù

She looked concerned ‚Äúnot to push you, but I must ask, Eliza, is she-‚Äú

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine, I got her and the two Kunan‚Äôai diplomats to the lander. They‚Äôre off floating in space.‚Äù

Bell smiled ‚Äúwe saw it and had sent a dropship to retrieve, she‚Äôs in the hands of my fianc√© right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúFianc√©, when did that happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúLast month, Michael proposed on the shores of Elysium. The wedding will be this fall in Pandemonium, we thought the purple leaves would make for a romantic wedding.‚Äù

Daniels smiled ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, your sister would love to hear that.‚Äù He said without thinking.

‚ÄúHow is Eliza doing anyway?‚Äù Bell asked casually, though Daniels could see how nervous she was. She had left her sister without any forewarning and became a mighty space pirate, the most she could do to continue supporting her sister was arrange for her to join the *Staff of Lore* and place Daniels in charge to keep an eye on her.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine, they didn‚Äôt hurt her‚Äù he answered.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good, and how is she adjusting to ship life, I heard she was miffed to be passed over for the position of captain.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, she was. Made my life a living hell for three months, butted heads with me endlessly, but we worked that out. I even made her my second in command.‚Äù Daniels smiled as he remembered his parting kiss before his mood soured and he cursed again.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Bell asked.

‚ÄúI really wasn‚Äôt expecting to live out the day, I told her that you would explain all the pirate stuff, and I, I sort of kissed her before she got in the lander.‚Äù

Bell put a hand to her mouth to hide her massive grin as she giggled uncontrollably, ‚Äúwell then, this will prove to be an interesting reunion.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnother fucking understatement.‚Äù He growled in exasperation.

Im 28 now and I‚Äôm in a bit of a dilemma. I have a fairly strong resume, education, and experience in my field. I started in 2017, including internships, then was able to get international work experience, managed a team, project management experience, foreign language skills, etc. 

FWIW, I work in enhanced due diligence/private intelligence. 

My issue is a bit over a year ago I got really sick while working abroad and had to move to move home. I had only been at my newest job then for about 5 months before I had to leave. Since then I‚Äôve been able to work a little for the same company (they send me a project once every two weeks or so). So on my resume I have about this year listed as ‚Äúpart time.‚Äù It‚Äôs been enough work to keep me up to date on tools/techniques etc. but it‚Äôs not really ‚Äúpart time.‚Äù 

My question is how will this look to employers and what‚Äôs the best way to frame my situation? I‚Äôll probably only be able to start applying later this fall/winter with how my health is. Currently I‚Äôm not working at all."

It‚Äôs my first salaried job and I‚Äôve seen a lot of things saying to always negotiate your initial salary given by HR, just as a rule of thumb w jobs. With the cohort system and being entry-level, is it a waste to try to negotiate? like would they ever increase the initial offer because of this system?

Only little thing being that it pays 500 a week which isn‚Äôt horrible,
But I‚Äôm taking a pay cut and currently leaving my job at the post office making almost 1,000 a week for this internship.

the internship is 9-5 Monday-Friday and completely remote but in zoom classes 

So I was just looking for jobs that have flexible hours and decent pay that I could possibly do after 5PM  or on weekends where I could make a good amount of money without having to work a full shift

Otherwise I might just Uber eats or door dash or post mates whenever my work load isn‚Äôt to heavy, but any recommendations would be appreciated :)"

It seems like there‚Äôs so many different options.I also am not sure whether it will be beneficial for me to go back to school and try and get a bachelors degree or will I be able to get a certificate that can help me start applying for internship and move up that way?

I've recently landed an internship of sorts through my university studies. Essentially, In order to graduate I need to undertake 100 hours of work integrated learning. 

While I can't go into specifics of the project the language and framework that said project must be developed on is Elixir and Phoenix. This is all new to me and I have a period of time in order to up-skill myself.

During my studies I've focused on Front-End Web Development and UI/UX Design. Most if not all my programming knowledge comes from HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. There's a high likelihood I'll be working on the Front-End for the project as well.

I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations as to what resources are best for someone with skills such as myself in order to better up-skill for the project ahead. 

Thanks all. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

I'm looking for somebody to practice either one or all of the following: SQL, Statistics, Machine Learning, Product Sense, Behavioral, and Python.

It‚Äôd be awesome if you have already practiced a few Leetcode SQL or Python questions and understood the basic concepts of statistics and ML, and know what product sense interview questions are. It‚Äôs totally fine if you don‚Äôt, but if you don‚Äôt, you might have to spend a little time(3hrs/wk) studying/preparing for the materials so that we both are prepared and at the same level. (We can talk more about this)

Lastly, I‚Äôm easy-going, and fun to hang out with, please let me know if you‚Äôre interested. I‚Äôm more than happy to chat with you or make new DS friends :) DM me or comment below so I can message you!!

(A little bit about my background, just so you know I‚Äôm not a weird guy: I‚Äôm currently interning at Intuit as a Product Analyst intern. Prior to that, I interned at 2 startups, one as a Data Science intern, and the other one as a Data Analyst intern. Before that, I interned at a non-profit as a Data Analyst intern. 1.5-year DS/Analytics-related internship experience in total.)"

I am an in-state CS Major applying from GSU and I‚Äôm planning on transferring for the spring semester. My GPA is a 3.9 on a 4.0 scale (4.0 M/S GPA), I currently have 49 credit hours completed and I‚Äôm in multiple leadership positions and an internship I‚Äôm currently working. My essays touched on my journey from high school to here (Started freshman year w/ a 2.1, Graduated w/ a 3.3), reasons why I wanted to attend, my experience as a minority, etc... I‚Äôm planning on including a teacher recommendation as well.

If you guys have any advice whether that‚Äôd be on my application, what spring transfer is like compared to fall/summer, or anything else that would be greatly appreciated. This seems to be a great community and hopefully I can see you all soon!"

whdw63,3,2022-08-05,I'm not learning anything in my CS classes and am thinking about dropping out. Advice?,tooyoungforsunmicro,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/whdw63/im_not_learning_anything_in_my_cs_classes_and_am/,"Yes, I did read the FAQ, particularly entry ""Can I get a programming job without a Computer Science degree? Or without any degree at all?"". I'm just hoping to get recounts of what other's have experienced and maybe some personal advice.

I'll start with my story thus far: I've completed my first two years of university as a Computer Science student and honestly, I kind of hate it. I've spent two years, however many thousands of dollars, and I feel like I've learned nothing. Ignoring the gen-eds, I've basically had two types of classes so far: programming classes on topics I already mastered and super hard classes that stress me way out and teach me things I doubt I'll ever touch again.

Those programming classes? I rarely paid attention in class, rarely studied, and the lowest grade I had in one was an A-. I was able to do that is because prior to entering university I had already learned the information online. I feel like, honestly, I could get a better education by just doing the same thing‚Äîlearning everything online‚Äîbut the unknown is always scary and I was hoping to get input on other peoples' experiences.

I'm asking because those hard, (imo) useless classes stress me way out and I don't want to deal with it anymore. College is also expensive and I feel like so far I've wasted however many thousands of dollars I've already spent and feel like it's maybe time to take a harder look at the sunk cost fallacy. Plus, I feel completely abandoned by my university. I've heard of bad advisors, but mine is worse than bad. They're entirely absent. I get no responses to emails even after sending new ones weekly asking for an update. I get your standard ""oh I'll have to look into that and get back to you"" when meeting in person and, guess what? No response ever!

I just feel like I could do better for myself by just taking a 6 month sabbatical, trying to learn on my own, and see what comes of it. If it works out, maybe just continue doing that until I have collected enough certifications or completed enough projects to be viable on the job market.

I already have work experience in a small IT department and have taken an internship working with databases (that one was mostly clerical work though). I feel like with maybe 1-2 weeks of studying I could easily get an RHCSA and CCNA. Obviously neither of these have to do with programming, but they are field adjacent. I was also thinking that, if I start with a 6 month sabbatical, I could get a Associate Android Developer certification after completing the accompanying course and maybe complete a project or two (not sure what at the moment) to start and see how that goes. But maybe these certifications are worthless or are maybe the wrong choice. Or, maybe my expectations are too high for myself.

But maybe the whole thing's just a terrible idea. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I appreciate all of your answers and feedback. I hope you've had a great summer!"
whg5e0,438,2022-08-06,I can't see the uploaded files,i_abh_esc_wq,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/whg5e0/i_cant_see_the_uploaded_files/,"Recently I posted about a [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/wefdcb/you_want_to_change_images_five_minutes_before_the/) from my first job.  I have one more story to share.

I was building a system for a client. They were sort of an online tuition center for underprivileged children. They had centers in three cities and each center had some teachers and some students. The teachers and students had separate apps. The teachers would record their classes and upload them. They would also upload exam question papers and the students would upload their answers which the teacher would download.

I had to build the two apps, the backend, the admin portal as well as be in contact with the client because I was the only one working on the project. If it were up to me, I wouldn't have made two separate apps with 90% overlap, but those were initially made by an intern on the client's side and they wanted me to finish them. The apps were a hot mess (pro tip: Never make an app without making or at least planning the backend. The intern had no idea how the backend would operate, so he assumed his own data structure and went with it). I could try to make the app better, but I wasn't paid enough to care and boss would often ask me to ""reduce"" my hours so I just duct taped the already duct taped app.

For the teachers' app, after you logged in, you could choose the center you wanted to vuew because one teacher could teach more than one center. Each center showed the students' uploaded scripts, attendance etc.

So one day, the client says ""Hey i_abh_esc_wq, I can't see the answer scripts uploaded by the students. It says 'No answer scripts uploaded'""

Familiar with the client's pea-sized brain, I asked the most obvious question - ""Are you sure they have uploaded their scripts?""

""Yes, we asked a few and they said they have uploaded ""

Sure enough, in the database there are scripts. Why aren't they showing up in the app? 

The app had very minimal logging in the form of Log.d and they made me spend so much time on ""features"" that there weren't enough time to implement development friendly features. So I spent the next evening adding logging as well as Firebase Crashlytics to collect the logs. I also tested multiple times with a local install as well as automated apps and I could see the answer scripts every time. Is it something that was happening only in the client's phone? The logs showed nothing unusual. No crash, no errors.

""Okay, we will bring our phone to [office]. Please come and check"".

I didn't really like going to the office because I had to go there after 8 hours of college and it was very far from the college in the direction opposite to my home. So I thought to solve this without having to go to the office.

Suddenly it dawned on me, ""These students, which center are they in?""

""City A,"" he quickly responds.

""Have you selected the correct center to view the scripts?""

A long pause.

""No. We were actually selecting City B""

I lost it, ""I have been trying to fix this for five days and all because you didn't select the correct center?""

The boss immediately calls me and says, ""Chill, he's the client. Don't be condescending no matter how stupid he is.""

I hated every moment of this."

Mechanical engineering


So to give some context , i recently completed my 2nd year in college, and we are supposed to find a 1 month summer holidays intership or take a autocad course at my college (which sucks too apparently as told by my peers)
At per the recommendation of my cousin who is also an engineer, my father talked to a friend of his and got me an intership at a workshop which makes hot steel rolling mill parts.

Now I'm just kinda left in the dark to just figure out about what am I supposed to see or learn here. Using some tips from here, I've been trying to look at all the machines, the part made, the process included, talkin' with everyone, and finally Askin tons of questions. 

That worked for the first 2 weeks but now I'm again lost as to what am I supposed to write that i have learnt here.

The workers here are simple people that are not that knowledgeable about their field except for the job they are supposed to do or the machines they are supposed to operate.

The engineers inside are most of the time super busy so its hard to get proper time to sit with them and learn about stuff. Everyone else are just always telling me to not go too deep into stuff and college isn't gonna bother much either which sounds true but also very bad advice for someone who wants to learn. 

As per the 1 month training guidance, we dont have to make a report and only a viva will be conducted after college starts. I tried to make a report regardless to have a better understanding of what I learnt here plus it could help for when i Actually need to make a project report in my 6 month training and i have a ton of information collected too but most of it seems kinda useless to write in a report, hence it's not something i can say I learnt during my internship. 

But now i dont even have an idea of what kind of skills im trying to develop here or what am I even supposed to do here in this workshop where I'm not even allowed to use the machine which is also kinda understandable. 

I'm just internally panicking again and again cause i don't want this intership to end up as a complete waste of time. 

What am I supposed to focus on learning and developing during the 3 weeks remaining in that workshop just by looking at machines, the process, the parts and the final finished product."
whjjwq,1,2022-08-06,Switching from Penetration Testing to DevOps,Megaman_1997,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/whjjwq/switching_from_penetration_testing_to_devops/,"Hi, this is my first post ever on reddit and I'm not a native English speaker so pardon my mistakes.

I have been working as a Penetration Tester for an year now and thinking about switching to DevOps. There are two reasons for that:

1- My ultimate goal is to be an Application Security Engineer or a DevSecOps Engineer.

2- There's a huge scarcity of Penetration Testing jobs in my country. Plus I cannot get a remote job since most remote jobs in Penetration Testing require you to be located in the same country and also having a security clearance from that country which I cannot afford on my own. Also the overexpensive certs which i cannot self-fund and companies here in my location don't pay for that either.

I read that DevSecOps requires you to have Penetration Testing skills which I think I have. I recently got an eWPT cert and also received my bachelor's degree in IT from my university. And i know I have to get into DevOps first then only i can go into DevSecOps after some years.

For DevOps, I'd call myself a complete beginner as i do have a sound knowledge of Linux, Python/Bash Scripting and Networking as I also did a CCNA crash course. Currently I'm learning AWS, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes and Prometheus.

So how hard it will be for me to switch to DevOps? Also does DevOps remote jobs require you to be in the same country? I also don't mind doing an internship first as I recently got my degree so I think it's not too late for me to start over.

Thanks in Advance."

Your honest opinion and time is appreciated. The specific role I will be applying for is a Scrum Master or Product Owner. Some keywords are mentioned below.   


Question I have:

\-what is the best resume format while transitioning?

\-considering the gaps and brief moment of relevant employment, where should I list stay at home mom experience?

\-should the detailed version of my story be on the cover letter?

  
\----

  
My name is JB.¬† I‚Äôm a wife and mother of 3 seeking to apply my skills as a Scrum Master / Product Owner in a large corporation or start up tech company

In 2008 I graduated high school

The following year I attended FSCJ to start my journey as a travel nurse

August 2009 I became pregnant with my first son JZ

With this new expectation, I quickly made the executive decision to change course a bit. I gave myself exactly 60 days to apply to a technical school in order to accelerate my education and pay

It was late 2009 when I officially enrolled at Concorde Career Institute in the Medical Assisting program that I later graduated from in mid 2010

Immediately after graduation I was placed in an intern role at Absolute Medical Clinic for 2 months before officially being hired. I was a 20 year old with a precious little boy and my career was finally on a roll

At least that is what I thought until I met BB (now husband). Moving forward we‚Äôll refer to him as the stakeholder ;)

In 2011 the stakeholder and I initiated a contract¬† where I would assume the role as¬†

Product Owner:

\- becoming solely responsible for product backlog¬†

\-product knowledge

Scrum master:

\-coaching development team

\-removing Impediments

Volunteer:

\-share¬†admin skills¬†

\-lead study groups

This continued for 8 years and as a now 29 year old mother of 3, I was ready to apply my cross functional team oriented capabilities in a more diverse setting

Gaining approval from the stakeholder, I became a fulfillment associate(developer) for one of top US companies, Amazon. Within one year I :

\-attended¬† daily stand ups

\-trained new hires

\-collaborated effectively

After much refinement and review it was time that I returned home full-time. The Scrum Team was about to start a new sprint..

The new goal was to learn as much about Forex &amp; Cryptocurrency as possible within the year. This was done by enrolling into an Academy, attending several¬†conferences, creating and maintaining a mastermind etc.

After much success, my peers began to take notice. This led to a new partnership in which I co-created an LLC where we consulted and educated new traders and investors on a daily basis. I was given the opportunity to further apply Scrum Master/Product Owner qualities. In a few short months we:

\-sourced and sold a¬†unique product that appealed to our target audience

\-conducted weekly meetings to address ideas for improvement¬†

\-took action on the feedback given by customers

August 2022 I received certification¬†as a Scrum Master/ Product Owner and now seek to apply for a long term position within a bigger¬†organization

On my original team, The developers are more and more self-sufficient, leaving¬† me with time to seek opportunities where I can continue to learn and¬†offer my skills to help (company) reach its goals ..

What I bring to the team:

\-necessary software knowledge 

\-extensive analytical skills

 \-optimism and servant Leadership"

One I had long interview process with and had friends with them recommend me. The other is my current summer internship who decided to extend me and also offered me a full time position for when I graduate if I stay (spring 2023). I feel really bad, but I think I am going to decline the first offer I got, which is the one that had a long interviewing process for. 

A few days after my interview, I got an email saying ""you got the internship, just sign this contract and start August 20th!"" which does not work with my current internship, nor was there any conversation about when I would be available or anything. This kind of gave me sketchy vibes; normally there's a ""you got it, do you accept?"" Is this normal? The contract already had been semi-filled out with my name through it, which makes me feel worse about potentially declining. 

So my questions are: am I burning any bridges by denying this offer when they seem to have the impression I was going to be an immediate yes? Is this kind of a red flag?

Thanks!"

the company is very big and its the number 1 in the region, I am very thankful for the opportunity and trying to put effort every day in these 3 months period of training.

I started in Helpdesk where I was the ""IT BOY"" it was a good start to learn how things go in the company, but it was not a long time until I started making moves and networking and getting to know everybody

I talked to my supervisor with the help of big software engineer in the company who really liked me, to build a new system for the stock inventory room they have, the approval came and I am working on the system alone (so far so good).

Now my question is: where should I aim to be to have both good salary and fun good work environment?

the company regarding IT department have: (infrastructure) side and (application) side, which inside of them have Network - cloud management - software solutions - database administration - etc... and also other department are open to me since I made very good first impressions with the Heads such as E-commerce (which already asked me if I can switch to his department and start doing work).

so its really confusing to me now that I have many career paths open to me and think I need to choose wisely

PS: there is like 80%above chance I will be hired with them, that is why I need to make choice from now where I want to be especially in this company"

whybwf,1,2022-08-06,Should I turn down a good job offer because I want to travel?,wifisighs,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/whybwf/should_i_turn_down_a_good_job_offer_because_i/,"I (21F) am an engineering student graduating at the end of April 2023. I'm wrapping up a 16 month internship at an engineering company and I really enjoyed my experience there. The company is good to its employees, the pay is good for a new grad, the work I do is interesting, and it's in a very stable industry (electricity transmission).

However, it has been my dream for the past six years to spend at least 1 year in a new country, living independently and experiencing a new culture. This is something that I've wanted to do for the past six years. I actually planned on doing my internship abroad, but it didn't happen due to covid. Instead, I took this internship in my home city.

This week, my manager offered me a full time position upon graduation. He initially wanted me to start 4 days after the end of final exams. I tried negotiating extending my start date by 8 months (January 2024). He said he wants to fill up the role sooner so the maximum time I could delay is 3.5 months (mid-August, 2023).

I am really grateful for the offer and recognize my privilege being in this position. It's a very great job offer with good pay, benefits, and community. My mind tells me that it is logical to take the 3.5 months to travel and then begin my career.

My heart, on the other hand, doesn't want to give up on my travelling dream. I don't necessarily want to visit a country like a tourist. I want to live there, experience the culture, rely on myself, and build a new community. I'm worried that if I don't take the risk and experience the world now, I will never get a chance. I'm in my early twenties now with no serious responsibilities (no husband, no mortgage, no kids, etc.) If I accept the job offer, I think I'll stay at the company for at least 2-4 years and I don't know what my life will look like then. It may be too late to travel as I wanted too. I worry that I'll regret not following my dream.

Ideally, while abroad, I would find a \~1 year contract engineering job to support me. I also have a good amount of money saved up in case I need to take on a more simple job while abroad. Unfortunately, I thought I'd have more time before having to worry about making a concrete plan, so I haven't really looked into the opportunities or applications in the countries I'm considering. I have not applied to any jobs abroad or made concrete plans.

I plan on staying in my home city for the long term. If I do the travel option, I would just want to explore the world for 1 or 2 years and return home.

&amp;#x200B;

Extra Information:

\- I've lived with my parents my whole life.

\- My parents support the idea of me travelling, but think that 3.5 months is enough. They'll support my decision regardless but are leaning towards me accepting the job offer now.

\- I'm a high-performing student with good extracurricular experience, but it took me about 5 months to land my current internship position. I applied to about 60 places, got 4 interviews, and 2 offers.

\- If I accept the job offer, I would get four weeks of paid vacation each year. I think this is generous compared to some other companies in my area.

\- I need to respond to my manager by the end of the week, preferably on Monday (2 days from now)

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: I have a job offer starting 3.5 months after my graduation date. I always imagined myself taking over a year to travel and live independently in a new country before settling down with a real career.**

I would love to hear some advice from reddit, especially those with established careers. Some key questions that I've been asking myself:

Is 3.5 months long enough to get a real travel experience?

Will I regret not taking a longer trip during a point in my life where I don't really have any responsibilities?

Is it foolish to turn down a job offer when I have no other concrete offers/plans yet?"

whyrqr,0,2022-08-06,Graduating with Finance degree in December. Worried about future and considering CS classes as backup plan.,TacoMedic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/whyrqr/graduating_with_finance_degree_in_december/,"Hey everyone!

For background, I'm graduating with a BBA in Finance (w/ minor in PPE) from a non-target in December. GPAs are 3.3 Total and 3.5 Major (but should be higher by the end of the year). I was originally a pre-Nursing student before switching to pre-Business and transferring to my current school as a Finance major. As such, I'm currently on track to graduate with 166 credits. I will also have 26 months left of my GI Bill by the time I graduate, so college/living costs aren't really a big factor for me.

______

With the fact I wasn't able to obtain an internship the last two Summers due to Reserves and familial obligations and now my increased worries about the recession, I'm looking for backup plans. With that in mind, I'm thinking of CS and am taking a python-based Computational Problem Solving class in the Fall. Now I'm wondering if I'd be better served:




Option | Thought Process
---|---
Finish up BBA and take a programming bootcamp in the Fall and hopefully grab some certs. | Quickest, but I'm hesitant because of the potential for terrible programs.
Finish up BBA and go back to the community college I already work at for a computer programming associates. (AA, ADT, AS, CoA) | Easiest, but would still likely increase my college by another 2 semesters and would be from a worse school than if I just tried to double major.
Attempting to double-major/add a minor this late in the game. | Probably my best bet, but will also effectively be me giving up on the Finance field completely without even trying to apply for a full-time position. And would be adding another ~40 credits getting either a BA or BS in the field.

Would really appreciate any help y'all could provide!"
whyuut,70,2022-08-06,Help! I've been assigned an intern who doesn't know anything at all,ceene,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/whyuut/help_ive_been_assigned_an_intern_who_doesnt_know/,"I'm the sole coder of an embedded system based on linux, using buildroot to generate the FS and crosscompile both the system and our closed source payload, written in C.

I've been assigned a very young intern who hasn't finished college, he was supposed to help me with random small tasks while I teach him the basis of our system.

But when I met him I discovered he hasn't never used Linux. In fact, he doesn't know how to change a Windows computer IP address. He says he's learned C by watching YouTube videos, and although I haven't yet tested his knowledge of C I can't but prepare for the worst.

He isn't able to help me with anything, and I can't teach him nothing really because he doesn't know anything really. Real fact: he didn't know he couldn't remove a folder from a filesystem that's been read only mounted. How am I supposed to explain to him our unionfs based system for persistent configuration when he doesn't know what a filesystem is, what a partition is or what read only means?

I don't think it's he's fault he doesn't know any of this, but I'm not a private IT teacher, I can't train a guy like this from 0 to even slightly useful level, because that would be a full time job in itself.

I've talked with my direct boss about this and he's going to talk to the higher ups, but from my experience I'm afraid their answer is just gonna be ""he'll learn, he's a resourceful kid"", obviating that my job is highly specialised and I've been solely doing this job for ten years. He isn't going to reach my level of knowledge in three months.

I'm now on holidays and I'm afraid of what I'm going to find when I come back... What would you guys suggest me to do? How do I train this kid so he at least is able to comprehend the documentation of our system?


EDIT: This blew up a bit! Thanks to all that have commented. A few of you have told me I am condescending... I believe I haven't disrespect this person in any way, and I can assure you that I haven't exaggerated a single thing. He's just a guy that hasn't finished college, is very young, hasn't used linux ever and lacks any experience with Windows beyond using it as a user who hasn't ever needed to check out his IP address or DNS servers.

He's also not family of any higher up, he's one out of five interns with similar backgrounds and they seem to have been randomly assigned to a few of us seniors. Management seem to believe that our jobs are trivial and they really do want this new guys to be useful in very short time, like immediately if possible.

Also, my position is fully remote, so I'm only talking with the intern via slack and zoom, so some of your suggestions won't work for us.

Oh, and by the way, I'm on vacation so this poor guy has been basically left alone since he arrived, we only shared one day of job at the same time, so they've hired him to start at the beginning of my 30 days out... Who's going to guide him during this time and what is he going to do meanwhile... nobody has told me."

But then I look at this project and say to myself ""how is this useful?"" The only silverlining, in my eyes, is that it's somewhat original.

wi1h6i,0,2022-08-06,Honor Societies: Pros and Cons,Katrinia17,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wi1h6i/honor_societies_pros_and_cons/,"I keep reading post asking about honor societies  and if they are legit or not. People seem to be pretty snarky about it. So, I figure a post to get the facts  straight and gather the pros and cons would be fun. 

What is an honor society?

 Organizations for like-minded students who have similar interests, such as academics and leadership abilities.¬†
The acceptance process includes an invitation or application and a fee. Benefits include: prestige, access to social events, workshops, and courses; special access and connections for internships, contest for areas in your field, publication and research opportunities, discounts from various companies and their products/services, scholarships, grants, loans for college or to promote your career, and of course networking. Membership is for life and alumni continue to reap many of the same benefits.

Why should you pay for something you have been awarded? Isn't that a clear sign of a scam? 

You haven't been awarded anything, you have been nominated or selected as a possible candidate for membership. You pay for your membership in the same way that one pays to become a member of the Elk Lodge or Romance Writers of America. These societies also have chapters ( your college will be a chapter), requirements, and fees. None of these societies/organizations are scams.

Why is my college/university trying to scam me out of my money when I already pay so much to attend?

The fee you pay goes to the society, not the school. Sometimes a chapter will request you pay extra to cover the ceremony they will hold but many do not. 

A true honor society wouldn't ask for a fee.

Ever heard of Phi Beta Kappa? They are the number one honor society and...they still charge a fee. They all do. 

But you have to put in so much work for so little. 

Some schools do set requirements for things like attending so many meetings or doing so many events. For the most part though, you just have to pay the fee and reap the awards. How much you decide to put into it is up to you.

So does this mean that all honor societies are equal?

Nooooo. There are some that really are a money mill amd not worth it. There are some that are legit but not worth it. Sometimes it depends on what you want them for. Check out the Association of College Honor Societies to see if the one coming for you is legit. Another way to determine if a society is legit  or not is to go to your schools society page and see if it is listed. The only way to get nominated is if an advisor or professor contacts the head of the chapter at your school, or that person gets the information from the school and then checks to verify  that you meet requirementsand then sends your name to the society which then sends contacts you. What does this mean? If your school does not have a chapter then the society is spamming anyone with a school email. Avoid them unless you are 100 percent sure they are legit.

So what is my story?

I am a part of 4 honor societies. The first one I joined with a group of friends in community college. We didn't  attend a single meeting or event but we all walked away with 8k in scholarships. 2 of us were told that our society factored into our getting into our program. 1 of us found 2 internships geared towards only members of the society. The second one I joined was because it helped first Gen students. The fee was only 10 dollars and it offers nothing but mentorship for those who are new to college and have no one else in their family experienced enough to show them the ropes. Even though I get nothing out of it I love the fact that I mentor first time students, answering  their questions, and supporting them. My third society I joined by mistake, thinking I was paying for another one. It is a transfer society and while legit and with my school, I have no idea what I will get out of it except for some online courses, in person events, discounts to a few things and maybe a scholarship. I  am unsure about how the scholarships work but they do offer them. My last society is one of my favorites because it is based off of my field of interest. It offers everything, scholarships, grants, internships, publishing opportunities, travel opportunities,  internships for members only from leading companies in the industry, online courses and certification,  workshops and networking with leading memebers of the field, research on and off campus...so happy. 

For all of my socities I was contacted by staff of my college, not by the society itself. I was given a code, I did pay my dues, and I also met the requirements.  FYI, all years of schooling I held a 4.0 and above GPA and my friends were 3.6 and above. If your GPA  is low and you have someone contacting...it is a scam.

I would love to join a few more societies, Phi Beta Kappa would be a dream, but I don't  expect it. Phi Kappa Phi is more realistic. But, if I had to choose just one out of all of them, I would choose the Motar Board Society. 

I hope this post helps you in deciding if a honor society is worth it and helps you to avoid scams. If you have any pros or cons please them below along with your experience in a honor society."

For example, some of those scholarships are quite time consuming and after submitting the application I can still end up with nothing. **Did applying for scholarships (external, not through your college) pay off for you?** I am not in desperate need, but extra money would be helpful, so the major concern is **whether the amount of time I put into scholarships could be spent better**: 1)by graduating a year earlier 2)getting a job 3)seeking paid internships?

For context, I can‚Äôt rely on any type of federal aid since I don‚Äôt have a green card, so although I graduated US high school and I am not on student visa, I am close to international students in my status. I‚Äôm also a Math-CS major at UCSD."

I‚Äôve just finished calc 1-3 and my first two introductory cs courses (programming with some data structures mixed in).  

My problem so that despite having found success so far in these courses, I feel I‚Äôm behind on achieving what I want.  My goal is to pursue further education, most likely a masters in CS, at a school like UCLA or another California school.  However, I‚Äôm constantly hearing that research experience is necessary and that other people in my grade are applying for or already working serious internships.

I‚Äôve been putting in a lot of time and I recognize that I need to start the internship search for next summer and get involved with research of some type (this is also a personal goal/interest of mine), but I can‚Äôt help but feel that I‚Äôve barely taken the introductory cs classes, so I how could I possibly be useful in a job setting or to do research under a professor?

I‚Äôd appreciate if anyone could give me advice on managing this, and on how to get involved in these sorts of things as an undergrad, when quite frankly I feel pretty much useless, and that by the time I‚Äôve studied upper level courses and actually feel confident in my abilities and knowledge, I‚Äôll be nearly done with my undergrad."

* Entrepreneurial Culture ‚Äî people love to build stuff, are willing to take risks, etc. 

**General**

* A more collaborative than cut-throat culture
* Professors and classmates who are driven and smart.
* A decent/good computer science equivalent degree options

**Ideal to have**

* Financial Aid (for intl' student)

**Others**

* A more practical approach to teaching than pure theoretical
* A smaller class size (because I reflected and realized I really like asking questions for classes, so I‚Äôd love to have a closer relationship with faculty members)
* A decent ranking/recognition for me to have access to more opportunities in the future

**Not a dealbreaker but...**

* Sunny Environment
* Near Silicon Valley / Bay Area (so more opportunities for tech startups I guess?)"

However, I've found it extremely difficult to find any opportunities at reputable companies. I know I should've started my job search earlier but I was pretty set on going to law school so it didn't seem like a priority for me at the time (Didn't go for financial reasons). I've applied to a number of places for mostly sales positions and have progressed pretty far into the recruitment process at every company I've been able to get an interview with (In the final interview stages at 3 companies). Despite this, sales isn't exactly what I have in mind for my future. I'm really passionate about marketing or even consulting but sales feels kinda like leaving the bar with whatever chick is willing at the end of the night to me. Maybe it's just the way the recruiters have described the positions or the companies themselves but it's pretty clear to me that I'm hesitant about accepting any offers from them. I've searched everywhere for entry-level marketing and consulting jobs at reputable companies but I can't find anything. Ideally, I would like to work for an established corporate business where I can learn from a big team. Any help/advice or opportunities that you're aware of would be greatly appreciated.

*Also, I wrote this at 3 AM after searching all day for jobs so I apologize for the crazy word mess above*

**Some background information:** I went to a pretty reputable business school-- Indiana University, Kelley School of Business. Degree in Marketing BSB which the major is ranked #3 undergrad in the country. GPA: 3.278 (It's not great but I had one F that really fucked my GPA up). Didn't get an internship because I was sick of covid and didn't want an online internship experience so I had a real sales job over the summer working for my Dad. I also have a number of previous jobs, mostly from highschool, and a number of volunteer experiences.

**Skills:** Microsoft word/excel/PowerPoint, SPSS statistical analysis software, Adobe Photoshop/Indesign/Illustrator, Critical Thinking"
wi9o0l,37,2022-08-07,Switching from Penetration Testing to DevOps,usamajr9,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/wi9o0l/switching_from_penetration_testing_to_devops/,"I have been working as a Penetration Tester for a year now and thinking about switching to DevOps. There are two reasons for that: 

 1- My ultimate goal is to be an Application Security Engineer or a DevSecOps Engineer. 

 2- There's a huge scarcity of Penetration Testing jobs in my country. Plus I cannot get a remote job since most remote jobs in Penetration Testing require you to be located in the same country and also have a security clearance from that country which I cannot afford on my own. Also, the over-expensive certs which I cannot self-fund and companies here in my location don't pay for that either. 

 I read that DevSecOps requires you to have Penetration Testing skills which I think I have. I recently got an eWPT cert and also received my bachelor's degree in IT from my university. And I know I have to get into DevOps first then only I can go into DevSecOps after some years. 

 For DevOps, I'd call myself a complete beginner as I do have a sound knowledge of Linux, Python/Bash Scripting and Networking as I also did a CCNA crash course. Currently, I'm learning AWS, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes and Prometheus. 

 So how hard it will be for me to switch to DevOps? Also, do DevOps remote jobs require you to be in the same country? I also don't mind doing an internship first as I recently got my degree so I think it's not too late for me to start over.   
  

Thanks in Advance.

Humanity, that name conjures up a lot. Humanity is the premier trading power of the galaxy. If you want something, the Terrans will get it to you, and their Ideal-X class Superfreighters are something to behold. Able to hold more than a billion tons of raw materials and luxury with a crew full of Terrans, you were guaranteed that nothing would interfere with your goods. Their position 25,000 light years from the galactic Core meant that they were isolated from the disputes of the Galactic Conglomerate, but not too far enough that it would take six months for the ship to reach its destination. Instead, it takes just under a Terran month to get to the home of the Galactic Conglomerate Ployus.

The Terrans said they were pacifists and would not interfere with galactic politics. This principle was tested when the Tyt-Umk war started, and the Terrans traded with both sides giving them food and dihydrogen-monoxide. They told the galactic consul this was to ensure the survival of civilians. So, we had researchers investigate the Terran military doctrine and found a rich history that ended abruptly 100 years before first contact with a war they called ""The War to End History"". We discovered they found something within themselves during that war they swore to destroy. After the war, they forged a document that the new Terran government must follow when it came to war, and on the top of that list was the protection of civilians. This word was foreign to us as once a country has begun a war, everyone is involved in the war, and for the Terrans to say that you cannot poison the water that factory workers drink so you can slow down production was a concept genuinely foreign.

However, we let them be as why stop them from practising their pacifist ideology. When the Terrans saw the bombing of Uyhma by the Tyt forces, they suddenly stopped all ships transporting goods to Tyt territories and even turned around those already in transit. This act shook the Tyt government, who immediately asked why the Terrans had stopped transporting vital aid. The Terrans stated they could not be complicit in the killing of civilians. The Tyt were outraged at this, seeing the action as tantamount to a declaration of war. However, the Terrans were too far away for anyone to conceive of mustering an army to challenge the Terrans. So, the galaxy watched as the Tyt civilization collapsed into a brutal civil war, letting it happen. The Terrans, however, could not let the suffering endure even though they caused it. Unfortunately, the Tyt public had the same opinion as the Tyt government and the Terrans peace forces were pushed back by an angry mob of civilians.

The Terrans realized after this that the rest of the galaxy does not think like them and thinks they're borderline crazy. So, they accepted this fact and continued to trade with the Core but would no longer partake in supplying governments during a war. However, the Terrans did not see that enemies were beginning to see them as weak-minded and, with their vast resources, easy pickings for anyone within range. Within range was the crucial part, as it took weeks for any fleet to travel across the needed space to get to the border of the Terran Federation and even more time to get to Terra itself. So, only two empires could do it, The Favja Empire or The Dstric Empire. The Dstric were neutral to the Terrans and, being militaristic, fancied the Terran's chances in battle. As they put it, You never unlearn the art of war. The Favja were much more opposed to the Terrans, and the two species had multiple close calls, mainly when superfreighters were shot at for trespassing into favja space.

It started getting nasty for the Favja when one of their stars went supernova and destroyed a significant part of their breadbasket. So, a famine began and looking for food. The Favja started to sponsor attacks on Superfreighters to collect food and meals for the hungry. Most were peaceful hijackings that stole the Superfreighters and ran into Favja territory. Of course, the Favja denied that they were sponsoring the pirates and that the pirates were looking out for those they loved. The Terrans were suspicious and started to arm their Superfreighters lightly. This arming of cargo created a proxy war between the Terrans and the Favja, with only one side knowing it was in a proxy war.

Then the Favja did something to piss the Terrans of royally; they massacred a crew. Overnight the Favja were no longer harbouring pirates but terrorists. So, the Terrans demanded the immediate surrender of the pirates responsible and the commander of the pirate organization, to which the Favja acted dumb. They said they did not know what the Terrans were talking about and that the pirates were not a cohesive group. The Terrans, displeased, told the Favja royals that if they could not hand over those responsible for the deaths of 578 Terran crew, then war would be declared. The Favja Queen Scoffed in the Terran's face and agreed. You see, the Favja could not hand over those responsible because they were all high-level commanders who were not meant to kill the Terran crew, but kinship is more robust than all, so the Favja had to protect them.

Compared to the Terrans, the favja fleets were up and running quickly because of the recent conflict the favja had been in, with the first war fleets being sent out only six months after the war began. These fleets knew that the planets and solar system closest to the border would be more heavily armed, so they took a longer route and hoped that Terran scanners would miss them. So, when they reached the system of Thales, the Favja caught the system entirely off guard and with the little defences, the system was crushed but not destroyed. This attack was a statement to the humans. We can come at you anywhere, and we will beat you. Unfortunately, this backfired on the Favja as the attack only seemed to add more fuel to the fire of humanity's rage.

After the attack, a statement by a Terran diplomat after the Terrans first united was published in News organisations across the galaxy as a statement by the Terran leadership.

May we hope that the Giant of war may never awake.

That after the millennia it spent chasing us, it has grown tired.

May it only grumble and snore in its long sleep.

We must strive to keep it within its slumber.

One day it might once again walk this Earth to spite us all.

At first, most races were confused about what the original speaker was implying. The original speech was layered with metaphors that made it hard to decipher. Some people thought it was about a literal giant walking the Earth. Some thought the address was about the Terran ability to make war. I, however, raised the point that this might be talking about Terrans simply waging war. My theory caught on as the claim of massive fleets moving within Terran space emerged. The intel was brushed off as the ship was only found to be superfreighters moving mass amounts of steel. The Favja continued to make attacks with more resistance than the last. With the growing losses suffered by the attack fleet, the Favja commander decided to move to a more strategic position and claim victory.

They boasted in front of the galactic Council about how they had beaten the Terrans easily and how little fight the Terrans had put up. After the speech, all eyes in the Galactic Council turned to the lowly Terran ambassador, who was smirking. Then, standing up, they began to use the same metaphor as the speech presented 4 Terran months earlier. ""The Giant cannot simply wake up and start fighting. They need to cook breakfast, get their gear on, and grab their weapons, and it is then and only then can the Giant's fight truly begins. So, the war is not over until we say it is,"" she said sternly. The Favja ambassador laughed as if the Terran had just told the greatest joke in the world. ""The Dstric seem to have had an overconfidence in you because you seem to have forgotten how war works, or do I need to explain it to you like you're my young."" The Favja spat. The Terran, not amused, stood up stern and began to speak with death in her bright blue eyes. ""A forge does not simply alight to the point where it can melt Iron. No, it needs to be heated so the Iron can melt. Sometimes you may place the Iron in too early, and it does not melt instantly. You and your race are the Iron Ambassador, and sooner or later, you‚Äôll start to melt."" Before walking out to silence.

Little did we all know at the time, but things were moving within Terran space, old designs and concepts getting built in factories that surrounded great gas giants. Hundreds of millions of beings were recruited to get ready for the great fight. Scientists concocted great weapons that could burn away a planet's atmosphere. Finally, an armada that spanned solar systems waiting at the Terran borders like it was a wall about to fall. All this is kept secret and silent for the day it is activated.

That day was January 25th on the Terran calendar. Sensors across the Core picked up a significant movement within space heading towards the Favja Empire. Closer sensors told the Core that the campaign was so massive that space was moving because of the number of ships going faster than light. All of it converging on Favja space. Two weeks would typically be enough to get some defences up, but for armies of the Terran's size, there was only one option, pray to your god for mercy and accept your coming death. Foolishly the Favja put up defences on their border, hoping they could stand long enough to gather intel on what the Terran's ships and weapons looked like, but they could not even do that. The outpost lasted just 15 Galactic standard minutes between first contact with the Terran and ceasing all communication. The pictures it sent back haunted the Favja leadership. The images showed a great mass of grey getting closer and closer before the feed was lost. The first solar system hit was the Gajret system. It stood longer than the defensive outposts but not by a lot. Thirty-seven minutes lasted before all signals cut except for the deepest military bunkers. They survived the longest of the lot at one galactic standard day before the Terran military kicked down the door and cut the final communication from the system.

In that time, they had taken out three other systems, and the favja were increasingly getting worried because the Terran battering ram was headed straight for jourjr prime the Favja home system. The good thing from the losses was that the Favja were getting more information about the Terran attack. First, the main front was the Favja, nicknamed the Planet killer. This charge was the front that would destroy everything in its path and lay the way to the Capture front, which cleared the planets and made sure that the main front was well supplied with goods and ammunition. The big surprise was that Terrans use projectile weapons that can only be countered with thick armour, unlike lasers, which a good enough shield will block.

The Favja panicked to thicken the armour on their warships and move every military asset they could to the Jourjr prime system to try and hold out in one last hurrah. But, to the favja surprise, when the Terrans finally arrived at Jourjr prime, they moved around it and to neighbouring systems. Thus real panic began as those in the know realized that the Terrans were going to perform an encirclement of the jourjr prime system. Every being in the system scrambled to make either a speedy exit or bunkered down in readiness for a fight. Weeks passed, and the Terrans stayed outside the Jourjr prime system before the Terran ambassador called a sudden emergency meeting of the Galactic Conglomerate.

""As you all know, the Terran Republic has been at war with the Favja Empire. We want to hold on to our promises and offer peace only if the Favja surrender unconditionally to the Terran forces. If our demands for peace are not met, we will destroy the entire Jourjr system, home to 58 billion Favja. Plus, with the Jourjr star going supernova once we are done, the death toll could exceed 100 billion and plunge what's left of the Favja Empire into turmoil. So, does the Favja ambassador accept his surrender,"" The Terran spoke as she commanded the whole room. All eyes turned to where the Favja ambassador was meant to be sitting but was only an intern. ""What happened to your ambassador."" the high speaker. ""He shot himself when we received the order for an emergency meeting, saying how this was the Terran backing us into the corner."" The intern stuttered out. ""Dear me, well, intern, you are now that ambassador to your people, and thus you have to accept or decline the Terrans peace offer."" The High speaker said, saddened at the News. At this, the intern said okay before collapsing. Suddenly the Favja's direct line to the leadership started to ring as the Favja queen was calling to accept the terms of the deal.

So, the great army surrounding Jourjr Prime retreated to the human territories, leaving only one message in its wake.

May we hope that the Giant of war may never awake.

For we all saw the might of the Giant and the power it welds

May it only grumble and snore in its long sleep.

For we must all strive to keep it asleep.

One day it might once again walk this Earth to spite us all.

We must learn from our mistakes so that the Giant can rest again.

To add, I want to work on my own projects to add to my github early on so again I'll barely have time for anything else.

I know that a job isn't guaranteed, but when I think about my future 10 or 20 years from now a cs degree is more likely to give me a life that I will enjoy professionally and financially. So is staying unemployed till I'm 25 maybe even more a sacrifice that's worth it?"

widfgr,6,2022-08-07,Feels like I lost from the start,oopthrowaways,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/widfgr/feels_like_i_lost_from_the_start/,"22(M) year-old here. I feel so defeated. All of my friends already finished their undergrads at uni. And me being a dumbass thought it'd be a good idea to follow my passion as a career choice.

Went into one year of college for art fundamentals thinking I'd figure out what kinda art I wanted to pursue as a career. Was just distracted and out of it the entire year I was there. I couldn't even complete the elective so I dropped out, never getting my graduate certificate. My parents told me to go into medicine or architecture because those jobs made a lot of money. But I never had an interest in any of those things. Same deal with business/economics. Hate all of that stuff. I wanted to have a job that would let me create art to contribute to games and whatnot. Or so I thought. I took a year off to figure out what I wanted to do in post-secondary, deciding that I should also work at fast food in the meantime to save up money.

I eventually decided to enroll in a three-year game art course, thinking this was it. A combination of my two favourite things: art and video games? What could go wrong. I realized that I was still distracted and out of it. I hated the lectures and I hated the assignments. I always ended up half-assing projects last minute. My marks were good but it didn't reflect the sheer dismay I had. Why did I hate this too? It's like my brain couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to do. I realized then that I have ADHD. After looking at all the possible symptoms and going in for a diagnosis. Everything made sense. But, it feels like it's too late anyway. I'm thousands of dollars in debt from a program I don't even wanna continue but did just so my parents could be happy that I'm still in school. I recently learned that I really like linguistics and maybe I should've pursued that but I've already wasted so much time... And who knows, I might end up hating it like my other college courses. One reason I didn't choose to pursue it earlier was because one of the most viable careers coming out of linguistics was being a professor and I never thought I'd be smart or committed enough to pursue a pHD or whatever. I could barely keep my attention focused on one hobby. How could I manage like ten years of school and intense study...

For some reason, I always was astounded how people around me could be so productive. How they could do all this adult stuff without batting an eye. Meanwhile, I still felt like I had the same mind that I had in high school. I keep distracting myself from important stuff like learning how to do my taxes or learning how to drive. The thought of doing any of it makes me seize up in fear. I can't wrap my brain around any of it. The fact that everyone around me can (especially people years younger than me) just makes me think my brain really is just wired differently. Slowly, it just feels like there's distance growing between me and my friends. They're climbing up society's ladder... Meanwhile, I'm pretending to do the same but I'll vanish when they aren't looking. Probably doesn't help that my depression is constantly in the way, giving me such a bleak outlook on life.

I'm not sure where the depression came from exactly but part of it could probably be attributed to my situation at home. I have two parents and two brothers, one older and one younger. But...I'm not very close to anyone in my family. I rarely talk to any of them because I just don't feel comfortable. Especially with my parents. I feel like anything I might say to them might reveal that I'm gay. And my parents seem to be pretty homophobic. As a kid, they always told me not to make certain gestures as society perceived those to be 'feminine.' They always warned me, saying that God wouldn't like it. Of course, after that, I learned to keep it to myself. I remember certain times where my emotion would be so pent up from trying to hide myself from them that I'd burst in anger at something small, to which they'd quickly shut me down and lecture me. It confused me because they always told me I was too quiet and never voiced my feelings but whenever I try to voice them I'm always dismissed as being too dramatic or rude. So, I just choose not to say anything at all anymore. Nothing about my mental health, and certainly nothing about me being gay because there's already so much about me that disappoints them. It's funny hearing my dad using my as an example of what not to be like to my little brother...right in front of me. It really hurts.

So now I feel like I'm always walking on egg shells with them. Not to mention the fact that my dad always finds an opportunity to suspect me of doing something bad. He's not exactly the kindest person. He's the type of person who'll argue with someone to the point of the other person breaking down and crying, disregarding any concern for them as long as he can prove his point and win the argument. And that happens very often at home. My parents arguing is just commonplace in this household. I guess my mom doesn't understand that it's impossible to win against him and so she keeps trying. I know better than to argue with him so even if he's wrong and I know how to prove it, I say nothing because I just wanna avoid conflict. There's enough of it every week. I'm not sure if that's caused me any underlying trauma but maybe it has.

I just have vivid memories of my parents arguing on two different family vacations and both of them ending with my parents giving each other the silent treatment for the remainder of the trip and creating this awful atmosphere between my little brother and I. One time we were in our hotel room at night and my mom, frustrated beyond belief, opened the hotel room door and told my dad to scream louder so that everyone else in the hotel could hear. That actually didn't stop him as I guess he didn't give a shit about the other people sleeping so he just continued to shout. I remember that was pretty frightening at the time because they both asked me for my input in the argument, which caused me to seize up.

Maybe I'm just making a big deal about this, because sometimes they actually look like a normal family, especially when they're talking to my older brother about sports and which teams they're rooting for. It's the one thing that brings the family together. But I hate sports and want nothing to do with them. Another thing to add to the distance between me and them. I feel so detached from my family to the point of no return. Really makes me wish I could just not exist. 

I'm not better outside my family either. Everyone around me and my age seems to be doing just fine. They all talk about getting their driver's licenses soon, or how they just landed an internship at some company. They're all studying things along the lines of science, business, etc. It just makes me sad to hear them on track and aware of where they wanna go in life. Whereas I can barely decide what I wanna do for the day. Not to mention a lot of them are in relationships.

Not much to say about that either. Never been in a relationship because my anxiety cripples me whenever I try to do anything. Any guy I find cute I just assume they're straight because, in the past, I've done the opposite. Inhaling copium and hoping that they were gay so maybe I could finally have a chance. But it's always depressing when I learn they have a girlfriend or they talk to me about a girl that they like. Not only do I have to look for someone gay, but they have to like me too...? What's up with that. Feels impossible for someone with social anxiety like me. But I know this would be insane from the start since I don't even love myself.

So for now, I came up with the only long-term plan I feel like I'll be able to commit to. My friends and I are saving up to travel to Japan next year. It's one of the places I've wanted to visit my entire life. I've never been able to go (my friends have) and I just want to be in my place of happiness, make the happiest memories of my life and then sign out.

This is on a throwaway account because I don't want them to know that I'm planning to off myself after the trip.

If anything life-changing happens before then, I won't go through with it, but I doubt anything will change, especially because I don't wanna change anymore. I just want to check this one thing off my bucket list and bid farewell to the world. Maybe in my next life I'll be a happier person.

Sorry for the long and disorganized post, this would be something for therapy except I'm scared of the therapist and I'm also broke."

Hi all,

‚Äî‚Äî background ‚Äî‚Äî
I recently graduated from a good university in UK, studying computer science and artificial intelligence.

My work experience:
I worked as a NLP research intern at a university in my 2nd year, and as a data science intern in a small startup. 
Currently I have started a job as graduate software engineer in another startup.

I had lots of difficulty finding a suitable job as I focused less on leetcode, and also applied mainly for data science/ machine learning engineer positions which mainly hire master/ phd candidates.

My current plan is to continue working on  Leetcode and learn as much as I can from my current software engineer position. Then, hopefully transition to a bigger sized company as either a software engineer or a machine learning engineer.

However, I also really want to move to USA, but can‚Äôt think of a good option that doesn‚Äôt involve getting masters degree in the USA.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
I don‚Äôt mind if it even takes 3-7 years, and can grind quite a lot during this time. Also, I care a lot more about growing as a developer than the company flair, etc.

So what is my best option/ career path to grow as software engineer/ machine learning engineer and move to USA."

Thing is IDK what language to choose or what to do, in CS50x I should take  **Scratch, C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript**.I do not know what kind of development I want to study but I know that I want to develop software if I'll take SWD field, or another field might be Data science and that will be data scientist jobs, so both require python so I will take that, but before reaching the level of data scientist or a SE. what type of development I should discover and learn if I am into AI-ML, these kind of stuff, what languages to use ? what type of projects should I learn to make to earn myself some experience to be ready and apply for the next summer ?

Also; out-of-topic question: I know it isn't easier for a student from a North-African country in middle east, to land an abroad internship. But if I have a chance based on my country and such, where and how can I apply ? specially I'd be needing a Visa and more hassle for companies to take me in rather than someone locally to them, if succeeded a paid internship would be a +, as we lack quality internship here and there's hardly close to none chance to have a paid one and even if I found, it pays LESS THAN 1$/hr no joke.  


EDIT#1: I dont mean that I am only stuck with the options listed with CS50x I am just giving an example of the langs it teaches, but I am speaking about other languages to learn besides them as well to acquire to my own experience."
wilg0x,2,2022-08-07,Take defense offer to wait out recession?,MrDarSwag,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wilg0x/take_defense_offer_to_wait_out_recession/,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm a rising senior EE who recently finished a summer internship at a defense contractor. On my last day, they notified me that I would be receiving a return offer. While I don‚Äôt know the full details of the offer, the pay seems to be quite reasonable and they offer good benefits. The work I did over the summer was quite enjoyable; there was a lot of downtime, but aside from that, I thought it was pretty cool. The company culture is also a good fit for me. 

Given all that information, you‚Äôre probably wondering why I haven‚Äôt already taken the offer. Well, it‚Äôs because I have another internship that I will be doing in fall, and I think an offer there would be more compelling. I don‚Äôt know too much about the company yet, but from everything they‚Äôve told me (plus my knowledge about the nature of the industry), it seems like the work will be more challenging and exciting. If I got a full time offer from this company, it would almost certainly substantially pay more than the other one. The location is also better for me because it‚Äôs near home, so I can live with my folks and save money. 

The only problem with the second company is that it‚Äôs pretty small and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs recession-proof in the same way that defense is. With all the hiring freezes that are happening in tech right now, I‚Äôm afraid that the same thing will happen to my company and I won‚Äôt get a return offer. Either that or I‚Äôll be a few months into my job and the company will go belly up, which would be tragic. 

I only have a few weeks to accept my offer from the defense company, so I‚Äôm torn about what to do. I‚Äôm going to ask for an extension, but I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôll give me a few more weeks at best. What would you guys advise me to do?"

Right now, I am doing classes in the mornings while learning JavaScript and doing CodeSmith‚Äôs CSX program (free right now) in the evenings. In the afternoon, I work as an undergraduate researcher in bioengineering 30 or so hours a week, this position has been teaching me incredible skills in bio-engineering, and I am doing original research and working on publishing review articles and writing a paper.

So, here are my thoughts and plans at the moment: I want to tie all of this together. 
I intend to do their full J.S. course and CS Prep, soon, but long term I am interested in joining their part time immersive program next year. I am not in a rush, as I want to make sure I fully understand and am comfortable with each concept and skill before moving on to the next, as I understand the immersive program is difficult. 

Molecular biology is my passion and I am finding coding to be something I *really* enjoy doing, I look forward to working on it in the evenings and want to combine SWE into my career scopes. Right now, my thoughts were: finish my degree in molecular biology, while completing the JS course and CS prep ‚Äî&gt; attend CodeSmith‚Äôs actual immersive program ($20k) ‚Äî&gt; potentially do an internship in programming to boost my resume credibility, since my SWE experience will be coming from a bootcamp as opposed to a 4 year CS degree. Eventually I would like to complete a graduate degree in molecular/cell biology as well. 

I also thought it could be beneficial to eventually work on my own projects during and after CS to build my portfolio. I wanted your opinion: would my education + work experience in bioengineering + CodeSmith + personal coding projects make me a good hiring candidate in SWE? Specifically, I am very interested in both AI and potentially creating programs to merge and assist in molecular bio research. I have no problem making that big of an investment into CodeSmith, so long as it appears it will pay itself back and benefit me. I would love to hear your thoughts, insight, and advice on whether or not it‚Äôs a good investment going forward. Do you think salary would be good in the long run too? I‚Äôm not really sure what it could range from. Thank you :)"

I got my first full-time job shortly after graduating. I'm also a male in my early 20's

Before I graduated college, I worked a part-time job where I worked between 15-30 hours a week. Working a full-time job was something brand new to me. Long story short, a company offered me an internship position that doesn't technically end. Basically, they can hold on to me for as long as they want until a position opens up. With quite a few people retiring this year, it was a pretty easy choice to accept this internship over other jobs. With that, I also don't receive any benefits with the company until the internship ends. I was pretty excited receiving this offer because it was my way into the industry. I don't have much work experience, so you need to start somewhere. 

The job itself is pretty simple. I work 12 hour days on the 2-2-3 schedule. Since I started working this new job, I've had very mixed feelings about it. I know I don't have much experience in working, but I really don't like working 12 hour shifts. I enjoy the days off, but it seems like once I reach that 8-9 hour mark in the shift, my brain shuts off and wants to be done working. On top of that, the guy who's been training me has been very tough on me. He fully expects that I should be as good as him despite the fact that he's been working with the company for 30 years. Again, this is with my CURRENT internship, not what it can be in the future if I stay.

The big problem at the moment resides on this passage. About a month ago, I was offered a REAL position with the company. A worker had an injury outside of work and will miss a couple months. After the couple months are up, another will retire. I've definitely considered accepting this offer, but if I accept the position, I'll be forced to work rotating shifts which I'm 100% against doing. I prefer 8-9 hour days where I'm out by 2 or 3pm. 

Accepting this offer would be really nice for my career due to the money and experience, but this offer will ruin me both physically and mentally. I'm blessed that I got this offer, but I don't know if I should accept it or not. My family wants me to, but I'm leaning against it. I'd prefer to find a job that fits more of what I want, Any thoughts?"

Also how would you approach this scenario. Amazon currently has 2023 SWE intern and SWE new grad applications open. Should I apply to both 2023 SWE intern and New grad. For example for the intern role I can say that my graduation date is December 2023 and for new grad I will put May 2023 instead.

wirakq,1,2022-08-07,Graduate in December vs June and Going into Industry vs Academia straight out of college?,cannonguy,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wirakq/graduate_in_december_vs_june_and_going_into/,"Hello,

I'm currently preparing for graduate school and applying for full time positions. I would like to ask advice from you all about which routes you would recommend taking:

* Graduate in December, go straight into full-time afterwards (start industry career early) or internship in spring/summer (if I plan to attend grad school fall 2023)
* Become part-time student now and work part-time (internship, research assistant, or tutor) until June and graduate then (can start industry or grad school in fall 2023 and staying until June will give me more time to build connections with professors/peers)

I'm grateful to have these choices, but at the same time, I'm struggling to decide which path to take. I've heard it's nice to start your career early on to build work experience, but from many people I've spoken to at my workplace and elsewhere, they regret not pursuing academia in their youth, when they did not have many obligations, like raising a family.

I would like to experience both industry and academia early on, since I'm worried about having that regret later in life. For academia, I plan to pursue a PhD, since I heard you can earn money in the program and also, 1-2 years of work experience outweighs paying for a master's degree. I can see myself pursuing either path, but I know they are huge commitments, so that's why I would like to hear your advice on this.

Also to mention, I won't be in debt or have to take loans if I stay until June, but it's nice to save money.

Thanks everyone!"
wirh6i,2,2022-08-07,Sophmore Computer Engineering Student,rolsand,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/wirh6i/sophmore_computer_engineering_student/," 

I'm a first-year computer engineering student trying to build up my resume and land an internship after my second year. I have a couple of questions about the process:

1. I'm currently learning C++ and considering picking up another language like Python or HTML/CSS/Javascript. I'm unsure what role I want or what language will provide the most opportunities. Should I continue to focus on C++ or should I pick up another language that's in demand for intern positions?
2. When building a project and posting it to Github how should I present it? What usually tells recruiters that I know how to actually code? What should my readme file and other ones be organized?
3. When it comes to learning C++ how do I actually know where my skill level is? I constantly hear that a good C++ developer knows what they don't know. How can I reach a point where I constantly know what I need to learn next?
4. What skills did you personally have when you applied for your first internship or job?
5. How can I get started with contributing to open-source projects?

I would really appreciate it if anyone with more experience could answer any of these questions. Thanks."
wirraz,0,2022-08-07,final year computer science student,GraphGirls,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/wirraz/final_year_computer_science_student/,"so basically, during the pandemic i slacked off and i would copy assignments and cheat on tests since everything was online. I'm going into my final year, and overall i can say that i understand 6/10 of data structures and algorithm, 8/10 on graph theory, 7/10 on discrete maths and proof theory, 4-5/10 on the operating system but around 6/10 on the history of computing including finite automata's etc. I didn't do any internships and i don't have any personal projects, I don't feel confident at all with my coding abilities ill probably give myself about 3/10 on writing code. I'm stuck between taking the semester off and trying to catch up or just going into my final year. I would greatly appreciate any advice given?"
wistfj,2,2022-08-07,internships after freshmen year,yoyoyoposter101,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wistfj/internships_after_freshmen_year/,"Btw looking at data analytics,BI, business analyst etc type roles since I'm a MIS major 

Alot companies seem to accept students for internships after freshmen year, like Amazon 

Like this one 
 https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/2141832/business-intelligence-engineer-internship-2023-us

Of course realistically, I don't meet all the preferences

Will there be lower standards as a freshmen? 

Atm I just know some excel, sql and python and am learning more of them

Any tips for getting one after freshman year?

I see so many kids my age hanging out especially now during the summer and it makes me so depressed the fact that I have never experienced such times, I am getting ""old"" and I'm wasting so much time by sitting home depressed doing nothing but I want to change that, just don't know how.   
I am starting college next february and I'm looking forward to it but I still have 6 months left and I just can't stay home doing nothing, I want to meet new people and make new friends and unforgettable memories but I have no idea how. Most kids my age are starting college now in september and I have no idea where to meet people so I came here to ask for advice. I don't want to meet anyone online through dating apps or anything of the sort as I don't feel comfortable and safe. I'd love to join a school or a program with housing and everything, like an internship? But I've looked and researched and haven't really found anything. (No summer camps since I'm now on vacation with family)

Do you guys have any advice/ideas?

After having done some research, some alumni still managed to work in IB at a BB but the numbers are quite a bit low...

I would appreciate some advice on that as Purdue is most likely going to be my cheapest option but I cannot enroll if I cannot reach IB as fast as somebody in a better known college. 

Also, would it be best to major in smtg Tech related (CS, DS, AI, or CompEng) with a minor in Finance or vice versa? I am considering the first option as I would like to have more flexibility in the future if I ever wanted to switch to Tech...is this a good idea?

wivcoo,1,2022-08-07,College Juniors/Seniors - Start Getting Ready for Fall Full-Time/Internship Recruiting,CalculatedCareers,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wivcoo/college_juniorsseniors_start_getting_ready_for/,"# Intro

Historically, there have been twice as many college graduates compared to the number of new jobs requiring a degree. If you are a college junior or senior, now is the time to start preparing for fall recruiting. Fall recruiting is when most of the large companies will do the bulk of their full-time and internship recruiting. I have put together a back-to-school checklist to make sure you are doing every needed to get recruitment ready. Hope it helps!

# Understand Your Impact

There are lots of ways to gain relevant work experience including internships, research projects, local jobs, or volunteering opportunities. If you did any of these over the summer you will most likely want to include that experience on your resume. One of the most important factors for an effective resume is being able to clearly communicate your impact. As a junior contributor it can sometimes be difficult to know the impact of your work. Reach out to your supervisor or lead to see if they can help you answer the following questions:

* **Value** \- Why did your work matter and how did you make an impact? Get specific numbers or percentages for impact were possible
* **Scale** \- What was the size and reach of your work? This can include how many people your work affected or the budget behind a project. Providing these details can help someone who is not directly familiar with your work understand its size
* **Visibility** \- How were senior leaders involved with the work you did? Explaining the visibility and showing executive presence can help a recruiter understand the importance of your work

**Tip:** If you haven‚Äôt had these conversations for some of your prior experiences, consider reaching back out to your former supervisor to see if they can help you fill in the gaps.

# Finish Any In-Progress Certifications

If you were working on any certifications over the summer, make sure to complete them before school starts. You don‚Äôt need more classes hanging over your head, and you might find it challenging to complete them once school starts. If you won‚Äôt be able to complete all the certifications you started then prioritize the ones best aligned with the types of roles you plan to apply for.

# Start Any Strategically Significant Certifications

You might be thinking ‚ÄúHold on, you said to finish my certifications‚Äù. While this is true, there may be instances where it strategically makes sense to start a certification program based on what you learned over the summer. This is especially true when the certification is meant to help you start a career in something that wouldn‚Äôt seem like an obvious fit for your background.

This tactic should be used sparingly, but you can list an in-progress certification on your resume as long as you put an expected completion date. In many ways this is the same thing you are doing with your degree. It‚Äôs a helpful way to show recruiters the active steps you are taking to move towards your career goals. Just make sure you actually complete the certification by the time listed on your resume, nobody is suggesting you lie.

# Update Your Resume, LinkedIn, and Handshake Profile

Now that you understand your impact, use this time to update your Resume, LinkedIn, and Handshake profiles (if applicable) with your latest experience. While your LinkedIn and Handshake profiles can have a broader list of experiences, you‚Äôll want to begin tailoring your resume for the types of roles you will be searching for in the fall.

You aren‚Äôt required to have just one resume. You can have multiple versions, each tailored to the types of roles or industries you plan to apply to. Your resume is your greatest marketing tool. So make sure it‚Äôs easy to read and clearly demonstrates the value and skills you can bring to a potential employer.

**Tip:** Consider running your resume through an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scanner. It ensures the format can be easily read by the systems recruiters use to track applicant profiles. Your career center may even have a subscription available for you to use for free. Someone with excellent experience may be passed over because their resume is not ATS friendly.

# Add Coworkers to Your Professional Network

Make sure to add anyone you worked with over the summer on LinkedIn. Not only can you potentially leverage them for a future opportunity, but you will also get exposure to their professional network. Shared connections can be used to help facilitate introductions to people working at companies you are interested in.

**Tip:** It's best to add people just before or right after finishing your role. Although if you are in a longer term role it‚Äôs ok to add them while you are still working there. If you are using this checklist and it's been over a week since departing your role‚Ä¶don‚Äôt worry. Better late than never!

# Reflect on Your Experience

As the summer comes to a close, reflect back on the experiences you had and consider what that means for the type of career you are interested in. Did you find out that working in Finance wasn‚Äôt what you thought it would be? Is being an academic researcher your new found passion? Perhaps you discovered that you like working at a small company. Whatever it is, take the time to reflect on what you learned and decide how you want to apply those learnings to your job search. Don‚Äôt be afraid to talk it through with a mentor, coach, or someone else you trust. Figuring out your career path isn‚Äôt something you have to do on your own.

# Reacquaint Yourself With Your Professional Network

Your professional network will be an important tool when it comes time to apply for roles. It‚Äôs worth reviewing your network to see who works at companies or in roles you are interested in. Consider making a shortlist of people you think you‚Äôll reach out to for a referral or professional introduction during your job search.

This would also be a good time to make connection requests for anyone you know well but who aren‚Äôt in your network. Think friends‚Äô parents, family members, alumni you know well, previous coworkers, or past professors. Every connection increases the number of people who could potentially help you in your job search.

**Tip:** You should plan on using your professional network to request a referral when the time comes to apply. A referral helps your application stand out and employers actually prefer to hire referrals.

# Next Steps

If you have completed the checklist then congratulations! You have taken huge steps towards getting ready for fall recruiting. Next, reach out to your career center or monitor their website for career fair details. There‚Äôs more preparation to be done, however you‚Äôll want those career fair details first before getting started."

wiwb48,2,2022-08-07,"Graduated college, but still not sure about what I really want to do?",jtnsniper14,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wiwb48/graduated_college_but_still_not_sure_about_what_i/,"I know this is probably a common question. But, I‚Äôm 24 and I graduated from college in December 2021, with a degree in computer information systems. From January until May, I was aggressively job searching and was doing DoorDash just make some type of money. But, then I finally got a job in mid May, as I‚Äôm a customer service representative at a small-mid size software company that deals with POS systems for restaurants, retail stores, etc. 

Currently I make only $14/hr. I know it‚Äôs low for a college graduate, but I didn‚Äôt really have much options as my resume features 2 minimum wage summer jobs and an unpaid IT internship. Plus, I was just tired of barely having money to pay for certain things and have to depend on my parents for every single thing. Also my 90 day review is coming up, so I‚Äôll be eligible for a raise and also benefits as well.

So far, the job is decent. For right now I‚Äôm just grateful to have more money, have the ability to finally start building credit, being able to pay student loans, and also just having some type of routine. But, I know the inevitable question is, what‚Äôs next? I know this job is not long term, as I plan to probably stay for a year, and I‚Äôm going to have to strive for something better and that pays more, but the thing is that I don‚Äôt know what I actually want to do. 

While I was job searching, I was applying to a lot of help desk/technical support jobs, thinking since I majored in computer information systems, I can try to break into IT. I‚Äôve been flirting with IT for like the past 2-3 years, since during school I did a lot of programming and I didn‚Äôt really enjoy it and have much interest in it, so I figured IT would be a great alternative. But, lately I‚Äôve been honest with myself. I‚Äôm not super into technology. I find it cool every once in a while, but I‚Äôm not exactly passionate about it. Also, my current job basically confirmed that I don‚Äôt really like talking on the phone with customers as it just feels awkward (especially since it‚Äôs an open office and everyone is just sitting around you). At my current position, I don‚Äôt have to make too many phone calls, but the technical support team takes most of the calls and have to help customers with things over the phone and sometimes the interactions don‚Äôt seem pleasant. I bring that up because the manager and the lead techs have hinted about me potentially moving to technical support, and I‚Äôve been kind of hesitant about moving forward with that. 

To describe myself, I‚Äôm quiet, reserved, and introverted. I actually feel like when it comes to customers, I would be better in person cause I feel way more comfortable talking to people when I can physically see them. Due to my major, I would prefer to stay in the technology/business field, so I‚Äôve thought about a job dealing with database management for example, as I find it interesting and I like keeping things organized. But, once again I still not sure.

Any recommendations? I know I‚Äôm still young, but I would like to have some type of direction on what I want to do once I eventually move on from my current job.

TL;DR: I graduated from college with a degree in Computer information systems, but I‚Äôm still not really sure what I want to do. I would like to have some type of direction when I move on from my current job."

wiyyyh,4,2022-08-08,Can I get some tips for people who have been through a similar situation to what I'm about to endure for the next semester?,guzzo9000,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wiyyyh/can_i_get_some_tips_for_people_who_have_been/,"Hello!

Next semester is my final semester, and I have a massive work load. I have 14 hours, 6 of which are graduate level courses, a massive senior design project which will eat up a lot of time, a 20 hours/week internship, hundreds of full time jobs that I intend on applying for, and a robotics team that I am an officer for.  


I am terrified because I am not sure how I can handle all of this. And it feels like most of my responsibilities are necessary. The classes and senior design project are actually a requirement for graduation. The internship is practically a requirement because I need experience in the field that I am pursuing since I am graduating so soon. I obviously need to apply for full time jobs since I am graduating soon. The only responsibility that I have that technically isn't a requirement is the robotics team that I'm a part of, but half of the officers had to leave, and I am heavily invested in the project that we're working on, both financially and technically.   


So, though I am aware that I might have too many responsibilities, I feel like I can't give any of them up. Well, it's really a matter of whether I am willing to give up the robotics thing, but I really do not want to. I guess I'll just have to get started with the entire workload, and I need to reserve the right to either leave the robotics team, or resign as an officer and start contributing much less (which would suck for the team since I am one of the big contributors).   


Here is my plan:   
I plan on planning my weeks out, allocating time for various activities on an hourly basis. I feel like if I am to succeed with this, I'll need to be very meticulous with my time management. I also plan on allocating 6 hours a day for Saturday/Sunday to mainly do work. I've heard of engineers who literally work 50-60 hours a week, and they're not absolutely dying. This is just a temporary thing, less than half a year, where I will be absolutely swamped with work. I will probably be burnt out by the end of the semester, but I plan on spending a few weeks during winter to rest and recuperate, and I will hopefully start working fulltime in January. I also intend on trying to keep my mental/physical health in check by getting 8+ hours of sleep and eating healthy, but I have a history of putting my health on the back burner during difficult times, so who knows what will happen.   


Does anyone have any tips? Perhaps some words of encouragement? Maybe a reality check?"

wj11vv,0,2022-08-08,Is it very bad for your code optimization to be dependent on the compiler?,Agile_Someone,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/wj11vv/is_it_very_bad_for_your_code_optimization_to_be/,"I'm a software engineer intern, and I am working for a database company where performance is critical. Because of that, I try to optimize my code as much as possible. 

However, I am not sure which optimizations are necessary and which ones are not. For example, I wrote a part of the algorithm using tail recursion, but I ended up switching to a while loop because google searches told me that compilers may not always optimize tail recursion in C++.

If I know that our current compiler will turn it to a while, is it acceptable to just use recursion since currently there isn't a difference? I understand that it is possible for us to switch to a new compiler some time in the future, but I'm guessing they will always be better? and not becoming worse as we upgrade.

Thanks!"
wj1p20,2,2022-08-08,[IWantOut] 19M USA -&gt; UK,TheMusketDood,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/wj1p20/iwantout_19m_usa_uk/,"Hello everyone, been thinking for a while how to make this post so I will try to format it the best I can.

My Current Situation: I am an American college student currently double majoring in Political Science and Criminal Justice with a minor in Urban Planning about to enter their 3rd year at a relatively well known school in my state. I majored in what I majored in because I had every intention of immediately going to law school upon graduating from undergrad. Recently, however, I had the opportunity to study abroad at Lancaster University in England for 6 months and it sounds a bit clich√© but it changed my perspective entirely. The UK isn't perfect but I could not help but fall in love with it while simultaneously seeing numerous problems continue to develop and fester here in the US. I'll have a minute to think about it but I believe I've made up my mind that I want to go back.

Visa options: As a non-starter I am going to need to finish my current degree before I do anything so it will be a minimum of two years. From my research I have figured my best option is to go to a UK university for grad school on a student visa for a year, get the two year grad visa and then try to find an employer who will sponsor a work visa for me to stay for five more years until I could get ILR. Other than that my only hope would seem to be that I would fall in love with a nice British lass who I could marry and stay on a spouse visa.

Education: As far as a skilled worker pathway goes I my outlook has its ups and downs. Of course only having a degree in the humanities will not really do for a work sponsorship so I am planning that whatever masters degree I get can put me on track. I would be open to literally any degree whether it be a conversion course or not but so far I have mainly considered management, consulting, and town planning degrees, really any program with good internship connections. With regards to what school exactly, as of this moment I have a perfect GPA, am an honors student, and am planning to do multiple internships with various legal and public policy firms before I graduate undergrad. I would hope that my experiences and academic performance would allow me to get into a respected UK university. My current list of places to apply are Cambridge, St Andrews, University of Manchester, University of Edinburgh, Cardiff University and Lancaster University. Again my main concern would be whichever school and degree would provide me with the highest chance to stay in the UK after graduation.


Financials: I have been very lucky with aid from the government, my school, and other sources that is going to allow me to graduate from college completely debt-free. I expect to have about $20,000 in savings by the time I graduate. I understand that international fees in the UK are nothing to sneeze at but looking at them and my other options for if I stayed in the US, they would literally be the same price anyways. 20k still would not be enough so I would probably seek to take out 10-15k in US federal loans to make sure I could pay for rent and other living expenses. Another point that goes back to my previous paragraph is because I studied abroad at Lancaster, I would be eligible for a 20% discount on my tuition if I chose to do my graduate program there.

Other considerations: I would also consider strongly living in Manchester because quite a few of the people I met while studying abroad live there and I think it would be nice to have some sort of personal network when starting to live in the UK.


So, that's all I have for now. I understand that I still have two years (or one and a half really before I start applying to graduate programs) but I am a long-term plan kind of person and immigrating is something that is definitely not a spur of the moment thing to do. So any comments would be appreciated. Anything I missed about the process? Recommendations on schools, degrees, advice for starting a career in the UK? Anything else I can do over the next two years to help my chances of making this dream into a reality?

wj1v2v,1,2022-08-08,How to deliver not so good news,EqualizerMc2,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wj1v2v/how_to_deliver_not_so_good_news/,"Okay so...

How do I tell my friend he cannot move in with me? This all started about 2 months ago when my friend asked me to cosign a home loan for him. I said I'd think about it and at the time I was living with my mom and I'm in a relationship with my girlfriend, and she has a dog (precontext).

After giving it some thought, I thought I'd talk to my family friend who is a lender and he said the only way to know is to get prequalified. So I did, I qualified for a loan for 460k and this was more than enough to get a loan for myself as well as cosign for him he was only approved for 280k. But there's no way in hell I'd ever cosign a loan that big for anyone besides my children (which I don't have). I told him this and he was very upset

Long story short he never qualified, and the timeframe slipped out of his hands because of tax issues he's had. I myself closed on the two-bedroom two-bathroom house by the skin on my teeth, closing, appraisal issues, and inspection where a hassle, I bought a fixer upper but it all worked out. Theres A bunch of work to do.

The first day I got my keys he asked me if he could move in I said sure why not but you'll need to pay for all utilities plus 400 for the room and wait as well as help me finish renovations, I haven't even opened the door to the house and he and his girlfriend where packed and ready to go they've been living at their apartment day to day lease out of boxes for the past month.

When we first arrived at the house the home was fully furnished, with the old ladies stuff (she left EVERYTHING), he helped me move all the stuff into the garage and insisted on ripping out the carpet, and wallpaper, I thought this would be a good idea to make the place a little more comfortable since the home is a 1980s original and stuff was really dusty and could use some new paint and flooring.

Ive been busting my ass on my weekends while working 50 hour weeks and all my friend and his girlfriend have done was help us move the old owners stuff to the garage and rip out the carpet, I myself painted the ceiling, mudded the walls hauled all the trash to the dump, bought all the materials, and I've still got a bunch of work to do on the subfloor, as well as prime and paint the entire house and install flooring and trim. The list goes on....

At this point I'm sort of tired of the guy telling me that I'm taking too long to finish these renovations he told me not to ""bullshit"" him and give him a date so he could move in. This really grinded my gears, the guy is getting a steal deal 600 a month renting a room from me, I'm also never home so hes going to be enjoying the home more than I am, while I'm the one paying 3400 a month for the mortgage and he just sits on his ass works when he wants, and smokes weed all day. I keep telling my girlfriend that I don't want him to move in and then changing my mind because hes been a decent friend to me for the past 6 years.

The reason why I ask is because I'm fed up, I've been doing so much work and he comes and acts like he puts in so much effort when he only came and helped for two days to rip out some carpet. I've been asking for his help to do some floor framing work (rip out a section of 15-foot 2x10s with particle board) I hurt my back using a crowbar and my girl is only 5'1 and can't help because of her stature, funny thing is I asked him to come out and help me yesterday and he said he was going to be busy working and yet I saw a social media post of him on a boat with his girlfriend today (NOT WORKING).

At this point I feel like I'm just ranting, there's more work to be done, and I'm going to ask a contractor to come out and help since I can't do this alone, there's some plumbing work to be done as well and I don't feel comfortable doing it myself. I told my friend I'd have everything ready by the end of this month, but it's probably going to take longer. I don't want him to live with me since he really showed me his true colors this past month. Me and my girl are going to stay with our parents and continue to put in the work so we can move in when we are ready and enjoy the fruits of our labor. As for his situation, IDK what to tell him.

thanks guys and girls.

Ps he is a tile installer and convinced me to do all of these renovations I was dumb enough to believe he'd help me, his girlfriend doesn't even work and just sits home all day while my girlfriend works two jobs and is pursuing nursing, I work in a microscopy clean room myself. They aren't bad people I'm just confused as to why I feel bad, I do want the privacy now that I think about it. I also do not want anybody to be liable for damages caused to my home, and they hate dogs and my girlfriend's dog is very affectionate and does not like to be alone I don't want them to lock him in the garage which I do see them doing. Hes very anxious and has special needs (hes a mini aussie).

Lastly, one of the main reasons why I decided to get the home loan was because we made a deal, he would come work at my company as an intern and I'd give him cheap rent since he had been begging me to get him a job and would start at 18 an hour (process tech 1), I got him an interview as well as a fulltime position and he flaked on us! Can you believe it? I started here 3 years ago at the same position, I'm now a process technician 3 making 40 an hour and he didn't have the balls to come join us. He passed on a once in a lifetime opportunity at my boss' startup company."

(Will be undertaking my paid intern year at 23. However as I near the end of my degree I can see myself eventually switching careers within 5 years of the job. I understand the idea of do what you want while you enjoy it, and there are aspects of pharmacy that I do enjoy however I want to move onto something better paying/more fulfilling with the potential of remote work if possible as I get older. However due to either personality (or possibly undiagnosed ADHD) I am constantly wanting to change careers and persue new passions. I suppose I would like some advice on my areas of interest and whether they should be worth considering now or later in life


Medicine, this one of my stronger considerations however it's very difficult to get into, not to mention the long years spent studying (4 years post grad) plus specialising and whether or not in intellectually capable enough

Areas in computer science/software engineering/cyber security

This has been a new area for me and is something I'll definitely try and persue (started a few free courses including cs50). I know some bootcamps/grad certs in Australia respected prior uni degrees, but I don't know if this is enough to land a job. And I don't necessarily pride myself in problem solving involving maths (but can be worked on). Would love to hear more about this field and how to land a job in Australia and what certs/diploma/degrees to persue to get a job as soon as possible.

Accounting
I have the option to go for a 2 year masters of professional accounting after graduating but this is more of a responsible backup option hence am not super passionate about it. I do like the security/room for promotion, aswell as working conditions but understand it can also be quite demanding

Police
My original plan after getting sick of pharmacy. The police force in Australia is great for work/time off and is something I've wanted to do for a while. However I understand the downfalls of the job and why I should consider it as a back up for my own sake.

Physiotherapy
Ideally what I wanted to do instead of pharmacy, but lacked the grades out of highschool. I'm very sports/club orientated and this job would have suited me . But unfortunately the master degree isn't available to me due to lack of prerequisite subjects. My only option would to be to start the 4 year bachelor's degree from beginning.

Last year I graduated in the studies System &amp; Network Engineering at my college.  
During my studies I did an internship at an MSP where I mostly did helpdesk for about 8 months.   


Now since I have graduated I have gotten a full time 40 hour job at a local company as a Junior Sysadmin / Helpdesk.   


The last months I have learnt a lot about DHCP, Windows Server, DNS, Cisco networking and many other things.   


The problem is now that since I have optimised most of the things everyhting is running smooth.   
So the only tasks I have to do now are helping end users and deploying new laptops for people which is boring for me.  I always complete my tasks in less than 2 hours so the rest of the day I almost always have nothing to do....  


I try to use all this spare time to learn as much stuff about things I don't know like linux server administration but If i'm not using this knowledge it's annoying for me.   


I really want to switch jobs and find something more challenging so I can use my skills more but my parents are againsts this since i'm only working at this company for about 10 months and I still live at home at the moment. 

Is it wise to leave you're first job after almost 1 year or will it look bad at my resume? 

Do you guys have any advice on what to do?

wja3yz,1,2022-08-08,Dilemma - MNC vs Startup?,kx_01,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/wja3yz/dilemma_mnc_vs_startup/,"Hello everyone,

I'm a 21 years old university ( Computer Science ) student and in a month, the last year of university will have started. I am currently doing my internship in an MNC. Things are going great, tasks are being completed without much help needed, I completed my first sprint ever and I presented my work to the Product Managers etc.

They want to keep me even if I still have a year of studies ( full-time ). It's a safe, secure job that provides me a salary around 20% more than the base salary here in Greece, which will also be increased every 6 months since they have this thing that is called evaluation. If you're doing great, you will have a raise, if you're doing awesome you will be promoted.

Yesterday, someone reached out to me. He said that he had talked with one of my university teachers about his startup.. he asked my teacher whether or not he had someone to recommend joining the startup. As you can understand, my teacher recommended me ( They know each other for a very long time ).

Eventually, we met. We did 2 meetings, one to get to know each other and a second one to talk about business stuff only. He proposed this:

""Do not continue on with the MNC. Join us! "" ( for 40% more than the base salary, although to be honest, I don't care that much about the money.. I just want to improve as a developer ).

""I believe you're a talent, a very smart person, and curious in a good way. You will learn about product development, processes, marketing, etc and by January when we do this funding thing ( I don't remember the actual terminology ), you will get a raise, be promoted, and also have a 5% of the company's earnings.""

I don't want to be tiring so let me just tell you that this guy has an insane background. Unfortunately, I'm not able to say anything about it. In addition, he is the Founder of the company and he also has 2 co-founders that are helping him.

My only concern is that on the first day of my internship at that MNC, their first question was literally whether or not I am interested in continuing on after the internship finishes, supposing I'm good enough. Well, I had said yes.. and I feel bad now because this seems like an amazing opportunity.

In conclusion, I actually believe the startup's idea is great and has great potential but that's just me. Last but not least, both jobs are remote so no relocation or anything like that.

What would you do if you were me?

Thanks everyone in advance for going through that huge text. I have around 7 days left to give him an answer."

It took me seven years to get my degree. I had to start off by taking pre-calc and trig so I was already behind the curve. I was never strong at math. I struggled with all the calculus, physics, etc. that was thrown to me during the first few years, acquiring C‚Äôs. 

Moving forward I studied abroad in Santander, Spain in 2018. It was the best experience of my life and to this day I have many friends in South America and Europe. I highly suggest all students to do so. It is not as expensive nor difficult as you might think.

Furthermore, the next year I joined the National Guard to avoid getting into debt and have them pay for all my schooling. I took a year off and became a Combat Medic to add something significant on my resume. 

I was nearing the end of my degree but was in danger of being disqualified for both failed and repeated course attempts. I failed a course the third time and was disqualified for one year. I was devastated. 

However, I snapped out of it. I decided to use my time wisely and seize the opportunity. I acquired three internships for each semester off that year. HNTB (drainage), Whiting-Turner (Tron Rollercoaster at Magic Kingdom), and Terracon (Geotechnical and Environmental)

I returned to UCF with a renewed sense of learning and time management. I finished my last three courses with no room for failure. 

If at one point you felt like me when I was disqualified, or in the danger of, let me tell
you this. 

That year off can be such a great opportunity. UCF has this policy for a reason. They know students who truly want to succeed will use that time wisely and come back with full force. 

They persist, no matter the circumstance, and for that very same reason truly deserve their degree. Do not give up, keep your chin up, and use your time wisely.  Engineering is not about smarts as much as it is about perseverance and dedication."

I'm entering my final semester of undergrad Molecular Biology. To graduate, I have to either write a thesis or do an internship. I want to gain work experience, so I'd been cold emailing professors to ask if I could work/volunteer at their labs.

Out of the 2 professors that replied so far, one has asked for my transcript and I feel like I'm screwed because of my 2.46 (out of 4) GPA. It's gone on a downward trend since the pandemic started, and most failing courses that have contributed to this are, unfortunately, bio courses.

I've done much better in other courses (particularly neuroscience &amp; psychology ones, which this professor's research touches on), and I've done decently in the lab components of my bio courses nonetheless. I know I work hard but I screwed myself over for bio exams, and my grades tanked mostly because I couldn't keep my mental health afloat to focus unless I was away from home and interacting with my classmates. I do well when classes are face to face.

These are my reasons, but I don't wish to come off as making excuses (of which I seem to have many, unfortunately). Nonetheless, the professor asked for my transcript, I'm prepared for a rejection once I give him my copy, but I still want to explain my situation but am at a loss for how to do so.

Is there *something* I can do to salvage this? How can I best explain my situation? Has anyone else had to go through anything similar? Help is urgent and appreciated.


**TLDR: cold emailed professor as undergrad to volunteer at their lab. They asked for my transcript, I have a 2.46 (out of 4) GPA. I'm screwed but want to explain my situation as best as I can anyway.**"

wjgi3l,2,2022-08-08,Should I switch my major at this point?,wakawakahoopla,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/wjgi3l/should_i_switch_my_major_at_this_point/,"I'm in a pretty interesting situation right now. I'm in contact with my counselors and stuff to help me make a decision but I figured I'd ask here for advice. I'm currently a rising junior in college and I'm studying marketing and I just added a minor in CS. 

However, I'm realizing that I don't really want to work in marketing after college. I have some coding experience, although it's limited, and the coding I've learned in the past I've picked up pretty quickly. Would it be worth it to switch my major entirely to CS even though I would probably not graduate in 4 years? Or would it also be possible to roll with my business major and CS minor and get a CS related internship out of college?

 I had an IT internship in high school and I'm currently an IT Tech for my summer job so I have the work experience as a foundation. I'm just not sure if it would even be possible to get a real internship without having a true CS major? Any comments or help would be greatly appreciated!"
wjh7h0,3,2022-08-08,"What jobs am I currently making myself marketable for, given the changing stack at my current role?",curmudgeono,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wjh7h0/what_jobs_am_i_currently_making_myself_marketable/,"**JS -&gt; Python**

The tasks I'm taking on at work are in a completely new stack, and generally have a different programming approach / ecosystem from my previous work.

So I'm a 2019 graduate, with two years of fulltime full stack web development experience, excluding internships (React + NodeJS)

Before my current job my career looked like this: 1 year at an e-commerce company, and one year of freelancing (4 months on nft project, 4 months on healthcare app, 4 months on various smaller projects)

My previous jobs I mostly did Frontend with React + Redux + NodeJS, and NodeJS on the backend for build tooling / API dev. I knew the roles I was fit for &amp; what my general options were in the market, and how to describe myself as a developer. (Fullstack Web Developer)

So my new job is for a startup which initially hired me to work on their NodeJS + Vue web app, specifically on the webGL / ThreeJS scene they were working on. ( I took this job to expand my skills in web-based 3D graphics )  For 6 months, I continued to work with this stack, but for the past few months, I've switched onto working on a native Python 3D application. I kind of enjoy this work, and think I may want to continue leveling up my skills in this job. However, I'm not sure what sort of other roles / industries / types of tech teams I could use the stack that I'm using, and apply the concepts that I'm learning.

I write pretty much everything now in Python, and use the following libs:

I'm using a lot of numpy [https://numpy.org/](https://numpy.org/) for processing large amounts of point data, and for generally optimizing / unfurling for loops into a format which can be compiled to faster code, using numba [http://numba.pydata.org/](http://numba.pydata.org/). I also often use some built in pylib imports like concurrent  [https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrency.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrency.html) for making things parallel, and python wrapped imgui [https://github.com/ocornut/imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for ui / interactivity.  I also use anaconda to manage libs, not that this likely matters much lol.

Concept wise: I do a lot of geometry processing, differential calculus, and linear algbra.

TLDR: What sort of jobs am I preparing myself to apply for after a few years of experience like this?"

If I'm doing a Math major, would doing a few info science classes help land me an internship for a data analyst position? I have a lot of certificates from Dataquest on Python, data cleaning, etc., but I'm not sure how much that matters to potential employers and I'm worried about not finding work.

I'm also a junior, but I've actually been working on my undergrad for several years longer than average. I want to get out of school w/out adding more time to being @ UMD, so changing my major this late isn't an option that I want to consider."

I understand that companies typically have their applications close many months before the internship is scheduled to take place which is why I am working towards getting the internships this early. I plan on attending career fairs - both school hosted ones and ones hosted by other organizations - in order to network and reach companies that have internship opportunities for undergrads in computer science. I would like advice on other ways to do this, so I can apply for internships at more companies as I have been advised to do. Do I just search up companies that have internship roles that I am align with what I am looking for? Are there effective, less arbitrary ways to find internships to apply for? Any other advice that you think can help with the getting an internship would be appreciated - advice like what tech related knowledge I should have in order to get software engineering internships."

Just spoke with my manager/HR and it seems that they just take a list of current interns who want to comeback the following year and in mid spring check their intern positions and reach out to those who did well in similar positions.

wjj1fe,112,2022-08-08,What are some career paths that involve coming up with algorithms and optimizations?,devor110,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wjj1fe/what_are_some_career_paths_that_involve_coming_up/,"During all my time programming those two have been my main interests and motivators. Encountering a problem, coming up with an algorithm to solve it, running into trouble, working it out on paper, and once it works, optimizing it.   
  
I'm on my first job as a backend developer (java) to some banking application, and I've been doing it for around half a year. So far I have not had to think of such an algorithm even once, which is to be expected in the future too since banking processes aren't particularly complex, or already have established solutions. This genuinely makes me quite disinterested, unmotivated and unfulfilled in my job which usually just involves making an API to store or show data.  
  
So this makes me wonder, what are career options that involve more algorithmic thinking? Is a CS bachelors good enough to get hired in these fields? Does game development involve what I'm looking for?  
  
P.S: Don't really care about pay, I'm currently making around 800ish euros a month as an intern in Hungary, so it surely can't be much worse than that."

I have had a total of 1 year's experience working at 2 different government contractors, as a software developer intern.

However, I don't wish to continue working in government contracting, due to the pressure to get a clearance. (I don't want to get a clearance for various reasons, but that's not the main topic here.).

Here's my question: given my 2 contractor jobs, plus my [GitHub](https://github.com/nicholaskross), how likely is it that I can get a software job *outside* of the government-contractor-clearance-verse? Is the switch going to be hard? Are there specific things I should do on my resume/LinkedIn/etc. to make the switch easier? I know there'll be a culture difference between the job types, I mean specifically getting hired.

Both contractors would likely recommend me to another company, even for a non-government-related job.

(Related: At the contractor I did the best work at, and worked the longest for, I was doing WFH. How hard will it be to get a non-contractor job that is also WFH or hybrid? Relative to the difficulty of the main switch.)

EDIT because I just realized it could be relevant: I don't get contacted much by recruiters on LinkedIn. Some of this was likely due to weird location/privacy settings, but a lot of it probably... not-that."

wjjwl3,1,2022-08-08,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (8/8/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/wjjwl3/weekly_job_qa_thread_882022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 126th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

wjln3d,5,2022-08-08,Why am I getting no output in my SDA line measured with a logic analyzer but still getting print output on the consol,dcfan105,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/wjln3d/why_am_i_getting_no_output_in_my_sda_line/,"So I'm trying to debug code that has an MCU read acceleration data from an accelerometer, via I2C.  My print outputs is showing the acceleration as 0 on all 3 axes, which is obviously wrong, which means there must be something wrong with the code, but I don't have a good idea of where to do start looking for the bug, so I hooked up a logic analyzer to the board so I could see the register reads and writes and check if any of them weren't what I expected.

Problem is, I'm not getting any output from the SDA line at all and I'm very confused why.  I'm confident I have the correct pin on the logic analyzer connected to correct pin on the board and the connections are firm.  

I'm thinking there must be something wrong with my calls to the library I2C function, but if there were, it should've return an error and never gotten to the point of printing -- I've got a TON of built in error checking and input validation in this code (mostly hidden in helper functions so as not to harm readability).  Plus, when I step through the code, the library function indicates it completed the I2C transfer.  I suppose there could be something wrong with the library function, especially as it's a 3rd party library (Silicon Labs), but that seems unlikely.  

So I'm just very confused here and I don't know what to even try to figure this out.  Why am I getting conflicting results from the function output via the debugger (i.e. that the data transfer was completed) and the logic analyzer (i.e. no SDA output at all)?

If it helps, the MCU is the EFR32MG24 from Silicon Labs, the accelerometer is the iis2dplc from SI, and this is the silabs library we're using: https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk 
I'm not really sure how to navigate the boatload of stuff they've got in that repository (it was already all set up in the project prior to my working on this one small piece; I'm an intern), so here are also some examples that are sort of similar to the functions in the library files in our project: https://github.com/SiliconLabs/peripheral_examples/tree/master/series1/i2c/i2c/src 

Unfortunately, I can't share actual code from our project or might get in trouble."

I did a summer internship (IT) which is probably the only relevant experience I have and it's not even CS-oriented, besides that I've got no real concrete evidence of skill.

My programming knowledge is mostly core Java/Python/C but I've made no real large projects besides some OOP based stuff and stuff like tic tac toe. I've also made a Spring Boot and Django project, but both are insanely barebones CRUD since they were basically my first non-core projects and look like garbage.

I guess I just wanna know is how important are large projects to getting attention for interviews and how much longer should I spend building my resume before starting to send out apps. Basically trying to find the sweet spot between having time to make better projects, and not waiting too long and missing out on prime time for apps.

Appreciate any advice."

My situation is that I have graduated with a degree in computer science, but don't have any real internship or work experience (I made a website for my old chinese school, and I have a lot of personal projects on my github but that's about it)

It seems many internships want you to still be a student (they'll specify ""graduating 2023 or later"" etc.), and any full time position wants 2++++++ years of experience, even for entry level roles. (some roles want you to be a current student with 2 years experience but I digress)

Are there any jobs that will accept someone with a degree and only personal projects for experience?

Is it ok to apply to internship roles that want currently enrolled students even though I've graduated? 

Am I basically screwed because I graduated college before getting internship experience?

wjn6h6,3,2022-08-08,Tips for keeping your energy levels up throughout the work day?,taytay10133,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/wjn6h6/tips_for_keeping_your_energy_levels_up_throughout/,"I have been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD and I take 10mg IR adderall twice a day (once in the morning and once in the afternoon). I am moving to NYC for a new job and will be working 8am-6pm. I have never worked such long hours and am nervous that my energy will be depleted by 3pm (as per usual for me). 

Things I currently do: 

-In bed by 10:30 at the latest. I am VERY diligent about getting enough sleep and make sacrifices in order to ensure I do. 

- drink a ton of water, probably more than is recommended. I‚Äôve recently started drinking propels so I get some electrolytes and hopefully stop peeing clear every 30 minutes. 

- Weight lift 5-6 days a week. My sessions are usually around 30-45 minutes and are done at varying times in the time (I don‚Äôt know if I will have an official break for this new job so I am planning on having to lift either early mornings or after work). 

- Take fish oil, vitamin d, vitamin c (in evening), zinc, and iron supplements daily. 

- eat healthy; I eat a lot of rice, chicken, roasted vegetables, raw vegetable salads with chicken/Turkey, bananas with peanut butter, avocados, eggs. 

- I try and go on multiple walks a day, outside in the sun. I am unsure if I will have that flexibility with this new job. 

- cold shower in morning and hot bath in evening. 

-10 minutes of intense cardio in morning (if I don‚Äôt lift that day). I used to do this every day but I‚Äôve gotten out of the habit as it is unbearably hot where I live and it‚Äôs a hassle to go to the gym for 10 minutes. 

- Very low carb lunch. Usually a salad with protein. I admittedly skip breakfast most days although I didn‚Äôt when I was working at my internship. I would have a Dave‚Äôs protein bagel with peanut butter and a banana. I would also add some form of vegetable because I am weird and can eat whatever at any time of the day. 

Despite these habits, I usually still have an intense brain fog around 3-4pm and unless I nap, it‚Äôs hard to shake it. I don‚Äôt want to be a zombie at work for the last few hours. Any tips appreciated!"

Ever since I‚Äôve discovered this sub, I have been waiting in anticipation to make a college decisions post of my own‚Äîand the time has finally arrived! Being a first-gen college student, my parents, nor I for that matter, didn‚Äôt know the first thing about applying to college. Subs like these have been instrumental in guiding me through this process, so I am ecstatic about being able to give back (if you have any questions or want me to elaborate on anything, feel free to DM me). This post will be filled with witticisms, hot takes, and plenty of advice, so enjoy!

**Demographics**

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: Half White (Irish), Half Hispanic (Mexican) - Irish last name, tho
* Residence: Big Midwestern City
* Income Bracket: Applied for aid, didn‚Äôt receive any
* Type of School: Private Catholic
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): First-gen, Partial URM

Thoughts: All things considered, I‚Äòm pretty privileged. I have never dealt with poverty, a broken family, or health issues. Some people like myself are born on third base, but I always keep this quote by Goethe in my mind to help remind me what I must do: ‚ÄúWhat you have inherited from your parents, earn over again for yourselves or it will not be yours.‚Äù

**Intended Major(s)**: (For most schools) 1. Philosophy 2. Economics | (For UPenn, Illinois, and ND) Business/Finance

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 3.99/4.47
* Rank (or percentile): We don‚Äôt rank but likely \~t10/350
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 2 honors freshman year, 2 honors 1 AP sophomore year, 4 APs junior year
* Senior Year Course Load: AP English Lit, AP Spanish Lit, AP European History, AP Physics 1, Multivariable Calc, Religion 4

**Standardized Testing**

* SAT I: 1510 (740RW, 770M)
* ACT: Too fast
* AP/IB: Submitted - BC Calc (4 with 5 AB Subscore), AP Spanish Lang (5), AP Macroeconomics (5) Did not submit - AP US History (3), AP Chemistry (3)

Thoughts: Ahh ‚Äústats,‚Äù how we needlessly fret over these numbers‚Äîand I can‚Äôt say that I haven‚Äôt done so either. But remember:

‚ÄúThere is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.‚Äù Epictetus

In other words, control the things you can control, but if something is out of your power, let it go because it won‚Äôt do you any good worrying about it. Yes, work hard to get good grades and good test scores, but ultimately they are just a check in the box; what college admissions officers are really interested in is who you are.

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. Started English tutoring program at our school for Hispanic adults
2. Cross country co-captain, four year varsity athlete, all-conference, all-regional, all-sectional, and x2 state qualifier
3. Varsity indoor/outdoor track and field
4. ‚ÄúExtracurricular philosophy research‚Äù (basically me meeting with my ethics teacher to read philosophy books and listening to philosophy lectures on my own)
5. Business and economics club executive board
6. Ethics bowl executive board
7. Spanish Honor Society executive board and National Honor Society member
8. Database developing intern at startup restaurant app

10. Substitute tutor for program serving underprivileged children

Additional info section: wrote about helping my brother with his schoolwork; talked about being accepted into Boys State and Wharton Leadership in the Business World (both were canceled due to Covid); and gave a list of 26 works of philosophy, literature, and history that I read for my ‚Äúextracurricular philosophy research.‚Äù

Thoughts: I spared a lot of details, so if you are interested in hearing more, feel free to DM me. All things considered, my first extracurricular is miles ahead of my others in terms of importance, as it took the better part of the second half of high school to plan it. In general, I‚Äôm a supporter of the tried-and-true aphorism: ‚Äúdo what you love.‚Äù In high school, you get four years to try new things, so find where your curiosity leads you. Maybe you want to challenge yourself by trying to make the world a better place. Start by identifying a problem you want to fix and then go about trying to solve it; you‚Äôll notice that the world is more receptive to young people with ambitious ideas than you may have thought. But even if you fail, you will have at least gained a valuable learning experience, and, as Teddy Roosevelt said, will have at least been ‚Äúthe man \[or woman\] in the arena,‚Äù not ‚Äùthe critic who points out how the strong \[man or woman\] stumbles.‚Äù

**Awards/Honors**

1. National Hispanic Recognition Program Winner and National Merit Commended Scholar
2. Winner of a state-wide fatherhood essay contest
3. All-academic athlete for our conference
4. AP Scholar with Distinction
5. Nominated x2 for student of the year

Thoughts: as you can see, my awards are, comparatively, sparse, but that‚Äôs okay. Not every part of your application needs to blow your admission reader away. It‚Äôs the overall impression that you make that matters.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(I didn‚Äôt read them)

Ethics teacher (11/10): My ethics teacher was not only the best teacher I ever had, but a mentor figure and role model. We first met my junior year, and by his sheer eloquence during his lectures, I knew that I needed learn more about philosophy. Soon, we would begin to meet outside of class a couple of times a week for about an hour at a time to discuss landmark books. I had some of the best conversations of my life with my teacher‚Äîdiscussing the nature of truth, love, and beauty. On top of that, I would go up to his classroom after school and just talk about life. Lastly, without his guidance, my plans for my English tutoring program would have most likely never come to fruition.

Spanish teacher (9/10): I had her for two years, and she was a terrific teacher. During my freshman year, I was easily the worst native speaker in our Spanish Heritage class. I was even afraid that I would be kicked out. However, I made it through by studying Spanish on my own and attempting to put my best foot forward in class. Soon enough, I made it to AP Spanish my junior year and ended up doing really well in the class. Also, my Spanish teacher was the moderator of the Spanish Honor Society and became a moderator for my English tutoring program.

Thoughts: I believe that my rec letters were one of the strongest parts of my application. I had very strong relationships with both my teachers and have no doubt that they did their best to portray me in as positive light as possible. In general, rec letters will be so much stronger if you have not only have an academic but personal relationship with your teachers. Make an attempt to get to know some of the teachers you like because from experience, they have a lot to offer.

**Interviews**

Harvard (8.5/10): My interviewer was a really interesting guy who actually worked with Lin Manuel Miranda. I felt like we had an open and candid coversation. He seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say, which made our discussion flow well. I was also prepared with a bunch of unique Harvard questions that hopefully helped convince him that I wasn‚Äôt only in it for the name.

University of Pennsylvania (6.5/10): This was a pretty odd interview. At our first scheduled time, he didn‚Äôt show up (I had a feeling he forgot). During our conversation, he seemed particularly interested in my stats and academics, even asking for my SAT score. He wasn‚Äôt a mean guy or anything, but I just think he had a misconceived view of the college admissions process.

Yale (8.75/10): There were a lot of highs and lows in this conversation, but I was praying that the good moments would outshine the bad. As for one of my low moments, I ended up forgetting in which city and state Yale was located, so in a last ditch effort, I ended up saying ‚ÄúYale surrounding area‚Äù instead of New Haven. For my high moments, I made my interviewer pause for a good five seconds after an insightful response and even made her teary-eyed when I was relating my relationship with my mother.

Stanford: not offered

Thoughts: interviews actually aren‚Äôt weighted super highly in the admissions process. In my opinion, if your interview is not bad, then it‚Äôs probably good enough. That being said, admissions readers do spend a lot of time reading your interviewer‚Äôs write up, so to the extent that it aligns with how you portrayed yourself in your application, it will bolster your image. On a last note, I know it‚Äôs easy to say this, but try not to get too nervous. You‚Äôre interviewers (for the most part) are volunteers who are rooting for you; prepare some questions in advance and try to facilitate an engaging dialogue.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Personal statement (9/10): I spent way too long on this, but I had been struggling to find the right words for the story I was trying relate. I knew that I needed to write about teaching my mother English and the start of my English tutoring program. After about 5+ drafts, I finally came up with the words to encapsulate my experience, and I am content with how it turned out.

UChicago Sups: (8.5/10): Took some risks while writing these, but with acceptance rates as low as they are nowadays, if you don‚Äôt stand out among the crowd, your application is going in the rejection pile. For my uncommon essay, I wrote stepping in goose poop, proposing a goose culling in my macroeconomics class, and ended with a discussion of goose ethics.

Notre Dame sups (7.5/10): These were pretty solid. I wrote about my philosophy journal and heavy metal.

Illinois sups (5/10): Not my greatest work, but I knew that I didn‚Äôt need to write a masterpiece. Wrote about my experience with economics, how I wanted to bring ethics into business, and my passion for philosophy

Harvard sups (3/10): I‚Äôm not going to lie; I was pretty lazy with these one because I didn‚Äôt think I had much of a shot. For the main essay, I recycled my UChicago uncommon essay, and for the extracurricular response, I recycled a shortened version of one of my Yale essays.

UPenn (7/10): I did a majority of these the night before‚Äînot my proudest moment. They turned out fine, but not very polished, and at the end, I was grasping at straws for ideas. I heavily relied on the website to write these, as they were mostly about the school.

Yale sups (10/10): This probably has to be the greatest collection of essays I have ever written. Honestly, I‚Äôm a pretty quirky person, so with each essay I think I was effectively able to reveal a unique facet about myself. I wrote about the Great Recession, my mortality, Abe Lincoln, Socrates, heavy metal, potato tacos, Crime and Punishment, and running.

Stanford Sups (8/10): I recycled a lot of these from my Yale essays, so those ones were pretty solid. The other ones were good but not out of the park. I wrote about nihilism, the Gulag Archipelago, my relationship with my ethics teacher, and tutoring underprivileged children.

Thoughts: To be brutally honest, I would say that a vast majority of college essays are actually pretty bad; they are rife with cliches, use strange diction, contain grammar errors, and have odd syntax‚Äîplus, we are in no way unbiased evaluators of our own writing. I won‚Äôt sugarcoat it: college essay writing is extremely difficult, especially since we are so accustomed to academic, not personal writing. For that reason, in order to write good essays, you need to spend good time with them, not being afraid to press delete when something does not encapsulate you, and come up with a sound process. Strong writing skills take a while to develop, and it almost always entails simply reading a ton; but there are some wonderful online resources to help you avoid errors that I strongly recommend you use:

[WordHippo](https://www.wordhippo.com) is the best thesaurus out there, but I can‚Äôt stress this enough: don‚Äôt use words if you don‚Äôt know full well what they mean and in what situations they are commonly used. It is better to use simple language than to use confusing, out-of-place vocabulary to try to sound smart, which admissions officers can see through like a window pane. [Ludwig](https://ludwig.guru) is the best resource to tell if you are using an idiom, word, or phrase in the right context. It takes clips from eminent newspapers and magazines, so you know you‚Äôre getting high-quality examples.  [QuillBot](https://quillbot.com) should be utilized after you have a essay draft done. It paraphrases your essay, and you can use it to tell if a certain sentence potentially has a better syntactical arrangement or better word choice‚Äîbut do not copy the entire or even most of the paraphrasing because it can often sound worse than the original.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

**Early Action**

*Acceptances:*

* University of Illinois Gies School of Business (10k/year honors presidential scholarship +2k/year in other merit scholarships)
* Notre Dame Mendoza School of Business (automatic semifinalist in 25k/year merit scholarship)
* University of Chicago (15k/year in merit scholarships)

**Regular Decision**

*Acceptances:*

* University of Pennsylvania Wharton School
* **Yale University (via likely letter)**

*Waitlists:*

* Stanford University (didn‚Äôt accept spot)

*Rejections:*

* Harvard University

My strategy: I decided to go the simple early action approach because even though I really liked UChicago, I wanted to leave my options open. And so for early action, I decided to apply to one safety (Illinois), target (ND), and reach (UChicago) school and then tailor my regular decision approach based on who accepted me. In hindsight, even though I think this approach was the best one for me, I probably should have applied to more target schools. Fortunately, after being accepted into UChicago, the only question for me became: which schools would I, if accepted, consider going to over UChicago? And that‚Äôs how I got my final four regular decision schools. The only drawback to this was that I only had two weeks to write my supplemental essays; let‚Äôs just say Christmas Break wasn‚Äôt very much of a break.

Reflections: After winter break, I was already on a high from being accepted into my early action schools, but one chilly day in the middle February, I received an email from my Yale admissions officer asking to connect with me about my application. Perplexed, I scheduled a phone conversation with her for later that day. During it, she gave me the fantastic news that I would be receiving a likely letter from Yale, an early form of acceptance that goes out to top 100-150 most competitive applicants in order to attract them to the school. I was, of course, both shocked and ecstatic. In addition, I was pre-accepted into this program called Directed Studies (humanities lovers should really check it out), which had drawn me to Yale in the first place.

Before receiving my regular decision results, I was pretty much set on Yale with the only school that could potentially change my mind being Harvard. In the end, not only did being rejected from Harvard help ground me from cloud nine, but it made my Yale decision a lot easier. If I was ultra-business-focused, it would have been tough to turn down UPenn Wharton, but even though I envision myself going into the business world, I wanted a more well-rounded and exploratory college experience.

Thank you for still reading if you made it here. My DMs are open, and you are completely free to reach out to me for any questions or advice (note that I‚Äôm not on Reddit much anymore).

I was not able to give focus on my subjects then, and I felt my knowledge is so much behind compared to my batchmates. I did not have company internships too and I worry if my qualifications will meet the opportunities in the tech field. 

I do have the enthusiasm to learn and recently I am into data visualization using SQL, Python, and D3 and cloud technologies. I am planning to fund myself to get a certification especially using GCP, but I don't think I can afford it since my compensation in the BPO industry is the least package and I mostly rely on incentives for extra.

What options do I have if I plan to pursue a career with my degree? What will be my struggles and how should I cope with the intellectual competition?

If I resign now, will there be opportunities accepting my qualifications?"

Is there any BCA/BSc grad on this sub who‚Äôs earning more than 10-15 LPA in his 3 or 4 YOE. If yes, how can I reach that point considering I am currently below the standard WITCH package for Btech guys even after an appraisal.

Please guide me! I feel lost and furiated by this bias between BTech and BCA.

Most of my experience is in C++, although I know C# and Python decently well.

For the last 4 years I've been working online on sites like freelancer or upwork. I have done a few projects worth more than &gt;500 euro, but most projects I have done fall under 100 euro. The only real project I can show off from there is a small 2d physics engine. 

I always read on this sub or others on how some people have 2 internships and how important internships are. I was really lazy in university and didn't even consider it until now, which is my bad. I feel like I'm kinda screwed and I'm worried about being stuck in some dead end job paying 30k / year.

Overall I feel like I have a lot of experience programming; I know from university that I'm a stronger programmer than most people. But I don't know if I have anything to show for it. How good of a job (in terms of salary) can I expect without an internship or impressive portfolio? How valuable is the freelance work experience?

As the title suggests, I have graduated HS in June, and I will be entering a four-year university this month to study Computer Science.

I currently have no work experience. But with a HS diploma and these two certifications, would I be able to score an entry level internship in the Networking/IT field before I enter college. Or is this not possible due to my lack of work experience/not entered college yet."

My college, high school and even middle school grades have consistently been mediocre at best (tbh mediocre is stretching it too lol) and I‚Äôve never really enjoyed the classic ‚Äúcollege lifestyle‚Äù at all. 

When I think about it, the only reasons I‚Äôm still in school are because I only have a year left so it would be stupid to drop out now, I have parental pressure and expectations to get a degree and a lot of entry level jobs require one. In terms of the learning and academic structure of college or something like living the dorm life and going to parties on the weekends, nothing really gets me excited or piques my interest. 

This summer I was able to do my first software development internship and it was so much more chill compared to being in school. I got paid to work instead of paying to do work, I had an amazing work-life balance, was a lot more social and truly valued all the extra free time I had, especially in the evenings, to work out and focus on my hobbies. Though it could get sort of repetitive, for the first time in years, I was truly relaxed, felt a sense of freedom and feel more eager than ever to graduate and get a full time job asap. 

No matter what I‚Äôve tried, I just haven‚Äôt been able to get that same level of satisfaction and enjoyment from being a student and have come to terms that college wasn‚Äôt the best years of my life and I have, in no shape or form, not the slightest bit of aptitude for school and studying (though I still appreciate my  personal growth and experiences from it). 

Curious to hear from people with similar thoughts/experiences about college or anyone already graduated and working, is the post college life really as bad as I hear on the internet‚Äìhaving to pay bills, work 40+ hour weeks and fully adult‚Äìand am I crazy for thinking it may actually be an upgrade?"

From what I gathered, these are really performant and easy to use, to the point you can gain some time one you get used to it. I have never used the Mac OS so is it difficult to transition from one to another? Are they in any way better for DE? Can you launch Power BI on Mac ?

wk5tws,2,2022-08-09,Not sure if I'm depressed or if I'm right,DangerousAnt3078,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/wk5tws/not_sure_if_im_depressed_or_if_im_right/,"Sorry this is long.  Literally my life storry.
Its as much of a rant as it is seeking advice.

Lately (all my life actually, but more so now than ever.)
I've been feelinf like nothing I do matters, that I can't do anything right and that I should just stop trying.

I was extremely competitive as an early teenager.  I was good at a particular sport and I was on the honor roll as well.

I chose to go to a very competitive HS and suddenly I couldn't keep up.  I was the last one chosen to make the team.. but once I was on, I put an extreme amount of effort forward to improving my game, but as a result my grades started to slip and I quickly lost honors.

The next year I handily made the team, but my grades suffered so bad.. not only was I not in honors.. but I was in danger of failing.  

I changed my schedule to be more reflective of what the other athletes were doing and that worked for a while.. then our scrimmage games started.

I was shocked when I did not start or even sub the first game or the second.  I went to ask my coach about it -nicely- and he said to stop being disrespectful.  (Ok?)

The third, forth game went by.. still no playing time.
Then the day of the last scrimmage.. I didn't leave though because I jeard there was a chance that the coach was going to give the rest of the players a chance who hadn't got in.

Several players had seen me doubled over and puking throughout the day.  Some even said go home.  It wasnt until we got to the game that I was told I would be starting.

Even after puking all day.. I kicked ass thr first half of the game.. then suddenly I was taken put half way through.  I was told it was to give the others a chance.. but the other player had already been in at least one other game.  What about me?

Fast forward to the real season and real games.. despite handily making the team the second time around.. and kicking ass during the one and only scrimmage I was put in.. I was made to ride the bench until at least halfway though the season.

Finally toward the end of the season.. toward the end of game.  The coach asked me to go in in the regular season.  

It was one of my worst days ever.  I did horrible.  I was tired that day, I was getting owned by the other team, and I felt the officiating was going against me..  

The coach who hadn't put me in all pre-season and most of the regular season decided to leave me in to finish the game.  When it was over.. it was pretty clear that I was never going to play another minute for him again.. even though every other player on that team had one bad game themselves at one point and got to play again.

After that.. I couldn't help but feel all was lost.  My goals with the team were over.. my grades were in the dumps.  I quit the team my third year.. but by then had found drugs as a way to cope, and my grades never came back up.

I made it to college and struggled there.  I missed playijg for a team.. but didn't want to put myself through it again.. so I didn't.  
I wanted to be a science major.. but the math kicked my ass.  I was disorganized and sloppy.. and still doing drugs.  

I wanted to give up so many times.. my parents pushed me to get my degree and I forced myself to do it.. and after 5 years I got a BA in science.  (Science classes with a lower math requirement)

Ok great!..
Not so much.
My grades weren't high enough to landed that awesome internship.. or even mediocre job.  The economy was bad at that time.. I found myself a college grad with a BA making $9 an hour.. but finally the competitive side re-emerged.

I moved out of state to find more opportunities.  I went through one job after another, after another until I was finally making 35k a year. (This isn't that long ago =/)

Unfortunately.. that job was with aot of old and bitter people who decided it would be in their best interest to make my life he'll.  They complained about everything I did.

My boss always acted like he bought in to everything they were saying.. but then asked me to work overtime all the time, and talked about promoting me.
Hmm.. I suck.. but you want me here longer.. and are thinking of giving me a promotion ???

One day a position opens up.  My bosses boss finds someone with a master' (ok common thing) in a non-science fiel, to become supervisor. 
--wait.. I didn't have to battle through Chem to get my bosses job.. I could have just studied English.. WTF???

Anyway.  After 5 years of work.. my friends who dropped out of college.. plumbers, electricians, car salesmen are all earning great living and I'm up to about 40k.  Yay.. go me.

Anyway.. years later.. I finally got a bunch of raises and am making a little bit more.    I guess that's cool because some people never get there.. fine.
But now I literally hate my job and have been looking for to change careers.
I was told of a particular field where college isn't necessary if you have certs.

I started studying and have earned certs.. but after hundreds of applications have not been able to get a call back.

Is it pointless to go further?
Im not a total failure.. but I feel like I could have easily been in the same let's say 'economic bracket' with a lot less work.. and I am starting to feel like this is the HS team all over again.. were I invest a lot of work at the expense of other things, for no reward."
wk69ch,17,2022-08-09,My Nana just died and my manager pushing me not to take any days off,Educational_Lake_147,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/wk69ch/my_nana_just_died_and_my_manager_pushing_me_not/,"She died Saturday and I found out Sunday night while I was out at dinner. 

I grew up in an abusive environment where my mom isolated me from most of my family and my grandmother mostly took care of me when my mom left me alone. 

My grandmother died when I was 12 and her mother (my Nana) has looked after me and checked in on me up until I turned 16 and my mom kicked me out. I promptly moved in with my dad but his girlfriend kicked me out about a year later when they fought, then I lived with a friend for about half a year. I visited my Nana once in this period of time and told her I'd spend Christmas with her, but work (old job) came up asking on short notice if I could do inventory and I needed the Holiday bonus money.

I have since moved states to put miles between my mom and I because she continually harasses me online and because of that, I lost connection with my Nana. My mom messaged me to tell me she'd passed. 

I've been no contact with my mom for something like a year now so this puts me in a weird, compromising position because now I feel obligated to speak to her over my G Grandma's death. I have relatives reaching out asking how I'm doing and I feel guilty because of my last conversation with my G Grandma.

I came to work yesterday and told my manager that I didn't want to be in, and why. And that I had only come in because I know the workload is very strained. He said ""Bless you. Thank you for coming in"". And then proceeded to poke and pry about whether or not I knew of a date for any funeral/memorial or service and how he ""hopes it ends up being on the weekend"" so that it doesn't affect work. 


There is only 3 of us 6am-3pm Monday-Friday. I work in an office caf√© and our cook handles the grill and the hotline and my manager handles paperwork and deli. I do everything inbetween including but not limited to the salad bar prep, constant pots of coffee, register, clean tables, disinfect everything, restock sauces, napkins, soup cups, chips, drink fridges, replace milk and creamer, make snack cups, and pick up slack wherever there is any. Whenever I feel done my manager tells me ""there are always things to do!"" and has me wipe down and clean the coffee machines and soak the coffee baskets and wipe down the fridges/restock snacks at the register or help him with catering &amp; whatever he can think of, which sometimes includes discussing potential new hires as well. &amp; some of the ppl I make coffee for are interns making the bare minimum of the company which is apparently $21 - but we are contracted so I make $15 and the cook who has been here for 10 yrs made $14.25 up until 9 months ago where they started giving him $16.

My breaks are ""enforced"" (clocking out) but not working during them is not. I frequently have to leave my ""break"" (chair in the cafe I already...work in, where I am frequently interrupted by customers for help) in order to help people or make more coffee.

I am heavily discouraged from calling out on Tues-Thurs because those are our really busy days and I am expected to be here. I start college soon too and my therapist is expressing serious concerns about the time I pour into my
job.  I've mentioned needing days before, one day I've even given him months advice notice and he asked if I ""really needed to be out that day?"" and has told me that I have to schedule things (like doctor's appointments) so that they ""don't interfere with you working the lunch rush"") 

I can hardly afford food at this point and I have multiple care professionals as well as my boyfriend expressing concern about how little I am eating and sleeping. I also have no reliable transportation and take the spotty city buses everywhere and my work hours are also going to affect my school schedule. I have no one to take me shopping or to help and my manager takes up a weird attitude over the idea of helping me get anywhere even if we are going the same direction. His reasoning is if he ""gives an inch, I'll keep asking for rides and inconveniencing him."" even though I've never formally asked him for help and the conversation was unprompted. 

I'm unsure what to do next because I still have to pay my rent and afford the bus and food and I enjoy this job more than anywhere I've worked but it's wearing me down to the point where I struggle to keep my temper around customers bothering me for coffee on my break and have begun crying in the stock room, freezer, drink storage, and in the caf√© &amp; have had to excuse myself to hyperventilate in the bathroom or above listed location.

tl;dr broke sad 18y/o with no financial safety net starting college, working full time for a boss that's ""never taken a day off and no one else should either"", can't afford food and now grieving too."

Short story of me:

THIS IS RAW, EMOTIONAL, WITH SOME CURSING IN THERE:

Short-log of me Pre-2016 episode and family base description (would call it a prologue but it really is just a short snapshot into how my life has been)

Here I begin to write about my depression and my feelings for real.

To be honest I‚Äôve definitely played a part in my own self-sabotage, however there is definitely some dysfunction in my family. For as long as I can remember I‚Äôve been a runner - an experience to highlight was when I was only 3 or 4 years old and left my house in the middle of the night to go to my grandma‚Äôs house, where I was constantly spoiled, to be honest. 

This story goes back and forth and is totally discombobulated, however this is how it is designed to be because this is exactly how my mind works - in crazy waves that usually do not make any sense, but have their brilliance. The purpose of this story is to inspire anyone going through it to simply tell their story as honest as they possibly can, which really can work wonders for others.

Anyways, back to the running. Yes, I am a good runner on the exercise side, which can explain to a certain extent why I enjoy it. However, this is a total oxymoron at the same time because as much as I enjoy running as a form of exercise, which requires you to just focus on the basics of your breathing and being in the moment, I VERY often try and escape this very same present. More to be revealed and thank you for embarking on this journey with me.

My Mom has had her issues with alcohol and so has my Dad, although they are both highly functioning and to some degree, the opposite of me - THEY‚ÄôRE ACTUALLY WORKAHOLICS (A problem I don‚Äôt seem to have which would maybe help me with my employment-mood issues). Anyways, my parents separated before I was born, and my Mom constantly communicates how great that decision was due to them not being able to stay together so it would‚Äôve been a horrible situation if they did. I don‚Äôt know how much I trust of that, I wonder if they had both changed some of themselves in order to fit together would that‚Äôve been a nice lesson for their only son on how to stick things out, etc. Oh and of course I will comment on whether I have tried therapy or not - Yes I have, and we will get more into that via talking about medication later.

A little more information on what my past has been before we get into chapter 1 chronologically is that aside from running, I have historically been just a disinterested human being without any desire to change. Even at college I was somewhat successful before transferring to another school and graduating but still didn‚Äôt seem to sustain any form of focus or desire on bare fucking nothing A.K.A. anything!

Thank you for sticking with me on the background info - time to dive in.

Chapter 1: Assault without charges (Thank God), medical evaluation leading to diagnosis of Bipolar (can‚Äôt remember which type), and prescription written for Abilify (5 mg) (2016)

So I did it, I snapped. After two years of college at one school I just cried out for help in the worst way possible. Thank God that it was just a psych adjustment disorder and that there were no charges because it could‚Äôve gotten a lot worse. Honestly, looking back I am totally astonished that I even lasted that long at college because I had absolutely no direction. And when I say absolutely no direction I mean ZILCH, bare fucking super fucking duckling nada. All I did was hook up with chicks and bullshit my work. It was a fun time, but it definitely caught up with me by the third year when you actually have to pick a major and I floundered like a fucking kingfish. 

Everyone was telling me that I was in the right place and that I just needed to keep pushing through, which I was not doing to the best of my ability, nor could I really have done so now that I think about all the fucking mental distractions I had going on. I think had I not went to college or left that school earlier I may have been able to get my shit together quicker, but I was too busy doing the sexy thing of college, which did not do me shit in the end.

So after snapping I went home and got a prescription for Abilify back when you actually had to physically see the psychiatrist. I got this prescription because I wanted to have the magic pill for my issues, which has actually helped stabilized me to a certain extent but at the same time did not really solve anything if that makes one iota of sense. 

Moral of the chapter: Don‚Äôt believe everything people say

Chapter 2: Pure Life Costa Rica Stay (End of 2016)

Pure Life was an awesome experience. Sure, it was incredibly difficult to be away from home in the beginning and have to actually face the music of what needed to be done, but there was beauty in just that. The friendships I made out there and the bare brutal brunt of nature is something that one cannot manipulate, but must cope with and I envy those headed down to this program now because I wish I could go back in time to re-live my stay. 

The positives being said, I was a sitter for a great big chunk of my stay at Pure Life. This ‚Äúsitter‚Äù term means someone who essentially sits out on anything and everything, which is not only dangerous to the group as you are taught to be responsible for others at the program, (YOU‚ÄôRE A TEAM) but also the individual because the more that you SIT out on life, the harder it seems to become someone actually involved in life. 

Moral of the chapter: Don‚Äôt be a sitter

Chapter 3: Friendships and Graduating College - nothing after for almost 2 spanking years (2017-2019)

So I had this one friend that I just stopped talking too cold turkey after many years of back and forth friendship. He convinced me to go to a new college, which for a while helped me feel less depressed and I was more motivated to do something with my life. This motivation was there for a couple of years where I finally completed and internship and contributed something to society by graduating college (this was how I was supposed to feel), and then it disappeared as being the Peter Pan that I am knowing that adulthood was coming I was like FUCK IT wanting to jump ship.

All that time at college was me not challenging myself and just going for the comfortable, easy way out which felt good in the moment but at the end of the day doesn‚Äôt serve you.

Moral of the chapter: Do not take time for granted because it WILL slip away

Chapter 4: Another mental health stay in San Diego, Real Estate License and Courses but still Can‚Äôt Seem to Bring myself to hold a job (Oct 2021-May 2022)

So after a couple more years of doing the typical floundering that I do best, I decided to go to another program in San Diego to treat my depression (typical escape). That stay is not really important because I just bullshitted around doing nothing until I went home again to live with the rents. With the rents I actually accomplished some nice things while job searching, but still student-related and had no real relation to the real world of being a functioning adult. Of course there was some family changes going on, but no excuse for what I was doing to myself yet again. 

I look back on those times now and wish that I could somehow be just a little more grateful than I was because the ups and downs are a part of life, bipolar or not.

Moral of the chapter: Be Grateful for everything in life

Chapter 5: Still Unemployed and taking Abilify 5 mg while living at home (May 2022-Present)

So this chapter is the shortest because really there‚Äôs nothing to be said here. I wasted so many years of my life and am on the same medication with the same damn results with only myself to blame.

Moral of the chapter: Nothing changes if nothing changes

Thank you Reddit for taking the time to read this - really wasn‚Äôt looking for anything here either than just a place to share my story. Am open to suggestions on both the writing and life."

Given that there's probably a time crunch, should I prioritize finishing the challenges quickly or providing good comments throughout my code?"

I had discussed with my team lead the possibility of continuing to work in the same project. He was nice and explained the various departments in the company and he said that since his team already has enough data scientists, he will be in the bottom line of getting the next hire.

He encouraged me to apply for different positions and he explained that there will be two rounds of interviews and he is not sure how much say he will have in the final decision.

I still haven't got feedback for my work ( will get it via a call in the coming weeks) but I did solve the problem given to me.

I just don't understand why he would ask me to apply via the job portal of the company and go through two rounds of interviews after a 6 months internship? Is this a normal?

Edit:


If they wanted me they would have extended an offer before the internship ended if they wanted to hire you. Did he ask me apply through the portal to spare my feelings. If I  apply and don't get hired, the company will be the bad guy, not him. 

I felt too awkward to ask directly and now I don't know how to feel about this."

I even applied to one run by an alumni of my university for students with little or no experience outside the classroom and yet couldn't even get into that. It was absolutely soul crushing to see that some of the people that were accepted were 2nd year students. For context, I am set to graduate Spring 2023. Looking through the I've been trying to self learn through The Odin Project and building the projects they assign but I can't help but constantly feel like an idiot for doing it without pay when i could be paid to learn at an internship. Not only that, it's lonely as hell. I wish someone had really stressed the importance of internships to me and the technologies I need to know for them. Getting a job as a software engineer or anything to do with tech feels more and more like a pipe dream everyday for me. Not a day goes by where I don't get bogged down by all my worries."

My question is, am I restricting myself to Finance and this kinda role? I think a major reason why I got this internship offer was because I've done very similar work in my previous job. I don't know if it's smart to limit myself to this area when I want to work in either Tech (say companies like Airbnb, Pinterest, etc) or FinTech (like PayPal, Stripe, etc) eventually.

I know it's always possible to move into other industries that excite you but I'm more curious to know about how difficult that may potentially be. And is it bad to limit myself so early in my career?"
wkipsq,1,2022-08-09,[Ultimate Guide] When Is the Best Time to Apply for a Job in the UK?,Dear-Relationship-39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/wkipsq/ultimate_guide_when_is_the_best_time_to_apply_for/," 

The UK job market can be competitive for students, fresh graduates, and people who have work experience. Sometimes, timing can also play a crucial role in the success of your job application. There are months that are busier for both students and graduates and experienced professionals, and there are months that are quieter. If you understand the timing, you can have a more planned approach in your job application. In this article, we explain the best time to apply for a job in the UK for students, graduates and experienced professionals

**For Students and Graduates**

Student and graduate recruitment often start around September, and companies recruit one year in advance. For example, the majority of the big recruiters, who accept international students, start recruiting in September 2021 for roles that commence in summer/autumn 2022. Recruiting one year in advance allows companies to have sufficient time to complete all interviews and assessment centres, deal with documents and visa applications and allocate resources in the company before the new hires arrive.

There is another reason for starting the hiring process around September time. The majority of the UK students finish their degrees and get their results by September. Even if you are doing a master‚Äôs course, you are most likely to complete your course by September and can legally start full-time employment afterwards.

Having a specific recruitment time frame means the number of vacancies available in the market often peaks around September to November each year for students and graduates. As the recruitment progresses, companies start closing their roles from November onwards and begin interviewing. Therefore, the number of vacancies available will be the lowest from April to June. It does not mean there will not be roles available during this time. There are more than 500+ live student and graduate vacancies on¬†[UK Visa Jobs](https://ukvisajobs.com/)¬†now, and UK‚Äôs biggest international student recruiters such as PwC, Barclays and Deloitte are still hiring for their summer internships and graduate programmes. However, due to the limited number of available vacancies, April to May can be slightly challenging to land a job offer due to the fierce competition. If a company started their recruitment in September and is still recruiting for the same role in April or May, it may also indicate that they could not fill these vacancies. Applying for this type of vacancy often increases your chance of being shortlisted for an interview.

The start times for internships and graduate programmes are different. The majority of internships often commence around June and last for anywhere between four to eight weeks. However, graduate programmes usually start between July and September, though some may start in October. Graduate programmes often last for 18-36 months, depending on the role, and graduate jobs are also deemed permanent. 18 ‚Äì 36 months are the duration of training. After the training period, you will often move into a permanent full-time role where training is less not common.

There will be a fresh influx of roles again in September 2022. If you are currently at school and have not graduated yet or are only starting your master‚Äôs degree this September, it is important to start your application as early as September. However, if you have already graduated, you should be applying for roles now.

**For Experienced Professionals**

Companies hire staff all year round, especially people with work experience. Although there is no recruitment cycle like graduate and internship roles have, there are months that are quieter than the others.

Usually, January to March is the best time to look for a job. During this time, many companies allocate their recruitment budget, people come back from their Christmas or new year breaks and hiring managers rush to fill in the vacancies which were paused due to holidays. Many companies also pay bonuses during this period, and people change jobs after getting their bonus, creating more vacant positions.

There are still plenty of roles in the market in April and May, mostly due to the openings from January to March. However, during this time, the job market can get very competitive because there are more people applying for jobs too. It is essential to review your CV and prepare well for your interview.

Summer months are usually quiet. There are not as many vacancies as there are in Januaries or Februaries, and there will be fewer interviews due to hiring managers being on holiday. You may need to try harder to find something suitable during this time. If you cannot find a job you like, you should not worry too much. The market will start picking up in September again, and there will be more jobs. Summer is also an excellent time to improve your interview skills to be ready for upcoming interviews and increase your chance of success in Autumn.

The rest of the year gest back to normal, apart from December, because it is a holiday period. In September, the market will recover, and there will be a decent amount of jobs you can apply for."

wkix7w,3,2022-08-09,"[WA, USA] Apartment company refusing to refund $400 holding deposit citing their ""24 hour only refundable"" policy. Can I dispute the charge on my credit card?",eleguanermans,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/wkix7w/wa_usa_apartment_company_refusing_to_refund_400/,"Hi there,

I am moving to the Seattle area from Canada for an internship in the Fall on a J-1 visa. I applied to lease an apartment a few weeks ago and the fees included a $400 holding deposit and $60 application fee. I paid the fees using my mastercard.

I decided to go with an alternative housing arrangement, partly since these guys were taking forever to approve me, so I withdrew my application. When I asked for a refund on my holding deposit, they cited a policy that ""refunds can only be issued within 24 hours of cancellation"". I checked their website and the policy is there but according to Washington state law here: [https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18.253](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18.253) 

 *(2) A landlord who charges a prospective tenant a fee or deposit to hold  a dwelling unit or secure that the prospective tenant will move into a  dwelling unit, after the dwelling unit has been offered to the  prospective tenant, must provide the prospective tenant with a receipt  for the fee or deposit, together with a written statement of the  conditions, if any, under which the fee or deposit may be retained,  immediately upon payment of the fee or deposit* 

I believe I have a claim to refund my deposit because:

A. They did not give me a receipt for the transaction

B. I was not provided a written statement of the conditions, nor informed of the refund policy, and was therefore completely unaware of it. 

I would normally dispute something like this without question but I'm scared that I might get into trouble since I will be going to Seattle on a student visa and I don't want to jeopardize my internship over a few hundred bucks. But at the end of the day, its still a large sum of money!

Any advice is appreciated."
wkjhqe,1,2022-08-09,What should I do after graduating with a bachelor's I despise?,KaizokuBebop,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/wkjhqe/what_should_i_do_after_graduating_with_a/,"So I recently graduated with my Bachelor's in Computer Science from a school in NYC, but this is after a year of fixing an incomplete grade and realizing that computer science or at least direct coding isn't for me in that year. I've had no internships because I never applied out of anxiety that nobody would take me. For the past year, I have been sending out resumes and CVs for programming positions to no avail. I don't even feel like doing any coding projects to bolster it just cause I feel that apathetic about coding now. Since then, I've gotten a certification in Project Management and working through Coursera. I just don't know what to do next, beyond thinking about what would have happened if I majored in a subject I was interested in like Film or Media."

I can typically code something that passes some test cases (i.e 60-80 %). When I look at the optimal solution, I find that they use concepts that feel a bit too advanced for me (at this time). I was wondering what extent my proficiency for these questions should be in order to get an internship? Is this sort of confusion normal for students of my year, or am I just very behind? If so, do you have any advise on how to catch up?"

I'm an incoming freshman at UWaterloo (a university in Canada) for CS. I had originally applied there due to its advantageous co-op opportunities in the industry, but now I'm not so sure, as I've found more of an interest in academia and research, and would like to pursue grad school.

One of the programs I looked very heavily at attempting to transfer into (either in 2nd? or 3rd year) was Berkeley's EECS program. Based on my research, I've come up with the following pros and cons of switching:

Pros:

* Berkeley's research prospects are much better/profs are more reputable (higher h-indexes). [Source1](https://research.com/university-rankings/computer-science/us) [Source2](https://research.com/university-rankings/computer-science/ca) . this is the point I've attributed the most weight to.
* Content in courses is much more expedited when compared to UW
* If I ever consider industry again, Berkeley has the highest Silicon Valley rate [Source](https://hiringsolved.com/blog/hiringsolved-identifies-top-skills-backgrounds-make-2017s-wanted-tech-employee/) .

Cons:

* International tuition surpasses 60k+ USD a year (will be applying for financial aid externally, so this may or may not be that big of an issue)
* Lose out on co-op internships &amp; waterloo's co-op board, potentially making it more difficult to gain industry experience
* Very low transfer acceptance rate into EECS for internationals outside of CCCs (may make the entire process futile)

With these points listed, I'd like to ask if the pros outweigh the cons? Am I placing too much weight on rankings? If anyone is knowledgable on both institutions, any insight would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading!

This place was about 3 hours away from my hometown and had 2 weeks' notice to find a place and move there before my start so that was an absolute nightmare but I got it figured out. Even though I also had a 35 min drive there and 35 min drive back I still did overall really enjoy the entire experience, really liked the people I worked with, and learned a lot while I was there. Well recently during my last week I got my offer for full-time for 61k with pretty good benefits but I was only given 3 days to decide, even though I do not graduate till May 2023. The company is a Fortune 200 company but I wouldn't say a tech company at all and my team I am on is pretty small so I really can't tell if there is room for growth. The main reason I am even thinking about declining this offer is that nearly a third of my yearly income will probably be spent just living there and while I know sometimes you have to make sacrifices, leaving everyone that I know like friends and family behind right away when I wasn't expecting this does not seem ideal either.

That being said I am thinking of declining the offer and spending my last 2 semesters of college doing interview prep, leetcode, and work on a personal project. Although I did not enjoy sending out a ton of applications last time and doing interview prep for nothing I feel this would be worthwhile and I am hoping by doing this I can get some sort of offer closer to home so I can take advantage of not paying rent for a while so I don't even mind the offer being lower than what I just got since I save so much alone because of that. Does this sound like a logical idea? or I am better off just taking the offer? Please let me know if you need any clarification or anything and any advice is appreciated!

I'm also unfortunately not too familiar with many algorithms (don't rmbr these being covered too in depth in my CS class) like DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra which I'm just beginning to brush up on and study now.

Is there anything I can do to set my best foot forward for FAANG internships/other SWE/DS internships? I've just started on Grind75, with the goal of hopefully completing it in a month. I think I'm from a target school for CS, but it's feeling a little hopeless with the little time I think I have. My resume is fairly weak too, since making the switch to potentially CS was something I'd just done recently after a full year in school already.

* SDE **summer internship (2 months)** at a startup
* College Projects: **2 projects (one major project and one done in 5 sem related to course)**
* Research experience:  **One paper was published (both at an International conference then it was included in IEEE)**
* **Extracurricular activity: Minimal** 
* **A few personal projects** (some in the CV/ML space, and some in the Web dev space) and **2 hackathon awards** (don't know if they matter)

\-pursuing a relevant bachelor's degree

\-good communication skills, can work within a team and meet deadlines

\-basic knowledge of network protocols

My first interview wasn't a technical interview. The interviewer just asked me basic questions about myself to get to know me and why I wanted to intern at their company specifically. She informed me that the second interview will be done by three people: two security consultants from their red team and a manager of business solutions.

To give some insight as to what the internship will be like, during my first interview I asked my interviewer what to expect to be doing day to day. She told me I would be working alongside the red team on their current project. I would also work on the helpdesk a little. And I would get to work with the business consulting team as well to see how they meet with clients. This is all to try to give me different aspects of what their company does and give me solid hands on experience. She did say primarily though that the internship focuses on working with the red team.

My question is what should I expect from the second interview? Are they expecting me to be able to answer technical questions about pentesting? I have some experience doing CTF's. I am by no means a master at them but I have been doing them everyday to try to learn more and improve. Any questions that I should expect to see so I can prepare for them?

I apologize for any errors on this post English is not my native language.

A little background information, I (26 F) just finished an intense year of internship in the medical field and starting the process of looking for jobs for the profession I want. I decided after my last day in intership to celebrate and relieve the stress I will go crazy and I went out everyday non stop for 8 days straight (events concerts, friends and family outings..etc). I am a bit of an introvert so that week has exhausted my social battery and I decided to take a break from social media and outings.

After 2 weeks my friends reached out to me as to why I am not talking in the groups and gone silent I told them that I was okay just socially exhausted and need a break to recharge and will talk when I feel ready to (I was recently diagnosed with depression and having suicidal thoughts so they were making sure I hadn't relapsed).

However my down time turned to home chores and errands and important family gatherings so I was preoccupied. I started to avoid looking at my notifications because they are a reminder that I am not engaging like I used to, I even started to avoid looking at my phone and dread phone calls. So I decided to turn the do not disturb button on my phone so I won't look and see any calls or notifications, I used to once in a while enter my social accounts, now I don't even open them at all.

Other than my friends my coworkers are also trying to reach me so we could continue our research but honestly, I am very terrified to look at their messages and calls, even my the research supervisor reached out to me and I haven't responded. I am a perfectionist and I like to do my job very well so when I saw the feedback about our paper I was floored and dejected, which might have caused me to avoid my phone more.

I thought that my recovery period wouldn't take long but I am in this state for over a month and everytime I look at my phone I feel my heart racing and I get short of breath, I distract myself with chores around the house and sleeping just to not think about the mess that would explode when I turn the do not disturb button off.

I know this is a cowardly and childish way to deal with this but I honestly don't know how to stop this fear and just suck it and handle like an adult should, but I really don't know how...

I need some insight and some help please, I am really lost on what to do and I want to stop this fear I have on my phone."

I'm currently a Software Engineering student in Melbourne, and I'm seeking some opinions on my current situation with my degree grades. In my first semester, I had to take a programming bootcamp (1) for 5 weeks which I didn't pass. Currently, I'm in my second semester completing programming bootcamp (2) and it is looking like another fail. I'm genuinely putting in the effort trying to pass but the difficulty and pacing of the bootcamp is too much for me to handle, but I am still interested in learning content that this course has to offer, and I really do like coding (and the maths), but these coding bootcamps are really burning me out quickly.

My question to all of you in the industry is, when I do graduate, how bad does a transcript with 2 bootcamp fails look?  Are my chances of obtaining an internship gone, and will I struggle to find a job right out of university? I am still motivated to carry on but the thought of not being successful of finding jobs because of my poor transcript is disheartening. I'd really appreciate any and all feedback, and I'm happy to answer any questions from you guys regarding my situation.

As for 351, I'm decent at non-trivial proofs, but my data structures knowledge is pretty crusty, and I took a lot of time on a select few 132 projects.

I know no one can answer this question, but how much work (per week) would I need to sustain such a schedule and perform decently well in these classes (CMSC 320, 330, 351H, MATH 410) (&gt; 3.5 GPA)?

I live in EU but I dont come from here which means that they are gonna sponsor my visa (not alot of companies are willing to do so and its big step for them to pay extra to hire me). i have not signed the contract yet.

The problem is that currently im doing the internship which ends at the end of the  September ( i just started). The company who is willing to hire me wants me to quit the internship and start working in September immediately and main reason is that multiple people will be joining and the training sessions are  face to face (no recording). So problems about this are:

* I dont want to quit the internship earlier. I find it very unfair to do this to them as Im am the only one who has to finish the project. Also they pay me and it not unpaid internship. So i feel guilty to betray them. I KNOW I KNOW, that at the end of the day i have to think about me but second problem is...
* I will be graduating soon which means I have no savings at all and I was counting on this internship (they pay good)
* And last and most important. Visa process takes alot of time. Im sure I wont be able to start in september as it takes around 3-4 month to get the working permit. So, not sure how i will be paid in September if I quit the internship, also I cant go in the office to attend the trainings so manager told me that if visa wont be on time I will attend the sessions online.

I should be sitting happy as it took me so loooong to find the company who wants me and also willing to sponsor visa at the same time but Im stressed and dont want to quit internship, as I feel shit about this cause those people trust me and waiting my help, also thinking about talking to my manager that I will leave the project in the middle. already feels super uncomfortable. Second, financial situation and then visa case too.

I‚Äôm finally starting to realize my brother may be a sociopath and I have no idea how to help his girlfriend.

My younger brother (22 M) has been dating his girlfriend (22 F) for 3 years (on and off) and they moved in together about two months ago. To clarify, he is just living rent free at her apartment. During the height of COVID, my brother was diagnosed with hietal hernia, anxiety, and panic disorder. His girlfriend would come over to his apartment to clean, cook, grocery shop for him because he was extremely anxious about getting COVID. Since then, he started treating his girlfriend like total piece of garbage and would verbally abuse and even slapped her face when she broke up with him. He drove to her house, threatened to crash in to the house and kill both of them. When she came out of the house, that‚Äôs when he slapped her face. Then he drove off telling her he will go suicide. But after few days or so, he came back crying begging for forgiveness and his girlfriend decided to give him another chance (big mistake).

Just a background about him, he is openly racist and sexist (but would only say racist and sexist things to his girlfriend and in front of me sometimes). He is very addicted to gaming, since he was in high school. He would refuse to go to school playing game all night and would still do that now until he got an internship. His sleep schedule is all messed up. He and his girlfriend live together with the girlfriend‚Äôs dog and he would smack her and hit her a lot. Says animals need discipline. Apparently he asked his girlfriend if she thinks he is sociopath because he enjoys abusing animals. He also tells his girlfriend regularly to ‚Äúact like a woman you should be‚Äù and be a housewife and not talk back to him even though he doesn‚Äôt even pay rent. He calls her names a lot but mostly calling her ‚Äúwoman‚Äù which triggers her and ends in messy violent fights. He has no respect and consideration for her. When she‚Äôs asleep at night, he would watch youtube on loud volume and talk loudly, totally disregarding the fact that his girlfriend needs to sleep to work the next day. 

Anyways, since then, his girlfriend moved to a different state (same state as me) upon graduating and my brother drove across the state and moved in with her once he graduated. But since they moved in together, things got worse again. The other day, the girlfriend told me that they were in a car and he said something triggering to her as usual and she got mad and he pushed her head and she pushed him back while he was driving. He then smacked her head against the window and she told him to break up because of the abuse. He got psycho and started switching lanes and stopped in the middle of the road stirring his wheels right and left threatening he will crash in to the fast driving cars to kill both of them. She got out of the car and ubered back home. The next day, similar thing happened again and that‚Äôs when she told me about everything and I picked her and her dog up and forced her to stay at my house because he is unsafe. 

I have told her multiple times to break up with him. She has been in an abusive relationship before my brother so she is scared of leaving because she fears my brother will kill himself or do other crazy shit. I told her we can call the cops if we have to but she doesn‚Äôt want to ruin his life since the criminal record will screw his life getting jobs. She told me he said he‚Äôs going to leave and drive back at the end of this month but I know for a fact he is just saying that to mend the situation for now and thinks she will forgive him and that he can stay. She wants to go back to her place and just ignore him until he leaves, which sounds unrealistic. 

Sorry for the long post. I‚Äôm not sure how I can help removing him. My parents don‚Äôt even know about his behaviors, no one does except his girlfriend, me, and my boyfriend because my brother is so good at acting normal and like nothing has happened between them. Let me know your thoughts/advice‚Ä¶

Thank you."

I‚Äôm a student at a T10 school going into my junior year (math+comp sci). I have straight A‚Äôs (above 4.0 gpa), but a relatively limited portfolio and no applicable work experience. My end goal is to work at a top big tech company, but I feel that I‚Äôm way off the mark for this cycle of recruiting for summer internships.

As an applicant, I know I need to work on my portfolio. The issue is that I don‚Äôt know what I want to do: data science, applications, security, etc‚Ä¶ Thus, I‚Äôve managed to complete almost no in depth projects because I‚Äôve poked at the surface of so many different things. Also, I‚Äôve found it very difficult to plan and execute projects in a timely/organized manner. Does anyone have any tips for that?

The only other (possibly) relevant thing about my is that I‚Äôm an national team level athlete in a pretty niche sport. That‚Äôs why I have little time to work on other things, because I basically have a 30 hour a week job to do on top of everything else.

So, if you were in my situation, what would you do? I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs time to develop myself as an applicant for a top job over the next month or two, or if I should do my best to land an easy gig and focus on my development for the future.

Thanks!"

My concentrations are statistics and finance. I‚Äôve tried 3 internships in business dev, marketing, and management consulting but didn‚Äôt really enjoy it. I have an upcoming fall internship as a statistician with a government org.  Recently, I have been looking at job opportunities for FT 2023 and came across job positions such as Quantitative Analyst, Model Validation, or Quant Traders that seemed interesting to me and that kind of sparked some questions. 

1. Most of these job postings (especially at banks) say you‚Äôre required to have a post-grad but how true is that? I have seen some of my peers get quant jobs during their undergrad but that may also be because the bar is lower?  Is post grad something i should be thinking of regardless?

2. Some posts state they require ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù programming skills. What qualifies as intermediate? 

3. If I were to try for quant, should I be filling my last years worth of courses with stats based courses? Should I also take a securities trading class for the business side of things as well?

4. Are there any other way to be competitive in the recruitment process? I haven‚Äôt gone into any recruitment for technical roles but i know projects are a big thing. Anywhere I can look for inspiration?

wl8ak5,22,2022-08-10,Y‚Äôall got this.,fagado,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wl8ak5/yall_got_this/,"Hey everyone!

I‚Äôve finished my 3rd year of Chemical Engineering, and it was definitely my worst year so far (finished a couple months ago). The return to in person from a full 2nd year of online classes did not go well with me, and I struggled. I missed classes, was well behind the majority of the time, and barely scraped by. I failed my first class in my university career. I didn‚Äôt feel like I belonged with everyone else in my program.

All the while, everyone was applying for co-ops and internships, an opportunity at my university where you can go and gain work experience for a full year after your 3rd year, and return for studies after.

I kept applying and applying, with no responses at all. October, November, December went by. Nothing. January, February, all the way until my final exams. No interviews, no messages back.

My grades were decent from 1st and 2nd year, and with my abysmal 3rd year soon being included in my transcript, I didn‚Äôt think I would be able to secure anything. I would go straight into fourth year whereas the majority of my friends would go gain valuable experience, and I would have to graduate without anyone I knew, with no significant work experience and probably a terrible transcript.

Application opportunities for this internship year closed July 29th. On July 8th, I had submitted a number of applications, at this point desperate to just get absolutely anything back. But every-time I knew I had to attach my transcript, seeing how I did in third year, I was not confident at all.

One of these positions did not require a transcript. And it seemed right up my ally, with and interesting company and a challenging role. I reached out to the hiring manager with my resume and cv, and by then end of the day I received a call back asking to setup an interview!

I was beyond overjoyed, my first actual response and they wanted to interview me! I immediately accepted, and an interview was scheduled for July 11th.

Long story short the interview went well in my eyes but I was very nervous. It was an in person interview which surprised me as well, and only made me more on edge that I would fuck it up somehow. It concluded with ‚Äúwe have some more applicants to interview, you‚Äôll probably hear back within 1 - 2 weeks on our decision‚Äù.

The next day, I got a call. I got the job! I actually couldn‚Äôt believe it. Within 4 days I had had an interview and secured my year of work experience, all within 2 weeks of final applications.

Been here for 3 weeks now, and it‚Äôs been amazing. I couldn‚Äôt ask for a more perfect fit  for me.

In the end, the point I want to get across is to not lose hope. What I had thought would be a last minute effort with probably no success given my previous experience in the application process turned into this. Probably more places out there don‚Äôt care about your transcripts. What I thought would be the worst year of my university career might shape up to be the best.

Apply to everything. Do your best. Y‚Äôall will get this in the end.

Thanks for reading, I just wanted to share my journey. I hope it might help you too."

I am currently stuck with a thought regarding the ""role"" I want to play during the development process. I would like to start by saying sorry for sounding confused and confusing - I am having a tough time wording all of it myself, lol

So I like to think that I'm a slightly artistic person, and I have always had a lot of success in mathematics and its related subsets. Which led me to be very interested in shader programming and then very interest in Tech Arts. I really like tinkering with particle systems, making visually ""interesting"" or ""exciting"" effects through code - stuff like that.

However, I also got in touch with computer graphics recently, and I REALLY like coding openGL stuff. As well as procedural geometry and everything related to 3d math within a computer, really. The idea that I can now draw things on a screen by directly calling a method through the GPU is a power fantasy that I cannot explain, and I love working on it!

But for context, I don't consider myself super experienced in either area: 

At the time of writing this - I'm not a fully fledged Tech Artist because I don't really have a lot of experience in the 3D modeling softwares which are usually expected for the job, or Houdini, and I'm only a little good with Photoshop/Krita. I'm also not particularly skilled at handling more robust things with openGL, like stencil buffers, anti aliasing, etc, and I also don't think I can make sense of the crazy shader code within Unreal and Unity's default ""Lit"" HLSL files.

So I face myself with a difficult question which is... What should I try to invest more time into, and then tailor my portfolio towards?

Because I really like having the visual output of coding graphics and shaders, but I also really enjoy the nice workflow of tech arts, despite it not involving a whole lot of code or math sometimes.

I know that both jobs are well paid and in a decent demand right now, but I don't know where I fit into it all.

I would love to hear a bit from Graphics Programmers and Technical Artists on what is your ""daily routine"" like, in hopes that I'll identify myself doing one of the jobs.

Alternatively, if you think I should do one thing over the other, I'd be willing to listen to that too.

I just really need to stop bouncing between the two of them because I need to find an internship by next year in order to complete my current education, and I feel like time is running out."

I switched to CS from MechE late 2021, and the only project I finished was a sudoku webpage, and I've been working on a personal website, and it's been taking months since it's kind of tricky. My GPA dropped from a 3.48 to a 3.2 between the fall and spring semesters last year. I had 3 OAs from internships I applied to and I failed test cases on all of them. Everyone else I see has more complex projects than me, even though I tried to look for things I could do that actually challenge me. I only got an unpaid ""internship"" at my school that I haven't done any work for because the manager just stopped contacting me and the other interns (yes, I reached out to them weeks ago, no I didn't get a response). And as of now, I haven't gotten an internship for next year or next summer, while most of the other people I know do. I know I'm supposed to connect with people, but I honestly don't even feel like interacting with people in tech or other CS majors - I always end up feeling inferior. I see people on TikTok/Instagram showing off their fancy setups and apartments, and I'm just a loser compared to them. I'm trying to teach myself data structures and I still can't settle on a resource that I can learn from quickly enough to start on LeetCode soon. I'm really worried. My school is competitive, and I know a lot of people are going to make it to the top software engineering jobs, including FAANG, and I was hoping to be one of them to make the money my parents are paying for me to go to school worth it and for me to feel like I accomplished something for once in my life. But now, I don't know if it's going to happen. I don't even know if I'm going to be able to land ANY job when I graduate if I can't even get a paid anything right now. Applying to internships, working on projects, learning DSA all feels like a waste. Every person I see saying ""not to compare yourself to other people"" or to ""focus on yourself"" is doing better than me."

i am learning to program pretty good in html and css, now on javascript. Self taught and want to study computer science so college could pretty much be paid for. I would also become an RA or intern. and get a job. my  first job.

 the more i look into California the less appealing it is to my case since theres so much i wouldn't have the answer to until im actually living there.but that would be an entirely expensive mistake.

consulting  makes sense because  i  am an expat (American) and i  want to help others do that as my own little business nothing huge unless it goes there. computer science makes sense because of all the technical things i would fix myself but how do you get started  with consulting? im aware there are multiple fields, anything in tech sales, travel or management seems cool. I am also aware networking is a huge thing.

I already did an internship in IT (the internship was meant for MIS majors). I really enjoyed it (a lot more than I expected).

I recently started a finance internship and am not liking it as much which brings me to the questions MIS or Finance?

I think both careers are stable and lucrative, but I think tech is supposed to be high paying, better wlb, more likely to be remote (remote is a great thing imo) and not as competitive. Whereas finance I think has a higher ceiling as far as career growth and salary. Also I feel like finance may be a little more broad than MIS so that could be a good thing.

Can anybody provide me with insights to these careers? Any feedback appreciated!"
wlb6xf,1,2022-08-10,How to handle an unproductive internship?,disgruntledJavaCoder,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wlb6xf/how_to_handle_an_unproductive_internship/,"I'm a rising senior CS major who will be graduating after this school year and going into industry. I've been lucky enough to have an internship every summer, first at a small-ish company (recent IPO, after my time there) doing software development; second a research assistant position doing data processing and analysis for a professor at my school; and last summer at a small but very old company doing software development on the research team. All three were productive and ended on good terms--I chose to go elsewhere each time to get varied experience. This year, I got a software internship at a substantially larger company (~2500 employees), which I hoped would help me decide whether I want to go to a smaller company or larger company.

Unfortunately, luck wasn't with me this time. It wasn't until the **end of week 6 out of 10 weeks that I received a task to do and the access to do it,** despite asking repeatedly through many different channels. I was shuffled between three managers before I heard back from any of them. I was hired to do DevOps, but in the end I'm just doing software development, primarily related to investigating performance issues in production. From talking to people, I gathered that the DevOps team I was supposed to join had a bunch of people leave at once, including several managers, and didn't have the capacity to take an intern in the wake of all that. Worse, the team I got moved onto has been in the middle of a shitshow of a late deployment that has meant my current manager and the entire team are also very busy and haven't always been available.

I've completed a couple tasks and gotten partially done with a couple others before they were resolved elsewhere, but it leaves me with a **small list of ""things I've done"".** It sounds like I just had terrible luck with the teams because besides than me and the other intern on this team, every other intern has had a great and productive experience. My **manager, teammates, and the internship program coordinators** (recruiters/HR) have totally understood that the situation has been a mess and I've tried, and it seems like they **view me positively.** It sounds like I could easily receive a return offer to go full-time when I graduate, and could go to a different team that isn't exploding. They've also helped me talk to many people at the company to get a lot of knowledge and insight from those conversations, so it has had some benefit.

But I want to leave my options open and am more interested in other companies, so I'm not sure how to deal with the aftermath of this. I'm trying to change the job title the company says I had here so they don't say ""DevOps Intern"" when I didn't do any DevOps. I can put stuff on my resume, but unlike my other jobs if they ask about it in an interview there isn't much detail to go into beyond what's written down. **How would I handle this in an interview?** I'm sure it's a bad idea to say ""my team was crumbling so I didn't do much beyond these things.""

I like many others did a coding bootcamp 2 years ago, and have been struggling to get my first dev job.

The first person I blamed for my failure was myself, so I took it upon myself to build projects, a smart personal website, and went to tech MeetUps and industry talks. I also contacted friends working in the industry to help me with my resume and cover letters, both of which have been through about 5 iterations.

However despite all my efforts, I'm still not even getting evens interviews for 90% of my applications - all of which are for entry-level developer and test engineer roles, and I'm seeing people with no personal website and hardly any projects get jobs and internships. I've managed to get a few interviews but haven't received any job offers.

My attitude now is screw it, and I'm considered lying about working for my brother's company as a software dev - something that he'll back me up with. I generally don't like lying but after 2 years, 200+ applications and being completely broke, I feel somewhat justified in this.

Thoughts?"

I am having a hard time trying to find work. I have received a few interviews but it seems like most of these positions are looking for a masters/phd or require a lot of knowledge in RF/antenna as well which I have very little knowledge about. I did have a test engineering internship related to RF but that is the extent of my knowledge.


I have had done a lot of work with SDRs and OFDM in Matlab but I can't really seem to find positions that fit what I know. A lot of my knowledge is programming (I did a lot of projects related to javascript/html/python/C++ and microcontrollers like Arduino), and I did a little bit of work in C in terms of just implementing basic digital filters. I've also taken 2 classes in verilog/systemverilog, but have only worked with FPGAs once.


It seems like the positions I apply to, I just don't really have the skills that they are looking for. Does anyone have any tips? I kind of feel like the only option is to purse a masters or phd which I don't feel up to the task currently."

I love math, love solving problems, reading papers, figuring out answers, applying formulas, etc.. I really enjoy it, so I'm wondering if there's a career in tech that is also very math heavy. I'm thinking maybe Machine Learning, AI, (Computational Science? although idk what careers this has) but I'm not too sure about the type of work that they do.

My question would be, what careers that have these qualities do you guys recommend? Or what do ya'll recommend me to look up? Thank you!"
wlim61,1,2022-08-11,Job Advice,MasterpieceNew6549,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wlim61/job_advice/,"So before I explain what my situation is, I want to say that I understand I put myself in this position and there is no one else to blame.  I would just like some helpful advice if possible. 

Last summer, I finished up a 6 month internship at a company that hired me through my college as we have a co-op program. This was actually my second stint with this company, having worked another 6 month internship there about 2 years prior to the second one. By the end of this second internship, I was very familiar with how the company functioned and their goals, and they extended a job offer since they said they were very impressed with my work. I explained to them that although I am very grateful for the offer, I still had over a year until I graduate(I graduated a month ago in June) and wanted to keep exploring options. They completely understood and sent me an offer which gave me until the end of the year(2021) to accept. I knew that I still would not be sure of what I wanted to do by then, but I was glad that they gave me a little bit of time to decide. So, after the internship I resumed with my classes and only a couple months later found myself really struggling mentally. Long story short, one of my parents had been battling organ failure for years and was finally cleared for a transplant at the end of last year.  The donor was actually my other parent, so I had to take care of them and do everything around the house for months after the surgery. At the end of the day, I had to somehow find the energy to finish my schoolwork which was very difficult since that is the last thing that I wanted to focus on at the time. Safe to say I was not in a good place mentally. 

As months passed, my parents health returned to normal which was a huge relief for me and now I could focus on school as I would be graduating in a few months. This was around February of this year. As I was less stressed now and could focus on more, I realized that I had completely forgotten about my job offer. Since by that point, it was a couple months past the deadline, I felt horrible that I never reached out to them about what was going on and made it seem like I was intentionally not getting back to them. I convinced myself that they were probably angry at me and did not want to hear from me anymore. So, I just continued to focus on school and graduated last month. 

I have been applying and interviewing for jobs and keep thinking about their offer. As far as my relationship with the company, like I said I worked there for a year total and grew close to most people since it is a fairly small office(about 50 people). They are extremely kind and treated me like family when I worked there. Part of me thinks that I should send an email explaining my past year and everything that happened but I wouldn't know exactly how to word it without it being awkward since it had been a while. Maybe they would extend the offer again since I see it posted on job sites still? Another part of me says to just let it go and continue searching for other jobs. Like I said in the beginning, I brought this on myself, but I would like to hear others' perspectives about what I might be able to do. Thanks."

I recently spent a few days stuck on leetcode question 20 (valid parentheses). I eventually youtubed the question, watched the approach used but not the implementation, and successfully completed the question with my own implementation. 

Then I watched the video implementation and looked at how it differed from mine 

My question is - the youtubers method of solving the problem didn't even enter my head. How do I improve my ability to think through the problem? Is it simply continued trial and error, using the process as above when I get stuck? Is there a better way?

For reference I'm a self taught dev, have done one 3 month internship. I'd say I've got about a solid year of cumulative study behind me, over the past ~2 years. I definitely have an issue of being a bit stubborn/bullheaded on problems and am looking for ways to improve.

I‚Äôm inexperienced in molecular cloning, but I‚Äôm now on my twelfth (!) attempt and I‚Äôm feeling very down and it‚Äôs hard not to take it to heart. 

I‚Äôve made various mistakes along the way. Once, on attempt 9 I did something truly stupid (wrong antibiotic lol) but I caught and fixed it quickly and it just took a few extra hours. Once we ran out of a key reagent because someone left an empty tube in a box and never ordered more (it was difficult to see it was empty before I thawed it) so I had to start over. Another time the undergrad intern used all 30 vials of the bacteria I needed the morning I needed them, without informing anyone. So my fault for only checking the freezer the morning of the experiment and not immediately before starting, but also in my opinion this is a broader lab organization issue. The other times were issues by relying on protocols that were not well-optimized for my project (par for the course I guess). The latest is that I now need to re-design most of my strategy as I was following the instructions of someone who did a cloning project with the same backbone only to find that their instructions were incorrect and ignored a key gene in the vector. This is something I feel awful for not catching sooner in hindsight but again, I am inexperienced so it did not jump out to me until my PI finally noticed it today. 

I‚Äôm not repeating the same mistakes but the sheer number of mistakes on the same step of a project is making me feel like I‚Äôm the problem. It‚Äôs driving me crazy and I keep going back and forth on how much of it is my fault or just unfortunate.

TLDR: How do you guys handle the kind of mistakes where you don‚Äôt know what you can do better except gain knowledge and experience over time? How do you not cry in the shower everyday? Send help üòÇ"

I am Shivanshu, a Physics Graduate from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Mohali, Punjab, India. I did an integrated 5-year course with a Major in Physics and a Minor in Data Sciences.

I am currently trying to push a publication out of this project.

My CPI (Cumulative Performance Index) is 7.4 out of 10 and my GPA is \~ 2.96 out of 4.

My primary goal is to get into a Ph.D. Program abroad outside India, but I am also fine with getting a Pre-Doctoral Position or a Research Assistant position or an internship or a job in an overlap of Quantum Computation and Quantum Infomation (QCQI) and Artificial Intelligence(AI). I have applied to several top schools such as Max Planck Institute for The Science of Light, University of Vienna, Bristol University, TU Wien, etc., primarily in Europe so far. I have also sent emails to Professors about Ph.D. and project positions around 25-30 and have gotten rejected in every one of them, but I majorly apply to advertisements posted on Quantiki twitter or LinkedIn.

I think one of the reasons why I am getting rejected is that I don‚Äôt have concrete experience in experimental Quantum Computing, for my thesis I majorly did only data analysis and Machine Learning. The positions in this overlap are in the minority.

Another reason is my lack of previous research experience in QCQI &amp; AI. I had never touched these subjects before my MS year, earlier I did summer projects in  Theoretical Evolutionary Biology and Applied Electromagnetics and that was mostly just me reading papers, doing derivations and running some pre-existing code/simulation, and writing a report about it. I didn‚Äôt do anything new on those projects.

Now, coming to the most important reason of all, my GPA is not good enough, I have received D and C grades in courses on foundations of physics and especially Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing. For example, I have a D in Quantum Mechanics, C in Advanced Quantum Mechanics and a D in Quantum Computation and Quantum Information along with a D in Classical Mechanics and the list goes on. I didn‚Äôt use to be serious and quite distracted by extracurriculars and relationships in my 3rd and 4th year which led to this. I think even if a prof is interested in looking at my CV they get disappointed by my transcripts which eventually leads to rejection.

I have been trying to compensate for my poor GPA and lack of research experience by doing certification in QCQI and AI on Coursera &amp; Udemy, and also, on NPTEL ( which is an AICTE accredited online certification platform run by the Ministry of Education, India where Profs. From IITs, NITs, etc., take courses and you give an offline exam in the end, this seems to have more credibility, at least in Academia so that‚Äôs why I am doing this too). I regularly take part in  IBM Qiskit events such as QIskit Global Summer Schools, Quantum Challenges, and qiskit certifications, in order to improve my QC skill set so that my CV looks better.

Despite all of this, I am still getting rejections and not getting anywhere, If I could even get a paid internship or a research project in some good lab or University abroad, that would be sufficient to get me going. At least I would have my foot in the door then.

I was thinking I should try getting a job in data science first, keep on building skills and keep applying to QC companies such as IBM Quantum, Amazon Bracket, Google Quantum, Riggeti, Honeywell, etc. There are QC startups in India too so I am applying there also.

My belief is that if I can get an internship or a project or a job in the QC industry/academia and I publish some first author or second author papers along with doing certifications/hackathons online, It would improve my chances of getting into Grad School Abroad for a Ph.D. Does that make sense?

I want to what I am doing wrong or what I am missing with regard to sending Ph.D. applications abroad. What else should I do? Where else can I improve?

Although I find it somewhat interesting I've always wanted to become a trader and I'm wondering what are the best steps for me to take rn. I'm currently taking a year long break after finishing my Bachelor in Econ and Finance and planning to get into a top Msc programme for next year, however I'm unsure of what to do in the meantime. I'm considering the following moves:

1. Move a tier down ""prestige""-wise and try to move from the strategy team into financial services team - i.e. one where I'll actually have exposure to working with financial instruments and learn about stuff that I ultimately wanna do. However, I'm afraid that somehow this will harm me in uni recruitment as afaik strategy teams are viewed as the peak of hierarchy in Big 4.
2. Try to move to a MBB firm as I know some people that can refer me and hope that having that on my CV will impress university admission team and recruiters at trading firms afterwards. The downside is that I will not learn anything about markets.
3. Try to join a local IB/market risk departments of banks that are present in my city.

I'd really appreciate some guidance on that, I would love to hear from people who work as traders. Also sorry if I sound like a clown talking about 'prestige' but at this point I genuinely have no clue what do recruiters at banks look for in candidates.

Thanks"

I've been accepted into a pdip cybersecurity and software development with NUIG. Details below with questions I have if anyone here could answer it'd be a huge help

Year 1:

Semester 1: 15 ECTS

Cybersecurity Essentials

Algorithms and Data Structures¬†

OO Programming 1¬†

Semester 2: 15 ECTS

Enterprise Java Programming¬†

Secure Web Programming

Year 2:

Semester 3: 15 ECTS

Applied Cybersecurity

Database Systems¬†

Architecture, Operating Systems &amp; Networks

The course has an internship in semester 4. 


Frankly I am working ft in a more business orientated role and a bit stuck career wise. My main motivation for doing this course is gaining in demand skills, I could imagine working as a software engineer for a couple of years and then take that learning into application security but without having done much coding beyond front-end stuff and never having delved into cyber sec it's hard to say what roles actually for me. 

My questions are 

1. Is this course enough to land a junior software development role? Assuming that's what the internship is focused on. 

2. Is it possible to get internships after just a semester of coding? Really I'm prepared to sacrifice the pay I'm on now to dive into it fully. Would trying to get into helpdesk be at all feasible? I used to work in technical support and I can do networking troubleshooting but not my day to day. 

3. I read everywhere that cyber sec isn't entry friendly and have seen several posts where someone that can code is then highly valued in that industry . Am I though not missing out on not specialising in the cyber security end of things through internships or personal projects? 

4. Anyone just have high level opinions they can give on the course above? . What would you do if your current job was irrelevant to you and you just want to dive into this full time (while still turning a wage) 

Tldr: What do you think of this course and career prospects. What would you recommend to get the most out of it? 

Cheers!"

It is now about 5-6 weeks or so into this four month internship and I really don't do much of anything. Not because I am lazy, but I just do not really get well formed tasks assigned to me, and I just don't really have the context to pick up the projects on our project board. 

My team consists of 3 Staff Engineers, a Mid-Level who is pairing with the Staffs, and then myself. My manager is a Senior's dream in the sense that the manager is very hands-off, though I feel like so early in my career as a software developer that being so hands-off is not what I need. My team maintains a client library that wraps around an open-source framework, so a lot of what we do is support, and though it's easy, I don't think I am growing much. 

Though I could not be seeing the forest for the trees it just feels like I am not getting tasks, not debugging things, or not coding nearly enough. If not for me just practicing leetcode questions and doing Advent of Code, I would probably argue I don't code much at all. 

Just kind of hoping to get some insights on this because I don't have anyone in close proximity that can relate to where I am at in my career."

I am a last year student of embedded systems developer and I landed a part time back-end internship (at a start up) that I thought would help me get a competitive edge when I graduate. However the first  assignment I will be working on is to create a CI pipeline. I believe they are looking at Travis-CI to create the pipeline. However, I have little to no experience with DevOps work.

So I was merely wondering if some of you awesome DevOpsers would provide a helping hand and guide me towards the things I would need to learn to succeed. 

&amp;#x200B;

So from what I understand I will have to learn:  
\- Travis CI  
\- Docker  


and maybe also:  
\- Kubenetes (not sure)  
\- Yaml (not sure)  
\- Cloud (Azure is part of my last year at school)  


I would really appreciate any guidance on the matter so I can read up and learn before we actually start. I would really love not to be the stupidest person in the room on my first day at work haha."

**January 2022** ‚Äì Complete Bootcamp and earn certificate.

**Early March** ‚Äì get my first interview for a junior web dev job. During the interview, the senior dev said they are more concerned with cultural fit and workplace skills over technical skills. They said they love teaching juniors and can help anyone learn to code. They asked me one technical question ‚Äújust to say we covered it in the interview‚Äù and the question was ‚ÄúDo you know what a react hook is?‚Äù Which I answered ‚ÄúIn my bootcamp, we covered useState and useEffect, but I would need to look it up again to ensure that I am using them properly. I am unsure if I could just replicate it off the top of my head‚Äù and they said, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs good enough for me!‚Äù

**Mid-March 2022** ‚Äì get a follow up interview where I was told I was picked because of my cultural fit and was given a job offer. I promptly accepted it out of excitement and it being a much better pay and remote work, both of which were goals of mine when starting that bootcamp. Put in my two weeks notice and got beyond excited I was breaking out into an industry I wanted to be in instead of where I was currently working

**Late March** ‚Äì start my job. Just like every green, entry level dev from any bootcamp, I was asking a lot of questions and feeling like a burden.

**Mid-April** ‚Äì working every day to try to get better but asking fewer questions because I felt like I was constantly disappointing and burdening the senior. The senior has stopped doing pair programming with me and just throwing tasks at me. I was working on a task that should have taken like an hour to do, but I am taking all day because I am unsure what to do and trying everything. The next morning, reach out and the senior is kind of angry with me for not getting it done and points me in the right direction. As soon as they do that, I finish that task in an hour or so.

**Late April** ‚Äì I am working on a task and reach out for help. The senior points out that I had a bad syntax error in my if statement and asks ‚ÄúHow do you think this is going‚Ä¶?‚Äù We have a short meeting where I promise I am trying my best and will continue to do so daily to get better and their response is ‚ÄúBut how long is that going to take‚Ä¶‚Äù The meeting ended and I had a terrible feeling.

**Early May** ‚Äì I am working hard to get better every day as promised. I am completing tasks a little quicker than before and am attending meetings where we are discussing the future of the company, and I am being asked questions and input on projects in the future. I am starting to feel better and not like I could get let go at any moment. I finish a task towards the end of a day and ask the senior which task to work on next hoping that they give me the easier of the two tasks presented. They end up giving me the much harder task that a junior wouldn‚Äôt be able to complete in a day by any means. I work on that task as best as I can for the rest of the day, and the next morning. I reach out about 9am asking for help, an hour later the senior calls a meeting and lets me go almost 2 weeks exactly from the meeting in April that made me worried for my job.

**Today** ‚Äì 3 months, 70+ applications (not including the 100+ I originally sent out from January to March) later, and 0 job offers, several rejection emails, still unemployed. I don‚Äôt live in a big city that has a lot of entry level or internships on site. I have reworked my portfolio to be better, started working on a passion project, and another website for a different company that a friend owns. I am just disheartened by all of this and am starting to wonder if I even should have done the bootcamp in the first place.

I know that I need to keep applying and keep coding to get better. I know that what I went through isn't necessarily the normal. It has just been 3 months and I am starting to lose faith. I guess this necessarily isn't a question, just sort of a way to vent. Has anyone else experienced something like this? How did you get past it?  


Edit: added an actual question at the end of the vent post."

I love to program and enjoy the project, but environment is grossing me out. Is that normal in the industry? 

Also another question is can  I privately make same project with my own vision and perhaps sell it or open source it because I made every single line of code and in the agreement we never mentioned any licensing or anything of that sorts?

I‚Äôve never thought that I am superior to her or my project is better than hers. FYI, she is a hard worker and super smart, I‚Äôve respected her even though she is mean to me.

However, she sometimes looks down on me, saying ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand what business is‚Äù or ‚Äú You don‚Äôt know anything about sales, do you?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you motivated enough to handle your project?‚Äù, ‚Äú I don‚Äôt understand what you are talking about‚Äù in a mean way.

The problem is she pretends to be nice to me when my boss, COO/CBO, is around. And when they are gone, she started talking with me in a mean way.

I really don‚Äôt know how to protect myself.

Are internships are part of CPT, and does that interfere with OPT or would I still be eligible for both?

In few months I will start college but I have been learning to program for a while specifically full stack Web Development through Node Js for the Backend and I'm also learning Fronend, since I want to move back to the US after college i want to be as employable as possible and while I plan of increasing my skill level before college is done experience isn't something my environment offers so I can't do internships in Iraq. So if I wanted to apply to Us/no-Us internships while passing the requirements, how would the process go? Do I get immediately rejected based on where I'm from or can I only apply to remote jobs and in case I could and I get accepted is it reasonable to live through my salary to live where I got accepted?

wmg7ee,0,2022-08-12,Fresh Graduate Salary,irlminion,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/wmg7ee/fresh_graduate_salary/,"How accurate are those annual surveys posted by universities detailing the mean and median salaries of fresh graduates from various courses?

My current salary is currently a couple of hundreds below the published mean and median, but I‚Äôm wondering if it could be because I studied Business (Marketing) and the published salaries are for Business graduates as a whole - I assume Banking and Business Analytics students earn way more thus pushing up the mean and median.

Another question: I graduated only this year, but am currently on my second job. I had to leave my first company after 2 months due to a company restructuring, and am now working in an MNC. When I was applying for jobs and had pre-screening calls with recruiters, many mentioned they will not be able to offer me my current pay (not even that high, only $3.5k) and I may only be able to hit that amount with commission etc. Hence when I applied for this MNC, I indicated expected salary as $3.5k-$4k as I was worried that they may not even want to proceed with my interview if their budget was $3.5k (according to Glassdoor, the salary for my current role seems to be around $3.3k but  this may not be accurate as a lot of my colleagues do seem to be pretty well off financially). When I eventually got the offer for $3.5k, I had wanted to negotiate for a slightly higher pay but before I could, the recruiting manager already mentioned that she did try to request for a higher compensation package but it was not granted as I have no experience, hence I did not proceed with any negotiation attempts. What I want to know is, was I wrong to have written $3.5k as the minimum range in the first place, should I have negotiated or was $3.5k really the most they could offer me? The only difference is that there is a confirmed 13th month bonus for this role. This role is a much more comprehensive version of an internship I‚Äôve done before, but I do not have much other experience besides my internship, although I did dabble in other roles previously which would help me to hone the interpersonal skills I would need for my current role.

I was initially pretty okay with this tbh but looking at some of my friends earn $3.8k (thanks to 10% increase in civil servant salary) while doing almost nothing (in their own words), compared to myself earning $3.5k and having to put in long hours is really casting doubts in my mind :(

Sorry for the long rant, but I would really welcome any input on this matter and please feel free to ask questions to understand my situation better. Thanks in advance!

Tldr;
1. Are salary guides published by universities accurate? What is the current market rate for fresh marketing grad from local Uni now?
2. Should I expect a pay increase if I switch jobs after 2 months due to company restructuring?"

Then January hits and I look for a job like job itself and I‚Äôve never seen sooo many rejections in my life. Applied to internships and they wanted me be in school. Unfortunately the internships I had lined up cancelled due to covid (summer 2021) even though I already had two done in 2019

I got an interview done back in April and I had landed the job but 2 weeks later they tell me it‚Äôs on hold. Three jobs emailed me telling me they were cancelled. So this is just making me even more nervous because what will happen next?! 

I‚Äôve also done the LinkedIn connection and talking to recruiters but they all just send me the link to job posting and say have a nice day.

Anyways if anyone could please help me find a job or land something it would be wonderful. I majored in information systems and I want to get into cybersecurity."
wmgxdv,0,2022-08-12,An Adulting Alumni's Salty Screed: Extra-Curricular Activities,joyyzybp,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/wmgxdv/an_adulting_alumnis_salty_screed_extracurricular/,"Of all things I had to look at after graduation through multiple channels I am still subscribed to for some reason - Telegram, Instagram - I see notice about       
1: the first in-person Student Life Fair since Covid and       
2: the groups and booths at said SLF.  
Congratulations and good on the Student Life Fair to be back as an in-person event.        
  
I thought to see what groups were there and which activities/teams made up the groups. Of all the groups I had to look up, I went to see the sports one - which I suppose is mainly teamNUS sports groups - and among the groups that involved the pool I see Water Polo saying they have ""a recreational team (new!)"". Since it was not on the eBooklet, I went to check Instagram for Swimming, and lo and behold, they now also have one - though apparently fastest fingers first as the Instagram says they have filled out the recreational quota, and now they are now only open for the play-to-win team.        
  
There will be no regard for the other activity groups (CAC, CFA, Interest Groups). Here is my experience visiting the booths at SLF for my first two years.        
  
When I went to the student life fair in Year One, I sure did not remember any recreational team for Swimming or Water Polo. The requirement for Swimming was experience competing at the club level - I didn't have that. I don't remember looking too in-depth for Water Polo, and I don't remember any mention of welcoming newcomers, at least for those who know how to swim, but did not have prior Water Polo experience. I get the feeling that maybe competitive swimmers would be more welcome than those who did not have any prior experience at the competitive level for any of the two water sports.        
  
Year Two, I remember one of those two activities did not set up a booth, or if they did, it was just a notice on a board on a table in the sports hall on what to do. So nope, fuhgeddaboudit.        
  
Years Three and Four would be very different.        
  
Year Three Semester One I was on internship, could not visit the main days of SLF, and the weekend one was probably half-effed, so thought it was pointless. Doubt joining in Year Three Semester Two would be a thing unless they really had openings for mid-Acad Year, or perhaps if one was connected enough with a member/insider to try and get the person in. Of course, ultimately, those were not even worth considering as that semester ended up being lit in the wrongest way possible.         
  
Year Four was full Covid version Heightened Alert, and managing last few modules and year project. Wouldn't be the same experience as pre-covid due to the restrictions.        
  
Were there other options I could have considered? Perhaps, such as Lifeguard Corps or Aquathlon, but even then, they did not look like good alternatives. For Lifeguard Corps, mainly specifically for getting the Lifesaving 1,2,3 and Bronze Medallion certifications - yay paper chase - and then maybe buzzing off and not bothering with the competition aspect of Lifesaving. For Aquathlon, not keen on the running part, was keener on the pool/swimming part. Considering things like IPPT though - such as the 2.4km run - I guess I was too narrow-minded to think of that as an ok alternative. Then again, I was willing to acknowledge not being competitive in terms of swimming, land sports wise I have written off and did not see any hope of improving, which reduced the desirability of this alternative.        
  
On to what I think of the (new!) recreational teams for the above-mentioned sports.         
  
The more charitable and growth-mindset oriented part of me would like to think that the recreational teams could become part of a development pathway/pipeline/team for those who, before university, did not get the opportunity to take part at the competitive level (for Swimming), or at all (for Water Polo), and are considering/keen on improving/taking part. If there are other sports teams with this thing already going on, then I guess that would be a good reference.         
  
The more cynical and jaded part of me thinks that the recreational teams could go awry in a few ways. The first way is for those who are at the competitive level to just ease off, even though they could possibly handle the rigour of the varsity level training. The second way/purpose I can think of is as justification for more funding to be piped into the activity just because the membership/team size is now larger. The third way (could be related to the second way/purpose) is that the recreational team is relegated to second-class-citizen status and there is no structure/pipeline for development/not as much.        
  
I suppose I'll tune back in after the end of the academic year to see if there are any updates.        
  
If you are in Year Three or Year Four, I guess at this stage you should just focus on your graduation requirements (internship, final year project) and/or maintaining (or raising) your CAP. Or actually maybe not, since your first/middle two years were Covid-ed and now you have the opportunity to have these things in-person, and you might be considering to make up for the lost time (and join an activity you have been thinking about).        
  
Back to being a cog in the economic machine and hoping that thoughts about working and adulting overwhelm the 'what-ifs'/'what-could-have-been'.        
  
Optional Change My View: Show me it is possible for a full-time employee to still be able to take part in swimming lessons and maybe even swimming competitions."

However I feel like I am getting pigeonholed in my position at the moment, I feel like I have reached the knowledge of people that have more years of experience than me and I feel a bit burned out and bored from this work although it pays decently. 
Since there aren't many hardware related positions were I live I have been wanting to move into software development. However I am not sure in what field exactly I should be trying to move to. I have some scripting experience with python and tcl and some shell scripts. And I have started learning a bit of web development with python but I haven't learned much yet. 
I had applied to some internships and entry level jobs but I didn't get any offers, and one internship I couldn't start due to my notice period in the current position.
At the moment I think I would be more interested in something like backend development, or I am not sure how to explain it, but software that is used for things like EDA, but I am not quite sure about these things.
I think I have a option to start as a mobile intern with progression to a junior Mobile development after completing the internship. But I am wondering if this will be the right fit for me as I don't have experience with it at all. How easy would it be to move to other development branches if this doesn't work out or I don't enjoy it? Is it worth it to try it at all or am I better with sticking to personal projects and get a few done before choosing what to apply?
Keep in mind as a while there aren't many entry level software positions in my country, especially in my town."
wmioh6,6,2022-08-12,My Manager Keeps Backpedaling and Shifting the Goalposts,AReallySadWolf,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/wmioh6/my_manager_keeps_backpedaling_and_shifting_the/,"So I got into this company as a HR intern, and before I started working, I had a call with the HR assistant manager where he told me that if I performed well, they might even consider converting me into a permanent staff after one month. So I said okay.

And on day one, my manager told me to learn the HR tasks (payroll, onboarding, offboarding, etc.) for several different countries as we're a multinational company. And on one occasion, when I was talking to the HR assistant manager, (I forgot the context, but) I brought up what he said previously about converting me after one month. He said he never said that and that one month is too short. And so I just assumed I misheard him.

So I started with one country. While I was learning how to process the payroll, which is the most difficult task according to them (my supervisor, manager, etc.), the HR assistant manager told me that if I can pull this off on my own the next month, he said he ""can't see why I'm can't be converted into a permanent staff"". And so during my 1st month, I learned everything seriously. I even created a manual for the payroll process that no one has ever done previously.

And on the 2nd month, they let me process the payroll on my own. And not only did I pull it off, I even made an overhaul to the Excel file that we were using to smooth out the process. And both my supervisor and HR assistant manager told me that they were very impressed by what I've done. And so I happily waited for them to convert me.

The 2nd month has passed, but I haven't received a word from any of them. Entering the 3rd month, which is this month, still nothing. I started growing impatient. So today, I asked the HR assistant manager when will they convert me. He acted as if he forgot what he said previously and told me to refer to the HR manager. So I went to the HR manager and asked him, he then brought the HR assistant manager in to join the discussion and proceeded to tell me that after discussing with the HR assistant manager, he can't convert me because I haven't learn every country's HR tasks yet, and the HR assistant manager agreed.

I was baffled. I wanted to bring up what the HR assistant manager promised me previously but was too scared to do so, because I assumed he'd just say he never said that. So I asked if they could at least give me a temporary contract. They said they are not allowed to do so since I'm still under an internship, but I feel like they're saying that because they didn't want to, not because they're not allowed. There's no law in my country saying an intern can't be converted into a permanent staff during internship. And so I kept my cool and left the meeting.

Right now, I just feel like I got scammed over and over again. I honestly took this internship very seriously and tried to achieve beyond expectations on every task given. And I've received compliments from my supervisor, HR assistant manager and HR manager on multiple occasions which proves that I'm on the right track. But now I feel like everything I've done previously have gone to waste. What's the point of putting in the extra effort if all I ever did was chasing a carrot forever dangling in front of me?

Sure, I could just forget it and find a new job after my internship. But tbh it feels really awful when people keep breaking their promises again and again, especially when it's related to something important in your life. I want to get hired as soon as possible to support my family and pay off my student loan and hopefully someday, I can save enough money to further study.

I really don't get why people keep making false promises like these? Like why not just say that I'll only be converted if I've every country's HR tasks? At least I know the exact goal that I'll need to strive for. And now I don't even know if I can trust them or anyone in the company anymore..."

Only been a week since it all ended, so I still have yet to really work through my network and contacts to see what's available. Still, thought I'd also throw some thoughts into this reddit for what advice they have, since my initial job applications do still show the same old problem of ""can't get a job unless you're the perfect candidate with 1000+ years of experience, but you can't get that experience, knowledge, and/or training when there's no opportunity to move up the ladder."" All ready got a few rejections, one of which surprised me; hence, why I'm fishing to see what reddit has to say, despite it honestly being a little premature for me to do so.  


Looking to remain in the niche of scientific programming. Mostly looking for ""Software engineer"" jobs in various cities, since stuff like ""scientific programmer"" doesn't come up too often. Have checked out some DoD support jobs, but quite a number of them seem to want clearance and/or C++ experience, both of which I lack. Was advised to take a looksie at the national labs, but I haven't much pursued that further: seems like most research labs are in the same spot of ""entry level position / support positions are mega-competitive, and/or we want PhDs"". I've got a network at my internship and I liked the area, but for personal reasons (which I'd rather not discuss), I've been prioritizing looking in other locations.  


So ... where am I going wrong in my search or networking? Or do I just need to hear that ""nope, nothing wrong, you're doing everything right, it's just the nightmare economy we live in.""

I'm the president of my university's cybersecurity club at Assumption University in Worcester, MA. We started the club last year and got officially recognized as a student club at the end of the spring semester so this is the first academic year where we will be able to really promote and grow the club.

We have a community outreach portion where we help students, faculty, and local orgs with advice and assessments. We also brought in a few speakers last October to talk to students about careers, internships, certs, etc. We started doing ctf trainings with picoCTF last year and we've put in a request with the school for a Hack the Box subscription and I plan to have us go to a few competitions. We also ran a wifi ctf for local high school students and we're starting a github account for the club when we resume in the fall.

My question for you all is what would you have liked to see done if you had a club like this when you were learning? What orgs should I be reaching out to? What resources do you all recommend for students to learn and expand their skills?

Thanks in advance!"

The American education system has its pros, but from the primary system all the way through the secondary system there are serious issues, and it seems like no one wants to address them. Student Debt is not an issue. It's not a conundrum, it's not a problem without a solution. Student Debt is what it is, debt financing for individuals seeking an education from an american university/college.

If you want to get into all the problems with our k-12 system, including a state funded system that allows for certain states and cities to fall dangerously behind the rest of the country. My mother is a high school teacher at a public high school. I've had friends teach in the teach for america system, and friends teach after studying at a private 4 year catholic institution, willing to chat.

If you want to get into the problems with our college system, I'll let everyone else talk about the crazy rise in cost, that doesn't match inflation, or the mass expansion of student services, meaning actual academic staff/faculty aren't getting paid steady with the cost of college either. We can debate those merits sure.

But let's be clear, the secondary education system, coupled with the student debt industry, has created a predatory system that manipulates the have nots further into proving their worth in this country. At this point, I'll explain that I'm probably privileged when it comes to this issue. I didn't grow up wealthy, I won't say poor, but all my friends were better off than me if I'm being honest. But I was smart, got into a good catholic school in an industrial city in the midwest. I studied accounting, and got a job out of college at a big 4 accounting firm in a major us/international market. My second job almost doubled my salary, and I'm paid a lot to do 'skilled' labor that allows me fully wfh capabilities. I borrowed nearly 6 figures for the pleasure of all this, and while my payments are no issue, I also went into significant amounts of credit card debt to afford other college expenses. Something that I didn't really have the means to support until I started getting internships. But for a while I was making $9-11/hour with maxxed out credit cards and accumulating debt. My school mandated students must live on campus for 2 years. So my sophomore year, my parents couldn't afford as much as freshman year and I was forced to work full time (between 2 jobs) and make monthly payments of $800 to cover my tution. My room &amp; board cost was over $1300/month. When I paid rent junior and senior year I was paying $475 and $500, for rather large places with good location and proximity to campus.  Now room and board covers food as well, but I definitely didn't spend $300/month on groceries when living off campus. And definitely not almost $1k/month on groceries and 'student services'. Now some of you may be saying didn't have to do that, and you're 100% right. But I live in a state where there are only two public universities, meaning I only had 2 chances at in-state tuition. Neither of these institutions rank in the top 200 according to US News. So why am I only allowed to go to those schools for instate tuition?? 

Anyways, it's obvious universities/colleges overcharge students for everything. Living expenses, textbooks, individual credit hours, etc. etc. etc. They offer some facilities in return (I was very grateful for our on campus health clinic), but again I don't think it makes up for the amount they overcharge. 

And this is where student debt becomes a problem. Because the federal government is essentially guaranteeing a certain amount of student debt financing, and paying it up front the universities are raising the cost. I guess that's opinion that I don't have data to necessarily support, but it seems to track with me, at least be coincidence. Secondly though, the private market is also seeing the opportunity of making money off young adults, and the  higher the cost of college, the higher the balance, and the higher the interest revenue. Again could all be coincidence, but I think private lenders have proven time and again they actually aren't concerned with risk. So you have these schools who are saying, hell yea, we're getting tuition up front from lending institutions, and we don't have to deal with collection. Let's admit more students, raise prices, and make a shit load of money. A lot of schools are not for profit, so technically these excess funds just feed these endowments, but I'd be surprised if most institutions actually struggle with having enough funds, haven't really read that in the news. I know my school has a massive endowment.

So, like I said the system is predatory, because no one in this system is actually concerned with your education, the institution or the lender. They just want you in the door, I think some people joke that they'll let anyone pay for law school, and I think that's become true about higher education in general. So, how much debt is there, well according to US News, $1.5 trillion in total debt to about 40 million borrowers as of Jan 2020, so I'm sure there's been significant reductions in both categories with some of Biden's debt cancellation. Relative to annual spending, in 2021 the Federal Government spent $6.82 trillion. That's who we owe $1.5 trillion too, a government that spends almost 6x that every year. In total, they spent $173 billion on higher education. Which is less than 3% of total expenditures. And again, that money has already been spent!! They paid it up front, that's what some of that $173 billion is, it's new notes receivables paid out to higher education institutions. So it wouldn't be a $1.5 trillion expense this year, it would be added to the cumulative debt, which sits at $30.6 trillion. Not to mention in 2021 they added $2.8 trillion in total losses to that amount. So again, $1.5 trillion, which is already in the debt figure technically as annual losses, is about 1/2 of one year's total loss, 1/5 of total annual spending. And it represents debts accumulated by over 40 million Americans for the last 50+ years.

If we don't pay our debt it won't affect the US economy. The money was already spent, and the federal government hasn't been receiving payments for almost 2 years anyway. The amount repaid each year prior to 2020 must not have been significant because it isn't listed or mentioned categorically the same way higher education expenses are in cbo annual review. So they're losing small amounts of revenue when they've been spending and adding trillions to the national debt annually for the past 4 Presidents, and hundreds of billions annually for the past 6. They can live without my monthly payment. In contrast, many many borrowers will get squeezed by these payments coming due. Many won't qualify for the various programs, and will be on the hook. 

President Biden said he would get rid of partial amounts of debt, I believe he's specifically stated $10k, multiple high ranking senators think $50k is appropriate. In short, many of our public officials agree that these debts are unreasonable for us to bear, and I think they would appreciate us taking this into our own hands. That is all, I'm sure my facts could be off, my financial data came from the CBO and [usaspending.gov](https://usaspending.gov). Everything else is off the cuff."

The problem is I don't have that much experience or qualifications for a job in IT. I like tech and I did do a 1 year internship at a computer repair shop back in 2015. I did various computer repair like virus removal, installing cleaning programs, cleaned hard drives, cleaned out PCs, and answered phone calls. My highest level of education is some college but no degree. I want to know how can I learn to get into IT and how can I teach myself online? What are some IT jobs I could get into now?"

How do people stand out then? Like do y'all do mega-crazy projects on your own time or have published research papers/patents? Or at that point, does it just come down to a question of whether you're from HYPSMC or not?"
wmop5g,0,2022-08-12,Am I learning too much as a PhD student??,BobbyWOWO,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/wmop5g/am_i_learning_too_much_as_a_phd_student/,"Some background information: So I am just starting my fourth year as a PhD student doing a materials science PhD. I've been working with a Chemistry professor on battery materials and overall I've been really enjoying the work. Due to some extenuating circumstances, I haven't been able to complete my preliminary oral exam yet, but my PI and I have just put the date on the books. Overall, we have a good working relationship and our boundaries are communicated well. 

My problem stems from the breadth of knowledge I've come into over the past 4ish years. My background is in materials engineering. I've worked internships where I've gotten material systems to work for specific applications, but the depth of chemistry behind those discoveries were unimportant - just enough to get everything to work. I chose the lab I work in now because I like the materials system and my PI is at the stage past theory and into application testing - PERFECT. My PI being a chemist wanted me to know more chemistry than I did which was fine because I only took like one class of chemistry in undergrad so I knew I needed to know more. Anyways, my project has evolved in many ways over the years and I've needed to do many characterization techniques, syntheses, and device fabrication to get the data I need for my papers.

This includes 
   -Many electrochemical techniques 
   -Solid state and liquid state diffusion
   -Surface chemistry
   -Solvation dynamics
   -Xray diffraction
   -Organic Syntheses and characterization
   -high temperature inorganic syntheses 
   -X-ray absorption spectroscopy 
   -DFT and DFT Software
   -Python Programming 

Ive collected most of this data on my own which has been really cool and rewarding. I honestly love the results and progress Im making. The issue is, My PI told me that I should be able to answer deep questions regarding any piece of data that I share with my committee. I understand enough to draw conclusions, but past that I am at a loss. Other people in my group have great depth of knowledge on some of these subjects, but their breadth is probably not as wide as mine. 

Anyways - what do you think? Does my PI expect too much from me, or should I suck it up and start reading some textbooks?"

wmrwy6,2,2022-08-12,Should I take the return offer or slow down?,SwordBreaker23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wmrwy6/should_i_take_the_return_offer_or_slow_down/," 

This summer I interned at a company that is offering me a full time position as UX Designer for August of 2023. It pays quite competitively, and my TC as a new hire would meet my personal expectations. They are based out of Seattle, my home city and location of education. They also seem to value and prioritize user experience, my designs never have been snubbed or shelved. I had the opportunity to work on designs that ACTUALLY mattered and had the chance to work on ""real"" projects.

All in all it seems like a no brainer to accept and is a great way to break into the industry, a looming and significant obstacle in my way.

However, a part of me doesn't want to take the offer.

If I reject or postpone the offer, they said they would keep me in the system as ""recommended"" but I'm guessing I would have to interview again.

To start, I am only 19yo and would be graduating in June of 2023 (at 20), the end of my Third Year. Sometimes I wonder what the point is in graduating so early. I am fortunate enough to be able to afford my education between scholarships, work, and this internship. I'm not accruing any debt, and taking a fourth year would mean, for me, just being broke another year. I've taken full 18 credit quarters for the past four consecutive terms and my first year was entirely virtual. Maybe I'm missing some parts of college by going so fast and early?

But more importantly, taking this offer feels like settling. It's secure and comfortable but is that what I want? It's not a company that is known for its UX, neither a place that curries a significant amount of prestige. And the payment is good and is 100% amazing relative to all jobs, but it's not top-notch by the standards of tech. But with another year, another internship cycle, maybe I could get something much better, somewhere I'd really love to work at.

Is it worth taking the risk to get something I really want or should I just take what I can get at this stage?"

I was reading a popular post on this sub explaining what someone should do and review before an interview? The only issue is the post assumed I just graduated with cs degree. I feel like I should be doing more that that because I‚Äôm not cs major. This is the post I was talking about.

Thanks in advance for all the feedback.

Edit #1

I forgot to also mention I‚Äôve been working on a mobile game for about a year. It‚Äôs an android simulation game. Would that help me get any potential internships? I used this program called Game Maker 2. The engine uses something called the game maker language which is very similar to python, but also has arrays and stuff. So it was pretty easy for me to pickup python."

Quality managers, developers, technicians, and plant workers, to name a few. When a notice is put in, sometimes a counteroffer is made that is in the tens of thousands higher. Only once has that been successful. Today was the last day for someone who has been here a decade. There was a big farewell party that was extremely conspicuous, though he left for a while and didn‚Äôt seem to be moved. The person they are asking to replace him (for no extra money) threw a public fit. I give her a few weeks, tops.

I decided back in June that I was done being underpaid. I signed a contract for 20% more money and 5 more vacation days. I want to drop the notice today but can‚Äôt, since the start date is so soon and I‚Äôm not done with background checks. Odds are they won‚Äôt get a proper notice. Part of me feels bad but they jerked me around in the beginning and I basically had to take the job to survive. That was in 2020 and times have changed. Once I go my department will be drastically slowed down and I wouldn‚Äôt take a counteroffer even if they made one.

The guy who heads this site is‚Ä¶not taking it seriously. He said God will work it out. They lose one more developer and new products grind to a stand still. They can‚Äôt hire new techs to save their lives. They are holding onto summer interns part time! And of course there‚Äôs the old chestnut of nobody wanting to work. Sure they do. They‚Äôre leaving for companies that pony up before you have a foot out the door! Maybe God‚Äôs plan is the invisible hand! Stupid."

It's my first real job and I'm basically acting as my boss' assistant. Everything regarding the job is mostly ok, although my boss is 10 times more serious than I am, she also lax when it comes to punctuality.

I've worked here 1 month so far, but the gist is this: I have tickets to a concert in September, out of town. I bought those tickets in December, back when I didn't know if I would even land an internship in the first place. I bought the plane tickets back in April and they're non-refundable.

My flight is on Friday mid afternoon, and the flight back is on Sunday. Sadly I work full time on weekdays and only Saturday mornings on the weekends, so I would be needed at the office either way. My boss doesn't know of the concert.

I don't want to lie to her. One of my friends suggested I fake an illness and have a trusted doctor sign a medical excuse in case she won't let me go, but the guilt would eat me alive if I did. I just want to be honest with her, but I'm also afraid she won't let me go (understandably). If anything, I'd be willing to work on-site Friday morning and from the hotel on Saturday so she won't be left alone and I can still help as much as I can.

I really don't want to miss the concert. It's my favorite band and I've never seen them live.

What's the best way to ask my boss for permission? Do you really think she'd let me go considering I bought everything almost a year in advance?

I'd appreciate the advice!!"

**Undergrad**: Combined honours CPSC and mathematics at University of British Columbia (Canada)
 - 85.9% GPA overall, 90.2% CPSC average.
 - 100% in a 400-level theory of computation course, 98% in a grad programming languages course. 
 - Taking a graduate compilers course this spring.

**Internships**: None

**Research Experience**:
 - Summer research in math, led to coauthor in paper in differential equations, published in M3AS (H-index: 83). Coauthor on another paper which is submitted. 
 - Summer research in PL, working on Rust verification in collaboration with some people at ETH Zurich. Likely will continue into the next year, and am looking into contributing to Rust itself. No plans for publication as of writing this. 
 - Attends PL reading group, have presented a paper to the group before (and am likely doing another one again soon).

**Teaching Experience**:
 - TA for 100-level math course and 300-level software engineering course
 - Possibly running an undergraduate PL reading group this year

**Projects**: I'm not really sure what counts as a good project: https://github.com/markusdemedeiros

**GRE**: Not taking this exam.

**Schools**: In order of preference: UW, Purdue, UCSD, Waterloo, IU Bloomington, UBC (maybe safer, since I know many of the active the PL faculty personally?), Brown, UofT, UAlberta.

I know nothing useful about networking or cybersecurity and I really like coding stuff. Plus I will start getting paid like next month. The big company also pays to their interns but not as much ofcourse.

I have little idea about what direction I should take. I worked my ass of to get an interview with the big company, and they were so kind, helpful and now I am getting cold feet maybe? Is that company worth switching from software to IT?

Here‚Äôs some background. M Engg CS and MPS infosciences are 1 year programs at Cornell.

Educational Background: Tier 2 Institute, 3.49/4 cgpa, undergrad in computer science, my institute graded us out of 4 directly, so i guess i cannot change it to weighted cgpa or anything 

Work exp: 2 years as a software engineer at Microsoft right now, Intern at a local startup, Intern at another startup which included others things more than software development, like market research, making a pitch deck of the product, etc

Research paper publications: none

Projects: Good projects for a CS background

GRE and toefl : yet to give, will b done by September (would like to know what‚Äôs safe to target)

LORs: 2 profs, one with research and one with entrepreneurial background, 1 manager from work.

I will be applying for universities and programs as well ofcourse, where they will be safe options, wont bet everything on cornell. I will do whatever i can to increase my chances of getting into these programs. 

If someone can share sample SOPs for reference for an ambitious uni like this, that would be great. Also kindly suggest any other 1 year programs related to CS or Product management in good universities

Let me know if this post is irrelevant here as I see other posts like this here usually are after they have gre score and everything."

wn64eu,1,2022-08-13,Exited the pandemic with 3 years experience at a movie theater and not much else. What should I do now?,Danielnrg,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wn64eu/exited_the_pandemic_with_3_years_experience_at_a/,"I've been zigzagging between asking the theater I worked at for my old job back, or applying at the other theater in my city. I don't have the education or experience to expect much else, and I can't imagine working at a drive-thru place. 

Now, I don't have anything against drive-thru places, it's just that I have nightmares about talking to people remotely in any way. I have social anxiety, and as hard as it is for me to talk to people in person, it's even harder to talk to them on the phone or any sort of remote device. I did an internship with GAP in high school, and having to listen to people barking orders at me over earpiece gave me panic attacks. 

I have a high school degree, so that limits me to the minimum wage service industry for now. I really liked working at the movie theater until they closed when the pandemic started. The way I see it, I have two realistic choices: try to get my old job back, or apply at the other theater in town.

The first option is not ideal for several reasons: firstly, the fact that I declined their offer to come back when they first offered back in fall 2020. I had a feeling they'd be shut down again, and I didn't see the point in working for 2 months only to lose my job again. I happened to be right, as businesses shut down again at the start of 2021. When they reopened in March 2021, I wasn't contacted. I see this as a personal slight against me, and question whether my old employers would even want me back or really deserve to have me back after they discarded me just because I wouldn't come back for 2 months and get fired again. There's also the matter of whether I'd be more anxious about meeting entirely new people or meeting people I haven't seen for 2 years, which I haven't figured out yet and won't without actually experiencing it for myself. 

The second option is equally terrifying, but for altogether different reasons. I have to meet new people, but I also have to adapt to a new working environment. The one thing my old job has going for it is I know the environment. I know the building, I worked there for almost 3 years. Working at an entirely new place brings its own hurdles. 

I have enough money saved up to live on my current budget for around a year, potentially longer. I don't need a job tomorrow, I don't need one next month or 6 months from now. But I'm starting to go stir-crazy, and I'm genuinely concerned about the effect 2+ years of total isolation will/is having on my mental health. I need a job, but I don't want to put myself into a situation that is just unneeded stress. 

I've considered online schooling, but I missed my chance about a year ago when all schooling needed to be done online, and it wouldn't have helped my massive deficit in social interaction. As much as I don't like social interaction in theory, I'm a human and I'm going crazy without it. I also don't have a car, so all my schooling would need to be done online until I get one (just one more reason why I should've gotten my degree during the pandemic).

So I'm kinda stuck. A big problem is the fact that I have enough money to last jobless for as long as I can. It allows me to procrastinate getting a job. The last time I was jobless, I was in massive debt and couldn't pay rent. I could sure use an impetus like that right now, because relying on my own personal desires to get a job isn't enough to overcome my fears. I guess I'm more of a ""crisis"" person. Once I exhaust my savings I'm sure I'll take whatever job I can get. But those savings would be put to better use buying a car instead of just paying rent for a year."

But she often compares me to my dad when I don‚Äôt do simple chores, on the computer all day, not ‚Äúspeaking the truth‚Äù when it comes to an itsy bitsy matter.

Yeah I tell her all about my hopes and dreams and goals to secure an internship but it just doesn‚Äôt seem to stick and goes one ear and out the other. She‚Äôs too frantic and simply disregards my mental health most of the time. I can‚Äôt really move out as she covers all the expenses but I can‚Äôt help but feel alone as I can‚Äôt really get into deep matters with her.

When I tell her how I feel, it‚Äôs like she always tells me to be in her shoes and understand the pain she went through in order to justify that I don‚Äôt deserve to feel.

I'm still gonna be looking at abroad and will give GRE and TEOFL and all that jizz. But what about India?

By my research online I could be eligible for CMI for all their Masters programme provided I clear their entrance exam. Could anyone confirm this? What about ISI?  And other colleges in India that'd allow me to do the same? Data Science is also another Masters program I'm exploring as of now. 

Since I'm planning to apply abroad as well, my overall profile is extremely important so I'm working on that as well. I'm currently doing a public policy research internship (it utilises a statistical analysis a lot) and am also in the process of starting a Python ""bootcamp"" course (offered by a program where students of my uni can do edx and udemy certified courses for free) because programming obviously takes you a long way in both econ and math. Would all of this help for Masters applications in top colleges in India? I know for undergrads its all about exams and marks but is it the same for Masters? 

My qualifications:

IBDP (grade 12) 43/45.
IGCSE (grade 10) Aggregate (top 5) A*"

I traveled through North America for 6 months: Mexico (Puerto Vallarta), US (AZ, OR, WA - Loved Seattle so much), and Canada (BC, ON, QC, NS- Loved Vancouver and Ottawa). 

The situation in Argentina is not very positive. Inflation rate is estimated to be 90% by the end of this year, and, compared to Canada, this country is quite dirty. 

I had to come back because my backpack was stolen (wallet, computer). Besides I was running out of money (6 months traveling wasn't free, but worth it!).

Now my idea is to get a new computer and save some money. I was thinking of moving to another country in December/January. 

Where would you go if you were me? I have an Argentinian passport and another one from Italy. I speak Spanish, English, French, Italian and a little of German. As for work, I studied Information Systems Engineering (not finished) and I finished a 6-months internship for IBM in Automation. 

Even though I would love to live in Seattle or Vancouver, going through the process of getting a visa in the US or Canada seems quite difficult."

I'm applying for Fall '23 cycle for MS CS in US universities (namely Columbia, NYU, Princeton and Cornell and a backup school) and I wanted to get in touch with professors in these schools to try establishing a connection for a possible supervisor. I have made a list of professors whose research aligns with my interests and noted their accomplishments and projects as well.

1. Now my question is, what should be my main talking points when emailing these professors? Do I talk about myself or them or both? And what would be some details which I should  highlight in these emails?
2. Second question: Is my list too ambitious? I want to gain perspective on my profile first so that I can try to fill in the gaps in my application. And follow-up, does this exercise of mailing professors prove beneficial?

For a little context, I'm in my final year from a Tier 2 college in India, with a CGPA of 9.14/10. I have done around 3 internships so far and have built multiple noteworthy projects as well.  Only thing I'm lacking in is research experience and I have no publications either (no work-ex either.) That being said, I'll be working on one for my final year capstone project. GRE is 320 (168Q, 152V) and TOEFL not given yet.

**Target:** MS EECS/ECE, specialising in RFICs/ RF circuit design/ MMICs and analog ICs 

**CGPA:** 9.4 

**Work-Ex: 1 year** by the time I join at a major core electronics company as a Hardware Engineer

**Publications:** 3 Journal papers in 2D materials and 1 possible conference paper in RF &amp; Microwave Engg

**Research Ex:**   Semester-long on-campus thesis (RF &amp; Microwave), MITACS Gloablink '21 (2D materials), a 6-week summer intern at a govt research institute (Not much work, just learnt COMSOL)

**TOEFL/GRE:** Yet to give

**LORS:** 2 strong LORs from college profs (1 in RF, 1 in 2D materials) and a (moderate?) one from a senior member of a govt research institute (in RF)

**Projects:** \~6 in RF and \~3 in 2D materials completed over the course of 3 years 

**Colleges I've Shortlisted:**  Stanford, UC Berkeley, Caltech, Georgia Tech, UCLA, Carnegie Mellon University, UIUC, University of Michigan Ann-Arbor, Princeton University, UT Austin, UCSD, Purdue University, Columbia University, UW Madison, New York University, Texas A&amp;M University, University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern University, UT Dallas, University of Maryland 

**Help I need:**

**1) Profile Evaluation + How to sort these colleges? Some are pretty obvious, like say Stanford would be ambitious, but how really would you go about it? Also, how many places should I apply to, given that I'd like to start my master's next year itself at any cost**

**2) From what I know, I need to aim for a 100+ in TOEFL, but what would be a good score on GRE?**

**3) Are there any colleges known to give a good number of TA/RA/GA positions to MS students with tuition waivers? I've heard that a lot of unis award these to PhD students only, and the only two I've heard of that help MS students also are UIUC, GA Tech and Purdue.**

**4) I've heard from many people that even colleges that do not have a rolling admissions process favour students who apply early for awarding scholarships and assistantships- Is this true? If so, should I apply within a few days of the opening of the admissions? Ideally, I'd like to take some time to perfect my SOP and LORs**

I would really appreciate it if some 2022 new grads or people with experience describe the hiring timeline for new grads especially @ FAANG and top tech companies.

I have prepared my resume, projects and portfolio and I started leetcoding (a bit behind schedule, but still depends on when interviewing starts). I already interned at a FAANG before and have decent skills I try improving on.

My main questions would be:

- [1] When do applications for new grads opens? I saw that postings for US have already popped up in r/csMajors?


- [2] After applying and passing the screening phase, when does the interviewing phase start (I know it heavily depends on companies, but your personal experience will help!)?


- [3] Is there a sys design round generally for new grads? I know that Google doesn't have a round for that for new grads. Not sure about Meta tho.


- [4] Where can I get refferals from companies outside the FAANG circle? I have some contacts there, and I try to reach out on LinkedIn, but is there another path? Blind for example?


- [5] And last but not least, what kind of advice can you offer? And how different is the new grad interview process to an internship process (aside from the number of rounds)? Any prep advice?


Thank you for reading through!"

I'm an international student (from India originally but lived abroad) and interested in applying for a doctoral program in medical informatics in the US for Fall 2024. Need some advice on my profile and how I can prepare myself better for this goal.

**Undergraduate:** BSc (First class honors) in Applied Medical Sciences from University College London (UCL). (2017 - 2020)

* Took courses similar to a medical school curriculum but with more research focus (e.g. clinical trials, cancer biology, genomics etc).
* Two years into the degree, realized I wasn't as interested in pure medical research but in data science and machine learning applied to medicine.
* Internships: Did a 3-4 week stint with a fintech company, but nothing really relevant or helpful to my CV. Couldn't secure any other internships due to my limited quantitative background :(
* External Courses: Completed ML Specialization on Coursera, deep learning (DL) Specialization from [Deeplearning.ai](https://Deeplearning.ai).
* Research experience: 9 month project in my final year with Barts cardiac imaging centre. The project focused on DL for cardiac image analysis. Gained skills in Python, Keras and DL, and medical imaging fundamentals. However, the project didn't proceed further.

**Postgraduate:** MSc (Distinction) in Machine Learning from UCL (2020 - 2021, Remote)

* Took courses in PGMs, DL, Reinforcement learning, Supervised Learning, Computer vision, Bioinformatics and medical image computing.
* Masters thesis focused on generative models for ophthalmic data analysis, based with UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital.
* Skills: Mathematics of ML (Linear Algebra, Stats, Calc), Python, MATLAB, Deep Learning, PyTorch, Keras, Ophthalmology, and retinal imaging.
* Submitted a first-author paper 2 months ago to a medical journal which is currently under review.
* Third author on another publication to Nature medicine which will also be submitted soon.
* Presented my research at UCL symposiums in Ophthalmology and Healthcare engineering.

**Current status:**

* Research Interests: Medical imaging + AI.
* Applied for PhDs for Fall 2022 however I was rejected from all programs :(
* Will be joining as a data scientist in a medical research department in Denver, Colorado with a very senior professor of AI. The professor is well connected to people from the top schools like Stanford, MIT in my research area, so I think this will boost my future application. 

**Interested scholarships:** Would be helpful if anyone could advise scholarships that NRIs like myself are eligible for. I applied for Knight Hennessy Scholars (Stanford) last year but didn't make it (selected first round only). Most of the scholarships in India that I'm aware of are for research students with Indian institutions, which I don't fall under.

**Schools:** Stanford (Biomedical informatics), Harvard-MIT (Health Sciences and Technology), Columbia (Biomedical informatics), University of Washington (Biomedical informatics), Johns Hopkins (Biomedical Engineering or Health Informatics), UC Berkeley (Computer Science)

**Other skills (not sure how much PhD programmes care about this!)**: Professionally-graded musician, performed in 6 countries, awarded arts and culture scholarship from Government of India this year, also gave fundraiser concerts during the pandemic to support underprivileged populations and support medical procedures for the poor.

**Tests:** Should I take the GREs? Most of the above schools say its optional and some Ph.D. students I asked suggested to only take if my background is limited. But I am still unsure.

Overall, with my current state, I feel I may be underqualified for big places like Stanford/MIT. Especially seeing people who have applied there have done big things like creating startups and doing an incredible amount of social service. But these are the schools I feel that do research in areas I am very personally interested in, so I would definitely like to spend the next 2 years building my profile to apply here. I would greatly appreciate any advice! Thanks a lot :D!"

Additionally, prior to graduating I was unable to line up a job with my senior-year internships as both had halted their intern programs due to struggles with the pandemic.    
  
As a result I've been trying to segue over to Software Engineering, however now I'm running into problems with competition since the BMEN curriculum didn't have many full-stack programming projects. I had thought that an entry-level software role wouldn't have an extremely high barrier-to-entry, but I'm seeing that most job postings appear to require upwards of two years of relevant experience. Even with notable programming experience/projects I find myself lacking more of the foundation that many software engineers have.  
  
Have any other BMEN undergraduates encountered  similar problems? I'm at a loss for how to progress from here."

I know this may vary by industry but curious if companies have a loose quota for how many students they're hiring from each school. 

Do companies set a max number they can hire from each program relative to the program's size? 

For example:

* Haas - 300 students
* Kellogg - 500
* Wharton - 900

When TCX recruits on campus, is their plan to hire **up to** 3 interns from Haas vs up to 5 from Kellogg vs up to 9 from Wharton? Or does it not matter? 

Trying to figure out if a larger or smaller program puts you at any recruiting advantage at really competitive firms/industries."

She and I were able to talk about deeper things and I felt like I could open up to her. I came from an abusive family, and I'd never experienced what love was before (romantic or otherwise). I never had anything like a hug or positive affirmation, and was born because my family wanted me to make money and take care of them. I've felt attracted to other girls, but she was the first one to make me feel this desire to be vulnerable and unconditionally kind to another person.

I've spoken with my therapist and understood that I should think carefully about my feelings, since it's easy to become very attached to someone if you're emotionally starved. After some time thinking, I decided that my feelings were from more than that, and I felt this way not just because she was nice to me.

I already had a feeling she didn't like me romantically, but I decided to tell her anyway since I didn't want to have any regrets, so I told her I liked he on the final day. She said she already had someone she liked, and just wants to be friends.

I cried in my room for a few hours before traveling back home. When I was waiting for a train I had a bad experience. My vision felt blurry, my body felt heavy, and and I felt like I was top of a slope heading down to the tracks. I was stumbling forward until someone snapped me out of it by telling me I was going to fall onto the tracks.

Yesterday when I got back home, I slept. Today I woke up and my body felt like a wreck, and I felt extremely depressed. My heart felt like it was going to burst, I was crying and hyperventilating until I passed out. I woke up in a hospital bed, and apparently I had experienced a stress induced heart attack.

I feel like an absolute loser. I'm told by people that I'm smart, and I've been able to do a lot despite having a horrible life for my first 18 years. And yet, something as simple as being rejected by a girl, who was honestly pretty nice about it, was enough to put me in the hospital. I feel like a broken mess of trauma and mental illness, and I can see why she didn't like me back now.

Tldr: Confessed to my best friend who I knew didn't like me back, got rejected, and landed myself in the hospital.

(Also apologies if this isn't the correct place to post this kind of thing, I know it's a bit intense)"

wnqfdz,3,2022-08-13,Learning Erlang as the first language,kintull,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/wnqfdz/learning_erlang_as_the_first_language/,"Hey folks, wanted to share my story of getting into professional programming with Erlang.

I‚Äôve started 5 years ago. I have just graduated as robotics/mechanical engineer. I knew some python and C, but I was far from guys who graduated in CS. I worked as a manual tester for 7 months for a startup. Then the startup run out of money and I had to find a new job. Developers were getting better payment and I tried this path. 

I went to 6 interviews with every company in my home town that I could. All of them rejected me, except one, whom I was afraid to accept. This company was working with Telecom and writing Erlang code. 

The only company I knew that used Erlang was WhatsApp. It was kinda scary that I will get into a niche language and would not be able to grow. 

After talking to my friends I decided to give it a go. I was hired as intern to Ericsson company. Not directly, but the company that was an outsource for Ericsson. They gave me 3 months of Linux, networking, and Erlang training. The compensation was lower than average, but my colleagues were very sweet and I was getting precious knowledge of working for an enterprise. While working there I was getting up to speed with algorithms and data structures. I was watching MIT 6.006 on YouTube on my way to work and back.

Around 1 year passed, I became more or less comfortable writing Erlang and C. I had a lot of fun reading [Learn you some erlang for the greater good](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/content).

One day my wife sent me a link to a position in another town with compensation 3x with the same skillset. It was a startup and they wanted to try Erlang. The hiring process was a call with answering some basic erlang knowledge, very easy. It was so much fun to build a new project from the ground with automated testing and deployments.

Next step was a bit bigger, I wanted to leave my country and I was looking for a company abroad. I found one company, that was working Elixir - successor of Erlang and Ruby. Interview was very chill: some generic erlang questions plus a coding assignment without time limit. I nailed it and it was time to move. Here was a room for learning new technologies, cloud tools, system design.

Recently I switched company. Interview was quite easy and chill. Again I got a home coding assignment. Same stack, much bigger scale, and got a raise almost 2x. That's where I am now and I am very happy that I went back then for this erlang internship.

I think the idea behind my story is not to be afraid of new or niche languages. Growing companies which are using them, create a big demand and create a safe space for you. With corona, there are more remote first companies and it is even easier to find a job."

I have been working at my 9-5 office job for about 5 months now. Prior to this, I was an intern at the same company during college. I regret accepting the full-time offer because the work is not enjoyable and the job required me to relocate to Texas. I am originally from Oregon and that is where all of my family and friends are. About a month ago, an employee on my team quit and I was assigned to replace him and take over  his workload. However, around this time I had already applied to another job located in Oregon, which I received an offer for and will be getting paid more for. Anyway, I decided to accept the offer and now I have to put in my two week notice at my current job this week. I am so nervous about everyone‚Äôs reaction since I have only been working here for 5 months. Most people stay at-least 2 years before leaving and others have been here for 30+ years. I am nervous that my manager will be upset since I am quitting so early and they spent time training me. In addition, i will be the second person on my team to have quit in the last two months and they will yet again have to find a replacement for the workload left behind. However, I know this is the best decision for me since I will be getting paid more and be able to move back to Oregon. Being that this is the situation I‚Äôm in, I need advice on how to not feel so guilty about my decision and the best way to go about it."

As I have about 3 weeks left until I go back to school, I am absolutely loathing the idea of going back, but I don‚Äôt know what to do about it. I really really hate where I go to school and it‚Äôs hard to deal with now that I‚Äôm back home (and loving it here).

I‚Äôm from Southern California but go to a large private university in NYC. It was my dream school, so I instantly decided to go there. It was extremely expensive, but I‚Äôm very fortunate that my family has the means to provide me with the education. That being said, while this school has given me a lot of opportunities, growth, and experiences, it turns out that I just really don‚Äôt like it.

In any case, I feel really stuck. The first factor is that I‚Äôve landed an internship for next summer with a nearly guaranteed full time offer to follow. It‚Äôs a really great, high-paying program at a great and prestigious company. It‚Äôs also nearly impossible to get into, so I can‚Äôt let this opportunity go and try another time. The important thing is that it‚Äôs contingent on me maintaining my current course of education (same program at the same university).

The second factor is that since my family is paying for my college, they exercise a larger degree of control over my academic path. While they let me study whatever I want, they won‚Äôt let me take any gap semesters or years or anything like that. I suggested to them that since I have the credits from high school, I can take an upcoming semester off to recharge and can still graduate on time. They flatly rejected it with no argument. They would like me to transfer because they see that I‚Äôm not happy at my uni, but not with the needed gap year until next admissions cycle. Also, I can‚Äôt just go and not take their money, as my university costs so much that even with my high paying job after college I couldn‚Äôt afford to pay it back (not at these interest rates).

In any case, I just don‚Äôt want to be at this university anymore; I want to be somewhere closer to home in California, but it‚Äôs too late to transfer to anywhere at roughly the same level as the program I‚Äôm in (think UCLA, Berkeley Haas, USC Marshall) without waiting a year. I feel so stuck and don‚Äôt know what to do. I really can‚Äôt stand living in NYC and going to my university, but I have no recourse. I am trying to find ways that I can go online but my university is trying to be fully in-person again.

What can I even do? All advice is appreciated."

My grades have always been rather high, except this was the first period where I felt like I was sort of just going to class to get the grade and then leaving without a clear goal as to what I'd like to do as a career (I've never had that clear of an idea of what I'd like to do, even when beginning university). Don't get me wrong, I find a lot of the content very interesting, but looking forward to my career after school leaves me feeling hopeless. I also currently have a summer research position at my school, but I am finding that I don't enjoy it all that much.

I am at a crossroads and am looking for some advice from people who've gone through similar stuff. I really enjoy problem solving and coming up with creative solutions to problems, so computer science and programming seems appealing (I've taken one MATLAB course and used it in other engineering courses). However, I have no idea what an actual ME industry job is like (never had an internship) and deciding on a whim to add another major/minor means more school and more money (but I am willing to put in the time).

I've already completed most GE's and major requirements for ME and am projected to graduate in spring 2023. Would it be better to graduate, get a job, and then decide if I like it? Or might it be better to go for it and take some CS courses while I'm still a full-time student? TIA for any advice!"

wnwhgk,9,2022-08-13,Edelman Internship Experience,Think-Vegetable-5773,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/wnwhgk/edelman_internship_experience/,"My internship at Edelman just ended so I wanted to get my thoughts out while they're still fresh.

So here it goes:

**TLDR**

* C+ Rating
* Great People
* Everyone is Massively Overworked and Underpaid
* Did Not Experience What I Signed Up For

**DISCLAIMER:** I want to preface this first by saying I was part of the 2022 class of interns. The first class since Covid and the new ""Hybrid"" work model. I was based in Seattle and most of the accounts I worked on were in NY or Chicago. My experience could 100% be a result of the circumstances but I still feel people deciding whether or not to work/intern here need to know about it. I'm going to split up my review in sections. I'll start with the worst of it first....

**THE BAD**

* Beginning- When I started I was told that I would be placed on two accounts. During my first week I was deep in the onboarding process (basically a bunch of internship trainings, meetings, etc.) I had not heard from my manager or anyone from either of my accounts, which I thought was strange. So I contacted the Intern Coordinator and she informed me there was a mix up and they had to find me new accounts. She was really apologetic and nice about it so I completely understood (sh\*t happens). She sent me an email telling me I actually only got re-assigned to one account but I still was on my second (YAY). I finally got in touch with my manager and everything was fine.....for about a week.
* The problem was the new account I was on was also a new business account. So everything was super chaotic because they were still getting situated with the new client. My manager basically told me they only had one-off tasks for me because it was so hectic. I barely had 2 hours of work a day (I'm supposed to work 40 hours a week). So I contacted HR again. She said I should be hearing from my second account.....never did. Eventually, after some digging I found the email of someone on the second account and contacted her myself. She got back to me quickly and responded confused because she was never informed she had an intern. WHAT?
* At this point we are in week 3. and I finally start getting new work from my second account. I realize though even with the new work from this account I still was not meeting my hours. So I contacted HR AGAIN. I basically was asking if I could be put on a third account so I could meet my hours. She GHOSTED me and I did not hear from her until the end of the internship about returning my work computer. WOW.

**WORK**

* The actual work was alright. Like I said till about week five I mostly got one-off tasks. This included social media monitoring, flags, research, etc. My second account finally started to pick up and I got to create outlines and get more involved with client work. I finished my tasks really quick though so I eventually got in contact with a group asking for extra help from interns. I ended up helping on three more accounts where I edited decks, wrote PR package notes, helped on pitches, and media lists.
* Everyone was really great about explaining the tasks. No one expects you to know what you are doing. BUT, the problem with Edelman is that they're understaffed. You constantly hear from people that they need more help. You would think being put on a new biz account would give me a lot of work as an intern but the truth is no one has time to babysit me when they are slammed with deadlines and don't have a lot of full-time employees. They need things to get done so yes a lot of the work was not interesting because they could not afford to take time and go through things with me.

**CULTURE**

* I'll get into this more in a second but the people are the best part of Edelman's otherwise iffy work culture. I talked to so many people at the firm during my time there trying to get a sense of what it was really like working there and here's what I generally heard:

1. You are not being paid what your worth
2. You will not get bonuses or raises unless you get promoted (which depending on what level you're on can take up to 1-2 years)
3. They pay outside hires more than internal (this I've heard is normal with agencies)
4. They do not let interns negotiate (they decreed that no interns would be allowed to negotiate as of 2022)
5. They have a high turnover rate because of long hours and low pay
6. One of the people I talked to didn't even know who made final decisions on promotions
7. People put up with this because they want to work on dream accounts and put it on their resume (I honestly get it)

**PEOPLE**

* LOVE THE PEOPLE. The best part of the internship was them. Just talking to them and hearing about their careers and journey as a PR professional was so educational for me. I made so many connections and received such good support, feedback, and reviews. They all honestly deserve the world.

**PAY**

* I was paid $18 and hour which is fine, I've made less in past internships. 

**FUTURE JOB PROSPECTS**

* This was my first agency internship so I don't know if I disliked Edelman or just agency life in general. Listen if I don't get any other job offers I'm willing to put up with it for a year or two then move onto something else (most interns that excepted a job offer had this mentality). I did learn what type of work I'm interested in from interning at Edelman and overall thankful for the experience. I'm not post-grad yet so I could not be offered a job and I'm actually happy that I have more time to decide what type of PR job I want after graduation.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

* I hope this review helps anyone struggling to decide on accepting a job offer/internship role at Edelman. Or maybe just take Edelman off of the pedestal you have them on, being that they are the biggest PR firm in the world. Hey, at the end of the day people like seeing this on your resume so even if you aren't planning on working there forever it will always be beneficial to your career.
* Now this note is directly for Mr. Edelman: If people at your corporate company have to have a SECOND job in addition to their FULL-TIME commitment to you in order to pay their rent. DO BETTER! I don't care if it's an entry level position you need to pay people so they can live. I am aware of the impending recession and COVID after-affects but people were saying this was a problem before that. So get it together man.

I was hoping it would be an amazing experience since it was my first ever job and I was working in my favorite field, Data Science. However, the whole experience turned out to be so underwhelming. 
 
The biggest let down, was this one manager I was working with. He only concentrates on the areas of Machine Learning and Algorithms, which is exactly my domain of interest, and hence I was most excited to work with him before joining. But for some reason, ever since the first day, he made me feel like I was some sort of idiot. 

He never showed any appreciation for anything I did correct, but always made sure to point out my mistakes. He was incredibly arrogant and rude in his way of speaking, and every interaction with him made me feel like I don‚Äôt belong there because I‚Äôm not at the same level as him and others. On my last day, I was working to transfer this data engineering pipeline to the team so they can work with it moving forwards, and one piece of code I wrote (which was suggested by him) was not the best practice.

I know that a lot of companies require a bachelors in C.S. for that position which is why I completed a huge milestone by working for and getting accepted to Berkeley EECS major as a junior transfer which will start August 24.

Now, I am extremely happy about this and all, problem is, I have no outside-classroom experience (no relevant work experience and no relevant internship). I tried to work on personal projects but it‚Äôs not going well at all.

I‚Äôm thinking about joining a software engineering job-guarantee coding bootcamp in the hopes that it can help me in creating those relevant personal projects and also help me in networking for the job I want for my career. The problem is a bootcamp would add to the list of things I‚Äôd have to pay for.

I am a 21yr old going into a prestigious university as a junior. I‚Äôm suppose to have so much career progress completed already but most of my life was spent fighting a deadly chronic illness (prolly the main reason why Berkeley accepted me).

Is there any hope for me? Is 2-1/2 years in Berkeley enough time to get back on my feet?

I'm currently an undergraduate studying CS in the US (as well as a US citizen) trying to see if I can get an internship/co-op in the EU this winter and/or spring. I'm pretty confused about work visas in general and was wondering if anyone had any pointers they could give regarding finding an employer that is willing to sponsor a visa for such a strangely timed internship.

Should I just apply to all the internships I see at big companies located in the countries I'm interested in, or are those only meant for students in the EU? Would it be a waste of time if I email startups I find interesting, as the process of sponsoring me might be too cumbersome to bother with? I'm not sure what my options are.

For context, I'm looking for internships within the SWE range, but honestly any kind of CS-adjacent roles are welcome. I'm studying at a very well-known university and have done a couple internships at FAANG-esque companies already.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer in an MNC in an Windows WPF application development role for 2 years. I dislike windows heavily even though I am okay with working with it productively. I am interested to switch to a backend engineering / cloud side role. I have some internship experience in Java backend api's. I have also done some hands-on with express development myself. I am very good with linux and have spent my 5 years in college playing with it, trying multiple distro's and setting up self hosted services myself. 

I constantly see and feel that I know better than the senior I have been working under. I also really want to switch urgently to a better place. I have tried applying in several linkedin roles but have not gotten back many responses. I have also given a couple of interviews and and got rejected. I have 1 interview which might get converged soon, but I forsee the hike to be not much.

The main problem I face is selling myself as a backend engineer when I have my professional experience in application development. Also, I do not want to work with C# or .net and am interested in other languages like python, golang etc. and moving to full time working on linux. I am really interested to move to a new place soon.

Can you kind people please suggest me what should I do to help myself ? Thank you!"

Hey guys,

So I‚Äôm at the cusp of restructuring my life and have been doing a lot of self-reflection. This is gonna be my last post; I‚Äôm deleting Reddit after this. I shouldn‚Äôt be asking you guys, but this is a big decision and I really am at a loss. I‚Äôm a rising senior in college, and I thought I wanted to do business since I got here. I got interviews for top internships and everything, but I fucked them up two years in a row and didn‚Äôt get any offers), and I concluded that business probably isn‚Äôt for me. I don‚Äôt really like doing it, I just convinced myself i did. I thought I wanted to do investment banking and consulting, but the idea of staying at your office 100 hours a week just isn‚Äôt for me. And at the end of the day‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really have the social skills required to do business. It‚Äôs just a fact of who I am. I don‚Äôt even enjoy my classes. They feel not stimulating to me; I was depressed about a year ago and hated going to my classes, which is unlike me because I previously enjoyed my classes, and was having fun at class when I was an econ and french major because it felt like I was learning something. Ultimately though, I‚Äôm a high-achieving person and would really like a well-paying job, so I‚Äôm at a crossroads.

I feel like my entire life I‚Äôve done nothing and chased the wrong thing out of inertia and the fear of making a big change. However, I strongly feel that the path of business is a waste for me and I should make a change now instead of getting complacent and getting a degree with no job. So I‚Äôm strongly considering changing my degree to computer science (I took the CS course at Harvard and really enjoyed all of it, even doing the homework. I‚Äôve dabbled with coding in the past as a child and really enjoyed it). The only thing is though that at my school that takes 105 credits (or the equivalent of 26 courses), that would mean that I would graduate in 5 years instead of the normal 4, and I would have to work straight. (I‚Äôd be doing a full course load (4 courses per semester and 2 semesters with 5) F2022 &gt; W2022 &gt; S2023 &gt; Find an internship for Summer &gt; F2023 &gt; W2023. 

If I fail to get an internship, I would have to extend college to Winter 2024, which would be 6 years). I was considering graduating, but I want a degree. If I finish my business degree or try to transfer, I would graduate Winter 2024 (if I do get an internship). I flirted with the idea of transferring because I had a high GPA so I could get into good colleges, but I got cold feet every time. I regret not doing it but c‚Äôest la vie. I‚Äôm afraid however that the prestige of your college affects how good the companies that you can intern at are.

I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel that extending my current college would be the best thing for me, even if I kinda hate where my college is (it‚Äôs in the middle of nowhere in a dying town with a lot of crime, but I think transferring would put me off too much. But this is really hard for me. I‚Äôve done research on this type of thing in the past when I flirted with the idea before, and heard that bootcamps were useless, and you should do college preferably over teaching yourself (and since it takes about a year for someone to teach themselves anyway‚Ä¶)

It is scary though. I really don‚Äôt know what to do. Any of you guys go through something similar?"

wo5fiu,22,2022-08-14,How can I change careers with a work history of 2 jobs that I've been in less than 6 months?,GreenGrass89,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/wo5fiu/how_can_i_change_careers_with_a_work_history_of_2/,"A  little bit of background: Currently 29M, went back to school in Jan  2018 to become a nurse. Graduated, got licensed, and started my first  nursing job (hospital on a med-surg/tele floor) in Sept 2021. Worked  there for 6 months before becoming very burnt out and leaving (on good  terms) for an endoscopy job. Have been there 5 months, and it's  mind-numbingly repetitive and boring.

Now  to the meat of my post. So as y'all can see, I'm a relatively new  nurse, and haven't even been a nurse a year yet. I've had 2 nursing  jobs, neither of which I've stayed a full year at, though still at my  current one. Throughout school for nursing, I had felt that nursing  wasn't really for me, but the promise of a stable income was enough to  keep me in it. Then COVID hit and I felt even less like I wanted to stay  in it, but I persevered and graduated, and became an RN.

In  my almost 1 year of working as a nurse, I ***hate*** it. I hated working  in the hospital; COVID sucked, the patients are entitled, I hate working  nights, I wasn't allowed to take accrued vacation time (ever), and I  felt like an expendable commodity of an employee. And while I'm a  safe/competent nurse and not the worst, nursing has never felt natural  to me and it felt like I was pushing myself to do something I'm not  meant to do.

After working in the  hospital 6 months, I finally left for an endoscopy job. It was a saving  grace in that it got me out of the hospital (no nights, no death, little  COVID, etc.), but this is very much a stepping stone job. It's very  simple, it's very repetitive, and it's mind-numbing. Pay/benefits also  kind of suck, which is giving me little incentive to stick around. The  work environment also isn't great; it's a physician owned  practice/endoscopy center, and you're consistently made aware of the  power differential the physicians have over you, which has been  uncomfortable to say the least. I've been there 5 months now.

I've  made the decision that nursing is not for me and I need to go do  something else. My plan right now is to take the next 6 months to do  some intentional soul searching and do a job search outside of my field.  I don't know where I want to go career-wise or what I want to do, but I  know nursing is not it. Even any of the ""niche"" jobs in nursing that  people often suggest. I hate nursing, and I hate healthcare. It's been  soul-crushing for me personally, and I want to move out of healthcare.

FWIW,  I do have a prior BA in International Relations (minors in German and  Russian languages) and I completed an internship in PR with a nonprofit  prior to returning to nursing school.

I  guess my main question is this: **I have 2 nursing jobs on my work  history now that I've been in for less than 6 months. Is now the right  time to begin my job search, or do I need to wait until I've been in my  current job a year?** I feel like 2020-2022 has been a weird time for a  lot of people which may help me explain it away, but I'm not sure how  much of a red flag it'll be during my job search.

My  mental health is pretty poor right now after the last couple of  draining years, so I really don't want to stick around in my current job  a year if I don't have to. But if it's something I need to do, so be  it.

And if anyone has any tips for a career field switch for my job search, that would also be super helpful!"

I'm a 25 yr old MCA graduate (2022) from some mediocre college feeling lost, depressed and anxious about life and career.  


scored 62% in MCA, 73% BCA, 57% 10th, and 59% +2 (commerce stream), I know these are pathetic qualifications and I can't apply for good companies with them.   


I have no experience working in any internship or job, and couldn't get through placements of whatever few companies that came cause I was ignorant and not prepared for any technical questions like DA and leetcode/hackerrank problems, it's been almost 2 months since placement and I just feel burnt out from everything.  


I've always been enthusiastic about tech and dabbled in different things I found interesting but I kept jumping from one thing to another, got stuck in tutorial hell, and in the end, I have some knowledge of many things but didn't master anything. 

I'm also dealing with mental health problems for a few years now and that has also contributed to my lack of socializing and networking of any kind or looking after my physical health and wellbeing. and here i am now contemplating life every day.  
**so my question is:**  
Is there any future for the likes of me?  
What's the path to follow now to possibly land a job soon as possible?   
Is there anything I can even apply for with my current qualifications?   
where to look for jobs and how consistent should i be with it? 

i have basic to intermediate knowledge of frontend(HTML/CSS/BOOTSTRAP), python, php, Linux, AWS EC2 and laravel but I'm not confident to say I'm good enough at them."

Im a 22 year old male, i went to college last year and for my course we have to do an internship for a total of 600 hours. I started working at a food truck after school had ended for my internship and things were going good at this point, i had a job immediately after school had ended and my relationship was seemingly going good. Then my boss started cutting back my hours severely ( was promised 40+ hours a week and was only receiving one shift a week) and i was not making enough money to support myself.

Not too long after this started me and my girlfriend at the time split up only 10 days after my birthday and after spending 3.5 years together (she was my first girlfriend that lasted more than A month). I was extremely down at this point and didn‚Äôt know what to do, then the food truck i was working at closed unexpectedly leaving me jobless from the end of June up until just a few days ago.

Now my second year of school is coming up quickly. i have no savings since i was out a job for so long, i am struggling to find another apartment to rent (currently living with my parents again) and don‚Äôt want to ask my parents to co-sign for another student loan since it comes as a risk to them.

I feel like all of this would be manageable if i wasn‚Äôt feeling so lonely lately, i have no one that i can talk to throughout the day anymore. Ive tried dating apps to find people to talk to with no luck (i usually get ghosted after a few messages due to being awkward over texts) and I‚Äôm have no time to go and be social anymore now that i am working so much to try to make some money for school.

&amp;#x200B;

So..sorry for the late update guys. Despite your helpful comments I am still not much closer to finding out what exactly this woman is. I mean, the obvious choice (highly sexual vibes, long white teeth, pale skin) would be vampire but I definitely saw her have a reflection in the several elevators we had been riding in. And she freely walks around in the sun , so doesn't  that disqualify werewolf as well? I loved reading horror when I was younger, but my knowledge is somewhat rusty.

I was busy with trying to find Miss Lamia a new flat- in fact, our last flat -seeing ended just 2 hours ago. One would think it is not that hard to find a flat or a house where the only demand is a storage room, yes? Turns out it bloody is, when your customer walks into said storage room, spends minutes in there doing God knows what only to emerge with an apologetic smile saying the apartment doesn't suit them! Not even a hint of what exactly is wrong, just ""I don't like it, find something else"".

Those last days were filled with flat-seeings to the brim. And they all went by on the same schedule: I would never actually SEE her come up to me, one moment she was nowhere in sight and the next one she was standing right next to me. We would walk in, I would have to assure her it is okay for her to enter said apartment or house and she would immediately march for the storage room, tell me she doesn't wish to be disturbed and stay there for even longer periods of time. I mean, I wouldn't even mind , it gave me time to scroll the Internet (the world is going to shit and we have the front seats) or have a quick lunch or generally unwind, were it not for the sounds that would emerge from said closed storage rooms.

Oh yes, did I mention that the storage rooms also would need to have a door you can lock beside yourself? Every time she would turn the key and I made one half-assed attempt of me to ask her not to do that, because if there would be an emergency someone would have to break down the door. She just laughed at me. I just let her do her thing.  But I stopped eating during her...seances so to say. The noises that I hear in the best case make me uneasy and in the worst case make me barf.

Do you remember her the first storage room she locked herself in? The slurping, murmuring and crying? Her repertoire steadily expands. I heard dry-heaving, retching, squelching and some very badly suppressed laughter. I heard deranged cackling, more of that damned slurping and..ehr, at some point I am very sure orgasmic moans. And every time she would reappear from the storage room looking like a damned Cosmo cover model, not a stroke out of line of her make-up, sensuality made flesh and ask for a new apartment-seeing  - or storage room seeing, since she was NEVER interested in any other part of all the apartments we have been to. And aside from busted light bulbs the storage rooms looked exactly the same before she entered. Every damn time.

She wasn't interested in attics, or basements or sheds. No, it had to be a storage room with no other exit, no window and a door you could lock. In some she spent 5 minutes. In another, her longest stay was an hour. Out of desperation, I led her to a flat where all the walls were broken down and hinted that she could build or let us build for her TEN storage rooms in there if she so desired. She plain out refused to enter and demanded to see a new house. And the house I led her to after that one..oh boy, did she get upset.

It was a tiny cottage of two floors with a small garden and a fenced-in backyard. Just imagine or google tiny cottage and you get a pretty accurate depiction. An elderly couple lived there before passing away and their children put it up for sale. Belongings of the couple still weren't completely removed so several biblical and religious knickknacks were piled in boxes before the door. I wasn't aware of this, but Lamias face turned into a snarl and she spat before the door, claiming she is highly offended (oh great..) by me taking her to a house of worship. Again, it wasn't a church, just a house with religious symbols. But she refused to enter. And she also wouldn't move in to a house near a church or a mosque or a synagogue. Anything religious or spiritual in general highly offended her, as I learned. She would snarl at something as innocent as a dreamcatcher and frown at amulets.

And today was the last flat-seeing we had.

See, I was slowly getting desperate and running out of homes and flats to show her. So I decided to show her our dead-weight home. Every rental agency had one of these. Houses no one wants to stay in, for whatever reason there might be. But this one I was actually understanding to a degree. It was at the end of an uninhabited street leading to bumfuck nowhere, with the nearest convenience store 5 kilometers away and the nearest police station 10. In the past there was a sparse grove surrounding it, but due to years of neglect and the recent heatwaves everything withered away, dead trees scratching and poking at the sky like clawed hands. And..I am not sure if it is true, but the rumor goes that the woman who lived there last killed and ate her sister. So there was a certain aura around the building that made you feel disgusted and unwanted there. Our rental agency didn't do much in terms of renovation, just painted the walls and replaced  the broken windows. The wooden floors creaked with every step, the doors jammed and the only furniture standing there was sparse and belonging to the last tenant. A table and 2 chairs in the kitchen and a bed upstairs. That's it. No phone line, no electricity, no running water, no internet- the house was taken off those services years ago. Nobody wanted to live there. And the area itself was sketchy, abandoned houses with a lot of squatters and drug addicts hanging around, desperate humans in the pangs of addiction, every morale eroded through drugs -  and yet the fact that none of them wanted to go near that building should tell you enough.

I was scared to leave my car unsupervised in that area for fear of it being stolen. So I had a colleague come with me. His name is Adrian and he is new, actually. An intern, if you want to be precise. You know how it goes in companies- the interns get dropped on one unlucky worker and are their problem from then. Adrian wasn't a problem though. He was helpful, eager to learn the few meager salesman tricks I could show him and very innovative when it came to solving problems. He somehow knew when to speak and when to be silent, but the silence was never uncomfortable. He was one of the few men you enjoy the silence with. It was his idea to show Lamia this house actually when I complained I was running of possible homes. And..well, I admit his good looks alone would have caught my eye in any other situation.

And Lamia's too. From the second she approached us (in her usual unnerving matter of just appearing in front of you) she practically devoured the poor man with her eyes. As we went up the stairs and I unlocked the door, Adrian went in  first but I hung back and I swear I saw her lick her lips as she watched him from behind.

Inside, it was business as usual. We invited her to enter, Lamia marched straight for the storage room, I spared myself the usual salesmen talk of any potential the house has, or the great location (which it didn't have) and just sat down while Adrian stared bewildered at the locked door of the storage.

""Its just her thing"" I remarked ""Just wait till she is done"".

She was done really quickly, actually. After only one minute in the storage room  she came out, her smile beaming and exclaimed ""I want this house!"". And while I was stupidly blinking at her, Adrian was already nodding and smiling, pulling out the paperwork for her to sign. I couldn't believe it. Our first sale.

The entire procedure did not take longer than 10 minutes but I was happy when I was outside, getting in the car and driving away from this wretched place. Call me squeamish, but I tried to avoid touching anything in that house.

""I am just as relieved as you are"" I heard Adrian say ""Happy to be away from her, actually. She is..unsettling"".

I chuckled ""Wouldn't you be flattered? This woman was basically undressing you with her eyes!""

He gently elbowed me ""She looks like the type who doesn't stop the undressing once the clothes are off"".

I hear myself grin at his joke, a tired laugh melting away the tension and the aversion of this place and this horrible woman we had to deal with. As Adrian smiles back at me, I feel reminded of my days back in school when I used to skip classes with my then best friend, how he dared me to climb the apple tree in the neighbor's garden and sneak some fruits down for us. That same smile of a mischievous young boy is shining at me now, from the eyes of a grown man who didn't let his inner child die.

He pets the signed lease in the folder ""Up for celebrating our first sale as colleagues?"".

I shake my head ""I am driving"".

Another one of those charming grins ""Tell you what. How about we park your car at a convenient place for you and have one glass of sparkled wine? Just one!""

I stare at the traffic. I feel that I have to wash away the disgust of dealing with this creepy woman and the house. And I feel that I have the cause of celebrating my first sale, becoming a ""proper real estate agent"".

""Why not?"" I hear myself say. ""Just one""."

woccl8,6,2022-08-14,Fast Food boss treats myself and other employees like shit. I'm putting in my two weeks soon.,MistahJ17,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/woccl8/fast_food_boss_treats_myself_and_other_employees/,"Yet another Fast Food gem here folks. So, I'm 21 m, and I've been working at the same fast food joint for about a year and a half give or take. When I first started, I was dealing with some severe mental health issues that made it damn near impossible for me to socialize with others, coupled with the fact that I honestly used to just straight up suck at everything I did. Thankfully I worked through my issues and have gotten MUCH better at my job since then. Unfortunaetly, I was denied a raise because of my performance in that period. No biggie, I didn't deserve it anyway, and make a decent enough wage for the work I do. I told myself that I was going to improve because I wanted to get better at my job so I could earn even more money, so I did. Flash forward to the current review period. By this point, most managers and team members genuinely enjoy working with me because of the massive improvement of my quality of work, and I feel the same towards them. Because of this, I was confident that I had that raise locked. Lo and behold, I didn't get it. The kicker is that my reviewer (who happens to be the number 3 manager at our restauraunt) pulled me aside and told me that every single manager we have voted in favor of giving me the raise... except our GM. Our GM is just a piece of shit, to the point where more people are quitting because of him rather than the upcoming school semester. I've bent over backwards for this guy, coming in on my days off and extending the length of my shifts with just a few hours notice purely because I needed the money. Hell, there was one day where I was scheduled for a 6 hour shift, and ended up working 11 hours, and was only given one thirty minute break. You'd think with all my hard work and every other manager's approval, the old fart would feel somewhat inclined to give me the raise, especially when I already scored high enough on our point system to warrant one. But nope, nada. I've got a couple more stories about this fuck, but this little essay is getting bloated anyway so I'll cut to the chase. I've got a paid internship with a very well known and prestiged IT company in the works; the head of IT and myself had a chat just the other day where he mentioned that internships usually start at 18 bucks an hour (more than 3 dollars more than what I make now) and that he really enjoyed our disucssions and was eager to get me on the team. On our last talk, he said he would talk to his superior about putting together an offer letter, and when that sucker comes in, I'm putting in my two weeks at my fast food place. Know your worth people, because those in ""power"" sure as hell do and will do anything to keep you from realizing it."

My plan is to optimize my CV and prepare for interviews with Leetcode. My goal is to start applying for Summer 2023 Internships beginning of October.

Do you have any advice for me? Would you prepare in a different way?

My background:- finished my bachelors (mixture between social sciences and computer science) in 2019

* work experience as a software developer intern, frontend developer and fullstack developer in less known companies --&gt; adding up to 3years of work experience mainly in web development
* I just started my master (software engineering) in which I can focus on cloud technologies or security

wogakb,1,2022-08-14,What should I be expecting for compensation as a software developer in Santa Clara California?,for_tampa,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/wogakb/what_should_i_be_expecting_for_compensation_as_a/,"I have been interning at Intel this summer and was asked if I would like to come back to work full time after I graduate from grad school this December. I am going to be receiving a job offer from them soon and I am wondering what I should be expecting for an offer in Santa Clara CA.

# Background on me

I am finishing up a summer internship at Intel and will be graduating in December with a Masters of Science in Computer Science (I also have a BS in CS). I have two years of experience in industry before I went back for my Master (1 Year and 10 Months full time work and around 6 months worth of internship experience). My full time position before grad school gave me a pretty big increase from my internship (that I did at the same company) which was around a 60% increase (I made 22$/hr as an intern and 35$/hr full time). This was working at a mid sized company in a small city in upstate New York and was a pretty good increase from intern to employee so I was fine with it at the time. I also got some good benefits with healthcare, employee discounts, etc... however there was nothing in terms of stock / other monetary compensation. And after spending some time researching what I should be expecting I am a bit lost with how compensation packages are done at large tech companies, and honestly at this point I could really use some help understanding how it works and what I should be expecting.

# Background on job and current compensation

I was expecting a similar increase from intern to full time as I did at my last company however I am not sure if that is what I should also expect from Intel, or other large tech companies. 

My current salary as a ***Graduate Intern*** is $103,000 / year (Graduate Interns are salaried). 

The position that I will be getting offered is posted as a research position, which is what I am doing in my internship, and requires a masters degree. In the job posting, the engineering level that was posted was level 6, which from what I have found is normal for incoming engineers with masters at Intel. 

I wasn't able to find much about level 6 engineers at intel that was recent, but what I did find showed a total compensation package of around $140,000 for the Oregon location, which does not line up with the 60% increase that I was expecting. Also it was total compensation packages that were in that range, the base salaries I found were around 110,000 which is barely more than what I am making as an intern right now. However these numbers were a bit old so I am not sure if they would still reliable for the current job market. 

# Thoughts on the job

I do really like the team that I am working with in particular my boss is great to work for. I have an excellent work life balance and am really encouraged to speak my mind and try new things which I really appreciate. I also have been working remotely this summer, however I did get a chance to spend a week at Intel headquarters in Santa Clara and really liked it there, and if working full time I would like to be able to work in the office.

# Other Comments

I know that a salary is not the only aspect of a job that should be considered when looking, however it is a pretty important aspect to me. I have worked very hard to get my degrees and this offer so getting lowballed is something that I don't want to happen, and given my ignorance of silicon valley salaries and compensation packages I wanted some insight from others to help when considering the positions. I, like many others, hear about the insane salaries and benefit packages from tech companies in CA and honestly don't know what to expect at this point. 

Also thank you in advance for anyone taking the time to read this and respond, I appreciate any help or discussion about this."

I am a 20M video game Developer, self taught coder and still learning the software and few other things like modeling and such. I chose this field as it was perfect for a nerdy like myself, I enjoy playing games and making them, watching videos about other devs and how they made it.

I recently started a job as a junior programmer in a newly started company.i have been in the company for 2 months now.
It's a group of around 10 ppl, 2 interns under me and 1 senior above me and rest are artist. 

The company's goal is to make sports or casual games and this differs from my goal which is action and adventure games.

The work environment is good except for my senior, I guess it's typical behavior of every senior.The work is boring and I hate it.

I joined the company solely to learn. I don't care how much money they provide or experience or anything else. Btw I haven't learned a thing in the training period yet (3mon period). 

From day one, I was like why I am doing this job but kept it anyway. For a month now, I am started to see that I am getting the typical Monday feeling everyday, stressed, overthinking,sleep cycle is messed up, not wanting to work etc. 

The thing  is that I am not learning anything. That's what I hate about the job to be honest. but I might later.

Uhhh, I am really confused right now. I want to learn new things.

What should I do?"

Before masters, I worked for 2 years as a Data Analyst (not super technical. Just Python &amp; SQL stuff). 

I don't have a stellar profile/knowledge. But fortunately I was able to get a SDE internship at a fairly popular tech company. 

I am hoping to get a FT at an *even better tech company*. Given my desire, here are my questions. 

1. Ideally what roles should I apply for - new grad or junior - given all my SDE experience is from projects &amp; this one internship?
2. I'm thinking of applying to new grad roles (as I don't have exp). But do I qualify as one - given technically I'm not a new grad?
3. Say I get interviews for junior roles - can I clear the interviews with my limited experience but good LC skills?

I'm kind of in a limbo as to what I should target. Please advise. Thank you :)"

following are other ECs that I will do this upcoming senior year alongside said ECs:

8. shadowing with nyu cultural analysis and gender studies professor ; plan on collaborating with leading people of her studies and from esteemed universities 

9. internship at local finance services ; it could either be a receptionist job or doing research idk ; i hope the second cuz i need something good and rewarding ; but they do the financial consulting for like our town

ivy league research associate - we both share a cultural and ethnic background ; I need to instill the ""I'm the younger version of him tackling issues ingrained in Latin America through research"" ideology into him by October to garner the right LOR ; we essentially get along well despite having immense social anxiety ; I essentially vented to him ; 11 / 10

nyu professor - again, we both share cultural, ethnic, and indigenous background ; we talked about how there's still more to be talked about in our culture when recognizing our indigeneity as well as history ; she said me applying as an economics major is perfects since I also have an attachment for cultural studies in Latin America ; gonna be writing my essay with her and since shes also designed the  gender and sexuality studies and mines gonna be about a coming out story but for a boy in my class, she's gonna offer revolutionary insights ; she said I was the first person ever to reach out for her works as a high schooler ; yale and stanford alumni ; 12 / 10

**essay:**

gonna be about the time i learned an entire language and culture (just verbally and through literature) because these group of boys called me a f$#%#@ in that language ; gonna tie in socioeconomic and cultural analysis and why i sort of excused their homophobia 

essential additional info:

1. i have had crippling anxiety and underlying paranoia ever since I was 6 
2. i got my first Chromebook laptop  - after saving for almost 3 years - in march of 2022, meaning almost all of my ECs (research, curriculum design, meeting professors, international business founders, internships/shadowings/fellowships, comic design, directory, literally everything but social media organization) all happened in the span of 5-9 months and not the 4 years most people have

I'm a recent college grad in the northern Virginia area with a degree in IT w/concentration in Cybersecurity with a 3.7 GPA. I'm also a veteran with a secret clearance. Military experience was IT but only basic stuff honestly. No true industry certs but working on getting some cloud ones. Good with people though. 

My dilemma: I studied Cybersecurity. I think it's cool, I'm decent at it, and it's where the money is. However, my college internship was sort of a portfolio management/continual service improvement team that resulted in me being offered a technical project coordinator job for $70k/YR. Our contract does cloud stuff for the VA. I've been with them for a little over a year from intern, part time, now full time. 

I work remote, I love my team, the work doesn't stress me, and honestly I like working with people more than I like heads down technical work. The mission is personally fulfilling since I work for the VA. 

Would I have wasted my studies to just go straight into a PM type role? Does the salary/upward mobility compare at all to security? How much am I missing out on by not going for your typical government cleared security position? I'm also worried about any security skills I have atropying.

I know this is an odd question for this sub but I feel like I'm at a crossroads and I need to make a decision that'll really affect my career progression for the future."
wok6lb,4,2022-08-14,Changing my major senior year?,Grammarnazi_bot,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/wok6lb/changing_my_major_senior_year/,"Hey guys. This is a weird question, but it begs to be asked. Basically, **I want to change my major from business to math / physics.** But I'm entering my senior year, and it means I'd likely have to take an extra year. I read posts on Reddit from similar positions and they say to just stick it out. But I don't know.

I don't take this decision lightly, I promise. I've been mulling over this for about a year, and I have three main reasons as for why I want to do it.

1. I realized over college that I'm autistic and I just simply don't have the social skills for high-paying business careers. I've had interviews for investment banking internships because I told myself I really wanted to do it... but I don't, and I flubbed the interviews because I don't have that passion for business that other people in my school have. I don't give a shit about the stock market. These business jobs are more networking than anything, and honestly, I just am not good at that.

2. My business classes have made me so miserable. When I was taking French classes, when I took a computer science course this summer, I really enjoyed learning! Learning in business courses feel understimulating and these past few semesters it's been really hard to get myself out of bed... because I just don't care. It feels like I'm just memorizing garbage for a grade instead of learning things that stack upon each other.

3. I've been flirting with the idea of transferring out of my college or getting back out of the business school. My grades are fine. I've taken advanced math classes and I've found them incredibly fun, my brain enjoys math and it's one of the ways that I can keep myself learning. Me disliking business isn't a matter of me getting bad grades... it's just these classes do not feel challenging or even stimulating and I have no desire to do more than what is expected of me. 

I wanted to do computer science but that's impossible without taking 6 years. I'm fine taking an extra year. I just really don't know. Is it worth it? I was considering getting a masters in computer science at a top program to make up for that. But doing that once I graduate, with a business degree, will make that process substantially different. I don't want to be stuck with a business degree. I want actual talents and projects to put under my name, but a year feels like I don't have enough time, since I've wasted my time chasing business. I didn't get a business internship... graduating on time is just leaving to work as a bartender or something, so I'd be spending the extra year teaching myself compsci in the hopes of getting a job regardless. Might as well do something, right?"

Nearing on 2 years in this role and have been getting contacted by recruiters regarding open positions. Have got to the latter stages of interviews for roles that piqued my interest (1 in BB MBS syndication, 1 in PE fixed income ‚Äúcompliance‚Äù (really more internal consultant/data analyst type role)). Other than these two most of the roles are either laterals to another bank or switching to buyside. 

I‚Äôm not super passionate about staying in this niche forever and am looking to job hop a bit for the next few years to get my TC up in order to buy a house &amp; invest for FIRE as I‚Äôm somewhat underpaid at the moment. The best comp seems to be in lateraling to a buyside client, however I fear that will limit my exit ops later on if I try to pivot out of my current field. I‚Äôm not opposed to continuing to do what I do as I find it fairly easy work but at the same time don‚Äôt want to dig myself too deep of a hole I can‚Äôt get out of, as I would like to dip my toes in another area of banking/investments before ultimately ‚Äúretiring‚Äù to an FP&amp;A or data analyst type role once I‚Äôve had enough of banking.

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

I've done multiple UX/UI projects on Figma, I can work with C++, C#, Python, Flutter/Dart, HTML, CSS, JS along with the occasional stackoverflow. I've completed the fundamentals in cybersecurity and Jr Pentesting course on THM too. Some previous interviews said I have good knowledge but my coding standards are to be improved so I'm working on this now. On top of all of this, I am in a dilemma on which tech stack I should focus on because I don't even know what CS path I want to take. I am interested in everything and I end up not being focused and specialized in anything.

I've been applying everywhere within Europe only to get no replies, doing interviews and tasks only to get rejected for having basic knowledge and not having enough experience. 

My home country doesn't have enough internship roles and it's mostly full-time roles that I'm not qualified for.

I don't mind doing customer support roles but even those are rejecting/ignoring me despite my previous experience in a high volume FnB environment.

I also don't have any valuable experiences related to CS to put on my resume which is probably the reason why I don't get called for interviews

As of now I feel like I'm a really useless human being that will become a drop out and fail in life after working hard the last 3 years to graduate and make my family proud after everything they've done to save up and ensure I have a good foundation. 

Sorry for the long post, I really appreciate any advice from the community."

Targeting: MSCS, MCS
Research Paper: 1 (related to AI/ML in International Journal)
Projects: 4-5 good projects (related to AI and Full stack web development)
Internships: 3 (total of 6 months internships at 3 different organizations as a software developer)
Work Experience: 20 months till now (at a big IT MNC, working as Software Engineer in Automation, IT Ops and trained in Java, AWS etc.)
Relevant courses taken: C Programming, Operating Systems, Microprocessors, Mathematics (4 semesters), Artificial Intelligence, Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (currently taking a classroom course online)

As you can see, I have my profile centered towards Computer Science throughout my college and after that I was sure I need to get into this field of study. I'm missing out on few subjects related to CS on my transcripts though as I'm from Electronics background.

I had good LORs and SOPs drafted for Fall 2022, but unfortunately got rejected for CS grad programs from US universities like USF, FSU, SUNY Buffalo, UNT Denton etc. I couldn't clearly understand the reason behind my rejection from all these universities.

Was my UG GPA not enough for these universities?
Was my UG field of study (Telecommunication) an issue as I'm looking for MSCS/MCS?

I'm planning to take my chances again for Fall 2023 (this time I'm planning to apply to 2-3 universities in Canada too), I've added few other good projects to my profile in the last one year, have learnt some new technologies in programming and am taking classroom courses for DSA to make up my missing prerequisites.

Need your opinion on if my profile is good enough to make it through to some good university? If you think so, can you name any universities for my reference?
Any idea why I was rejected from all universities last year, was it because of my profile or can we just call it hard luck? :(

I'm thinking of these universities this year: IIT Chicago (MACS), UCF, SUNY Binghamton (MSIS), CSULA, UTA
Canada: UNB, Dalhousie University (MACS), Saint Mary's University (Msc. CDA)

There is scripting involved in my current job but that's not my main focus as others mostly handle it, I have added just a few small procedures. 

I think I may have an opportunity to take on a mobile dev internship which then progresses to junior after 4 months. I am a bit worried though, because since I have never build a project on my own or worked in a team that build software professionally, I feel like I may not be ready and will be awful at it. Am I better off building a few projects on my own before leaving my current work and taking on internships/junior positions? Or is it better to take the internship if I can and handle stuff as they come?

Some additional info: I am working in a pretty big hardware company at the moment that I started right after my last university semester a few years back. 
I was studying for a bachelor's degree in computer science, I still have to complete my thesis however."

wozj75,674,2022-08-15,Want to be successful in IT? YOU have to Pick a path,Jeffbx,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/wozj75/want_to_be_successful_in_it_you_have_to_pick_a/,"This is probably the biggest mistake people make in IT.  ""I want to make a lot of money and be successful in IT.  Tell me exactly what to do?""

Here's the formula:  choose a path for yourself.  Have a defined *long-term* goal, and work toward it.  It should take you at least 5-10 years to reach this goal, and it's OK if it changes over time.  If your goals stop after you get your first entry-level role, then that's where you'll stall until you decide what to do next.

Most people who get stuck at helpdesk are there because they just don't know what to do next.  Networking?  Security?  Systems administration?  I don't know - someone tell me what to do!  But no one will - that's a decision that only you can make.  And your boss likely won't do it for you.

There's no defined path upward in the vast majority of IT roles - this is something you just have to do yourself.  

As an example - let's say your goal is to be a cloud architect.  Your plan to move forward might look like:

- Get a CS degree
- Internship with a big company
- Entry-level role after graduation doing cloud admin work
- Look at Google/Azure certs to decide on a direction
- Cloud-centered position at an MSP or at a cloud provider
- Move to more advanced roles
- etc.

The further out you go the less well-defined the goals need to be since they could change along the way.  But as long as you have a defined path in your head, then **what you're doing today should be preparing you for what your next step should be**.  And if you don't know that next step, you're going to stall.  No one will tell you what to do if you can't decide for yourself. And you should ALWAYS have a ""next step"" until that next step is retirement.  

And maybe your goal is, ""decide what specialty to do"" - that's completely valid, since that'll force you to focus on making that decision.  You'll pay attention to what's available, cross off things you don't like, make a short list of the ones you do, etc.  So it's still OK if you don't know exactly what you want to do, as long as your goal is to make that decision.  But having a plan is your responsibility - don't overlook it."

I got an internship this summer at a startup working on creating meaningful analytics using machine learning and visualizing it. Because it isnt paid, and money is tight, I work full time while only spending 2 hours a day on my internship and more on the weekends. Unfortunately, most of that time, is spent on reading and learning machine learning with related concepts (because starting off I knew very little about it) and less applying that knowledge. I am worried that when future interviews come around I wont have much to show off. What do you suggest I do?"

I landed a job before graduating at a local mssp close to my house, they gave me a role as a systems analyst/engineer. since May i have grown from just doing firewall and ips monitoring to handling managed web gateway requests, on site support, i dispatch for incoming support calls/emails as well as pushing rules to the firewalls and ips units. we also do email encryption so i also work with the system to add and remove users.

i took this job and settled on a lower salary 39k yearly since it is 10 minutes from home and i dont need to travel, as well as other companies were lowballing me or not offering me anything other then help desk. i am located in the tristate area.

on my offer letter it was stated after 90 days id have a chance of a review and possible raise, in my interview i was told within 6 months id have a chance at a raise. im content with my salary i was offered but being that now i have taken on more work im not sure what to expect/handle this as this is my first job outside retail. 

my bosses are partners in the company and both have told me that they are very happy with how i am working out and have pointed out i should keep working with the higher engineers to keep learning stuff which i have been working to.

Now being that ive written a whole story: what should i expect next to come in this position and what should i do to keep growing and not end up plateauing with this company. i understand that in tech it is common to move on to a better position. I would like to continue working in an engineering role and maybe work more with blue team or purple team in the future."

wpbkg2,13,2022-08-15,Considering dropping out of school.,moonstarsfire,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/wpbkg2/considering_dropping_out_of_school/,"Hello, all. I have completed 27/60 hours in my Clinical Mental Health Counseling program, and I am considering dropping out. My anxiety started when I went to schedule with my own therapist, who works at a big low-income community health chain in my area, and I saw that she was seeing 10-12 clients a day, 5 days a week, with 45 minute sessions. When I asked her about it, she said originally she was seeing 12 but had to ask to cut down to 10 because it was too much. She said that‚Äôs the norm, and that starting pay was ~$50k for the first few years working at a community health clinic or non-profit. That really freaked me out, because I‚Äôm not trying to work over 40 hours a week, and it seems like the norm is 50-60.

I have my own mental health problems (treatment resistant depression, which I am honestly not dealing with well), and I am concerned the stress and emotional toil from seeing this many clients is going to cause me to burn out, or that my own issues are going to get worse from hearing people talk about their problems all day or from the stress of it all. The burnout and stress stuff concerns me because I was originally a teacher, and I had seizures from the stress 2/4 years I taught, so if this is going to be just as bad, I don‚Äôt see the point in pursuing it.

I talked to an intern who told me she was overloaded with clients at first and had to cut back because it caused her to burn out, and she said she had to seek counseling because of the emotional aspect of the job. She decided to only work part time and has a full time job doing something unrelated. I also talked to a counselor who has been in the field awhile who works part time with the prison system and part time in private practice, and he said the pay is better in private practice, but there are no benefits and if he didn‚Äôt have his wife‚Äôs insurance, he would be on a ACA plan (I live in Texas, so we don‚Äôt get subsidized rates). He also told me that for every client he sees, it takes an hour to do paperwork for them (he said this could he because he has to be really detailed since he is called into court all the time), and that he would see 25-30 clients max a week‚Ä¶so that‚Äôs like 60 hours. 

I have no interest in working in private practice because of insurance issues and the lack of benefits, but from talking to people and reading here, it seems like everyone eventually ends up in it because it seems to have better work/life balance and pays more. I really wanted to work in hospitals, or for a community health organization, but it sounds like people at the latter are overworked and underpaid. I grew up low-socioeconomic status, so having stability, good pay, and benefits is really important to me because I‚Äôve gone without all three for long periods of time and I don‚Äôt want to go back to that life. I also don‚Äôt want to do anything that‚Äôs going to make my mental health worse, and it worries me that every counselor has a counselor. 

Is there a way to have work/life balance, good pay, and benefits in this profession? And is being a therapist sustainable when you don‚Äôt have someone else‚Äôs income to fall back on? I‚Äôm 32 and really I‚Äôm more concerned with meeting someone and starting a family at this point in time, and I‚Äôm afraid the long hours are going to get in the way of that. I‚Äôm strongly considering applying to a school library job because I am currently a librarian and with my teaching certificate, I could make $64k right now and it would be leas stress than in the classroom. 

To be honest, it‚Äôs hard for me to even tell if I‚Äôm passionate about this line of work anymore because working full time and taking 9 hours every semester has me so worn out. 

Sorry for the novel. Reading here has opened my eyes to the reality of the profession, and I guess I‚Äôm just wondering what it‚Äôs actually like and how people practically do it."
wpbnpw,1,2022-08-15,"I feel burnt, what should I do?",softdeveloperguy,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/wpbnpw/i_feel_burnt_what_should_i_do/,"Hello,

I want to get to the point immediately. So, I soon to be graduated as a software engineer. I did 1 internship as a unity game developer for 6 months. Besides that, I put as much time as possible into self-learning. I'm talking about online courses. However, there is a problem with that. My goal was to learn something from scratch to a very advanced level and find a related job with that knowledge. But my learning process cut every time and ended up finishing many courses in different programming languages at the beginning level. So, I know a few languages and I can create the same basic applications with all of them but nothing advanced. I'll give you an example, I can think of so many apps and solutions with just C#, but I can't build a web application or web API with SOLID principles and extreme clean code, like I can't guarantee that it will contain those industry needs and I think like this is necessary and it feels so overwhelming for me because I can't just learn that, I mean I need experience or need to watch someone else do it real-time to teach me and show how exactly it works.

Lastly, 2 months ago I applied for a .Net bootcamp and got accepted. Now it is finished and I'm waiting for the company's offer. Because they sponsored the bootcamp and they'll offer jobs to the people that succeed. While I'm in this process, another company offered me a job but they work with PHP. Until this point, I always worked with OOP languages like C# and Java. Now, they shared a PHP course and I'm watching it but man, besides the difference and difficulty of PHP, I don't want to watch anything right now. I'm done, I can't even look at the screen for 1 straight minute, I feel burned, like I spent all of my energy on something that I can't even benefit from. It is too much for me to watch another course or some tutorial. I don't know what to do.

My dream is just to be financially stable. People say you gotta be passionate about your job but this ain't my dream, it's just a tool or the path that I'll go through for my dream.

I am asking for your advice, experience, or anything that will change my perspective and get rid of this overwhelming mindset.

Thank you."
wpbpgb,1,2022-08-15,"dear older sister,",hxkcc2222,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wpbpgb/dear_older_sister/,"i just broke down crying after what had happened with my mother. i haven‚Äòt cried in months and that was my final straw. 
so yesterday my mother was ironing my new (thrifted) shirts, saying they were ugly and my style is shit (baggy). i told her that i liked it and she said i wasn‚Äòt girly at all, which confused me because she doesn‚Äòt let me wear tight clothes. she was calm the whole time but i couldn‚Äòt handle that. she threw insults after insults at me and i cried a lot yesterday. also because of what had happened the previous day. she was looking at my pictures from 3 years ago and told me i was so so so so so ugly. she‚Äòs right, but that hurt a lot. because i still look like that without makeup, i just lost weight, changed my hairstyle and took off my glasses. she constantly says i used to be so fucking ugly, and whenever i look in the mirror without makeup i still see my old self. i don‚Äòt deserve to hear this from my own mother and the saddest part is, that everytime she used to look at me back then, she must‚Äòve thought ,,i have such a fucking ugly daughter.‚Äú and i never knew she thought of me like that. maybe that‚Äòs why she treated me better when i had my big glow-up. and today she wanted me to write an e-mail and it was 9pm. i jokingly told her that it was late and couldn‚Äòt think much this late. she then yelled at me and said i was so lazy and useless. that was where i just couldn‚Äòt hold it in anymore.
also the fights with my younger sister are stressing me out a lot. i see her as my best friend, we do everything together. she‚Äòs 4 years younger than me but we both have a lot of interests in common, i love her. but recently she‚Äòs been very (!) rude to me and obv i confronted her. btw i‚Äòm doing a 2 month summer internship in an office and it‚Äòs stressful, hot and i don‚Äòt have a lot of free time. i got my first paycheck and the big sister i am, i gave her 50 bucks so we could go shopping together. i also bought her A LOT of stuff, food etc. she was thankful obv. but she still was really (!) disrespectful, joking about my appearance, which i‚Äòm very sensitive about. also yelling at me for little things and giving me the silent treatment, even though i did nothing wrong. i told her that i did a LOT for her, gave her a LOT of stuff even fucking money i worked hard for, i told her to not treat me like literal shit and respect me. she also uses my shit against me. i gave her a shoulder to cry on when no one did it for me, my mother is less strict to her and she also didn‚Äòt get as traumatized as me. i may sound selfish but it‚Äòs the truth.
and i don‚Äòt even want to start about my father. he‚Äòs emotionally absent, has anger issues and abuses my mom emotionally. we never talk, and if we do, it‚Äòs only because he needs me for a fucking e-mail or when he has to repair something. i‚Äòm always his target. 
i feel so unapprechiated. i feel so hated by everyone, even my cat. 
i‚Äòm only here for my emotionally disabled older sister. she seems normal but is disabled. she can only talk. it‚Äòs very difficult and hard for all of us and when i think of her i get so sad. my mom hits her a lot when she doesn‚Äòt do as said or when she‚Äòs just in a bad mood. it has gotten better this year but when i‚Äòm not around i‚Äòm always paranoid that she will beat her (to death). my sister gets angry quickly, hits and swears at people. she has epilepsy so she has seizures often. these are the only times my family fucking cares about her and that shit breaks my heart in a trillion pieces. i don‚Äòt wanna make my mother look bad because she looks after her, like cleans her, makes food, entertains her which i could never take care of her because i go to school and she stays at home. my mom mentally is in a better place so she isn‚Äòt as angry as before. but as i said she‚Äòs physically abusive to her and one time she almost stabbed her or fucking hit her face with a plate full of food and chocked her with the food to the point where she was bleeding, infront of all my siblings and me and we are traumatized. even my younger brother. that day on i became her second mom. i take care of her, sometimes do her makeup and hair, dress her up, play games with her, make food for her and every good thing i can think of, because she deserves the whole universe. she loves me too and we have the strongest bond. i would take a bullet for her. i would do anything in my power to protect her, because she can‚Äòt do it for herself. she‚Äôs even disrespected by my father and other siblings. she‚Äòs my everything and i won‚Äòt let anyone do anything to her. the day she passes away from her illness is the day i lose myself. she has my whole heart, she‚Äòs been through so so so much, and is so traumatized. allthough she‚Äôs been treated like shit she still smiles everyday, she greets me with the biggest smile, always, everyday, and hugs me. i will do my best to make her happy because her smile is the only thing that can warm my heart.
typing all this, i‚Äòm crying so hard. there are countless memories like this, i have more bad memories than good ones. 
everyone hates me and i hate myself too. i don‚Äòt know anymore, i want to keep going but it‚Äòs hard. 
the only reason i‚Äòm here is because of her."
wpea9m,1,2022-08-15,Should I quit my current job? I have barely any experience,Maxfarace,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/wpea9m/should_i_quit_my_current_job_i_have_barely_any/,"I started an internship with a company last summer (2021) while I was still finishing up school. It was nice because it added experience onto my resume. At the end of the summer my boss offered me a permanent position to work remote while I finished up school. This was great because all of my classes could still be taken online due to COVID still being an ongoing issue, and I could work from home. Sounds awesome right? I get to work from home for my first job out of college.

I won't go into all the details about the specific position and how he explained salary and benefits, but I work for a Fortune 50 company that is generally structured as salary and commission. The expectations for the role seemed a little high, however I didn't stress because my boss made it sound easy. I started out quite slow because it can he quite tedious to learn everything - even after a year I still don't know how to answer every question I get from customers. We've had a LOT of issues with turnover since January of this year which means I get stuck with the workload of all those that quit. And my workload was already astronomical for the horrible pay. I do the work of 2 maybe 3 people and I make 31k a year... (minimum wage in my area).

Now my question: I finished college in March with a bachelors in Finance and I've been applying to new positions since then. However, I can't find anything that will pay me more than 40k a year (on site or remote). I do live with my girlfriend so she would be able to help cover costs while I find something new. I've put up with bullshit at this job for for so long (while my boss is on his 6th or 7th week off so far this year). Should I quit until I find a new job? With hardly any work experience I fear I won't be able to find even an entry level position with a gap on my resume.

TLDR: Just finished college with Finance degree - have one year experience in a toxic/stressful environment. Should I quit my job until I find something new?"

I just finished my degree in CS today, and want to hit the ground running on the job search. I've had plenty of input from friends/family, but I think some unbiased povs could be very helpful. As a bit of background, I graduated with a degree in finance in the middle of the original Covid lockdown, and had a hell of a time finding a position. During this search I realized my real passion lay with CS, so I went back to school for degree #2, and I'm excited to finally start a career. 

Would love to hear any feedback at all. Specifically wondering about removing the two earlier internships, as they were pretty low-impact and a bit irrelevant to SWE, along with pushing the resume to 2 pages.

Thanks in advance for any help!

wpgqa1,11,2022-08-15,[University] Undergrads,dimen1004,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/wpgqa1/university_undergrads/,"Hello, just writing this out because I feel the need to just share some advise / suggestions even though most peeps probably don't really need it haha. It's not freshie specific / certain year specific, just in general. Mostly for probably the small handful who might be feeling lost while in uni! 

For the engineers and freshies, if given a chance to participate in research like URECA / A*star, go for it, don't hesitate. Great for skill building, great for deeper understanding, and practicality wise great for portfolio and networking. It can also help you better gauge whether research field is really what you want to pursue in the future.

Any event held for industry talks, always try to make time for it, helps to build network and know more about whether it's what you want. Don't hesitate or miss such opportunities because you might have fears of not wanting to speak up or interact with others. That's alright, at least sit in and listen, connect with them on LinkedIn / other socials they provide to all. Same for workshops!

If you happen to fail certain modules and have to retake them, don't beat yourself up and dwell on it too much. Take it as a lesson learnt and reflect on what might have gone wrong, and work on it the next time you retake it. And for those who might have slacked off abit too much like me and are regretting your previous years mistakes, make do with what you have and try to pull up your GPA to the best that you can, and build up portfolio via summer / winter internships or even part time jobs related to your field or that helps build up technical/soft skills! 

As I know not everyone might have the privilege/same opportunity presented to you from the majority, do not worry too much! Enjoy your uni life, manage your time wisely, work hard and play just as hard, make friends when you can, join clubs and CCA if you are available to do so, if you gotta work and sacrifice your social life to feed your family/yourself, go for it. 

You can always make use of what you have. not much work experience? Seek help from your uni career office to craft a resume that can help to make even your one single experience stand out. There's always resources out there if you just take the first step and reach out for it. 

Sorry this is long winded and all over the place. As always, mental health is just as important as working hard and playing hard! :)"

I did it as my computing SIP and welps if like me you couldn't secure SEP etc., you can still go on an overseas intern

Also, I remember being stressed looking for internship before summer break because that's when everyone is applying and the competition is pretty high. Looking overseas is definitely another option, and I found it much to apply overseas than at Singapore, I had interviews within a week of applying, though it might also be because I was looking at Taiwan which has a different academic schedule than us and thus less competition.

Anyhows, feel free to ask me questions if any!

The position I applied for was an internship, but because I recently graduated I'm considered part-time and I got hired.
The initial contract was that I work 20 hours per week but after my first extension, I was told I could work 30 hours for 2 months. Then after two months I was told I could work up to 40.
My contract was supposed to end on 8/31 after having it extended twice. I was told today by my mentor that both him and my director vouched for me and told our VP that I should get FT, but because fiscal year deadline is in October, and apparently there are some budgeting issues, my contract got extended for the 3rd time until the end of October. Not only that, but I now have to go back to working only 20 hours.

I'm trying to think positively and give them the benefit of the doubt that it really is a budgeting issue, but I cannot help but think this is just a cover up and they're just extending my time to give me 2 months to look for another job...

And I know that I'm being very broad but your experience at whatever big tech you have worked at would be nice. So far I am leaning toward Austin cause of the big tech hub there but like I said I have no clue what to expect.

I graduated from college with an engineering degree this spring and have just received my first job offer. It's for a company I am very interested in working for; it's in the industry I hope to build my career, and I will have the opportunity to learn and develop the skills I would need to either advance or get my next job in that industry.

My only reservation in accepting is the salary. I was offered 60K. Despite my research and internship experience, I was offered an entry-level position as I have no experience in this particular industry. I am familiar with some of the instruments I‚Äôd be using but none of the other procedures. 

There is the opportunity for advancement in a year, and they‚Äôve laid out the specific metrics used to make that decision. It kind of feels like they are essentially paying me to learn and grow into the role I‚Äôd like, however, living expenses are no joke! Especially right now.

I want to take the job because the work being done is very new and exciting. However, I feel like I‚Äôm restricting my earning potential. 

I have submitted many other job applications, and I am waiting to hear back from other companies. 

What would you advise?

I‚Äôd be happy to provide more details if I have been too vague to inform your thoughts. Mostly I am interested in hearing your advice.

Thank you!"

Amazon was my first ever OA and technical interview. I took the assessment as practice for other assessments because I thought there was no way in hell I would advance past it. But I did and then I got my hopes up way too high while preparing as hard as possible. 

I tried not to hope so much, but when you put so much work into preparing for something I feel like you just can‚Äôt help it.

I am currently a 4th year student at Tech and I just wanted to say something to everyone. If you are a freshman or someone who has never lived away from before, your feelings are valid. You might all be feeling a whole mix of emotions, and it is totally normal for all of those feelings. I can guarantee you most people at this school experienced similar feelings. If you are worried about making friends, don‚Äôt be! Tech is a great place to meet likeminded people who share your interests, or even to try out a whole new activity. 

The first few weeks will be wild, as you make friends, lose friends, and miss home and your family very much. In the next few months, campus will be a buzz with talks of career fairs and internships. Many of your freshman friends will land cool internships, and many will not. You yourself may or may not, and that‚Äôs OKAY!!! You are a freshman, and you go to one of the best schools in the country. The Georgia Tech name is a golden ticket to so much opportunity, you will be looking back in several years thinking ‚Äúwhy was I so worried.‚Äù 

Georgia Tech will push you. It will make you cry. It will make you mad. But it will also make you happy. It will bring you memories that last for a life time, and it will give you some of the best friends you could imagine. Above all, take care of yourself. Both your physical and mental health are important, and it‚Äôs important to sleep, exercise, and remember to eat! You will fail tests, and for many of you, this will be the first time in your lives you have failed. Embrace it! Learn from it! And come back stronger! I wish everyone a great start to their next journey, and welcome to Tech yall!!!"
wpkc8e,5,2022-08-16,need some advice,choices12,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/wpkc8e/need_some_advice/,"Hi everyone!

I just graduated from community college with a Business Administration degree. I am currently stuck on this decision that I have to make in a week and a half.  So back in February, I got accepted into Rutgers-New Brunswick business school(an hour away from me). My major will most likely be either Business Analytics and Information technology or finance. I am currently enrolled but realized I will be coming out of school with most likely 25k of debt (found that out by seeing my the cost of living in a dorm is 20k). 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I am realizing there is a cheaper option at another school. The school is at Rowan University(it's like 20 minutes away from me). But, instead, I would be getting a Business Administration degree and not living on campus for my next two years. I also will most likely have less than 5k of debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I am stuck is that Rutgers is a good business school and has a lot of great networking options compared to Rowan. I also would be getting the so-called ""college experience"". I could also potentially grow more as a person/adult(as many people have mentioned to me). But, I am in 20k debt.

&amp;#x200B;

OR

&amp;#x200B;

I could go to Rowan and have barely any debt. But, the internships and people I network with would not be the same. Due to it being a small school that isn't known for business at all. I am also unsure how businesses view a Business Admin degree(since it is so broad).

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I am very unsure of what I should do. I have tried to talk to everyone I know and it has been mixed results. Also, like to know if either of these degrees I have will be good when it comes to applying for jobs. If so what jobs would be interesting? In general, I would love to hear your opinions! Because my decision is coming up soon haha."

I did intro to computer science in python course and scored an A in it (I did know about coding in python even before starting). Now I want to progress and by the coming summer break (May 2023), I wanna aim for a CS internship, at any company. My long term goal would be to go into Artificial Intelligence, but for my first internship, I'd just take anything. The course I'll be taking next semester is Computer Logic and Foundations of Computer Systems. I know I'll learn a lot, over the next two semesters but I currently have a 3 week break and I want to utilize it as much as I can, by doing learning and doing CS projects. 

The only problem is that I don't know where to start. I know a good deal about basics of python (other languages are pretty much the same, so it won't take much time to learn something else). Should I learn some other languages/frameworks, to better prepare myself for internship? Where should I start?

What are the main things that a computer science major, who just started, do to get his first internship?"

I am not sure where to prioritize my time, however. Should I just spend most of my time on Leetcode? Building some personal projects? Do I even stand a chance getting hired with no internship experience? Should I even bother applying to jobs right now, or should I just wait until I feel very confident about my projects and technical skills? I really just want to land an entry-level job.

I'm trying to land an entry-level job or internship in data analysis. My work experience consists of working in a library for a couple of years, and some volunteer work, both of which have nothing to do with data analysis so I chose to not include them. However, my resume now looks awful and I'm not surprised that none of the 50+ job postings I applied to have answered me.

Right now, I'm trying to learn some advanced concepts in SQL to maybe stand out, and the plan is to do a good data analysis project for my portfolio, in case that helps me in any way (I already know the basics: select, order by, inner/outer joins, create table,....and I learned a bit about ER schemas in my master's program). After that, I want to become better at Tableau, and learn PowerBI.

I would like to know from everyone what would you do if you were in my position? And I need the cold hard truth if I ever have a chance of landing at least an internship. I know my resume sucks and I'm lost on what to do. I messed up by not interning in things related to data analysis when I was younger, but to be completely honest, I was lost at that time (when I was getting my bachelor's degree), and didn't know what I wanted my career to be. I know that's no excuse, but still. I finally figured out this year that I actually really like data analysis and I can see myself working in it.

So please, if you can give me any advice on how to make my resume better (since I have no work experience), it'd be much appreciated!

Thank you to anyone who responds!

For C++  I made a terminal game where you have to flip 2 cards to match and you have to match all the cards to win. 

For some of the more advanced projects I have followed some YouTube tutorials and made a really simple facial recognition software that can identify people in a given image, and also another project where it uses the computers webcam camera to follow you around and identify the person. 

I also followed another project on YouTube to build a music player using swift. and the music api to play music with it. 

For C++ I was able to make a simulation with SDL2 where you can move a square in a window and when it hits the side of the window it bounces, you can also increase or decrease the speed of the square. 

I also did some programs using MIPS. One small program was to turn a given argument that you put in and turn it into the decimal form and also get the largest number that you inputted, and another program I was able to draw some graphics onto the bitmap. 

Right now I am currently working on C++ and learning SDL2 so that I can create my own game! 

SO.. basically what I am asking is, are there projects worth it to put on my pro folio so that I could have a chance of getting an internship or even a job? If not please give me some good projects to work on!! Any help is appreciated! C:"

However, I graduated and realized I do not want that at all. What I really want is a stable career with easy access to work visas in European countries, partly because I want to live abroad for myself and partly because my partner is from a European country and I really want to stay with them. 

The only real solution I can come up with is to switch completely to a STEM/tech/finance career (e.g data analyst) except these fields of study are not super intuitive to me, although I'm sure that if I applied myself I could succeed.  I have some work experience, namely a project management internship, working in a non profit, and starting an organization.

I swear it was a lyrical miracle the way I was just about to tuck my depressed ass to sleep when boom I got an email telling me I got it. Dude the dopamine rush after reading that email was really like none other. It felt like a big weight just got dropped off my shoulders. And this summer I did the internship and it was spectacular. My mentors were awesome and helpful and I learned so much. But I just wanted to say thank you everyone who supported me in the comments of that post and everyone that reached out to me providing some form of help because I went through a ton of shit in my personal life that whole year and it just feels like everything somehow turned around so quickly. 


Alright so I just wanted to ask about the internship return offer for the next I've received from TI. It's going to be 32 an hour in the same role I did this summer. I only have about a month and a half to sign it. The thing is that I don't want to do the same role next year, I want to try a different role out to explore my options when I'm a full time. Also, I don't want to stick with the same company for my junior yr internship because I just want to experience working at another company before I go into a full time position. I'm just afraid that I won't get a better offer if I don't sign the return offer. I don't have a lot of time for the recruiting process because of the short deadline for the return offer, so I'm kind of in a dilemma if I should sign the offer or not. I want to take that risk to try and land better internships (hopefully with higher pay too!), but I don't want to lose this offer if it's the best one I'm gonna get."

Once they hit the 8-10 years mark they seem to know a bit about everything, and only need the barest of pointers for them to go off their own initiative.

This new tech lead is not like that at all. They constantly ask the most basic questions, not even related to the project specific info, just basic coding questions. They supposedly have 19 years 'experience', and it has disappointed me severely that after 2 years of keeping this project afloat, I now have a dead weight that's earning 50% more than me.

How can I complain officially about them? I'm fed up, because I've literally gotten more productive work out of interns still in college!"

I am in desperate need of some solid career guidance. Please note I am totally out of financial aid funding so that isn't an option... NO FINANCIAL AID.


I have obtained 118 of 122 credit hours from DeVry (I know please don't remind me) from an account DeVry. Please this is a trigger for me so don't just say well you should be working in accounting. I have been going part time to college since 2003 and the last time I attended was in 2013.I have applied many, many, many times over for an entry level accounting job, but nothing period.I think the reasoning behind this is that I don't actually have any accounting experience at all. 

When I was at DeVry I got offered an awesome internship 16 weeks long at the Chicago mercantile exchange. Although I really wanted to do it if course I couldn't because I had my own place and bills at 19.I don't have good parents that seen me through college, it was more like your 18 leave.

Now it's been so long I have forgotten everything anyways so I am sure I would not be a competent in accounting anymore.

Professionally I have worked in the banking, financially industry for over 16 years. I have done everything from teller work, phone banking, loan processing, loan approval...I had lending authority. The only thing I didn't do bank wise was mortgages.

I worked 7 years in student finance at DeVry. Ironically this was well after being a student with them. Basically I helped new and continuing students through the initial steps to securing their payment method for schooling. It continuing students problem solve financial issues that arose during their time with us. I also had to scrub, go through students whole account profile, over 200 accounts to make sure everything (gpa for grants and scholarships, level years, financial aid, military payments, state and government payments were and would be applied correctly)... No pressure right.

I did a 4 year stint with blue cross blue shield. There I did membership, benefits and claims over the phones. It was during the time the affordable care act (obama care) was implemented and it was a challenging job.

Shortly after this I moved to NWI to be with me partner and you know the job prospects aren't the same here but this is where I live now and I don't want to change that nor is commuting to downtown Chicago a viable option.

Here in NWI I have worked patient registration for 3 years. I started in the ER and moved my way into outpatient registration. There I learned the front desk, lab, preadmit testing and surgical registration.

During the end of my career there I started having problems with my hands, carpel tunnel, back and knee pain... Severe arthritis.I didn't let it affect my job there though but they down sized and I was relieved at that point. I had learned shortly after that I have mental disabilities to that I was never area of.

I hired an attorney and have been through the disability process 4 times now still yet with no luck. This is despite the fact that my the disabilities own standards I have met their requirements ever time for the mental disability.

Regardless of any of that I have to go back to work. My family needs me to work financially and I can't wait much longer to only be denied again for disability.I know you government of anyone else cares about the fact that I should be and am disabled physically and by some mental impairments as well but those are easy enough to hide for the sake of earning a check to take care of my family.

I know I am best suited in an office type of setting with minimal customer contact (pain doesn't make you want to associate allot).I don't even know what I should attempt at but if I am going to have to go back to work I at least want something that can be a career because I got at least another 20 years to work (disability obviously isn't going to happen). Please note I do not want to work in sales EVER.

I know I am pretty much screwed but what is your career guidance."

Professionally I have worked in the banking, financially industry for over 16 years. I have done everything from teller work, phone banking, loan processing, loan approval...I had lending authority. The only thing I didn't do bank wise was mortgages.

I worked 7 years in student finance at DeVry. Ironically this was well after being a student with them. Basically I helped new and continuing students through the initial steps to securing their payment method for schooling. It continuing students problem solve financial issues that arose during their time with us. I also had to scrub, go through students whole account profile, over 200 accounts to make sure everything (gpa for grants and scholarships, level years, financial aid, military payments, state and government payments were and would be applied correctly)... No pressure right.

I did a 4 year stint with blue cross blue shield. There I did membership, benefits and claims over the phones. It was during the time the affordable care act (obama care) was implemented and it was a challenging job.

Shortly after this I moved to NWI to be with me partner and you know the job prospects aren't the same here but this is where I live now and I don't want to change that nor is commuting to downtown Chicago a viable option.

Here in NWI I have worked patient registration for 3 years. I started in the ER and moved my way into outpatient registration. There I learned the front desk, lab, preadmit testing and surgical registration.

During the end of my career there I started having problems with my hands, carpel tunnel, back and knee pain... Severe arthritis.I didn't let it affect my job there though but they down sized and I was relieved at that point. I had learned shortly after that I have mental disabilities to that I was never area of.

I hired an attorney and have been through the disability process 4 times now still yet with no luck. This is despite the fact that my the disabilities own standards I have met their requirements ever time for the mental disability.

Regardless of any of that I have to go back to work. My family needs me to work financially and I can't wait much longer to only be denied again for disability.I know you government of anyone else cares about the fact that I should be and am disabled physically and by some mental impairments as well but those are easy enough to hide for the sake of earning a check to take care of my family.

I know I am best suited in an office type of setting with minimal customer contact (pain doesn't make you want to associate allot).I don't even know what I should attempt at but if I am going to have to go back to work I at least want something that can be a career because I got at least another 20 years to work (disability obviously isn't going to happen). Please note I do not want to work in sales EVER.

I know I am pretty much screwed but what is your career guidance."

Codepath also has the virtual career fair, which seems good for getting an internship, and with ABCS, im not sure if it will help with my meta university application (and could I possibly get a referral from it)?

wpvigp,3,2022-08-16,Legislation to protect entry level workers?,Monoplox,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/wpvigp/legislation_to_protect_entry_level_workers/,"Been thinking about this a lot lately. Currently in a 6 month 40 hour a week internship following my graduation from my masters program. This internship is the only place that would (and will still) have me, despite having and continuing to send out 100+ applications to entry level roles.

It seems as though internships have replaced the entry level role, but do not on their own provide the 1-3 years of experience asked for in many entry level jobs. In my personal example, I had multiple years of volunteer work and 2 internships during the course of my 2 year masters, but since they were part time, the experience seems to mean Jack to employers.

I'm not sure how such a ball would get rolling, but I feel as though some legal definitions and laws put in place (I'm US based for clarity) would go a long way towards putting the entry level job back at entry level. My thoughts off top of head are:

1. By law an entry level job can have educational requirements, but no experience based requirements outside of classroom understanding.

2. Internships are still allowed, but a company must employ interns at a rate of 2 entry level employees to 1 intern. This point is the avoid the entry level job vanishing entirely, were only point 1 implemented.

I'd love to hear the thoughts on you all if such a legislative idea is worth pursuing. Maybe if we collectively put our thoughts together, we in the US could send similar letters and or calls to our reps in various states."

wpx6hr,1,2022-08-16,Got let go from a job today... still don't really know why.,Accomplished_Crew630,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/wpx6hr/got_let_go_from_a_job_today_still_dont_really/,"Just as the title says, I've been working with a cleaning and contracting company the last few months owned by a ""friend"" of mine. When I started I was leaving another job with good pay and benefits because I was also opening my own company doing home inspections. She had reached out to offer some advice for getting started and a few weeks later I asked if she could use some help even part time. She said no problem, come work full time and take the day off if I have an inspection to do, no issue leaving around 5:30 to pick up my kid etc... So at the time a pretty decent arrangement even tho I was making alot less money. It let me do my own thing on the side.

Well the last few days I could tell something was off, I mostly work with her GF who is the 'manager' and I kind of felt like she just decided one day she didn't like me. Maybe because I was getting to chummy with the owner who was my friend, or because she spends 12+ hrs a day working 6+ days a week and feels like anyone who doesn't do that is lazy. (she mentioned how this doesn't bother her because when she started she had been working 3 jobs) I don't really know, but I'm fairly certain she influenced this decision.

So anyway I come in this morning, owner asks to have a talk with me and basically tells me she's letting me go because working there is a ""disservice to me"" because I can't do as much networking for my own business, and sounds like she was upset I'd mentioned my business to clients who were realtors, even tho she was the one who told me to so. I told her that's fine I wouldn't do that anymore if it was an issue, but she essentially told me she wants someone who's 100% dedicated from the get go to her companies vision and enjoys the work... Mind you it's mainly cleaning houses, which I don't mind but honestly don't love. I do truly enjoy the contracting work as it helps me learn my trade that much more and I like to be left alone to just get stuff done.

Now the kicker is from day 1 I've been told how great a job I was doing, how I got sooooo much more done than the last batch of employees she had and how she wants me to be managing people within the year as she hires no people. So basically because I have my business, which she said was not an issue, now it's a problem I guess?

I already had 2 paychecks screwed up because the funds weren't in the account to be paid, one is still on hold until the end of the month now and I didn't complain, I wasn't pushy and I didn't make a big deal of it. I always did what they asked me to do and then some, I made progress on jobs that have been sitting with nothing being done for literal months now because of her old crew and this is what I get for it I guess.

Yes I want to run my own business, this absolutely resolidifies that plan, screw working for other people any longer, but we'd discussed many times that if she continued to give me raises/incentive to be there I didn't intend to leave but that I wanted to at least finish my internship and get my license as I'd put alot of money into being trained for it. And beyond that wanted to help her business grow and expand.

I really want to just fucking give up, my car was stolen two weeks ago with all of my tools and some of theirs, I'm driving a crappy beater my inlaws sold me because we apparently didn't have rental and was planning to use the payout from my vehicle to get something I really liked and keep this as a work vehicle... Now that's probably going to have to wait... I assumed doing a good job, a better job than any of her other employees had done would be enough but I guess not... I'm just sick of dealing with this crap... But tbh if that's what she's looking for I don't really want to be a part of it... She claims she wants me to be able to dedicate time to building my business (I guess I'll get that now) but we'd discussed already that even the fastest growing inspectors take a couple years to get up and running with enough business to do it full time and I had even offered to put her stuff first at least until we had a full staff again.

She had already let her entire staff go because her and her GF said they weren't actually working half the time and were stealing, but this really makes me rethink that... It's entirely possible they just weren't killing themselves for someone else's dream, or that they don't have as much cash flow as they claimed or some combination of those things... The worst is I kind of realized this over the last few weeks when her gf (the gm) was in a pissy mood every day, sucks at explaining how to do the work and gets upset if something isn't done perfectly when it hadn't been explained yet, that the old crew probably wasn't quite as bad as they let on.

Anyway, I'm just annoyed, and angry and anxious over everything I've dealt with the last two weeks... And I won't ever... EVER give a company a commitment like that again. Never, no one's but my own. If I'd been screwing up I'd understand, if I'd cost them money I'd understand, if it was a money thing I'd understand but to me it feels like her gf decided she had some issue with me and this is the cop out explanation I got to justify letting me go. I told her if she still needs help (I know they do) that's fine they can sub contract me for whatever rate I decide on... I'll tell you now it's a hell of alot more than what I was being paid. 

Sorry for the long rant I'm just burned out from everything lately, and now have to explain this to my wife later. I'm going to apply for unemployment, my state is usually pretty good about it and I made it abundantly clear I was not quitting and if I was leaving it was because I was being let go.

Tldr; went to work with a friend who had recently let go of an entire staff, was told me having my own business wasnt and issue and in fact she wanted to help me grow it and was let go this morning because I wasn't 150% dedicated to her company even tho I was told almost daily how great a job I was doing."

Completely Lost...,iron_and_sound,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wpxs1p/advice_for_failed_sophomore_year_of_biomedical/,"I'm a sophomore undergrad BME student in Portugal, and last year I failed my 4th semester by 2 credits because of relationship/mental health issues, and COVID shutdowns really didn't help, which made me have to retake my second year with the classes I had failed. I didn't give up initally because of my girlfriend's support and enrolled to take senior classes as well to fill my schedule and not be as set back, and keep relationships with my friends/colleagues.

But now I'm going into my senior year with just 3 classes per semester and internship at the end of the year. I'm panicking and depressed because I've lost most of my friends, that now finished the bachelor degree, my GPA is around 2.30, and in my country it's really easy to just get absorbed into an IT job or maintenance job with no fair pay, right after completing my bachelor's, which is the complete opposite of what I enrolled for. I tried getting a summer internship for experience before next year, but I only got an IT one for mobile computing for therapy apps, which I'm not enjoying at all.

I enrolled in biomed because I've always loved the medical world since I was a kid, and I've wanted to create solutions for medical problems and research cancer and diseases, or enroll in an exciting area which could advance mankind and help millions.

I've been thinking of dropping out and switching majors, doing a second bachelor's in something more related with medicine or biology/biotech, and trying to find ways to compensate for lost time and experience, especially since this means it's another year not having a proper job, not advancing with my life. Most of my friends started working this year or are going into the job market next month. 

I feel stuck, depressed, desperate and socially lonely and lost... Any advice/help?"

Okay, long story and while I'm at it, I'm just gonna give an excessively detailed report of my problem because I am super confused about my life rn and I need a place to take it all out anyways.

So basically, made a stupid decision and essentially moved abroad for uni to what I was sold to as a top uni in the x country I moved to, but it turned out to be very *very* meh which made me super depressed and unmotivated to study leading to mediocre grades (3.47 GPA) which I got by cramming and squeezing work the night before exams/deadlines. the whole ordeal meant that I never properly studied the actual subjects and nor did I do ANYTHING outside of class and now I'm in my 2nd year.

I've finally gotten my head straight now but am super stressed knowing that I am way way behind everyone else and ppl are gonna be getting internships by the end of this year, ppl have already done tons of projects and hackathons, and ppl are working as research assistants and co-writing journal papers and I am here w absolutely noting. On top of all of that, my uni's teaching is barely helping but I still need to go to class for attendance so i'm basically spending a shit ton of time in class and then a shit ton of time outside of class just studying.

Anyways, that's just the unnecessary backstory, but what do I do specifically from now on? I'm so lost and desperate i'm literally willing to just jump into lava if that's what'll get me on track. but fr tho i would really really appreciate some step-by-step pointers on what i should do to a. be on top of my game b. build a resume worthy of getting a good internship in 10 months time c. give a good enough profile to transfer to a good uni in 4-6 months time. Thanks!

p.s.  for detail, I've studied python and c/c++ last year. this sem im doing java, data structures &amp; algorithms and computer architecture &amp; organization + i'm gonna be learning solidity for this DAO club I joined and also I'm specializing in AI and machine learning for my degree."

I am a Canadian student in Switzerland studying the Canadian curriculum for a year abroad for my senior year.

**Demographics:**

* White Male
* Upper Class
* Private School (or independent school as we say)
* Hooks: NONE!

**Intended Major**

* Economics, Public Policy/Government/Political Science, maybe philosophy

**Coursework &amp;  Average:**

* Advanced Math, Advanced French, Advance Chemistry, Advanced Physics, Advanced English, and Extra courses (took 10 instead of 8) since freshman year. Socials courses too, but the school doesn't offer advanced socials courses. Most rigorous courseload I could take outside of skipping a year.
* 91% Freshman Year, 93% Sophomore, 94% Junior, this places me about top 5-10%, the school only specifies whether top 10% or not. Technically this would be a 4.0 as 86+ is an A in my curriculum, but I doubt AOs would read my application as such.

**APs:**

* Microeconomics (5), Macroeconomics (5) Comp Sci (4), Environment (4) 
* TBD: Calculus, Statistics, Comp Gov, (can write French &amp; Lit but preferably not)

**SAT:**

I'm a Senior going into my last semester of a 4yr in IT - InfoSec. I've worked fulltime and attended university fulltime. I haven't landed an internship and kind of want to feel out the value of one if I planned around it.

I'm taking my last four classes this semester, and could push one class (IT Capstone) back for the Spring semester to maintain eligibility for an internship in IT Security / Information Security in Spring.

My current job pays the bills but pays around if not less than what an Internship would. If I push this class back I could finish my Security+ studies with my classes on top before applying for said internships.

So, TLDR; Is it worth stretching my bachelor degree by moving one class to my last semester so that I could gun for an internship in a preferred role before graduating?"

wq1c0l,1,2022-08-16,Columbia University: QMSS program vs Data Analytics,snowsnowey,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/wq1c0l/columbia_university_qmss_program_vs_data_analytics/,"Hey All, 

TLDR: what are your thoughts on Columbias QMSS masters program as opposed to their Data Analytics bootcamp? What are pros/cons to be thinking about?

Curious as I am about in the process of applying for the QMSS program at Columbia but keep getting adds for different boot camps that are making me rethink my options.

Background: 

Currently work in structured finance, my first ft job from undergrad and about a year in. Its not for me, great people, and I have a lot of internship experience in finance but it isnt for me nor what I can see myself happy with in a few years. During undergrad (econP) I had to do a thesis and that was my favorite time - finding data, cleaning it, see if it tells a story, and write a research paper. I also have been seeing better reviews in terms of pay and WLB which I value. I am also reaching out to Columbia to learn as much as I can, but I am still aware they will always try to sell me on something so I take their information with a grain of salt as of now.

**QMSS:** A decent amount of my undergrad classmates have gone through this program and they said it was rigorus but they loved it and job prospects are good. They also say Columbia did a good job at helping them finance the 1year program at around $75k. They, like I did, came from an econ background and said the coding was hard but manageable and they thought it was worth it. After talking to my professors who helped my classmates, they also think it would be a good fit for me. 

**Bootcamp:** Its a shorter period of time, and cheaper. I value the holistic education of a masters, but taking on so much debt and leaving my finance job for a completely new field is daunting. With a Bootcamp, its feasible to do it part-time and keep my current finance job. I would still have an income as I take class, and there would not me a financial constraint when I complete it and look for new work as I would have my finance job as a safety net. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts on a Bootcamp as opposed to a masters? Are there other pro/cons I should be thinking about? In the job world, how do people view a bootcamp vs masters? If i have little prior knowledge (apart from econometrics and STATA, sadly didnt learn R) would a bootcamp be too cut and dry ? 

&amp;#x200B;

ty in advance."

I really want to gain experience in the coorperative world that would eventually lead to being good enough to work independently wherever I'm needed.

Some facts:

All degrees from Denmark but I'm not Danish. Spent an exchange semester in Switzerland and it's where I want to move back.

College degree Marketing Management
Bachelors in Innovation and Entrepreneurship
Masters in International tourism and leisure management

2 internships, in Denmark and Germany, small companies, marketing focused

Experience being a marketing project manager in an agency for 7 months, full time
A year an a half student job for a restaurant in the marketing and branding field

Part time shorter term jobs in marketing, branding, copywritting and somewhat strategy. All for small businesses so I'm not super skilled but they were all really happy with my work.

I speak 4 languages. Have worked as a translator. I love writting and leadership (have led a small team), very good public speaker, can inspire people, high work ethic, love a challenge and learning new skills.

I wish to find a role which is dynamic and where I can use above and eventually work for myself one day.

Problem is- I do not know where to start. I don't have one specific high demand skill. My degree is also not MBA, so economics and analytical side is not that developed.

During my exchange, I had a course in Strategy and loved it. I got a very good grade and it seems to fit everything I've written above. However, with my degrees Im not sure I'll get a position like that in Switzerland. Out of all, I found it the most appealing.

I've also made my own course on creative thinking and innovation which I taught to a small group of people and they were very pleased.

I'm not sure how to succesfully start in the coorporative world so that I can build a career that seems interesting, challenging and dynamic and later enables me to work for myself. I would love to have to travel for work as well.

Thank you for any inputs!"

You cannot expect me to just already have a job as a graduate let alone experience. 

I‚Äôve sent about 200 direct applications to industry jobs i meet all of the criteria for but i keep hearing I don‚Äôt have enough experience. Every day that goes by, my unemployment gap gets bigger and my patience wears thinner. I have serious questions for recruiters.

1. What do I do to get out of the catch22 that recruiters created - I need experience to get a job but can‚Äôt get a job without experience. Internship? They don‚Äôt exist.
2. What do I do to get out of the catch22 that recruiters created - I can‚Äôt get a job because I don‚Äôt currently have one but don‚Äôt have one because I don‚Äôt have one because I don‚Äôt have one‚Ä¶
3. What do I do to get out of the catch22 that recruiters created - I can‚Äôt get a job because I have a gap in my CV but have a gap in my CV because I don‚Äôt have a job (Because I‚Äôve just graduated).

convince me that recruiters aren‚Äôt a villain in this story and what can i do to overcome those moronic catch22‚Äôs - please. I‚Äôm also trying to get a minimum wage local job so that I‚Äôm at least doing something but this gives rise to another catch22 - if I get a job being a bartender so that I won‚Äôt be homeless and I apply to an entry level analyst job that I tick all the boxes for, the recruiter is looking to hire someone who is already an analyst, not a bartender.‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd start a business to get some experience on my own but don‚Äôt have any money BECAUSE I CANT GET A JOB!!! Volunteer? ""Hi, company, can I work for your firm for free?"" ""No sorry, that‚Äôs ILLEGAL!"".

&amp;#x200B;

i‚Äòd also like to address some myths/ excuses, which may be true in some cases but is not true in my case/ from my perspective:

1. Employers/ recruiters treat graduates like they‚Äôre toddlers, I am not a toddler, I am a smart and capable adult. Would you say you were completely incapable of doing whatever entry level job you did out of university and would have burnt the whole place to the ground If no one held your hand? If yes you we‚Äôre either actually incapable doing an entry level job as an adult or you‚Äôre being smug and downplaying how capable you knew you were when you were younger, because you obviously managed fine if you ended up moving onwards and upwards. I don‚Äôt require everyone (or anyone) to hold my hand to do a basic entry level job (or most mid-level jobs might I add), I just don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just an excuse.
2. 1 - 2 years of experience required for an entry-level/ associate/ junior position? No, I do not need 1 - 2 years experience to do this job incredibly well as is. Experience, especially at entry level/ junior level is a myth, although I appreciate this being used only as a filter mechanism so you don‚Äôt end up having to trawl through 10000 applicants per job. My brother did a graduate scheme and pretty much straight away became a project manager for a tech company with 0 experience and performs exceptionally well alongside highly seasoned PM‚Äôs.
3. ‚ÄòTraining‚Äô. \*cracks knuckles\*. Employers love to claim that graduates are bad because they need too much training and this costs the company significant amounts of time and other resources, as if it‚Äôs going to take a year for them to acclimatise and cost $1m. Wrong. Going back to basic junior jobs, so long as you‚Äôre not an idiot, any training/ skills required that you feel I need that I don‚Äôt already have, I can learn in my own time is no more than a week. Hasn‚Äôt cost the company a penny and I‚Äôm up to speed just as quick as anyone else.

There are obviously cases/ graduates in which the above aren‚Äôt the case, but I do feel that all graduates are treated like incompetent toddlers, when a lot of graduates are not - stop belittling me. So for someone in my position, assuming I‚Äôm as capable as I‚Äôm making myself out to be, what can I do from a recruiters perspective to convince you? and if there are any other points I haven‚Äôt made as to why you are reluctant to hire graduates, please comment them below, along with what I can do to combat that reluctancy. There has to be a way to break through this mess, everyone that has a degree and ultimately, a job/ career was in my position at some point."

Long time reader, first time poster. Im hoping someone can guide me in the right direction regarding a project im working on during my internship at a local city government. 

I was tasked with editing a map and highlighting select land parcels based on these assessor parcel numbers that are listed within an excel sheet. 

So we went ahead and created that map but now they want some of the data that exists within the attribute table (part of a larger county shapefile that contains building square footage) exported to an already preexisting excel sheet with that building info.

My question is.. how do I go about doing that? I‚Äôve done table joins before and added info to ArcGIS pro attribute tables but this is essentially the same thing backwards. Taking info from ARC and putting into an existing excel. 

Now, the issue is that the attribute table and the excel sheet don‚Äôt have the same order in regards the parcels.. so it‚Äôs not like I can just export from arcgis and copy/paste to the excel sheet. I need to be able to keep the same formatting as the existing excel sheet when I import the data.

Idk, am I missing something or having a brain fart moment? I‚Äôd hate to have to sit here putting all that data manually"

One project I did is data scrape ebay with python to try to improve sales on my (small) ebay store. The python program runs and stores all of the data in an excel file.

I did an internship this summer that just ended but could not secure a full time position with the company due to it being a smaller nonprofit. A couple of months ago I started a job as a delivery driver to pay for expenses (rent, tuition, food, etc.) and have been making very good money doing it (around $20/hr on average, for reference: minimum wage here is $7.25). I just recently heard back from a part-time software developer job that I applied to a couple of months ago with an offer for employment where I would be making about $10/hr. I think this job would look great on my resume as I am applying for jobs when I graduate, but since I wouldn't be able to balance the two jobs and my school, I would likely have to quit my delivery job. Doing so would probably require me to either take a larger loan out or live much more frugally to get by for the year. Should I take the developer job despite the financial risk or should I stick with my delivery job and not have to worry about finances?"

I was recently an EECS student at UMich, and anyone that has complete EECS 280 or has comparable experience with Python or object oriented programming likely has the necessary background required for our project.

Our team is interested in autonomous systems and designing a generalized framework to automate complex procedures with multiple agents. The work we are specifically looking for is integrating a series of machines into our framework. This will primarily require learning about the equipment we are working with, understanding the interfaces, and building code to interact with each piece of equipment through a standardized interface. Familiarity with the basics and best practices of programming in C/C++, Python, Matlab or another object oriented language would be very beneficial.

When I was an EECS student, internships were typically reserved for upperclassmen or after completing 281. I hope this is an opportunity for underclassmen to get experience, learn about software development outside the class room, and at least get a few projects under their belt.

Please PM me with any questions about this or to apply!"

Hi Reddit, 

I want to paint the full picture for you so here‚Äôs some background info. I‚Äôm in a community college 18 y/o and have the opportunity to do a 9 month apprenticeship program at Mastercards product and engineering department and it would be centered around cybersecurity. Im not super interested in cybersecurity but really enjoy the tech field. After the internship is over I would have 1.5 semesters left to graduate.

I also have the option of going to WGU for computer science and continue working at a chase where I‚Äôm making 26/hr part time. I do have a bigger interest in the software engineering aspect of tech. My goals are primarily to get into the field as fast as possible and do not care about the college experience. I also definitely learn better on my own as I figure out during Covid.

Now the questions is boiled down to take the internship lose the chase job and delay starting my career 3 years since I would have to graduate uni (might as-well I would be 2 yrs into my degree). Or go to WGU which is an online accredited and respected uni and grind to graduate in 1.5 yrs and begin looking for work while keeping at 26/hr job.

Side note - Sorry if this is really all over the place I have adhd so I think weird."

I won‚Äôt give specific numbers, but for the sake of simplicity let‚Äôs say I make $50k a year salaried as a worker in IT. I‚Äôve been there almost 2 years. Got hired out of college during covid, where it was very hard to find an IT job in my area. So I took what I could get. I got lowballed but we negotiated to a price I was happy with, seeing as how it‚Äôd been 3 months without me finding a job. 

3.95 GPA, lots of projects, internships, it didn‚Äôt matter. Salaries were low on job listings. Anyways, I feel I‚Äôve done a great job at my job. I get what needs to be done, done. But I make about 25-30% less than the average salary is for that job title. I don‚Äôt even know how to ask for a raise. Do I ask my manager, or HR? Since HR would be the one with the say. 

And do I say the truth, which is I‚Äôm trying to start a family and need more money? That I like working here but realistically I can‚Äôt make that salary work? Or do I say there are other offers, but that I‚Äôd like to stay here if I can get a raise?

Obviously looking for another job is the fastest method, but I really do enjoy working at my company. So assuming I make $50k even, and the standard is $65-70k, about how much of a raise should I ask for? I feel like asking for a $15-20k raise will just get me laughed off. Any advice?"

In Jan 22 I started contracting as a software engineer for a small company in a remote position. I was told that their current developing company was screwing them over and they were looking to create a dev department under their own roof.

I started off as a contractor through Upwork. Over 6 months I created multiple tools in Python and wrote about 75% of their code base nothing but positive feed back. The pay was not great (Ask a software dev) $25 an hour minus Upwork's service fees (wont go into detail here look them up). I was really happy with my position but I always felt like they were treating me as a contractor and not as their new in house development branch.  The only thing I was not happy about was those pesky service fees and me still on my base pay of $25 an hour after I felt like I had proved myself as a developer. Which I have to admit they did take a risk on me initially. 

I figured my first battle would be trying to get put on to the team as either a 1099 or W2 employee, after all things were going great. After asking about benefits if I took the W2 route things got weird. HR would only message me back once a day like they had to ask the CEO and even my boss got a little quiet. HR finally got back to me and said I did not meet the weekly hour requirements to get benefits even though I did in the State of New Jersey where I am located.  I brushed it off as the 1099 route would be better for taxes and such.

Fast forward a week or two to the Mistake... I was tasked on creating a plugin for a third party software. Interesting enough the project seemed like it would have short use anyway as they were planning on using a different service in the near future (Another thing the company seemed to be all over the place when it came to planning). The project meeting was over Zoom and very informal but to my knowledge I got all the requirements down and got to work. I completed the back-end of the application and then moved over to the front end. Being the only person on the dev team and having the requirements/responsibility I decided to build the app using the Flutter SDK.  I completed the app and was very proud of it as it was my first full production app where I linked a database, back-end, and front-end together all from scratch. 

I then learned that my requirements were very wrong and that the front-end of the project had to be completely scrapped and re-written in React JS. The blame was put all on me and I was told that I did not gather all the requirements from our meeting. Also that it was not the first time that I had done this (To my knowledge it was, at least to this scale). Not the best thing you want to happen when you were planning on asking for more money.

What it came down to was the CEO asking me to comp the project. Which I agreed to doing and planned on working the next week for free to make up my mistake. Messed up but keep in mind I was acting as a contractor (If you want to treat me as a contractor I will act as one and hike my rates in a week or two after this passes). I billed them for the pervious week since I went back and forth on the front and back-end which was still usable for the application. I would say that is fair especially when I was going to comp the hours to re-write the entire front end of the application. 

And then... The meeting... I was told they were cancelling the contract due to the mix up that had happened and that while I knocked it out of the park for everything else that I did it ""shed light on to a problematic part of me"". My boss also said he took some of the responsibility of mix up (So why are you letting me go?). The official reason of my termination was lack of sales and that they did not have enough money for payroll and that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. 

To me it seems like they were just looking for some cheap labor and when I started asking for more they had to find a way to get rid of me and move on to the next developer (There were some things that an experienced developer would not do that I found in the code). I am not the only one that thinks that. I do not regret asking for more as I was the companies only developer working a Full Stack Position making internship money. Also why would you shoot yourself in the foot by completely getting rid of all your developers!?!?!?!? 

But the biggest kick in the shin was when they wrote me a 5 start review on how great I was on my Upwork profile a few weeks after the contract ended."

I‚Äôve been having real trouble scheduling my days to balance getting enough work done with having a social life (and hitting the gym, which is non negotiable for my mental health). It would be great to hear how you all approach scheduling your days / weeks. Do you give yourself strict work hours? Do you take time off for lunches/coffees with friends as you please? 

When a friend texts you saying 'lets get lunch' how do you make the choice between 1.5 hours of fun vs work? That‚Äôs the kind of decision I agonize over multiple times a day. I have close friends in other countries that I haven‚Äôt spoken to in months because the time zones don‚Äôt line up well. If I wanted I could spend all day catching up with them. I could also spend all day working because the amount of work I could do is limitless. Neither of these extremes are right, but what‚Äôs the right way to find an optimal middle ground? Should I target X hours/week of work and just accept whatever gets done in that time? 

I‚Äôve experimented with different strategies like ‚Äòstrict work in the morning then be flexible‚Äô or ‚Äò8 hours a day however I get them in‚Äô but nothing has really stuck. Would really appreciate any tips!"

Currently I am a intern in a tech company and we are building system with gRPC.

He doesn't go to school anymore, but insists he's still going to be a therapist. Except at his internship when he was asked to lead group he told the group to masterbate to cope. (He was asked to leave after) He then blames people running the program for the fact he ""didn't know any better""

He barely goes to work too! A mutual friend got him the job and he calls off CONSTANTLY. Then he has the audacity to tell his fiancee that he can't help with rent. When told to work more he responded with ‚Äú do you want me to work a job I hate for the rest of my life making minimum wage ?""

Meanwhile all he does these days is sit around the apartment and play video games. Their kitchen is disgusting, their apartment is a mess. The cat's litter box hasn't been cleaned in three months, he won't walk the dog HE wanted.

And the world HAS to revolve around him. I met this chuckle fuck during D&amp;D and if it wasn't about his character he wasn't interested. Now that he has to start over in a new game and actually share some of the spotlight he isn't interested. And that shit bleeds into real life too. In a moment of vulnerability I told him that yeah I don't really have any important male figures in my life. 
""Oh I guess that would be me then?""
I told him flat out no.

When me and my fiancee got engaged, he started talking about getting engaged to his girl not too long after.
When we bought a house, he started wanting a house too.

And don't get me fucking started on the house thing. They are using another mutal friend as a realtor (and also their roommate) I told him not  to take them on as clients. He's unfortunately best friends with the man child's fiancee and wanted to help her out. 

They were looking at 200k houses when their credit was WORSE than ours. When we told them ""wait until you're approved"" the would flat out ignore us. They made thier realtor drive out to the middle of nowhere to look at houses before they got the call that they were declined for the loan they wanted. They now are looking at drastically cheaper houses. He has said out loud that he's mourning the loss of his economic privilege. 

Other things this waste of space has done:
 
Take $500 meditation retreat and tells everyone, including his job, he's going two days before

Talk about miscarriages In front of my friend who was still suffering mentally from the miscarriage she had. When asked to apologize in person he couldn't understand why he had to.

Ask to be me and my fiancee's sperm donor (we are a lesbian couple, and I know how he has looked at my partner before)

Ask his fiancee to pay for half of her birthday gift he got for her .

Threaten to hit my cat

Constantly let's his dog run around the apartment complex without her leash on. (Despite my constant warnings about how dangerous that actually can be since in my old apartment a dog died in the elevators because of a leash incident)

Get an allowance from his fiancee despite being capable of working


At this point I only want to hang around them for the required amount of time for DND night. 
DM cancelled this week and they wanted to meet up. I already made plans with another player to have a movie night and not invite them."

I'm at the point where I've made a lot of small projects by myself, and they've gotten better as far as design and code organization. I feel ready to jump into a team to work either as a junior developer or even just as an intern, but there is a problem which is affecting my search.

I'm an American currently living in Vietnam, trying to change careers after teaching. I have looked into entry-level jobs and internships in my part of the world but have seen that they're very flooded with local talent, and I don't think I'd be able to compete with their language abilities (most posts need bilingual workers) and lower salary expectations. 

As far as getting work in the US while abroad, I feel silly even thinking about applying given the \~12 hour time zone difference. Surely, it would be a major hurdle for potential employers, especially since I'm a newbie. I can't work nights to line up with US times due to having a baby. 

In about a years' time, I hope to be back working in this field in the US (pending my wife's immigration), but I really feel I need some practical experience while abroad if possible. Do you think it's possible to still land a job or internship? I don't care where and I don't really care about how much money, just want to get my foot in the door.

1.- Stay in spain and hunt for a first job, if possible remotely(i live in a 200.000 inhabitants city with no so much IT offers) and get paid around 17-23k.(Thats what i have been told in Spanish forums), after this first job i will hunt for a new one after 1-2 years to keep improving my salary.

2.- Try to move out of spain and land a job with a salary high enough to live ok without much luxuries BUT with a much more better future prospects

Maybe do a mix of both paths starting in spain? Is being a new grad with 6 month internship enough to find a job in Ireland for example?

I started off a computer science major but ended up really not being able to handle it, and made the decision to switch into psychology and minor in comp sci before sophomore year, with the intention of going for something like UX design in the future. However, I wasn't able to get a single internship this summer. Not one. Not even an interview request or anything. Even though I know I would enjoy the job, everything I've read about it seems to suggest that the field is super super saturated right now and it's impossible to break in without relevant experience. I was originally going to go for an HCI masters, but it feels like a huge risk to spend thousands of dollars on something that might not even be able to land me a job, and because of how specific the masters is I wouldn't really be eligible to do anything else. I made the decision to switch to information systems this fall because of the job prospects being better, but the lack of any internships makes me so nervous, and I'm not interested in any of the classes in the semester plan. I'd also have to stay back a semester since I'd be cramming in the entire course load in these two years, and I feel like I'm gonna hate it, but at this point I don't have the chance to switch to anything else, even if I knew what I wanted to do. I could go back to psychology and think I'd be a pretty good therapist, but my GPA is ruined from the comp sci classes and I have no psychology work experience, so I don't even think I'd be able to get into a psych masters program, let alone PhD. 

I've had such bad anxiety over the semester starting, to the point where I can't eat or sleep, because I don't know what to do with my life anymore and I hate that I can't find a job I would like. I go to a top 30 school on a full ride (so dropping out/taking time off isn't an option) and it feels like everyone around me is on track to have a great career and have all sorts of work experiences and clubs and organizations they're part of, while I have one research lab I did for a year that I didn't even really enjoy. I've been to multiple academic advisors at my school but they haven't been helpful at all, and I've called the counseling center on campus so many times because of panic attacks that they straight up told me not to call anymore. I can't go to any outside mental health services because I'm on my parents' insurance and they're not the most supportive of mental health. I just feel so lost and scared, and the idea of starting fall semester makes me want to die.

Does anyone have any advice for what to do in this situation? I don't know how to figure out a career path I'm interested in, nothing sounds great even after researching jobs and speaking to people on linkedin all summer. I'm terrified I'm gonna be miserable and stuck in some dead end IT job after college, when I don't even like IT. But my parents have too many expectations for me to just major in something creative like film, and I don't think it would be smart anyway to stay a 5th year for something like that when I don't have any related work experience. 

I'm terrified that despite all the networking and clubs I plan to join this semester, I won't find an internship this year. I'm so very tired. Has anyone gone through a career crisis this late in the game, and does it get any better?"

wqtj48,41,2022-08-17,The Value of Good Judgement (x-post),PharmaMBA,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/wqtj48/the_value_of_good_judgement_xpost/,"As I‚Äôve grown older one of the more peculiar things I‚Äôve realized is that there really isn‚Äôt any proven path to professional success. In fact, there doesn‚Äôt even seem to be a consensus definition of success. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to break bread with Chinese billionaire clients, former high school friends turned blue chip VC partners, and post-entrepreneurial retirees in their thirties now training at my boxing gym. Metrics of professional success vary wildly, from raw net worth to annual portfolio ROI to the amount of daily leisure time afforded. The path(s) to achieve such diverse definitions of success is an order of magnitude even more varied.

But there is one common trait that every ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù person I‚Äôve talked to has espoused, and that is the cultivation and application of good judgement. Naturally one might ask, what does good judgement look like? I find good judgement to be easy to recognize when I see it demonstrated, but curiously difficult to actually define. One working definition I like is the *ability to understand the long-term consequences of your actions*. Another is *the ability to recognize, control, and channel your emotions, rather than allowing your emotions to hijack, control, and use you*.

Perhaps it‚Äôs easier to define and better illustrate the benefits of good judgement by demonstrating the application and pitfalls of poor judgement. I‚Äôll share three examples from my own career that I‚Äôve done some reflecting on over the years. It‚Äôs going to be impossible to capture all the nuance and specifics of each situation, but I promise to be as honest and objective as I can.

# Personal Directive

The most common behavioral interview question consulting firms ask prospective students is *‚Äúwhy do you want to do consulting?‚Äù* If we were all telling the truth, the overwhelmingly most common answer would be *‚Äúprestige‚Äù*, followed by *‚Äúexit opportunities‚Äù.* For me it was both. I interviewed well and got several offers coming out of school. However, during my first go-around at consulting, I was absolutely miserable, and perhaps more importantly, terrible at my job.

I spent so much of my time positioning myself to get onto the sexiest projects. I networked well and was able to do so. My peers were jealous of me; early on I was seen as the high-flyer amongst my class, and I reveled in it. However, I consistently underperformed on my projects; I was sorely lacking all the fundamental junior consulting skills my peers had developed on less sexy projects. After two years of underperformance, I did not make the promotion cut and was transitioned out.

**I exhibited poor judgement** by spending too much time chasing what I thought would position me best for exit opportunities, and not enough time figuring out if I actually enjoyed / was good at consulting. My insecurity and (at the time unknown) need for external approval clouded my internal decision-making process. Better judgement would have been to reallocate much (not all) of the time and effort spent networking into actually developing the core consulting skill set. I believe this would have made me a better consultant, and more importantly it would have helped me realize more quickly if I truly wanted to do this long-term.

# People Management

Fast forward a couple years after being unceremoniously booted from my first consulting firm; I was now an engagement manager at another firm running a high-profile project for a first-time client for the firm. One of the team members staffed to this project was an experienced associate up for promotion soon. Over the first two weeks, she spent a good amount of time ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù other team members, but not enough time looking after her own work. I shared my concerns with her during our feedback session, where I was met with a combination of defensiveness and lukewarm acceptance. The following week I asked her to own a menial but critical task (cleaning and aggregating raw data into a pivot table), where she let me know in no uncertain terms the work was beneath her and she would not do it.

Filled with moral indignation and self-righteous fury, I went to the project partner and demanded she be rolled off and replaced with a more competent associate. I told him she was endangering the project, and for good measure, added she was jeopardizing his chances for future projects with this client. This particular partner was not someone I would consider a role model, but on that day he did deliver some sage if not brutal career advice: ‚Äú*You‚Äôre not a leader because you make pretty slides and talk a good game. You become a leader when you can turn a group of mediocre performers into a high-performing team. Figure it out.‚Äù*

On that project, I was unable to figure it out. In the end I could not get any meaningful contributions from the aforementioned associate, nor could I get her rolled off the project. We managed to deliver an acceptable work product at the end, after 11 weeks of consistent 70+ hour weeks. The associate was not promoted and was soon counseled out. The partner did not manage to sell any follow-on work to the client. I received poor marks during my review and developed a reputation among the juniors as a project leader to avoid getting staffed with.

**I exhibited poor judgement** by failing to realize not everyone makes decisions I would. As a junior consultant, I was always insecure about my lack of industry knowledge and a such was always happy to exchange grinding unpalatable tasks on my part for mentoring from my managers. I assumed everyone else was the same; I was wrong. The associate in question had a PhD and several years of industry experience; in hindsight it was preposterous to think she would have the same goals I did when I as in her shoes.

Even more damning, **I exhibited poor judgement** by letting my indignation and sense of righteousness get the better of me. I was so caught up in how I was wronged; I did not have the wherewithal to simply ask her what she wanted, and *actually listen*. In hindsight, it‚Äôs painfully obvious now that one of her developmental goals was to demonstrate more leadership in order to position herself for advancement. It would have been simple for me to reassign the task to an intern and have the associate manage / complete the workstream. Intern gets the reps and coaching, associate gets the management experience, and I get a quality work product. Win-win (win).

# Capital Allocation

I am a small-time philanthropist, donating to local charities and non-profits that champion causes consistent with my value system. I am also a big proponent of impact investing, where the success of the fund is not measured (only) in ROI but in efficiently investing in projects consistent with its mission. I take great personal pleasure in deploying my personal wealth (and time) towards causes I am passionate about.

But I am also a professional investor, where my first and foremost objective is to maximize risk-adjusted returns. Earlier in my career there was a certain political ideology I felt quite strongly about. I believed I, and the people that agreed with me, were the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù and refused to believe those on the other side had anything to offer intellectually. I invested a good amount of personal capital, and even more so personal time and energy, in areas that aligned with my (at the time) ideology. In my mind, I was NOT investing for impact; I truly thought this was the highest ROI decision available to me at the time.

**I exhibited poor judgement** by seeing the world the way I wanted to see it, rather than the way it was. I fell victim to confirmation bias, seeking out opinions that validated my own and discrediting anything and anyone who disagreed with me. My anger at the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù, and more importantly my failure to realize that my anger was driving my decisions, clouded my financial and even spiritual decision making. Please note I do NOT think it is a lapse in judgement to invest in causes you care about; the mistake I made was confusing what I wanted to be true with what actually was true.

# Conclusion

A natural question to be asking at this point is ‚Äúhow do I cultivate better judgement?‚Äù. I‚Äôve already rambled on for longer than I originally intended to in this post, but if there‚Äôs interest I could certainly see myself starting a thread / discussion on that topic at a later date. Most of my thoughts of the matter touch on the intersection of philosophy and spirituality and may not be appropriate for this particular subreddit.

As a closing remark, I certainly do not think it is any sort of ‚Äúmoral failing‚Äù at all to be exhibit poor judgement throughout one‚Äôs life. I find it‚Äôs the best (perhaps only?) way to grow and consequently exhibit better judgement in the future. A mind capable of good judgement is hard-earned; a mind capable of perfect judgement is an asymptote we can strive for but accept we will never reach. In my humble opinion, the moral failing, if there is one at all, is to be capable of yet refuse to live an examined life and learn from our past mistakes in judgement.

Thanks for reading."

I am a 21-year-old college student. I support myself and have no one else to depend on. I just need some advice on what I should do on my situation. I can already tell it is going to be stressful for me and cause burnout. I had gotten a job on campus, however, it does not pay as much and requires me to stay late hours. Due to conflicting schedule times, I am only able to work there Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. On those days I work from 5:30pm-11:00pm. I also get paid a dollar less than my other job. Tuesdays and Thursdays is also when I have classes from 9:30AM-3:15PM. Mondays and Wednesdays are my internship hours, 9:00AM-3:30PM. With my other job I work Mondays (4pm-8pm), Wednesdays(4pm-8pm), Fridays(9am-3pm), and because my client needs a certain amount of hours, my work has me coming in on the weekends working on Saturday from 9AM-2PM and Sundays 9am-3pm. This job is in the healthcare profession and pays just a bit more than my on campus job. However, the state has cut a lot of peoples hours in half so lately I have not been able to get over 30 hours. However, with an appeal, my client has been able to get some more hours, but not as much as before. This job splits my pay hours. So I have to clock in and clock out from being an HHA to ATTC. ATTC means I get paid a dollar less but a dollar more than my on campus job. I was thinking, If I quit my second job, I could get more hours and not have to always work on the weekend to have some sort of a break. While working in the healthcare profession, I would honestly have more time to sit and do any homework or assignments for my classes. With this job I get paid weekly while my on campus job only pays bi-weekly. I just know in the future this may take a toll on me because the only times I am home is to eat, sleep, and shower. I do not have much me time. And with my internship at a counseling center, it would be best for me to have some time to myself and get a reprieve from the heavy topics that are talked about. As well as have breaks from school life.

 I was just wanting to know opinions and advice on what I should do in my situation. I am having a difficult time deciding as I do not want to let my coworkers down at my campus job but at the same time I should be putting my mental health before others?"

I'm going to be a junior now and I am absolutely dreading going back to Rutgers. My entire freshman year was virtual and my sophomore year was pretty miserable. I'm not expecting for my junior year to be any better. I have no friends and everything is an isolating experience. Going to class? No one talks to each other. *No one.* Clubs? Everyone just stays isolated in their own little groups. And I'm going to be honest - I don't have the charisma points to just turn up to a random place alone and strike up a conversation with someone.

It just doesn't work for me. I have no semblance of a social life. Forget parties - I have no get togethers, no one-on-one hangouts, no one to call if I wanted to go to a concert or an event.

And if I just try to go out on my own - to the gym or even to grab lunch from the dining hall? It still sucks. Because now I'm being reminded of how alone I am. Sometimes I would go out to buy fast food just to have a little social interaction with *anyone* \- basically a two sentence interaction with whoever took my order.

Last year my mental health pretty much hit an all time low, the first time I've ever had to seek out therapy (which honestly didn't really work). I go to all my classes. I joined clubs and organizations. I did what I was supposed to but it didn't work. Rutgers feels like high school 13.0, and now as a junior it feels legitimately impossible to make friends because that ship has sailed.

This summer, I actually felt good at my internship. I got fairly regular human social interaction (and although I probably didn't make any lifelong friends), I did get to meet interesting people who were nice to chat with, grab lunch, or get a coffee. I basically got an elusive taste of what I never had - and now I have to go back to my ""normal."" Every time another day of summer passes by, I get more of a gnawing feeling in my stomach.

Sorry if this sounds like one long complaint. There are definitely things that I appreciate about Rutgers - don't get me wrong. But this is definitely something I am not looking forward to. I just had to get it off my chest - and it seems Reddit is generally an OK place to do that.

Edit: This is a throwaway account and I figured to check it over the weekend - I did not realize the level of traction this post would gain. It's vaguely reassuring (but also very concerning) that there are a lot of people in the same situation as me. Shoutout to whoever made the Discord server, that actually sounds like a great idea. And thanks to the people that PM'ed me as well!

What I got from a lot of these comments was that the pandemic really messed up a lot of people's social lives - which is something I felt as well. Unfortunately, I don't think we've yet seen the full effects of the havoc the pandemic's wreaked - that's something that's probably going to last decades. But it is very reassuring to see the response to this post :)"

**Step 1: Online Application Form**

**To apply for a role at EY, you will first need to fill out a registration form and an application form. Provided that all information submitted is correct and nothing needs attention from the recruiter, you will immediately receive an email inviting you to complete an online assessment.**

**Step 2: Online Assessment**

**EY‚Äôs online assessment is divided into two components, a** [**situational judgement test**](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/) **and a** [**numerical reasoning test**](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/)**. In order to progress to the interview stage, you must pass both tests. The situational judgement test is not timed and it will take around 30 minutes to complete. The numerical reasoning test is timed and you will need to complete it within 12-13 minutes. We will explain the details below.**

**Step 3: Job Simulation**

**The job simulation is the interview stage of EY, and there are 14 questions in total for this stage with a selection of rank order, written and video answers. The job simulation has a mix of timed and untimed questions, so it‚Äôs essential to prepare yourself, as this stage must be completed in one sitting. On average, this stage will take around 60 minutes. In order to provide excellent answers, it is important to understand what interviewers are looking for. Our** [**Job Interview Pro**](https://learnandpass.co.uk/interview/) **online course will make you fully prepared for any tough interview questions.**

**Step 4: EY Experience Day**

**If you are successful in your Job Simulation, you will be invited to attend the EY experience day. EY experience day consists of multiple parts, some of which you need to complete individually and other parts you need to complete as part of a group. During the exercises, you‚Äôll be required to use a webcam facility in order to interact with your assessor. EY has a great emphasis on sustainability and related topics. It is important to do some readings on this subject. During the experience day, you may be asked questions about sustainability.**

**Step 5: Final Interview**

**If you meet EY‚Äôs assessment benchmark during the experience day, you will need to attend a final stage interview with one of the company‚Äôs senior members. It will be a one-to-one interview, and you will be assessed on areas such as your motivation, your understanding of EY, including their strategy and services, and your skills and strengths. You may also need to do a presentation depending on the area you are joining. The topic for the presentation will be sent to you in advance. In our** [**Job Interview Pro**](https://learnandpass.co.uk/interview/) **online course we explained how to answer some of the tough interview questions with specific examples. If you are not confident with your interview, you may learn a lot from our course.**

### How to prepare for EY‚Äôs online assessments?

**Although EY uses online assessment tools both during their online assessment and experience day, the questions can be categorised as followings:** [**numerical reasoning tests**](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/) **and** [**situational judgement tests**](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/)**.**

**If you are invited to complete EY‚Äôs online assessment, you can practice our numerical reasoning tests, especially numerical reasoning tests in** [**Group B**](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/)**. During the** [**numerical reasoning test**](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/)**, you will see a set of questions, each with a chart and a related question. You will need to calculate them within a specific time frame to pass the test successfully. If you pass our tests multiple times, you should be able to pass EY‚Äôs numerical reasoning tests confidently.**

**EY‚Äôs situational judgement tests are scenario-based questions that ask you to rank multiple options according to your preferred way of action in that situation. Some questions may ask you to choose an answer from multip options. Our** [**situational judgement tests**](https://learnandpass.co.uk/practice-online-tests/) **are developed to simulate actual situational judgement tests. You will be able to cover almost all scenarios that may appear in a real assessment with our more than 150 practice questions.**"

I worked on average 2 days a week this summer and it is according to my direct reports boss, I should have worked with her because they are ""very flexible"" even though it was a statement that she told me. Recently I had an altercation with her where I messed up on an assignment because I had some personal stuff going on in my life and I wasn't focused and she started prying into my life trying to figure out what was wrong but when I told her it was private, she kept pressuring me to share and I asked her how she would like me to fix it and I was sorry but she kept going at it. She then started saying how the other interns who did similar tasks didn't have difficulty reading it but I have dyslexia and ADHD which she knows about and even the shortest of sentences can be challenging at times which is why I messed up. She started belittling me without even telling me how she wanted me to fix it and started attacking me as a person so I left the office. I have since been banned from the office for two weeks and I have to apologize to her and according to her boss I should have opened up about my personal life even though it is not something I was comfortable about sharing. 

With all of this in mind, I really don't feel comfortable working here anymore because I am literally being blamed for my disabilities and not wanting to be bullied and peer pressured into sharing things. Everyone else at the office likes me and my work and I like everyone else, but I can't feel safe knowing that I will be thrown under the bus for one wrong thing and treated like garbage. I already spoke with a head department member who confirmed that the only people who know about the altercation is my direct report and her boss as well as the person I spoke with, but only because I told them what was happening.

As far as LoR go, I'm planning on using my master's thesis advisor for one and the lead professor for a research group I did some work in for a second. As far as a 3rd (my interested programs require 3), I'm a bit torn between two options:

(1) Professor whose class I took last semester. The class had discussions for lectures I participated in, and most of your grade came from an independent semester-long project that gave you quite a bit of freedom. I ended up doing very well and getting good feedback on the project and the class and I think the professor seems to have a positive view on me, but I wouldn't say we were very close, I didn't go to their office hours or talk to him beyond participating in class discussion/asking questions in class. To reiterate, they are a current professor (research in a machine learning related field, and obviously has a PhD).

(2) Boss for internship I did this summer. I worked as a machine learning intern (applied, not research) for a company this summer, and my boss is pretty happy with my work. Since my boss and I had to talk and work on things on a daily basis, I would say my boss probably knows me and my work flow better than the professor. However of course, they are not and never have been a professor. They do however have a PhD (from MIT) they got only a couple years ago.

My MBTI type is ISFJ and my enneagram is 6w5. 

I know that I don‚Äôt want to end up in a low income job and that as someone who has grown up in a low income home, I have always found my parents‚Äô financial status to be annoying even though I understand that both have ended up in this position in life due to childhood trauma. 

I understand that this is why everyone in my family has so many problems - due to childhood trauma, and there is greater generational trauma within the family due to the fact that we are black. 

Unlike some people, I do not have ‚Äúgood social skills.‚Äù I can empathize w other people and know how to be polite in convo, but cannot name a single time in my life wherein I have been ‚Äúpopular‚Äù and there have even been one or two points wherein a fair number of ppl disliked me. 

I would really value a non toxic work environment. 

I was good at completing tasks for my summer internship and felt particularly happy when working w the kids, specifically the black kids (felt a greater urge to be a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù person.)

I offered to help out a boy in my computer science class (which I hope to drop to become a TA) w his English and grammar, as in review his papers. I actually wouldn‚Äôt mind doing something like that. 

I am really liking mental health matters as we are reading the novel ‚Äúpush‚Äù by sapphire, and I like how we are discussing different kinds of abuse. 

My brother is in rehab, my older brother, and even though I perhaps have some slight idk‚Ä¶ trauma in regards to him or things he did a few yrs ago (tho I‚Äôve honestly gotten much better abt dealing w this as the time has passed by) I fully intend to help him out w his life when he gets out. Even though he is almost 23, I want to let him know that it isn‚Äôt too late. 

My strengths: Teachers have been impressed w my writing skills even though the ‚Äústructure‚Äù of junior yr AP English didn‚Äôt work for me, if I like what I am doing I tend to have a good work ethic, I am detail oriented, I don‚Äôt tend to be late or inconsistent, good at remembering historical facts and general things that interest me, I value having a high GPA. I type over 100 WPM. 

My weaknesses: Don‚Äôt have ‚Äúgood social skills‚Äù (would likely not be good at networking bc of it,) have depression and anxiety (but high functioning depression,) don‚Äôt lack self awareness, can be inclined to become cynical or pessimistic, can easily become stressed out even if I don‚Äôt show it, have sleeping issues.

Another weakness is that I also have a lot of learning gaps now in regards to math. I dropped pre cal in junior yr and noticed that for computer science, I couldn‚Äôt remember anymore how to find the area of a circle or solve for number of degrees in a right triangle.

I suspect that I would feel more confident if I looked better (as in, were wearing makeup consistently, had my hair done, etc.) I am not comfortable w the idea of making anything less than $60,000 annually. I always used to like researching salaries when younger. 

I am presently located in Cali but may eventually move, perhaps to a city that has a higher black population. 

I am fine w basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division and wouldn‚Äôt mind teaching this as a part time job or something to small children or people who don‚Äôt understand it. 

I am curious abt different kinds of disorders and disabilities and recall that I partly liked my former crush to some extent in 9th grade bc I understood after reading his paper that he has an undiagnosed learning disability and wanted to assist him. But I think he ‚Äúknew‚Äù I had a crush on him.  

I can grow tired of very physically straining stuff and know I would hate working outside in the hot Sun."

Almost precisely at what most species on the ‚ÄòG.A. Authorative‚Äô considered to be midnight an automated distress signal followed by a less automated ‚Äúway more distress‚Äù signal had been intercepted by one of the frontier worlds and was subsequently forwarded to the quadrant‚Äôs official base of operations.  

Which of course meant that all the council members had to be roused from their sleep and escorted to the council room as quickly as possible. This as you might expect led to certain ‚Ä¶ interesting developments. For one, either Atleon was seeing double or both the Adtnian monarch as well as his body double had arrived at the meeting, not knowing that the other would attend as well. Of course the young monarch had a simple explanation, for you see this look-alike was merely an evil clone.  
Who as evil clones are often known to do, immediately agreed with his accuser, called himself a dastardly rascal before letting himself get handcuffed and carried out of the room.

Atleon had almost found it funny if not for a third Hirunas to walk in not 2 minutes later. Not wanting to get drawn into even more courtly intrigue the Grand Vizier began to mentally recite his talking points, trying to ignore the other panicked heads of state. Most of all his political rival, the esteaming piece of shit Grand Priest Eddiyun.

Whereas Atleon could be described as rather stout and fair (perhaps a tiny bit opportunistic). His co-ruler Eddiyun, was his polar opposite. Lanky, conniving and if Atleon knew what a snake was he‚Äôd probably liken (and wish to feed) him to one.

One might ponder why Eddiyun hadn‚Äôt been ousted from his post as a religious figurehead ages ago on the grounds of laziness and a general lack of respect. After all, he practically sleeps through the entire workday, only to then spend the night attending lavish parties and enjoying himself.  
At first one might blame corruption or nepotism, accusations that wouldn‚Äôt be entirely without merit. But more so than anything else Eddiyun's just a very annoying and dangerous combination of charismatic, clever and ruthless. Whatever work the Theocracy's diplomats and politicians might get done during the day, Eddiyun would easily surpass them at night at said celebratory events.

The following day he‚Äôd merely need to point out who he‚Äôd talked to the night before, and then the only thing that the Theocrasy's diplomats would need to do is make things official with a polite nod and a scribble. It was a fairly good system, at least as long as they could remember to warn the interns against waking him up prematurely. Otherwise he‚Äôd oversleep and no one wanted to have to pay him overtime.


Having had enough of everyone‚Äôs insistent bickering and convoluted accusations Atleon finally couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and yelled for every one to ‚ÄúBE QUIET ALREADY!‚Äù  
'Everyone undoubtedly already knew what had happened, we‚Äôre all stressed and tired so then why the hell do these childish sycophants feel the need to further add fuel to the proverbial fire!?' Atleon thought to himself angrily.
‚Äú‚Ä¶ erm that wasn‚Äôt me ‚Ä¶ that was the gods.‚Äù He stammered nervously after almost losing his cool there for a second.

With everyone finally quiet Atleon officially started the emergency council meeting. ‚ÄúHonored members of the council, guests to this humble station and representatives of the people‚Äôs interests. Today fate has once again dealt us a crippling blow...‚Äù Atleon continued to inform the rest of the council about the concerning news regarding the Enoweian‚Äôs oh so high-tech ship that was no doubt already in the hands of the dark goddess.  


‚ÄúThis is a travesty!‚Äù

‚ÄúA tragedy!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe must send a fleet of those new ‚Äòwar-ships‚Äô!‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not ready yet and might not even be all that effective against the Gaians. We shouldn‚Äôt provoke them!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, hide! We should just cut off all contact and pray they won‚Äôt find us!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ridiculous! How long do you think we‚Äôd be able to keep that up!?‚Äù

Once again, fueled by fear and desperation, the council members began to argue and bicker among themselves. Or at least they did until a shrill, high pitched voice stood out above the rest.

‚ÄúMaybe things need not be so difficult.‚Äù The second representative of the Inaliss‚Äô seat of power remarked.
‚ÄúPerhaps these ‚ÄòGaians‚Äô have a very different part to play in the galaxy‚Äôs future affairs other than what might appear most evident. Perhaps you‚Äôve all been looking at things all wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you on about this time, Eddiyun?‚Äù Atleon asked dryly.

‚ÄùOh come, do you all seriously not see the opportunity that‚Äôs right in front of us!?‚Äù  

‚ÄúOver the last few millennia some of our constituents have grown ‚Ä¶ difficult, displeased with the way of the world. And now thanks to these Gaians dissenting voices have made themselves known. All while those still loyal have been invigorated with renewed fervor and zealous admiration towards us and the prestigious gods we serve. These Gaians have reminded the universe why, we‚Äôre here, why we, the gods‚Äô representatives were chosen. Those who were progressively losing their way and faith in our rule have in one swift motion seen the error of their ways and returned to the flock, while those too far gone to be saved are practically on the cusp of becoming a cautionary tale. Don‚Äôt you all see!?  Are you all blind!? They‚Äôre our counterbalance, yet so far behind technologically. We can use that and more importantly, we can use them!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich is why I‚Äôve taken the liberty of intercepting and dealing with any and all ‚Ä¶ troublesome information that might otherwise find its way past the quadrants borders. Admittedly I can‚Äôt entirely stop the rumor mill  but I can at least manipulate how fast it spins. In fact I‚Äôd wager I‚Äôm pretty adept at dampening revolutions if I say so myself.‚Äú He mused ominously while staring at the other representatives with an expression of child-like glee plastered on his bonny visage.

‚ÄúAre you seriously suggesting we use the 'Dark Goddess‚Äô children' to keep our people in line!?‚Äù One of the Qwuizinian senators asked incredulously.

‚ÄúWell why not, we‚Äôve technically been doing it since forever already. Telling our children to behave or the ‚Äòthe horned one‚Äô will find them, telling non-believers to start praying or they‚Äôll get send to the world of the dark goddess. Only difference now is that we‚Äôve got coordinates and some rather ‚Äòinvigorating‚Äô visual stimulants to accompany these life lessons we whish to impart onto our flock.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook just send a couple PKV‚Äôs (peace keeping vessels) to go retrieve whatever still remains of the ‚ÄòSubtlety‚Äô and I‚Äôll do the rest‚Ä¶ um .. eventually, whenever I feel like it that is.‚Äù The arch priest said mid yawn.

‚ÄúNo, we must send an entire fleet and strike back. They can‚Äôt think we‚Äôre weak and cowardly!‚Äù One of the senators yelled.

‚ÄúFirst and foremost we must send a theocratic vessel to guide the souls of the Subtlety‚Äôs crew to the afterlife.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if they left the ship‚Äôs wreck after slaughtering the crew?! Our people have payed a heavy price to have it build and manned as quickly as it was. That ship was proof of our commitment and sense of solidarity, so therefor I‚Äôd argue we should be allowed to go and retrieve whatever‚Äôs left of it.‚Äù   

‚ÄúOh because your first expedition went so well.‚Äù The Arch priest remarked mockingly to which the offended Enoweian huffed with righteous indignation.  

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù one of the two Adtnian monarchs yelled. Whereas yesterday‚Äôs doppelganger had already been promoted to evil clone and escorted out of the room this third ‚ÄúHirunas‚Äù seemed much more convincing in regards to their looks as well as age, although they still appeared to be a few years older than the original.   

‚ÄúPerhaps we don‚Äôt need to resort to violence just yet. Perhaps we can um, we can study them and make videos and erm watch later and learn from them.‚Äù The third Hirunas mumbled and stuttered while rapidly losing confidence as the various council members where regarding the fake king with puzzled, judgmental expressions. Seemingly staring a hole straight through their soul, or at least that must have been what it felt like.

‚ÄúPssst sis, what are you doing!?  Does this have anything to do with those weird forums dad caught you browsing the other day!?‚Äù

‚ÄúShush, mom said it would be my turn to be king today!‚Äù The disguised sister chastised her younger brother. ‚ÄúLook I know what I‚Äôm doing, just wait and stay quiet okay‚Ä¶ or just leave, I know what I‚Äôm doing, I promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrect me if I‚Äôm wrong but it sounds to me that while the Adtnian as well as the Enoweian representative might not agree with the spirit of my suggestion. I do believe that our interests align in such a way where neither party would be inconvenienced by a cooperative venture?‚Äù Eddiyun pondered aloud while absentmindedly fidgeting with one of his many rings.

""Ah shit, this is what I'd feared."" To Atleon‚Äôs horror it seemed that factions were forming within the council.
‚ÄòThat fool, Eddiyun, what's he doing?! Can‚Äôt he see that now more than ever we should be united!?‚Äô Atleon thought to himself. ‚ÄòI suppose, as usual it falls on me to compromise and help mediate the situation in order to maintain the council‚Äôs cohesion.‚Äô

‚ÄúIn that case.‚Äù Alteon began. ‚ÄúSeeing as you‚Äôre all so excited to venture out towards GA-14 yet again. How about this, every race gets to prepare up to 3 vessels, one of which a PKV, and together as one fleet they‚Äôll make their way to the dark goddesses‚Äô domain to secure their respective race‚Äôs interests, whatever those may be. Now if the Gaians do show up or are suspected of being close by it's up to each race to individually decide whether they'd like to flee or take military action. And last but not least, if anything goes wrong, we cut our losses and wash our hands of the situation. We can‚Äôt let ourselves get suckered into wasting vast amounts of resources and manpower just to save rescue parties that were meant to save previous rescue parties.‚Äù  

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs settled then.‚Äù Eddiyun cheerfully exclaimed as everyone appeared to accept Atleon‚Äôs plan. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about you lot but I‚Äôm excited to see where all of this will lead.‚Äù

‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ...

‚ÄúWait, if we‚Äôre so scared of the Gaians finding us then why don‚Äôt we just have our ships explore their system at night, when it‚Äôs dark outside?‚Äù The real/first Hirunas said to which Atleon asked one of his attendants to fetch a copy of the Adtnian rules of succession. You know, just in case.

-----------------------------------------------

‚ÄúHOLD THE DOOR LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT! CAUSE IT JUST MIGHT!‚Äù

Over at the bridge the frightened captain and part of his crew were frantically trying to keep the Gaians at bay. They‚Äôd barricaded the door with every significantly large piece of machinery that wasn‚Äôt nailed down. Even though they knew it was just a matter of time before the Gaians would breach their defenses and do god knows what to them.  

It didn‚Äôt matter what the security feed had shown them. These Gaians sounded much scarier and more feral in person. They roared and screamed loudly and with each push the Enoweians could feel the door as well as the items in front of it shake violently. Their arms were slowly faltering. They wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep this up for much longer.

‚ÄòGods what was I thinking? I'm so gonna die! These things are gonna tear me appa-‚Äô Gallyth‚Äôs train of thought stopped dead in its tracks, his stomach dropped, he couldn't breath and it suddenly felt as if liquid nitrogen was coursing through his veins.  
He heard something move above them, he was sure of it. Something was trying to get in via an alternative route, and it was fast.  

That was it, Gallyth wanted to leave, to go back to his home, back to his mom. Considering their current predicament, a sentiment no doubt shared by the captain and the rest of the crew.
After all word around the ship was Gallyth‚Äôs mom was a fine lady and an even finer interior decorator.  

‚ÄúSON IF YOU DON‚ÄôT START PUSHING AGAIN I‚ÄôM GONNA HAVE TO START PUSHING MY FO-‚Äù and then the captain froze as well. They‚Äôd all heard it now, a loud growl followed by almost equally loud hollow thumping noises that were moving towards them. As if on cue they all looked at the security monitor which showed that only 2 Gaians were still pushing against the door while the third was missing. Not for long though as upon following the continued rumbling sound emanating from above them, their eyes eventually came to a halt when said sounds brought attention to a rather large air vent overlooking the entire room.  
At which point anyone with a keen interest in spaceship air-circulation protocols must have realized that a light shimmer emanating from a predator‚Äôs steely gaze and a mouth full of sharp white teeth were never part of that particular vents initial design. Contractor‚Äôs can be really difficult about that sort of thing after all.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in the walls ... FUCKING RUN!!‚Äù

I've been taking the IT Support Specialist offered on Coursera for a few weeks now and tbh I'm definitely gaining more than I knew coming in since I'm new. But I feel like it's hard to retain the information since it's just mainly videos and notes I take to get me by on the quizzes. As well as frustrating sometimes since they explain everything by the book.

I really want to succeed in this and I know I can do it with help as well as self study so I was thinking of attending a local trade School that offers an Associates in IT but not completely sold as it will take 21 months to complete. This consist of 18 months in class Hands On training and a 3 month internship. The hands on is what appeals to me I feel like I'll retain the knowledge better but obviously cost way more and time consuming. I really just don't want to forget what I've been learning and since I don't use it for anything it is hard to remember everything Coursera has covered so far.

Also having an internship and a degree seems like it might be better for my career getting started and down the road. Possibly can go back for my bachelor's if a future company offers tuition reimbursement and won't need to attend as long. Anyone been in a similar position?"

The details are as follows:

I'm in my final year of studies at an economic university in Vietnam. My major is Business English, and I also minor in Business Administration. I obtained an IELTS score of 7.0 in 2017 and an HSK 3 (this is a Chinese language proficiency test) score of 257 a month ago. My current GPA is 3.32/4. In addition, I have two MOS Word and Excel certificates, both with over 900 points. I can work both independently and in groups, and I have served as a team leader on a few occasions in school tasks. As an introvert, I appreciate hearing what others say and occasionally offering advice. I enjoy planning my work and strive to accomplish it on schedule. I am also detail-oriented.

I'm now considering two options.

The first position is as an intern in the Recruitment division of a global HR firm with headquarters in Switzerland. They don't require prior experience and are willing to train interns from scratch. The internship lasts for six months, and if the candidate is eligible, they will be considered for full-time employment after the internship. The first three months of the internship will pay 64 USD per month, and the final three months will pay 132 USD per month. Interns will work from 9 am to 6 pm. I have no prior experience in the field of HR. However, I have friends who are HR interns and my father used to work in this industry. I live 4.3 kilometers away from the firm.

The second choice will be working as an English translator for a Vietnamese translation agency. They also don't call for previous knowledge. I only know that the candidates will work full time because they don't indicate their exact working hours. Additionally, they revealed nothing about the salary itself, simply saying that it can be negotiated. I've translated fanfics before (more than 400 pages in all), and I've also done subtitle translation for two YouTube videos. I also gained experience translating more than 50,000 words while writing my graduation thesis. The business will need documents translated, including those on specialized topics like Chemistry, Computer science, Information Technology, Marketing, Medical, etc. The company is 2.6 kilometers from my home.

I'm not sure which job would be best for me, so I'd appreciate any input. Thank you."

wrdudi,1,2022-08-18,Should I include Industry Relevant Side Business on my Resume? General IT Career Advice Request,EnvironmentPopular50,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wrdudi/should_i_include_industry_relevant_side_business/,"TLDR: I work in IT doing mostly hardware currently, I also run an IT hardware side business my company doesn't know about and would like to know the best way of presenting this for my career-minded job. I'm close to 30 and it's time to play the corporate BS game. Should I include my side business which is a potential conflict of interest and how should I go about doing so?

So, I work in IT. In my current position, I do mostly hardware repair on computers in a primarily consumer-facing environment as an 'IT Technician.' I've been at the company for about 3 years and this is my first actual experience in IT for a company. In the year leading up to that, I did some freelance dev work with no prior experience. It was inconsistent but I was able to land a few gigs along the way. One notable one that's predominately under NDA, but was for a pretty well-established company in a niche industry that makes a chrome extension for businesses. I kind of sweet-talked my way into it by being the opposite of what you'd expect as your run-of-the-mill developer that can't hold a conversation. I barely knew anything and busted ass to barely be above expectations by googling the hell out of everything and the company ended up being pleased with my 6-month contract as a consultant. All this to say that I hustled my way into this industry with no technical training or school at all. So my resume is far from stacked and I feel like I need to carefully consider the details in order to compete with the more traditional applicants that have Bachelors degrees and internships from sought-after companies. I want to start playing the game at higher-end companies and actually build out a career. 

A little more than a year ago I decided to form my own LLC. Fixing consumer electronics via mail-in service. Mostly focused on laptops with an emphasis on micro soldering, professionalism, and customer service (this industry has a huge hole when it comes to customer service.) I did so as supplemental income and as a bit of a hobby as who doesn't dream of starting their own business? Well, things have been exactly what I would ask for. About $20,000 in profit while doing this alongside my current job, alone and relatively stress-free. I've been able to manage a full-time gig and this business by phrasing things like ""due to our current volume, we should have a completed diagnostic in about 5 business days"" when in reality I'm just tired after my day job and want to go drink some beers with friends. I am not built for the crazy entrepreneur life where money is everything and busting out 70-hour weeks is the norm. But I really like being a business owner where I can put in a few hours a week into something I enjoy and help people in an industry filled with shady practices. It's also a lot of fun at times. 

I'm at a point (late 20's) where I feel like I should start thinking more long-term career-wise. I was always so against being micromanaged and told what to do. But I would really like to land a position at a company like FAANG to play the game and get the high-tier roles. Or at least work for one of the big players in the short term to have a stacked resume and be allowed to be more decisive on where I'd like to work going forward. I think for me, that will likely end up on the security side of IT as I find it interesting and there is always a growing need. 

I suppose this was a really roundabout way of explaining my somewhat unique history and asking for advice on how to proceed. Should I include my experience as a business owner on my resume? Will managers make the connection that it may be a conflict of interest? Do you think they will think my heart won't be in it for the current position if I'm running a business of my own off the clock? If so, are those companies even worth working for? 

Sorry for the long-winded explanation here lmao it really ran on.  But I would appreciate any help I can get because as you can see I've kind of been winging everything for the past 10 years. While it's worked out, I don't know anything about the corporate structure or inner workings. 

TLDR: I work in IT doing mostly hardware currently, I also run an IT hardware side business my company doesn't know about and would like to know the best way of presenting this for my career-minded job. I'm close to 30 and it's time to play the corporate BS game. Should I include my side business which is a potential conflict of interest and how should I go about doing so?

Hello people,

I work as a student in the help desk department of a support company.

My position is ""Operation Specialist intern"".

I recently started working in the SAP program in the Customer Support/Service module.

They offered me a work contract and a permanent job.

I have heard from many that SAP experience is in high demand and you can find a well-paid job with that experience.

So I'm thinking about whether I should stay for at least a year to get some SAP experience and move on to a better company.

Is a year of experience in the SAP CS module enough to find a better paying job?

Is my work in the CS module important/requested and can I easily switch from it to another module in a new company?"

hejhej

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not one to spit all my life on others but today it seams i can muster the strength to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

\[I think i'm part of that neat portion of youth you talked about in this episode. NEET\]

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24. 

&amp;#x200B;

After graduating high school, I was directed toward 'prepa'(MPSI-PSI) to later join the engineering work force.

Shit started raining when i couldn't handle this toxicity and elitism \*even though nothing else was to expect from it apparently\*. I wasn't a bottom student and the teachers tried to get me to stay but I couldn't motivate myself to go to most of the classes and would just pop for the interrogations not to bring too much attention on myself. I ended up leaving when the second year competitive examinations started. I was lost and with nothing better to do, I went to work to support my life at a carrefour city in Strasbourg while crashing on my sister's couch (I already couldn't count on my parents for ideological differences ... they didn't take well me dropping school even though they knew that was paining me more than them .. that and other serious internal 'affaires').

&amp;#x200B;

The first pay check was nice but the terrible reality of being employed didn't really improve my situation. The social and environmental repercussions of my actions were the sources of a lot of anxiety (having to throw food away and keeping an eye on thieves are good examples \*even though i was turning a blind eye on the latter as often as i could and basically ate for free from all of the store's waste\*).

After a few months of work there, I heard about the Working Holiday Visa I could apply to to travel in Australia, took my savings and backpack and flew around the world in search of a life that would taste less bitter.

&amp;#x200B;

Backpackers are common there, I quickly met to other frenchies with whom i spent a year there, fooling around, alternating farm work and travels. Feeling less alone and less depressed, hope was on the horizon. I wanted to study again ! I've always been curious about everything, i couldn't (and still can't) envision a life without learning. My applications in french engineering schools were denied but then i tried applying at Linnaeus University in Sweden for a bachelor in cyber-security and was accepted very easily. I came back in France to work the summer months and left for Sweden (and broke my leg the week before leaving).

&amp;#x200B;

It was really hard for me to find accommodation there, especially cheap ones, and ended being forced to accept a high rent (500e for 1 room in a flat shared with 4 other people). With my broken leg I wasn't able to find work and my savings quickly ran dry and I went through a very harsh introduction to the wonders of the lodgings problematics. I could barely finish the year (plus it was the year COVID started) and then had to come back to France, my backpack filled with frustrations, disappointments and anxiety about the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another summer spent working at a shitty job ; in the beautiful Strasbourg again, but with depressing thoughts again. To this day I still don't have higher than high school diploma. But I wasn't disabled, and a former math teacher that I really admired was always repeating ""Y'a pas de problems ; que des solutions"". So whatever it was that I was facing, I could find a way to solve it ; and to get back at 'the solution for lodging', I spent lots of time in Sweden depressed-thinking and researching about resilient lifestyles and how to build strong foundations for the Mashlow's pyramid : find a way to provide housing, food, water and energy for myself (or anyone in general) without having to buy these basic necessities (something i strongly associated to buying one's life on monthly basis and yet having to exchange it against most of one's time &gt;&gt;&gt; which YEAH does sound stupid, and actually is). 

&amp;#x200B;

I came across the work of an architect in Berlin, trying to provide and integrate Tiny Houses to the city. The concept of tiny houses fitted well what i was envisioning with a cool bonus : it's mobile, so perfect for the no-country guy that i was becoming. I started dreaming about being able to rent a truck to move and plug my resilient, autonomous housing unit to any big cities i wanted to study or settle to develop projects in. So I shyly emailed him and surprisingly got to go help him out for the month of September that followed. He was kind enough to let me stay in his demonstration houses for free so that was sweet times (&lt;3 good people at the Tiny Foundation). I got a taste of the life i wanted and it felt awesome. On the other hand, shitty-job-anxiety had turned into fear of having to call someone 'boss'. I already had a few experiences with the associative world and it felt like everything was possible, WHILE including respect. I had applied to something called ""service civique d'initiative"" in Bordeaux to try working on projects for autonomous affordable housing, and I was accepted. So i chained the 'internship' in Berlin with this hope of concrete solutions in Bordeaux.

&amp;#x200B;

Although it was a disappointment for the latter, it was really nice (&lt;3 good people too at OIM). I don't know how the government expects anyone to live on 400e in a city though ! Thankfully, it was my friends parents that were paying for the flat so they were kind enough to accept my crashing there for free (and providing black work at their venue later on ; good people &lt;3 disgustingly right-winged but i still &lt;3 'em). This experience got me to take a little confidence in myself and in what i wanted to do ; being alone at it rendered impossible for anything concrete to emerge however. Since Berlin the spirits were high, I felt like i could give my brain to a complex and critical problem 'lodging', and .. well .. I wouldn't say my friends family was fortunate (maybe idk) but well off for sure but i had not to worry about anything around them so that was huge weights off my shoulder and saved everything i could. But as this program was ending, I was fed up with having to bother friends for a roof for lil'ol'me and all the emergency alarms started ringing again. I had practiced modeling again for the past months so i quickly devised schematics for a house of my own. With the help of my sister i had 15 grants to do everything and she even got me to talk to my parents again to ask if i could use their backyard as building site (plus they hoard a wide range of tools and material without ever using them soooo bonus). They said i was forcing them by betting my life on this endeavor but accepted. Roaming around the world, my curiosity and experience having me well aware of the intricate atrocities of most basic actions, add to that the terrible braindead feeling of working shitty jobs : it would be do or die ! I couldn't think of any alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

Being with my parents and little sisters again felt nice and finally starting something concrete was thrilling at the beginning. It would be huge work but if it allowed me to live by my words then it would be worth it. On the other hand i was exited because it would give an amazing opportunity to reconnect with my dad (which used to be a do-it-all kinda guy) and so work on our family and solve our own problems (solve solve solve yay everything's possible). Sadly (I'm sure with the context anyone could see this coming) it did not go smoothly..

&amp;#x200B;

I quickly realize that wouldn't get from my parents, more help than their irrational fears, disinterested comments &amp;Co so i was basically alone again. They would avoid me, the 2 meals a day forcibly shared with them was the only time we could spend together. Some moral support when my sisters came check on me. Anyway no turn back now, i don't want to ! so sleeves high i learned as i did. The shortage of material due to the pandemic was tough though .. everything felt crazy expensive so as summer was coming and i had just wrapped the skeleton of the house sooo \*like : a veerrryyy long sigh\* worked through another summer at my friends venue. (it's starting to feel like i can only see depressing lonely winters) 3 months, 6 days fully at the venue and Sundays to speed covering the outside of the house with wood because the sheet protecting the inside from water can't stay in the sun without turning useless \*facepalm\* oh and also winter is coming. At the end of the summer i had almost finished the exterior. I kindly thanked my friends parents for their help, but put an end to my time there as originally agreed .. too depressed by the constant BFM TV above my head and terrible topics of discussion (Zemmour-is-smart-because.. kinda terrible) from my friend's uncle keeping the place.

&amp;#x200B;

From then on, I've been truly 24/7 alone. Sister's at school, parental relations severely degrading ... the only thing to do is build. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh ! where we live is in the country-side. Small village, closest city is 20km away ; I'm used to walking and cycling big distances (and 20k isn't) but that's still not something i want to do just to get to public transportation, everyday, twice a day (call it laziness if you want .. or maybe i wrote that because i unconsciously thinking that of myself..). I don't have a car. I don't possess a lot of things actually : my backpack laptop bike and a big pile of wood.

&amp;#x200B;

Being alone slowed me down like crazy. I couldn't always find the motivation, the many technical, financial, relational difficulties weighing more than what i was actually building. Occasionally i could have friends come and give a hand but i would end up spending this more as social time, enjoying the chat rather than putting us to work.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't expect help from local 'Pole emploie'. From my knowledge there's absolutely nothing i can expect from the government (community). I just keep building, pouring myself in the only thing that can allow me to live without feeling both tortured and guilty. i cut on eating and just go sneak low quantities of rice, pasta and some vegetables when everyone's asleep. I avoid my parents at all cost. It started slowly to cut on the toxicity, i really didn't need more weights on on me, but as more serious topics were uncovered while our sister/brotherhood had our backs turned, stuff they did not accept to work on despite the seriousness .. i just couldn't caution this. So i do things quietly hoping they don't decide to kick me and my small unfinished house. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to finish my budget with enough materials for something life able-ing (Yayy ...) electricity done (although i couldn't have solar panels, for now i need a plug), basic plumbing (i gather and filter rain water for the kitchen sink and a shy shower), the exterior is done (i plan art to fill some spots but it already looks neat), the inside need some paint but the basics are here and it's comfy. I feel a bit proud thinking about all the obstacles it took me to get to that result and if not for the complete helplessness i could have hope.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been penniless since last December, slowly building all this while trying to find help to bounce back : Somewhere i would be accepted as myself and could put my brain on solving the big interesting problems of our big family : Humanity. These past years of running with the head filled with problematics too big for one person, gave my the opportunity to witness our world from many different aspects, tackle issues in various fields, allowed me to reflect on myself, my actions, and time to gather a shit tone of info about everything from this AMAZING tool that's this cute couple (my laptop and the web =)) is ..  all of that got me to build a strong ethic with self-criticism, developed my curiosity and reinforced my intuition that everything IS possible &gt; We're human, we can learn ! ANYTHING ! so we can eventually solve anything ! For me and for all others because literally everyone has the same problem : ""How to i secure my basic needs while not feeling like a jerk so i can do my own shit"". (Well actually there are people that KNOW they'll never ever be able to feel secure about that so it's not  the exact same thing but you get the gist) so .. yeah i feel like i'm not a bad fellow.. I genuinely want to help solve problems for everyone. However, I just can't take society's bullshit anymore. I just can't accept it because i KNOW it doesn't have to be ... And that kinda closes lots of doors.

&amp;#x200B;

After spending last winter slowly starving, i approached the organism 'mission local' thinking they might help me or give me counsel. The dude wouldn't understand me from the few question he asked me. The half hour was mainly spent filling forms but it didn't seem like i'd get something to eat from him until after he casually gave me another rdv the next month and i replied ""so i'm not supposed to eat for at least another month ?"" to which he responded by fetching a 25e meal-check. (i have to laugh not to cry) Following month, he tells me he might get me into a program called PACEA for a total or 3000e. with that i could get the driving license to move my house, rent a truck and possibly joining a city and start doing something worthwhile. The catch is that you don't get to spend it as you want : you can ask for max 497e in a month, have to justify it and they may refuse. Obviously the induced slowliness forces to waste more on basic needs if i want to feel like less of a thief by buying my own food and paying for my electricity (that way i would more feel like a silent neighbor, bit better). And it would not be before another month of waiting so ""tighten your belt man..."" (i ended up not benefiting from more than a third of financial help i entitled to in this program.)

&amp;#x200B;

I managed to get through that, get my license with 2 months of waiting, gathering the enough funds to buy it. (First try Yay .. well it's not like i had a choice .. i HAD to make it, couldn't afford to fail) But now ... a final issue is crushing me, I wasn't able to find somewhere to land. All this time and still nothing. I naively thought the hardest part would be the technical one, that finding a small rectangle of grass and meet the neighbors to ask to buy some electricity in exchange helping around like neighbors should do HAD to be easier that selling myself to rent shitty apartment for terrible prices... ""NAIVE NAIVE NAIVE I SAY PLEOPLE ARE STUPID, SELFISH, RENDERED APATHETIC, CYNICAL from this crazy, inefficient mess of a human organization that we call society !! cities are the place the people gather to work together you say ... well 'together' means the people that bought the land so you can't benefit from it without needing them ... na√Øve i say""

&amp;#x200B;

My last hope vanished a couple of days ago when i realized this last opportunity that hasn't yet turned out a dead end that i was digging was too good to be true. There's small piece of land in the greenest district of Strasbourg, my sister and her husband applied for a shared-house project with two other families and until they start building (\~March 2023 so would've give some time to bounce) i could try and stay there. For now the city still owns the land so i asked locally elected official if it was okay and they said yes. It's at the border of dense spaces just next to field and forests, the tram is 100m away the district is really super cool and surprisingly quite. 

&amp;#x200B;

So i made my way there to prepare the field, cut a few branches blocking the way ... and so i took my biggest smile, high spirits, went to greet the neighbors. Over 3 days of trying, of the 4 enclosing neighbors, 1 mean-commented me away through the door without letting me speak, 3 said the project was nice but told me not to count on them for help to access electricity. (1 listened to me, we talked a while so we were vibin' =) or so i though because she told me they were busy at the moment so she needed time to think, and told me to text her after the 14th of august so the beginning of this week .. only to text me back they won't help me .. which feels like unnecessary hypocrisy on top the disappointment). And i can't still go there and try using the dusty generator i found in the attic. Running that 24/7 at people's widow .. the noise the smell .. it could even die on me i don't know if it works properly; It would be hazardous, i would make myself enemies if i don't simply get kicked by the city quickly in addition to go against the engagements i try to keep. And thoughts about the authorities taking away my house because i can't move it from wherever they decided i couldn't land has been REAALLYY stressful.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired. In fact I'm exhausted. I've got nothing to do. Stuck in the middle of nowhere, quietly going mad out of loneliness and despair in a small (yet cool looking) wooden house that ends up being a coffin on wheels. I don't know where to go. I don't know what to do more or better. It feels like no matter how well-intended I can be, I'm still pushed away .. like a broken tool. labeled unproductive. For as long as i can remember I've had suicidal thoughts or at least na√Øve wishes to disappear. Feeling the deep issues around me even when i couldn't really understand them. I went to Australia with the idea to go as far as i could to disappear quietly in the wilderness .. but ended up with cool people there (Yohan and \*RIP\*Lucas &lt;3) that made me consider trying a little harder. And now I'm looking at where it got me. Life is cool and all ... this universe is a wonderful place .. our potential is amazing .. but people seem interested in nothing else but their own demise as well as bringing everyone along .. and if life means suffering just for the fun of it, i should be able to respectfully decline the offer no ? It would've been impossible to ask me before hand but now that i'm here and that I've been educated on the matter : that's the right moment to bring the topic around no ?! ""It would be causing harm to the people that care about you"" Shouldn't the guilt be on them for selfishly keeping me around only to watch me suffer from afar ? sharing about suicidal thoughts isn't bitching for help, it's sharing about the (expected) result of specific situations. (well actually feels like it's more ""General"" than ""Specific"" but that's bitching to me)... but i don't want to suffer ! the goal is to stop the suffering. yet, my country being hypocritical on this topic by not allowing people to go painlessly on their own term, if i want to go down this path then it'll have to be DIY. (... good thing i developed some skills for diys ...)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it's also something that has to get out sometimes .. as an alarm signal keeping our focus on what needs to be solved .. for the few ears that want to listen ... and so many go unnoticed. But if they go unnoticed, then how can we as a group can at least learn from their experience ??

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

so there was my experience .. heavily summarized .. there's so much i would've liked to talk about though .. so many problems left to solve .. nothing I'm allowed to work on but maybe you will .. with some of my experience in mind ..

&amp;#x200B;

I can't stay like this anyway. In a few days i'll take my backpack and point my bike to some random directions .. maybe there's hope in Christiania Copenhagen but i can imagine the kind of lifestyle i'll be leading for having experienced it already .. i heard about this place from different homeless people in the past .. that's the worst btw : desperate hope ! You can't let go of even the most insignificant probability. but as weak and depressed as i am i'll be doing this in hope that my body fails me and I'd roll under some bush of exhaustion without feeling it coming... that would be nice ! and an accurate image of what current society does to people : it runs them dry. well them a shit tone of other natural resources XD

&amp;#x200B;

plus the house i leave behind will be free for anyone that needs it i'll leave the key inside and the card of its grey card signed so you can move it .. if my sisters don't need it .. they don't listen but they'll face the same issues at some point ! Anyways it's not meant to be sold : the raw material is already paid off and its previous user won't need it anymore so it can help some other one.

&amp;#x200B;

""So yeah you fucking stupid people : learn a thing or two ! there're important problems to solve !! i could've helped you but you killed me so go figure shit out yourself now ! well actually there's a staggering remaining many to help you out so that CAN be super easy .. good luck ! I stay convinced humanity has the potential to fix everything. just act ffs !"" \[hope this won't count as activism XD just wanted to express a little bit of my frustration but i mean no harm\]

&amp;#x200B;

as for me, i hope the insignificant probability will catch me in time .."

I‚Äôve started seeing in many places that prestige in CS actually matters a lot more than people let on.


edit: I don't want to make it seem like I'm only going for the piece of paper. In reality, I actually think Duke as a college is a really good fit for me. The 100k in debt is not with interest because my parents are (GOD IM SO GRATEFUL) financially prepared to take on the debt with interest. I would simply repay them 100k flat and, depending on my success, even more for their sacrifice and gratitude. A lot of people are giving me answers based on just industry. While I understand that employers care about skills&gt;degree in industry, I want to consider my opportunities beyond a desk job at Google. For example Quant, IB, Consulting, algo-trading, business. I am not deadset on coding. I am deadset on being intellectually stimulated through cs, math, and business. As such, I'm sure the money will follow that curiosity. For a school like Duke, I'm asking if 100k flat is worth the CS+Math degree, the college, the opportunities, and as an investment overall. I'm facing a big dilemma because my goals are to choose a school that provides me with that flexibility while being worth the money. My other options are UofSC Honors and Clemson (I'm instate and have high confidence I'll practically pay nothing). Considering these factors, my final question is: is it worth?

edit 2: I'm also pretty committed down this path. At the end of the day, being able to do the actual task is how you get the job. People do leet code whether they are at MIT or Community College. I will do leet code wherever I end up to get my internships or jobs. I don't expect to get carried. I simply want to see where I can get the most bang for my buck/ a greater potential. 100k is a static number to me and I need to know if it's worth overcoming for one choice that I make.

edit 3: I'm applying to a mix of top 40 cs schools. Either OOS public (expect no aid cause I'm not ivy auto-admit) or private unis (the same cost across the board). Relatively speaking, Duke's price is identical for nearly all of the colleges I apply to other than my safeties (net price calculator). Duke ED is the highest chance I'll get to a high-ranked university while the rest is a crap shoot, but it works out cause it's also one of the best fits for me."

If I were to ever get an interview, I would just not be qualified - that's pretty much what happened for the company I got invited to interview at, which I got rejected from the same day. Messaging recruiters hasn't done anything either. I had an unpaid ""internship"" at my school that I was doing over the summer (not really though, since we didn't have any work for it, even after I tried contacting my managers, who all ignored me). If I do the same internship in the fall, then I could get paid (not much though). Should I just do that for the fall and give up on finding something for the summer?

wrnzc6,10,2022-08-18,I am starting to think my former place of employment may have given me PTSD.,Tasty-Application807,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/wrnzc6/i_am_starting_to_think_my_former_place_of/,"I‚Äôll just start by saying that I‚Äôm extremely happy with what I do now. The work is fulfilling, the pay is decent, and the people are mostly great to work with.

Like the subject line says, it‚Äôs been a little over a decade and I‚Äôm starting to think my last place of employment has given me literal PTSD, no joke. I‚Äôm going to try to limit myself but there‚Äôs no way this won‚Äôt be a tldr:former workplace so toxic that I still have nightmares a decade after leaving, still feel my heart race and my blood pressure rise when I see something that reminds me of that place.
To be fair, there were some pros. Some of this list are positive attributes for all the wrong reasons and in all the wrong ways, but they‚Äôre positives nonetheless.

I learned so much here, probably more than anywhere else in my career. Both concrete and soft skills. I learned that my limitations were not what I previously thought they were. A few years of excellent experience for which I am grateful.

I got to work with a cadre of the most talented, brilliant, and creative people I've ever met or worked with. Great brains to pick. They taught me a lot about my camera, among other things.

It's a paycheck, and it won't bounce (although I sometimes felt nervous early on). I was working here during the subprime mortgage crisis and recession. Reasonable degree of Job Security during the subprime mortgage crisis due to underbidding myself and having inappropriate responsibilities abusively heaped upon me.

The one and only deadline I ever failed to hit (in my entire 20 year career so far, knock on wood...) was taken surprisingly well (considering how willing and ready my superiors always were to crucify me by fire with no mercy over the slightest mistake or no mistake at all, just using me as a scapegoat).

Wearing many different hats, even though it was employee abuse, kept it fresh. I get bored easily.

There was about a mile of walking built into every work day with transferring between the trains I had to ride. I sure could use that today.

But there were many, many more reasons to leave, which i probably should have done sooner. An atmosphere of constant crisis and disapproval was established and maintained. Any questions about how this helps productivity were met with accusations of not being on board with the team and generally seen as a threat to the inner circle‚Äôs illusion of omniscience and omnipotence. answering these questions would require sharing information, the concealment of which gives the inner circle considerable advantages over the rest of the employees.

I started with good self image and no serious health problems. I left with high blood pressure, alcoholism (4 years sober now), a sharp increase in nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety (for which I am now receiving treatment). Part of me quitting was that I felt pretty confident that if I continued I‚Äôd have a heart attack by the time I was 40. My perception of the world and myself was objectively changed for the worse. Since my time here I no longer feel the employee/employer relationship is viable and employers cannot be trusted with the livelihood my family and I need. I have since found other ways to procure resources, and will no longer work for just one employer at a time unless I have no other choice (which I have learned there usually are alternatives, they can just be hard to see). 

There was always a steady stream of lies from the inner circle; I'll limit myself to just one strong example. After telling every employee they'd be reviewed soon (at a point when we were about 6 months overdue), he told us ""We're gonna talk first thing next week, you're gonna be happy, we want you to be happy"" when he knew he was about to take a weeklong vacation in Mexico but hadn‚Äôt told any of us. This occurred on a Friday evening (after I had worked until 5am Thursday in fact), and on the train home I coincidentally bumped into a producer and the office manager, who told me he's out of the office next week; the actual reviews/raises were not to take place until about a month after this. He lied straight faced, right to our faces, right through his teeth. When our reviews finally transpired 5 weeks later, nobody that I was aware of got their now 7 months overdue raises retroactively. They were not shy about lying about anything and everything. Sometimes Inconsequential lies from which they had nothing to gain, which led me to think that it was perhaps pathological.

Over time an overall pattern of Lacking priorities and vision for their company emerged. We were regularly asked to review the pertinent training materials but there was never actual time allotted to do it. When I had down time and started training, inevitably someone would swing by and tell me to do their job for them or clean up some idiot mess they made, because I was ""just training."" They never funded an employee taking a class, that I am aware of. Another great example, there were a couple of ""clients,"" they would show up somewhere in the ballpark of 1-3 times per year, essentially with their palms up. They'd throw some flowery language at the owner and ask for some free work. This sent the inner circle into hysterics about how important it was to impress these chowderheads due to their promises of future work. This happened periodically the entire time I was with them. At the time that I left this place, we had produced exactly one free wedding video and one free printed sign for one of these guys. A wedding video.

Hours: 3 yr avg roughly 50/wk‚îÄnot too bad. HOWEVER, the day-to-day schedule was totally unpredictable. A manager popping by my desk at 5:15pm on Friday to inform me that I‚Äôd be working late that night and all weekend was not uncommon. It was in fact a 40 (12/14/14) hour weekend that tore it for me. We busted our ass on this project that actually never ended up seeing the light of day, wouldn‚Äôt you know it. We had the help of a freelancer that was charging emergency rate $150 an hour to write html/CSS code. And while I was thankful to have the help, I was sitting there with my coworker, both of us doing the same work as he was for what would have worked out to less than minimum wage for that weekend. We were offered no extra reward of any kind, and when I asked for one the general manager laughed in my face. When I came in on Monday, the owner said to do these couple things and I could just bolt for the day, and when one of the other producers learned I was about to leave she started trying to get me to do her chores for her. I almost had to fight with her to make good on the bosses promise. It was right after that that I put in my notice.

I bid myself lower than I should have and had to live with shitty pay while working there‚îÄno one else's fault but my own, I completely get that. I bid in good faith thinking it would be an opportunity for improvement and upward mobility. After almost 3 years of working there, yes I got a few raises but still never got anywhere near median industry standard nor a living wage for Chicago. In the future I will decide what I want to ask for with the assumption that it won't change very much regardless of seniority, effort, or performance. Or pretty much any other (probably secret) measure of merit. I will never again accept any salaried position without clearly defined parameters outlining my emergency rate of pay (probably 2x normal salary measured hourly is reasonable), what timeframe of notice triggers this rate (48 hours or less is reasonable), and any restrictions I may need on working OT on certain days or times of the year. And I will not accept any verbal agreement on these parameters. I will Insist on getting it in writing and keep a copy. If you're freelancing, you should already be doing this but here's your reminder. If they refuse, don't walk away. Run. There's a reason they're refusing.

My pay was low if measured hourly. I was pulling in somewhere in the ballpark of $15-$20/hr depending on the week, which is pretty terrible for Chicago.

They never had a real payroll in the 3 years I worked there. The checks were cut by hand by the owner. Payday was once a month and the date drifted from one month to the next, the 4th, the 2nd, the 6th, the only thing you could rely on is that they wouldn't be early. They never offered direct deposit while I was working there. My check never bounced either, to be fair, although I sometimes felt nervous early on.

I got baited and switched for what I was told would be my duties at the interview vs. what my responsibilities actually were (as did most or all of my colleagues). Job descriptions are left intentionally ambiguous without clearly defined responsibilities, thus leaving the door open for the higher ups to commit labor abuses. There is a sizable list of duties I was asked to take on that did not fit my job description, some above and some below my pay grade. I never claimed to have any amount of competency in these areas or asked for these to be my job. For example IT and programming. They wanted to hire someone with a degree in computer information systems/programming but didn't want to pay for it. Artists are probably easier to exploit. They wanted full fledged application development, but wanted it done with JavaScript, actionscript, and director lingo, and weren‚Äôt willing to spend the time and money to train us nor equip us with a real app dev environment (which I wouldn‚Äôt have known what to do with anyway). I‚Äôm a digital artist who happens to know his way around a few lines of code and under the hood of the machine, not a computer scientist who happens to know a bit of design and animation. There was also a lot of menial labor I was tasked with that was not appropriate to my job description. Should've been handled by an intern.

After a few years of working there, a stipulation forbidding us from freelancing was added to our contract. There were several employees who were already freelancing when this was introduced... I'm pretty sure they just continued to do it. We were told we'd receive permission in writing which never materialized.

I saw several employees fired frivolously. I overheard some comments about those employees after they left that truly disgusted me, and believe me when I say I don't go out of my way to hear gossip in the office. A lot of employees also essentially fled/fired the bosses, bringing the turnover rate into the ballpark of fast food. I knew if I didn‚Äôt make it a point to quit that I also would be fired for no real reason.

Within a few months of starting here, I was regularly sending out resumes to area production houses, other workplaces in unrelated fields, and places outside the state. We were in a pretty major recession for these years due to the subprime mortgage crisis. Eventually I just said screw it and quit anyway. After freelancing for a while I found more permanent work as the economy was swinging back into gear. Waiting around here was an obvious invitation to be fired frivolously in one of their emotional outbursts, thus robbing me of three years of work experience on my resume‚Äîand these guys cannot be trusted to say something positive when a potential future employer asks about me. Get references in writing. That‚Äôs what I did. If future employers call them asking about me and they don't have anything positive to say, I have two written letters from their own managers that say otherwise. I recommend you do the same.

After a year or two working there, the inner circle stopped introducing us to new hires. It felt like, the superiors‚Äô attitudes had shifted to, ‚Äúthe employees are completely disposable.‚Äù I have inside information that after our meetings, they would go back to their offices snickering and deriding us, with comments such as ‚Äúwe told those idiots we‚Äôre all family! They‚Äôll stick around for another few months at least!‚Äù and, ‚ÄúWe just tell them what they want to hear to placate them!‚Äù I was told I‚Äôd be taken out to lunch for my 1 year. Never happened. I deliberately didn‚Äôt bring up my 2 year just to see if anyone noticed. They didn‚Äôt. After a series of hired sales people that proved themselves to be miserable failures, they routinely yanked the rug out from under the one and only sales guy that ever worked out well during my time there-letting him do all the footwork and heavy lifting for the sales he was grooming and then swoop in at the last second to close it, thus denying him the commission he had rightfully earned. Really brilliant considering how much money this guy was bringing in. You'd think they would want to keep him. The company owed him 5 figures when he left. I don't know if he was ever paid for these stolen commissions.

PTO, even if requested months in advance, never failed to generate some kind of unnecessary drama. Sometimes, unintentionally picking the wrong moment to walk over to 7-11 for coffee and snacks generated some unnecessary drama.

The super-white-male-right-wing-osity of the leadership can feel unsafe to, well, pretty much anyone who isn‚Äôt a cis white male, like women and those of alternative lifestyles such as LBGTQ+. There were only three employees in my 3 years there who were not white. One of which didn‚Äôt last very long (it could be that his work just plain sucked, I don‚Äôt really know). Every once in a while I caught some... comments... I‚Äôm not going out of my way to hear office gossip, I assure you. Let‚Äôs just say that, ‚Äú gosh, that African-American family over there sure does look well dressed and successful,‚Äù was not a phrase that you would expect to hear out of their mouths. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà emailed all employees while I was working there telling us how he wanted us to vote. He also had choice comments for that year's winning democrats that he shared via email. 

‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà is such a ridiculous annoying jock. Our team meetings often felt like locker room pep-talks. That‚Äôs ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà way of trying to inspire and motivate the crew, but most of us found it annoying or uncomfortable. A few actually found it disturbing. Did you ever get the fuck you pay me speech? That was a real gem of a meeting. Did it feel threatening? If you tried to talk about it, were you made out to be the problem? Did you come away from the conversation feeling as though you'd done something wrong? He had fuck you pay me slides in his PowerPoint. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà is weirdly and inappropriately competitive. He will horn in on the photographer's best shots so he can shoot the good stuff and leave the B roll to the little people. He is possessive of the projects most important to him. He will push employees over to a less important project or something menial if he doesn‚Äôt like them or feels threatened by their talent without a second thought. One day we could all hear him melting down about some sort of lawsuit. The entire office could hear him shouting phrases such as ""F**(K THEM! THEY'RE GONNA SUE ME?!""

Inner circle are all vocally anti-union. The crew could hypothetically organize but everybody would have to be onboard all at once, and unfortunately it would have to be handled delicately and covertly at least for a while, and every barrier possible should be expected as soon as ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà learns of the intent. Out of curiosity, I spent a few weekend afternoons lunching with a regional media industry union rep, ultimately deciding it would be too painful and brutal and I‚Äôd probably get [yes, illegally, I know] fired for engaging in a fight that I didn‚Äôt really know I even wanted on my plate. But if this crew organized.... Well they‚Äôd probably just sell the whole shebang to the highest bidder. Or just burn it to the ground. Who knows. Maybe the crew already has unionized, but I‚Äôd be totally shocked. You may not think highly of unions either and I am not trying to downplay their flaws. But, you can wait around with your fingers crossed, relying on your hopefully benevolent employer to reward your hard work and provide your livelihood, or, you can band together and negotiate your contract as a unified group through a lawyer trained in doing just that. Which do you think is the better plan?

Their willingness to expose their own company to legal liability shocked me at times. Some of their practices were a little south of legal. I'm fairly sure that suggesting to your employees how they should vote is not legal, and ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà did it in writing. I know they were using some stock assets and more software licenses then they paid for during my time there. If you know the industry, you know that it's normal for a production house or animation studio in a time crunch to grab a piece of ""trial"" ware needed to complete the immediate project and then quickly pay for it after the fact. This is not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about These guys not wanting to pay for the assets and software they're using day in and day out for months and years. No, I didn't report them for any of this if you're wondering. Our stock music source changed when the previous one wouldn't let the ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà account download anything else. Please note that I always got what I was owed, albeit not always in a timely manner. And of course Landlords tend to be real punctual people, when it comes to collecting!

And seriously, this post is abbreviated, I‚Äôm not kidding. One last thing, I haven‚Äôt even gone into how bush league they were, but one big thing sticks out. The inner circle are absolutely not above hiring sock puppets (or just doing it themselves) to covertly plant comments in their favor in the various online social media platforms. I watched them do it on more than one occasion. I was checking this place out on glassdoor thinking some of the positive job reviews there were a tad sus, but there's one in there that I'm certain was posted by ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà. There'll been no activity there for years, but a one star review will appear, and then a couple months later a new 5 star review will conveniently appear directly refuting what They had to say and gushing about what a wonderful place ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà is to work at. If that fails, they'll fall back to directed personal attacks. Here is the most suspicious review i saw:

Pros

My experience was incredibly positive. I learned more in a few months than i did in all of my time at school. I was surrounded by pros and learned something new almost every day.
 
 On several occasions, my extra effort was rewarded with a bonus. It made me feel like I was appreciated. Leadership was mostly positive and always fair.
 
 I‚Äôve read a couple of negative reviews and I‚Äôm bewildered. In my opinion, ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà offers creatives like me with incredible opportunities. 
 
 The more I excelled, the more responsibilities I was given. If you had a negative experience, it might be your fault. 
 
 My two cents.

Cons
- Like any creative agency, sometimes the hours were long.
 - Sometimes, you may have to work weekends.

I had a rly good time and the main guy I worked under who I rly enjoyed getting to know and got close with told me to let him know if I‚Äôd like him to write a recommendation letter (I never brought up anything related to college and wasn‚Äôt expecting this but he just asked it) and so I‚Äôm just curious if it‚Äôs a good idea to have someone outside of school I worked with to write me one of them.

My degree program came with an internship at a local literary magazine. 

I would prefer a job editing for a book publishing imprint. 

I have been applying to jobs and internships, specifically in the book publishing industry, and either I am: not a student (so don't qualify for internship), overqualified (for internship), under qualified (don't have publishing experience, why don't I try an internship?). A few times I have made it to the final round of interviews, but have ultimately not been chosen. The only jobs that really consider me are those scammy content writing marketing jobs where you're a contactor, not an employee, and your pay is... subjective... to say the least. Any help?

So then I send them all the issues I‚Äôve found and what I‚Äôve tried. And then I continue messaging them updating them as I progress. And then I message them saying ‚ÄúI fixed it now, it was because [x]‚Äù. And then they respond ‚Äúcool‚Äù. 

And all I‚Äôm thinking is: ‚Äúdid I just waste their time?‚Äù ‚ÄúThere was no need for so many messages‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis is embarrassing‚Äù.

It‚Äôs the first time it‚Äôs happened but I was just really tired, hungry and stuck and my mind went to straight to asking them for help when it only took me 15 minutes to fix.

Btw, I‚Äôm an intern close to finishing this 1-year internship. I should know better."
wrubde,9,2022-08-18,Is 70k for entry salary too low?,osufootball14,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/wrubde/is_70k_for_entry_salary_too_low/,"Hi EEs! So here is my predicament. I am going to graduate with my BSEE in the spring. I have 3 years of internship experience 2 of those years being with an aerospace and defense company which I really like. While I‚Äôm at school, I work part time doing undergraduate research and have been published in a few major projects with DOE and DARPA. While at my internship, I have been told many times over what a fantastic job I am doing and how much they‚Äôd love for me to work with them full time post graduation. With this being said, I was extended a full time offer however it was less than I hoped at $70k. This was a major hit in the gut for me as all the other engineers are started at that salary. And despite my dedication to come back and work for them every break I had away from school, it feels like my hard work wasn‚Äôt valued whatsoever. There was even a EE intern who was there for 3 months yet got an offer set at $75. I tried negotiating but they told me they are firm on the number. They gave me a week and a half for my decision‚Ä¶not even enough time for me to try to apply elsewhere. What do you guys think? Is this fair? Or am I being taken advantage of?"

I have done diploma in financial accounting where I learnt ms office and tally erp, applied in various internship but got no response called my nearby ca firms but everyone rejected cause I'm not pursuing ca and some rejected cause I don't have experience.

My main objective is to stay in finance / accounting field but don't know what should I do next? Planning to do M.COM from ignou itself cause can't think of anything else which would be affordable but other suggestions are also welcome.

Can't pursue MBA(even from distance learning), CPA, CMA, CA due to financial issue and also I'm not good with academics 70% IN 12th and 50% in college (aggregate of 1st and 2nd year).

(I also gave thought to do B.ED to teach accounting but currently can't afford it and family won't allow taking loan and stuff)"
wrvr1d,1,2022-08-18,So the general consensus is that the entry-level dev market is saturated. So why do salaries keep going up?,Flaky_Bee_2599,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wrvr1d/so_the_general_consensus_is_that_the_entrylevel/,"Basically the title. 

Everything I hear about entry level developers is that it's a lot harder and the field is saturated. However, salaries seem to be going up. If you look at the salary threads here, the new grad salaries have trended considerably upwards in recent years.

If you want to discount that as sub bias, cs new grad salaries are also going up. If you look at [this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/these-bachelors-degrees-from-public-colleges-pay-more-than-100000.html), you'll notice that computer science is high and growing at a faster rate than other majors.

You'd imagine if the entry level market was saturated, you'd see wages come down, or at the very least stagnate. 

In addition, the concept of bootcamp grads seem to be counterintuitive to entry level jobs stagnating. Obviously a lot of bootcamps sell false promises, but there's a good amount of them that do result in a job. However, imo due to lack of quality control in bootcamps, bootcamp grads are considered a lot riskier a hire than a CS grad. So if the field was saturated, these people wouldn't be getting jobs. 

At the same time, I hear a lot of anecdotal evidence of people back in the 2000s being able to get jobs out of college with no internships and limited technical interviews. I also see comments from experienced devs saying things something like ""All these applicants are identical. They all have a degree, an internship, and some personal projects"". That kind of resume out of college used to essentially guarantee a job. So on some level it must have gotten worse. 

You could explain away some of that by saying this sub is just an echo chamber, but this sub freely admits that the job market is good for seniors. You'd think if it were okay for juniors that would be the prevailing narrative. 

So what does this sub think the deal is?"

I've recently pivoted to add a CS major after spending the first few years of my college career earning a philosophy degree. It will take me two years of coursework to earn the CS degree, which means I'll have only one summer - next summer - to do an internship while I'm still a student. Right now, when many internship applications are coming due, I have only finished one programming course. By next summer, I'll be half-way through my CS education, and so in a better position to perform at an internship. However, since it seems that, largely, applications for summer internships are due early this fall, I'll have to try to win internships with the very limited experience I have under my belt.

So, my question is, for someone in my position, what, if any, internships ought I to pursue?"

Next year, I will get an engineer diploma in statistics and mathematics. I'm supposed to work in data science but I'm worried not to like it.

 I really enjoy programming, extracting data, etc, but when I need to analyse it, I get bored. I feel like I'm doing basic stuff, and actually I dont really enjoy that much ploting things, find correlations, etc. 

Moreover, I really dislike the fact of having a not clearly defined goal, as I expect it will be the case in data science. I would way more enjoy having very explicit missions where I can see myself progress, like add a feature to a program. 

I'm still a student and I've never worked in data science, so the problem is that I dont really know if I will regret going into that field. After some researches, it seems like data engineers are doing more technical / computer science related things than data analyst / scientific. Could it be more suited to me ?

As I said above, the fact of really enjoying coding makes me think I would do better in a SWE job. However, because I've also never worked as one, I think I'm highly biased, both against data science in favor of SWE, which makes it really hard for me to make a decision, which is why I would be interested in your opinions. An important thing that I was thinking was that if I try to find a job as SWE, wont I waste all my skills in statistics ? Wont it be hard to find a job ?

Another important thing to say is that until getting my diploma, I have to do a semester abroad, in which I will be able to choose some courses as I wish, which I guess could help me transition to SWE. I also have to do an internship.

What are your thoughts about my situation ? Do you think I should give a try to data science ? Data engineering ? SWE ?"

Hoping that since you guys have more experience and insight you may be able to help me. I was offered 2 tax internships for summer 2023 from both kpmg and pwc. I can list the details of each.

KPMG: 

75,000 annual salaried (obviously only working 3 months won't get that much, and also want to convert it to hourly)  
NYC Area  
Had an internship with them this year and was offered to come back again as an intern  
Have a semi established network

PWC:

34.50 hourly  
NYC Area  
Interviewed with them prior and also had an offer for this year but turned it down in favor of higher pay with kpmg  
No network whatsoever

I'm not really sure what to choose in this case. Previously I was only in it for the money and that's why I had chosen kpmg, but since I'm choosing tax and this is an internship that will ultimately lead to a full time position I feel it will hold more weight and want to consider my options. Honestly I keep going back and forth on which to choose and I'm not sure as to what I should do, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

The dietetics route seems like the safer option and although I'm decently interested in it because of the dealing with individuals and psychology side, I'm worried about how happy I'll be in that kind of medical job. Also I'd be worried about getting medical-related internships because I do kind of struggle with mental health. A stressful job in a hospital might just make me overwhelmed.

BUT I've leaned toward arts and creative classes my whole high school career. So art/digital media sounds really appealing. However I don't really draw on my own time unless there's a deadline, so I tend to practice only when absolutely necessary (But I can meet deadlines!! I mean it!!). And the flip side of arts is I don't know how reliable it is to get a job with a degree or even an internship within sophomore and junior or senior years. Can art careers be stressful?

The real problem is there isn't any ""in-between"" for digital media and nutrition/dietetics.  And if I somehow change my mind while in classes for nutrition it'd be exhausting and maybe a huge mistake to switch to an arts major. Do artists get a lot of work experience in college? Is it profitable to have a digital media degree, easy to find decent paying work or fulfilling jobs? Would you recommend sticking to your ""passion"" or going for something you have a little less interest in but would be more financially safe? I have time to decide, but a year (till next fall) goes by fast. I *could* minor in one, but that seems useless as these fields are pretty much completely separate.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I've always been into creative stuff like film/animation. Can't decide between digital media (arts) or nutrition-dietetics majors. These are my two main interests, have to pick major by next fall. Should I go with what I've been doing my whole life (arts) or branch out to a smaller interest of mine (dietetics) that would be more profitable long-term?"

Apologies if this is the incorrect place to ask this or if it's been asked a lot before, I don't really use reddit all that much. 

I have been learning programming for a couple years now, both in my personal life and as part of my university degree, and even taken a few internships in which I did it as a job. However, I feel like I'm not quite out of the beginner/ early Intermediate stage. It feels like a lot of the code I've seen by others, whether at uni or work or via open source stuff is far more professional than my own.  Whilst I understand that there's an experience difference and such I still feel like I'm missing something.

I know my programming skills are fine, I can solve problems given to me as well as make projects etc. But it's the methodologies, design practices and such that I feel I'm lacking. I can solve the problem just not in a way that feels professional or well-done. When I've attempted to google this, there's a lot of stuff about making code scalable and reliable and all of that, but how do I actually do that? What are the skills I need to learn to design systems in a way that is more akin to a professional solution rather than an intern jerry-rigging something together? How do I progress from someone who's learnt how to program to someone who can engineer software solutions?

Thank you advance."
ws3bbh,1,2022-08-18,I'm struggling with what to do about a pregnancy,hyperion124,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ws3bbh/im_struggling_with_what_to_do_about_a_pregnancy/,"I feel like there is a lot to this, or at least a lot personally for me to unpack, so buckle up. 

I (21m) had been dating a girl (22f) from high school on and off for four years. It was rocky for sure, and we both did things we shouldn't have. In the fall of 2021, we spent virtually lived together, and after a few months I realized that I wasn't who I wanted to be while I was in the relationship, and that I wanted out. In January, I broke up with her, and she moved away.

In the last week of February, my family came to visit me, and she came along under the pretense that she had bought the plane tickets in the fall and she wanted to visit friends in the area. She claimed she didn't have a place to stay, and I felt bad so I let her stay with me. She ended up giving me a lengthy apology for things she felt she had done wrong in the relationship, and I felt largely validated because they were things that I always felt were wrong but never had the courage to speak up. The next day, we had sex, but we were both clear that there were no strings attached and it was not going to lead to a rekindled relationship (this is the part I'm most ashamed of; I'm not the type to have casual sex and the consequences of that night prove that I made the wrong decision).

Some context: she has some serious health problems where she told me that she was not able to get pregnant, and while she was undergoing treatments (medications?) to possibly change that, it was unlikely she would ever be able to have kids. We had sex somewhat frequently during our relationship, and rarely used protection because of this fact. In 2019, we had a fight that led to a separation, and she told me she was pregnant. For a week, I agonized over what that meant for me, for her, and for the child. At the end of the week, however, she told me she wasn't pregnant and that she just wanted to see how I would react.

So after visiting in February, she goes back home, I stay where I was, we don't talk and I believe all is well. In the beginning of April, my brother comes to visit, and she invites herself to come. I didn't really want her to, but she insisted. I arranged for her to stay in the hotel with my brother rather than me, since she was close to my brother and I didn't care to have her stay with me. However, on the first night, she feels sick (I later learned she faked it) so that she can come back with me for the night. I make separate beds, and start to go to sleep when she comes over, says she needs to talk to me, and places a positive pregnancy test on my lap. The rest of that night is a blur, I don't remember saying much or her saying much. I was in full panic mode, but we went about the weekend as normal so as not to disturb my brother. After she left, over the coming weeks I thought about it somewhat frequently, but the event in 2019 came to mind, and a combination of not wanting to believe it could be true and wondering if she made it up again led to me largely putting it out of mind. Aside from a picture of a picture of an ultrasound, we didn't talk.

We get to the middle of June, and we have a phone call to talk about it, and at that point it all became real. She talked about what to do and how the whole situation could be handled, and I realized that she was really pregnant. I stayed calm and said that we would figure it out, but once I hung up the phone, I got in the shower and more or less had a nervous breakdown. I struggled to breathe, and lots of thoughts ran through my head. When I got out, I wrote four pages worth of what I was thinking and feeling at the time, and sent it to my parents, who I hadn't told up to this point. In truth, I was considering suicide, and that requires an entirely different post, but basically this situation was just the straw that broke the camel's back and I couldn't contain it anymore. I had never discussed any mental health issues I had with my parents, so when I told them about the situation and how I was feeling, they immediately drove down to be with me. They talked me through it over the weekend, and while I don't have suicidal feelings right now, it's hard to have a positive outlook on my life.

Since that phone call, my ex and I have not talked aside from her telling me that her parents want to speak to me (which I think is totally fair) and her telling me that the due date is October 16 (which doesn't make sense to me but I assume it has something to do with her health condition). I haven't told anyone but my immediate family, and the thought of telling extended family or friends makes me so embarrassed that I can't even think about it, even though I know they will find out eventually. 

Perhaps this is just me being privileged or ungrateful, but I was so close to achieving a life I had always wanted: I was on an internship for the company I always wanted to work for, I was making true friends for the first time since high school, and I could see a successful end to college in sight. Even since all of this has happened, I have received a couple of job offers that would put me within arm's reach of my dream job, but I'm afraid I won't be able to take them because they would put me hours away from my ex and the baby, and even though I never planned on having a baby this early (and honestly, still don't want one) and I don't plan on getting back with my ex, I feel like I might need to stay close. I'm afraid I've stuck myself into a life I don't want and can't get out of, and knowing that I was so close to having my dream makes it suck. And that's without the shame of having a kid on accident so young. 

What should I do? Is there anything to do other than just to wait? Am I being a total asshole?"

1. I recently graduated from a FL community college with an AA in accounting and I decided that I don't want to pursue a career as a CPA anymore and I want to go into a career in cybersecurity. The closest major to IT I could find at UF was information systems. However, one of my friends who is a product manager at Google said that a degree in computer science was the best way to go. The only problem with that is I would have to take a couple more semesters of extra classes that weren't included in my AA degree but with information systems major, I have all the required classes since they are both business degrees.
2. Is there anyone here who graduated with an information systems degree? If so, could you share what it was like finding an internship and where you are now in your career. I was browsing reddit trying to find out about this information systems major and one of the posts in the subreddit r/cscareerquestions basically was saying it's a trash major and that employers consider it ""bottom of the barrel"".
3. My friend told me that if it's possible, I could just get a master's in computer science, and he could teach me what he knows while I get my bachelor's in information systems. Although I'm not sure if I would need a bachelors in CS to pursue a masters. Please let me know if this is possible!"

Personally, I'm a rising sophomore and basically self taught (only completed intro to CS classes, never learned about data structures before except for Queues and Hash Maps in some personal projects), so I don't really have any expectations about this interview other than a practice interview to dip my toe in the water. Looking at some of the posts on this subreddit, the questions asked during the technical portion of the interview are leagues above what I know and am comfortable with implementing so I'm not really stressing about it.

That being said, other people actually know what they're doing and since I plan on recording the interview to review it afterwards, I'll update this post with an in-depth review of what I was asked during all three stages.

**Post-Interview Reflection:**

Overall, the interview was pretty easy in my opinion. I started off with the case interview where I had to talk about my design and testing principles with the my first interviewer and then I had to debug some practical code (similar to what they actually use in-house).

My second interview was the technical interview, where I had to implement a data structure for two given lists of data. Objectively it was very easy and, with some help from my second interviewer, I understood what I needed to do despite not having any real experience with data structures (I used a HashMap and a List) but I was really clumsy in my implementation due to said lack of experience so I wasn't able to finish implementing the entire assignment but I discussed with my interviewer what I was thinking and what I planned to do as well as documented what I wrote before the end of the second interview. For anybody who actually knows what they're doing with data structures, this will be a piece of cake.

After an hour break, the last interview was behavioral and was also pretty easy. My interviewer was very charismatic, so it felt easy to talk with her and not so much like having to remember planned responses. I was asked a three separate questions that required a STAR answer (‚Äútell me about a time when...‚Äù) and then she asked me to elaborate on some details when she needed them.

Overall, the interview itself wasn't bad and while I don't think I'll be getting an offer due to poor performance in the technical interview, I can say that the Capital One interview isn't as bad as a lot of posts on this subreddit make it out to be. All I can say is actually talk with your interviewer and let them know what you're thinking as they'll point you in the right direction if you get stuck on a specific part."

In the beginning, the other 4 interns and I were in training, just watching tutorials and doing small projects to show that we understood the concepts and I was doing well. About a week and a half ago, one of my coordinators told me that he saw I'm really enthusiastic about front end development and that he wants me to get some hands on experience on an actual project the company is working on. They use Vue.js as their framework (also this is my first time working with a framework).So then I had about 3 days to try and understand Vue, and I felt like I was doing well, but then the first task came. He gave me a simple component to do and incorporate into the project, and told me to take as much time as I need and that there's no pressure. 
Although I know that, I still feel very dissapointed in myself. I spent like a week on such a simple task, getting lost in the project or stupid errors, and even though I try solving them on my own, I usually end up having to ask him for help because otherwise I lose too much time.
I just feel like I have a terrible  working pace , I end up taking such a long time for very simple task and sometimes I feel like the information just doesn't stick in my head.

wsk2k2,0,2022-08-19,Should I sue my fraternity big for destroying my TV?,69420cockring,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wsk2k2/should_i_sue_my_fraternity_big_for_destroying_my/,"throwaway account bc this is a recent event and I want to avoid the off-chance someone involved comes across it and makes my migraine worse.

Gonna try to make this brief and succinct, but brevity is not in my wheelhouse.

**Context**

The guy in question is my fraternity big brother and roommate I've known for almost 3 years. I am living in our fraternity house for my second consecutive year, he was a 2-year resident and is now moving next door. He was formerly on voting 5 as VP before he stepped down this semester (never showed up to anything, didn't care, glad he did). I am the incumbent Treasurer. Another brother who stayed in town over the summer was doing work for the alumni landlord who manages the house; he got access to the spare room keys and went room-by-room inspecting them for damages and taking pictures of their conditions for records. No worries there. However, he forgot to lock my door on the way out. This was 6 pm on the night in question. A few hours later, my big got drunk downtown and came back to our house. I presume he and the two brothers he was with went to each room looking to find anyone awake. When they got to my room, they probably pounded on the door and noticed it was ajar. Fast forward to the next day, the brother doing inspections for the landlord realizes a major problem: the **2020 Samsung 65"" 4k TV hanging from my wall mount has been obliterated and pulverized into fragments by what he can only assume was a baseball bat from the aftermath**. Shortly thereafter I get the call from our President about this and he fills me in on what I've outlined thus far. We have external security cameras and they show 3 brothers, including my big, entering the house at 1:50 am and roughly 10 minutes later the security camera DVR was unplugged. They were the only people in the house overnight from when the brother working for the landlord saw my TV in perfect condition at 6 pm, left, and returned the next day around 10 am to find it in pieces. The DVR is in the closet of my big's old room and he has unplugged it in the past while doing nefarious things. They were plugged in and functioning normally just hours before this according to the brother who was helping our landlord. My big is also the only other person with a key to the room the cameras are in. The only other person who has a key is the current resident of that room, who is my pledge brother and was asleep at the time with his door locked. Therefore, one can reasonably deduce the course of events. My big came back from downtown piss drunk with two other piss drunk interlopers, wandered around looking for attention, found my room unattended, took a bat to the TV (something I've watched him do to his TV over a girl), opened his old room with his old key and ripped the cord out of the camera DVR in an attempt to tamper with evidence. Fortunately, the cameras are backed-up and nothing was lost, and they don't overwrite old footage until it's two weeks old. The brother working for our landlord has already downloaded the footage. Unfortunately, I don't go back to school until tomorrow; this all happened earlier this past week. Whoever did it had the audacity to do it while I was still in my hometown a week before classes started, knowing the whole time I would arrive back to see it destroyed the day before classes start. And to rub salt in the wound, all of this happened two weeks after I spent three days moving, assembling, and mounting everything in the new room myself, and driving 8 hours there and back home over the 1st weekend of August.

I was incredibly disappointed to hear the news, and even more so when I started to piece together the timeline of events and realized there is convincing evidence to suggest the culprit was my own big.

This is not the first time he has done something like this. He has a long history of being careless and having zero accountability for his actions, owes a plethora of brothers and our landlord money, drinks well beyond his limits and acts like a child, and has routinely demonstrated that he is a complete piece of shit. I was naively altruistic and always gave him the benefit of the doubt, made excuses for his actions, etc. I was so incredibly tolerant. **He was drunk and fell into the same TV a month after I bought it and left a one-pixel wide vertical line running down the screen and would fervently deny any wrongdoing despite three witnesses' testimony that watched him do it that night**. Since it was barely noticeable from a distance, I let it go and never sought out compensation or reimbursement for the damages. Despite this, he has continued to abuse my trust and friendship. I have lost all respect for him. This most recent event was the straw that broke the camel's back and I cannot dedicate any more mental energy to entertaining this 24-year-old child. It is exhausting.

When I received the call from our President, he said he thought it was best he omit the names until measures had been taken to resolve/settle the issue. I fought the urge to start witch-hunting whoever was at fault, and agreed it was probably best I stay willfully ignorant of the names until culpability was established. However; I spoke with the brother who is working for our landlord a few hours later and the names slipped out while I was getting his statement. I haven't reached out to anyone besides him, our President, and our landlord who has already started investigating and is committed to making things right whether that be **through a mutual private settlement wherein my big (and/or others involved) reimburse me financially, replace the TV with an identical model or one of equal or greater value with my blessing, or litigate if necessary**. Our President had to deal with a similar situation involving a brother vandalizing his property last year which was thankfully resolved amicably. Nonetheless, he has a zero-tolerance policy for this kind of behavior and mentioned that regardless of how the matter is resolved/settled, he would be motioning to suspend this guy for the semester, which is his last. I intend to only disclose information to those that need to know, both for the sake of preserving the integrity of potential legal proceedings and also to keep the peace within the fraternity as a whole. We struggled with recruitment/rush during and post-COVID and our only chance at survival is to restructure our chapter and inculcate a sense of common fraternal pride; the last thing I want is for this to get out to the rest of the brothers. It would undermine an entire semester's worth of time and effort spent dismantling and abandoning the former culture of our organization which fostered and condoned senseless destruction and vandalism, petty beef between brothers, disloyalty, cliques, degenerate behavior, and a myriad of other issues. Clearly, this former culture lives on vicariously through my big. The way I see it, **our organization sits precariously at the edge of a precipice, and I am doing everything in my power to carefully back us off the ledge**. Meanwhile, a few individuals derive sick humor out of stirring the pot to create conflict and instability simply because instigating and provoking people brings them *joy*.

This is an uncomfortable position to be in and I am perplexed. This whole situation was brought to my attention in the last 24 hours. Nevertheless, my focus is on finishing my last two semesters so that I can start a full-time gig I just landed after an internship with a great company with some even better people, doing work I truly enjoy. **What's done is done and at this point, I don't care about the TV**. I just want to be made whole again (reimbursed), cut off all contact with this guy, and move on. I feel apprehensive about trying to settle things privately with him because he owes everyone and their mother money and will more than likely make insincere empty promises knowing damn well he won't fulfill them just to get the immediate pressure off of him. That way, he has some plausible deniability and can string this thing out long enough that I just let it go out of frustration. This is why I am seriously considering taking this to small claims court. I understand that the entire burden of proof would fall on me, the plaintiff, but I believe what I have is sufficient to fulfill the preponderance of the evidence standard in a civil suit.

I apologize for the verbosity of this thread; I thought it was important to include all the relevant details and context so that you can understand the big picture. If you have had a similar experience in the past or have any advice to offer, I am all ears. Hopefully, this can be resolved civilly, but I'm prepared to escalate it if need be.

If you're still reading this, thank you for your time and patience. I appreciate you.

I am an incoming freshman this upcoming fall. I am going over my resume again to apply to different internships and is wondering if I should include any leadership activities I did in high school on there. However, I do have enough CS programs/internships I've done to cover up all the space already. I'm just wondering about it because of the ""is leadership a keyword they will scan on"" thought for the resume screen part.

Thank you!"
wspqbf,4,2022-08-19,Non-coding roles?,dwokarrr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wspqbf/noncoding_roles/,"Idk if this is the right place to ask but I graduate this semester with a CS degree. I absolutely hate coding and really regret choosing this major. Right now I'm interviewing for SWE roles but it's become almost painful (Codesignal, Leetcode etc). I've had two SWE internships and hated them.

Are there any non-coding roles I can land straight out of school as a new grad? If it helps at all I have an Econ minor. (I'm also considering delaying grad by a semester to get an Econ double major. Would a CS-Econ double major open any extra doors for me or no?)"

wstnaw,0,2022-08-19,Making an impact,OatmealCawffee,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/wstnaw/making_an_impact/,"Hey there! I‚Äôve landed my first IT gig last year, and have been fast tracked into the Jr SysAdmin role, which I am going to be officially moving into very soon. I‚Äôve already been doing a lot of responsibilities in that role, and am doing everything I can to prove that I‚Äôm worth the investment. I‚Äôve written a script to automate account creation, as we were making accounts manually, and would go through these waves of hundreds of intern accounts that had to be completed in a fairly short span of time. It cut a bunch of busy work out of the equation and removed the guess work from permission and groups for each position, both for hires and interns. I‚Äôm being involved in meetings for new vendor software and our new AV onboarding. But I‚Äôm still ‚Äútechnically‚Äù help desk. I wanted to ask, when you guys were in those transitional periods, what kind of other ‚Äúquality of life‚Äù scripts or processes did you improve upon to make your mark?"

The job market was hard mode this year.  In my experience, entry level positions in software and web development have had really high requirements with so much competition. It really felt that I needed a referral, converted  from intern to full time, or a inside contact in order to a position.

 I finally got a full stack developer job after 6 months of searching and 3 months after graduation. I had a 3.98 GPA with multiple academic excellence awards  with great people for references in addition to internship experience.  Job search was rough even though I only applied to applications that I met 80%+ of the requirements and have the skills for. 

How was your job search experience like?   
How long did it take you all to find the first job after college that you liked?"

I am in honors and I have a GPA of 3.97. I also got my real estate license (not sure if thats useful for these purposes at all). I'm very self-driven and hard working, but I'm a big worrier so maybe I'm going overboard but I like to assume not for now.

So I'm looking for an internship for my sophomore summer, and applied to about 70  positions so far. Looking to double that by next week but uni starts so who knows. I had alot of rejections and had one gokd interview with a smaller wealth management place near me for a fall internship. But I have very little relevant work experience. I worked as a lifeguard, Pool Coordinator and for my family Real Estate business. I joined my schools Finance SPO and learning fund last year, with the intent to join its E fund by hopefully the next semester or start of my junior year.

My worry is I feel very unprepared and when I go on linkedin to see others they have stacked like 3 internships in their freshman year. Granted they're likely in the top 50 in my class for my major but I want to be in that group too. I feel like I have all the right drive and intellegence, but I have such low experience that I feel like I'm going to be underachieving.

My Questions are: 
2. What are some certs/courses I could take to make up for my lack of experience? (My first thoughts is some excel cert, bloomberg cert and maybe Wall St. Prep) I'm also thinking of getting a Math/Stat minor. Thoughts?
3. What should I do to secure a solid summer sophomore internship? Should I stack some fall/spring internships? In that case, what r some companies known to be lighter with sophomore recruiting?

Thank you in advance for your thoughts!"

wt4csl,138,2022-08-20,"Turning 30, 70k in school debt alone and my degree is in a field I think I‚Äôm actually shit at now/burned out by",sleepy_paladin,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/wt4csl/turning_30_70k_in_school_debt_alone_and_my_degree/,"I originally had written ‚Äúshort version‚Äù but this is anything but so. Sorry for that. 

I was in and out of school for 9 years in total (only 6 actually in school) due to financial reasons and a lifetime of undiagnosed depression coming to a head, for a degree in media production; when I started in 2011 it was something that really needed a degree and when I finished right before Covid in December 2019 it was something a majority of teenagers learn through YouTube. That constant in and out of school lead to a few things, most importantly a sense of insane burnout, a complete lack of a plan/very little work in things like internships and connections, and actually being far behind my peers in ability due to having year long breaks in my work. 

I‚Äôve struggled immensely finding it within me to create anything for myself, let alone try to make things for a reel to showcase myself/teach myself new things. Much like how I used to find joy in reading and writing all the time, i used to adore editing audio and video. I‚Äôve wanted to have my own radio show or write a cartoon or work on a travel show since I was child; creative things that are interesting. But for almost a decade now I‚Äôve only ever created for school or work, and now even that gives me panic attacks when staring at a fresh editing timeline. I feel like I‚Äôm going to vomit just thinking about trying to get back into media production despite it being a thing I do really want and having spent so much time and money on (point is moot currently as computer fried itself recently so I need to get a new one I can actually edit on if I did want to even try)

I have no idea what I‚Äôd do otherwise either; I can‚Äôt go back to school as literally every penny I make goes to bills so I can‚Äôt afford more expenses. I have friends telling me to go into a trade like electrician, but while I think I would actually enjoy working with my hands and having a tangible effect on the world (even when I loved creating media i started really hating sitting behind a desk every day and not having something ‚Äúreal‚Äù at the end of the day for work), I‚Äôve also always been the ‚Äúoutgoing creative‚Äù type; I respect trades people immensely but frankly I feel im too soft for it, and already have back and knees problems from when I was in the national guard (part of my stint of not knowing what to do when on break from school a second or third time)

I turn 30 in January and looking at my life I‚Äôm having increasing bouts of manic/depressive episodes where I think I‚Äôve found something that could work as a career or calling and then immediately find out it requires years of schooling I just don‚Äôt have in me. I‚Äôm no longer suicidal and haven‚Äôt been for years but I never expected to live this long as it was; I was convinced if by 30 I wasn‚Äôt on the way to where I wanted to be that clearly meant it was never going to happen. Despite knowing how insane and destructive that is, looking at the past few years of debt and spinning my wheels doing nothing, I‚Äôm not sure I was wrong. It‚Äôs giving me a lot of sleepless nights and affecting my day job as I‚Äôm constantly either thinking about how much of my life is already over with nothing to show or job searching, trying to find some kind of entry level media gig I think will restart that drive.

I‚Äôm terrified my life is just going to be me wishing and hoping one day I‚Äôll go back to the old me that created and was creative and ambitious but i know it won‚Äôt happen without work, and conversely I worry me committing to something else as a career means I‚Äôm shutting the door on dreams I‚Äôve had since I was a child and am set for a mundane, very meaningless life and I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. I know Reddit doesn‚Äôt have all the answers but if anyone has ever gone through similar or has advice I‚Äôd love to hear it"

I am entering my pre-final year at university. I am pursuing Computer Science at one of the best universities in India, and my CGPA is 7.72 (out of 10).

I spent my entire second year exploring different domains such as - web development, machine learning, and blockchain. Did a few projects as well. I am really enjoying machine learning because I am comfortable with math, and I enjoy programming.

My current profile is all over the place; a weird mix of a web developer, PCB designer and some ML projects. After all the exploration, I would like to apply for research internships abroad in the field of ML. But I am completely clueless about how to go about it. I know that my CGPA is not impressive, but it doesn't paint the whole picture of who I am.

*My main questions are:*

\- How should I find and email professors abroad for research internships in machine learning?

\- Since my CGPA is 7.72, is there anything I can do/say to prove my competency?

\- Given my very general profile, how can I use it to my advantage to convince professors that I am someone who can be relied on to get work done?

I dont know why but guys are weird 
In initial months they are all into you and they want to meet you every now and then and what not.
So this was few months later when i came home from summer vacation and so did he 
He had an internship on going
He would constantly ask me to meet for small things ice cream or a movie or something 

I often denied as i was sure back then not to meet in hometown ( strict household situation) 
But then he would ask so many times that i eventually gave into meeting him and he was all into the relationship 
Like that he has never been after that.

So it happened that whenever i did go meet him, people back at my place would find out about it and i wouldnt realise it then 
Only few months they found it and a whole argument broke out in my house 
And i told him about it how it went 
Which broke the whole thing for him of us being the way he thought we could be and things changed for him as he said so .
So i said i have been told to breakup with you and i went through a shithole and weirdly the response was ‚Äú had i been told like this by my family i would end it‚Äù

This right here was my Que to leave? Knowing we didn‚Äôt have a future together 
Was it our fault to continue 
But i often thought about this every time after that he made feel distant or like he was stuck with me 
Every time 
Not to mention the amount of pain both of us would go through in lying and getting out and not getting into trouble 

Always anxious.
Still i feel a little bit stupid for both to initially saying yes to meeting in hometown and then later on not analysing thoroughly and acting on the fact that he did actually for a while thought of leaving the relationship had he been in my place giving me a sign to do the same.
We dated for a long time after that.
But this was the best time i felt
Where he was into it as much as me
Later it felt he was just into it for a while then not."

People in my class are either not doing anything or paid for course that advertise as internship n going at it

What should I do since i don't have much knowledge about skills n stuff

Should i just apply everywhere that accepts freshers n if so which platform is the best

Or 

Should I learn something in these holidays n apply for internship based on that knowledge,also what would u recommend i learn about.

I just got in to Manipal university, which is quite sweet but after a horror show of other exams. My ultimate goal was always higher education in the USA due to the much better education standards but unfortunately i couldn't get into a Tier 1 to better my chances at a top American university. However, what can i do in the next few years to better my chances at being accepted into a Top PhD program / Masters degree (if PhD does not work out)?

&amp;#x200B;

PhD:

From what i know currently, the top PhD programs have very limited intakes and focus more on your research experience more than anything else. What is the best way to get some research experience in?

Incase i do manage to get some respectable publications in by my 4th year, would it be wise to start applying straightaway without any prior job experience?

In addition, what do the top schools in the US usually look for in their applicants that sets them apart from, say other Top 100 schools?

&amp;#x200B;

Masters:

Alternatively, what would be the plan for masters? One of the reasons i wanna do PhD is I'm genuinely passionate for research in CS plus it would also solve a lot of financial woes since PhDs are extremely well funded programs. Masters would admittedly be very expensive especially from a top school and i would be hesitant to take loan since my undergraduate degree already would be costing me upward of 25 lacs. Nevertheless, i want to keep masters open for backup. From what i understand,

\- 8.5+ gpa

\- Extracurriculars, such as joining clubs and getting projects done

\- Hackathons and Coding comps, for further ECs

\- 2-3 years of work experience, preferably with prior internships

Would all be really beneficial. But if i aim for the top schools such as Stanford, MIT and Columbia, what should i be doing different to stand out in the applicant pool?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to know what else to keep in mind and what corrections to make from my current path. Please give any suggestion you have. I'd love to know from people better informed about this than me. I want to start early, so that i don't regret it later on, like i did with my entrance prep prior to this."

(MSBA/MSDS) Fall 2023.,MainSimple,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/wtcx0w/confused_about_the_lors_how_do_i_choose_who_i/,"So I'm applying to both MSBA and MSDS programs for the upcoming cycle and I'm super confused about how I can choose the right LOR for any given university.

Writing it in hypotheses for a clearer understanding:

Professor A: I did significant research under, and I've done really well in his classes. I might have a paper from the research too! (This is the only LOR that I am sure of)

For the LOR 2:

Prof M: I worked with them for a long duration (a year?) on GANs and image processing but due to many reasons, the research wasn't as impactful as I would have hoped. The guide barely put any effort into understanding what we were working for and only looked at output images at the end of the year. They were away from all the research processes and does not really have any idea how the project evolved.

Prof N: Took two semesters of business and tech under them. Excelled in both, TA'd the class, and won a national business and startup hackathon due to analytics! I have a strong professional relationship with them.

My issue with taking Prof N's LOR is that it might not be entirely related to a lot of MSDS programs (especially the more academically structured ones), even though business + data is something that is a huge part of who I am.

For the LOR 3:

Manager X: my internship manager at an F500 company. I worked under them for three months for R&amp;D and came up with a great predictive model. Everything from start to finish was handled by me and another intern. Used LSTMs, time series forecasting, etc.

Manager Y: my full-time manager at a B4. It's a prestigious job but I have just been annotating, using ETL tools, and doing some literature surveys. Nothing else as of now and I'm not sure it'll change by December.

I would really like to take X's LOR but I do not want the AdCom to think I'm hiding something because I do not have a LOR from my full-time employer. Is there any way I can satisfactorily address this?

Which combinations work better for what type of programs?

Ex: maybe ANX for a business analytics program and AMY for data science? I'm just not too stoked about asking M and Y.

Overall it seems like the interns are actually juniors, juniors are mid-levels and mids are seniors, as our seniors lead the team. Aka all is shifted 1 lvl lower.

I normally stay at home over the summer, which is 2.5hrs away by train from where I'm working. My plan was to work 9-6pm Monday to Thursday, so I can take a half day Friday and go home to see my family and friends. I did this last week, my first week away, and it worked out well. 

This week however, due to train strikes I am unable to travel back. My Mum called me, and says she has decided to rent my room out starting Monday, 2 days from now. I was blindsided by this, and got a bit upset (not angry or anything, just she could tell I was sad).

She is NOT kicking me out; we have a great relationship and I love her very much. I would be sleeping in the living room if I came back, which is not an issue. I just wasn't expecting it, and would like to know if I have somewhere to stay if I come back, and what she's going to do with my stuff. When I was younger and went away with my Dad for a week or longer, she would move everything of mine which was very frustrating, and as I wasn't expecting this nothing of mine is packed up. I can be fussy with my things, and I don't want her going through my stuff.

She could tell I was upset and now she feels bad, which I don't want because I'm not using the room 5/7 days anyway. I am still upset and stressed about not being able to get back down and move out myself before Monday, but I don't know how to fix that. She has offered to not move the lodger in until next Monday, and I can move when I come down over the weekend, but I feel guilty over her missing out on a week of rent because of something that is only a big deal to me. She is trying to contact me and I know she feels guilty, but I'm still upset and I don't have a good solution and I'm worried I'll make her feel worse.

I‚Äôm a LPCC working towards full licensure. I‚Äôve been working at a group practice, which at first seemed to be like a good fit, but has since turned into feeling exploited, paid little, and provided with little to show for the 55% cut I give to the practice. Not to mention that myself and others in my position are being told to do unpaid work, such as managing inquiries for the practice. I‚Äôve been looking into getting a new job, but I‚Äôm running into the same issue of low pay and high expectations. I have a potential job offer incoming that would give me more access to working with couples, which is the population I work best with and am most excited to continue growing with. However, there are also some similar issues there and I am concerned about the more conservative and religious clients that the practice works with. Of course I can work within their values system, but I‚Äôm not necessarily excited about doing so.

So, with those less than ideal situations, I am contemplating starting a private practice myself. It is my long-term goal anyways and I am being encouraged by former supervisors to do it, but I have been unable to mentally take the plunge. I had a very robust internship that set me up incredibly well, so I feel very competent, in addition to clinical experience and training post-graduation. I ran my own S-Corp in another field for several years prior to entering mental health, so I feel competent in that aspect as well. But I still can‚Äôt shake the sense that I haven‚Äôt ‚Äúearned‚Äù the right to open a PP or that I‚Äôll somehow fail miserably.

Is it a bad idea to get started in PP so early or am I being overly fearful? Any experiences or advice would be wonderful."

As a kid, I was scared to be scolded or just straight up verbally abused by my parents (especially AM) whenever I had bad grades, and now whenever I make a mistake of fail at something I always feel like a failure. Also because of the verbal abuse I have low self-esteem, keep everything for myself and bottle up my emotions, and I‚Äôve grown numb from any kind of comments (compliments or critics). I never realized how bad it was until now.

I‚Äôm currently doing an internship. I completed my first assignment but I‚Äôve been struggling with my second assignment for a while now and I‚Äôm nearing the end of my internship.

I got called for a meeting with my manager and the head of department. In short I was praised for the work I did and they were so satisfied that they offered to take me for another internship next year (which could even lead to getting hired in the company). This is honestly an amazing opportunity, they didn‚Äôt even make the offer to another classmate who‚Äôs also interning there.

Above is a short synopsis of what I have done thus far. I need help on what I can do from here. I know junior year summer at university in the tech industry is crucial for obtaining an internship. I feel so behind and don‚Äôt know how to clear them. I have had interviews last year for internships from companies like American Airlines, T-Mobile, J&amp;J, and FedEx for their BA position. For whatever reason I don‚Äôt get the internship and get cut out after the first interview round. Not sure what more I can do I feel lost as everyone around me is snatching an internship and I know everyone puts hard work to get these. I just feel I‚Äôm missing something on a more efficient way to obtain one.

I am looking into positions revolving around Business Analysts, Data Analytics, Business Analytics, and others relating. Not sure what is the best and easiest position I should apply for based on my major. I know many have told me my major is super versatile and is amazing in today‚Äôs world but I feel I don‚Äôt know how to use it. 

Please feel free to guide me and tell me about you experience and what you did to land that first job/internship. Any pointers and tips would be great!

Thank you!!"

I am entering my pre-final year at university. I am pursuing Computer Science at one of the best universities in India, and my CGPA is 7.72 (out of 10).

I spent my entire second year exploring different domains such as - web development, machine learning, and blockchain. Did a few projects as well. I am really enjoying machine learning because I am comfortable with math, and I enjoy programming.

My current profile is all over the place; a weird mix of a web developer, PCB designer and some ML projects. After all the exploration, I would like to apply for research internships abroad in the field of ML. But I am completely clueless about how to go about it. I know that my CGPA is not impressive, but it doesn't paint the whole picture of who I am.

*My main questions are:*

\- How should I find and email professors abroad for research internships in machine learning?

\- Since my CGPA is 7.72, is there anything I can do/say to prove my competency?

\- Given my very general profile, how can I use it to my advantage to convince professors that I am someone who can be relied on to get work done?

***Professors of Reddit, please offer any advice you can. I appreciate any help you can provide. Also, please feel free to DM if you have something you can't say in the comments.***

I'm a (about to start) 4th year CS student based in Spain, and before starting uni I've always wanted to work on game dev. Growing up I realized I also liked AI (specially CV) and AR/VR. However, I wanted to do a MSc about CV and thought that AR/VR was just a hobby.

The thing is, I've done a couple internships (SWE and Data Science) and just ended the second internship. It was about AI, but mostly data analysis and some basic ML models. After the internship I realized that I don't really enjoy this (although idk if AI engineer would be different, or even CV engineer), and started looking for some MSc that can merge CV and AR/VR, I found one in UCL, but too expensive for me, and another one in TU WEIN (Visual computing).

I may start a project related to VR with a teacher at uni, but I haven't done anything related to VR before, but I'm sure I will like it, since I did a couple subjects related to graphics and I really enjoy maths and geometry.

Idk what to do, do you guys think there is a lot of difference between data science and AI engineer? Do you know if there is any possible job that can merge both CV and AR/VR? 

Anyways, thank you, and any advice would be appreciated :)"

Last fall, I was in a terrible mental state. I couldn't open my laptop to do homework without suffering a panic attack and crying. I lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks. I constantly found it hard to breathe. To ease my anxiety, my dad, who is in my field(Computer Science), helped me with 2 of my classes. He would sit with me and guide me through my labs.
I don't have a clear memory of what happened, but it feels like he did them for me. From what I can remember, he would do the assignment before me, partially so as not to waste time and partially as to ease my anxiety, giving me a rough estimate of the difficulty of that lab. 

Some labs the code was more or less in the book, and he would just direct me to where that code was.

Other times where we had to write more of it on our own, or maybe just when it was the really hard parts, it felt like he did them for me, but he would explain how it works and how I could have gotten to that solution.

This was one class(Data Structures) and the other class(Compilers), he didnt help me as much until towards the end. My poor mental health probably contributed to this, but I ended up getting pneumonia and getting hospitalized. This was right around when my last compilers project was due. If I can remember correctly, I feel like my dad did it for me and just walked me through it and how it works.

My memory of the events isn't too clear, but my reasoning is that since I have been unable to move past this for a year, I did something really bad. Tbh, my diagnosed OCD and compulsive need to be honest might have played into this as well.

I feel like I might be using my unclear memory of the events as an excuse.

I have talked to my dad about this, and our accounts differ as to how much he helped, but I feel like he might be lying to me to protect me.

As this school year starts, i have been considering coming clean to my teachers. I feel I don't deserve this job offer and to graduate.

If you're in academia and/or engineering, please mention it in your reply."

&amp;#x200B;

2 months ago I decided I wanted to find a new job and apartment. I worked at a high-end restaurant for around 2 years and grew to dislike it. On the other hand, I was living in an apartment complex for almost 2 years and I despised my living conditions and my roommate. So I wanted some change. I started looking for roommates online to move in. Long story short I had three places I wanted to move into but they all fell through. Two of them were supposed to be with potential roommates and last minute they communicated to me that it wasn't going to work out. After the two situations didn't work out I went to my mom to ask for help to look around. My mom and I started looking for apartments. First, she looked at potential roommates on craigslist and sent some to me. I emailed a bunch but the majority never responded and others told me that the space was taken already. So then we started looking for studios and one-bedroom apartments. My mom had a list of things she wanted. 

1. An apartment on the second floor (no first floor so someone won't be able to break in),

2.   in-unit washer/dryer, 

3. and a safe neighborhood.

 We toured around 5 or 6 apartment complexes. We came to a studio apartment where the rent was $850 but my mom didn't want to pick it because the neighborhood seemed unsafe. She called my aunt that lives in the area of the state, asking for her opinion. Even though my aunt doesn't live in the area, she lives in the suburbs. My aunt said that some of the places seemed unsafe so because of that my mom wanted to look at other places. I was annoyed because my aunt doesn't live in the city or where I was looking at apartments and my mom completely just went with her opinion. 

Around this time of looking for apartments,  I found a job. This was after applying to around 75 jobs online and getting rejected as well. The new job doesn't pay amazing but I was excited because my boss would treat me better than my old boss. I am currently a psych major, graduating in December. When my mom found out about the job she told me that she hated it. The job is a hearing aid medical office. It's not completely psychology but it paid a bit better than my old job, I get to work with patients, fill in invoices/insurance, and get treated better. My mom still hates it. She thinks it has nothing to do with my major and I should have picked something else.  I also have an internship lined up for the beginning of next year for a social services division. I was thinking of working part-time at my new job and doing the internship but my mom wants me to pick...even though the internship doesn't pay anything. I am trying to explain to her that I don't even have my degree yet (I'm taking my last 4 classes this semester) and that it's normal to not find high-paying jobs as a psych major without your master's. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward, my mom tries to get this house to buy for me (2 bedrooms and 1 1/2 bathrooms) (I know...). Her plan was to buy the house and get a mortgage with my dad. Then she was going to fix it up. The rent was going to be around $1,200. Fast forward, my parents didn't get the house. At this point, I am getting frustrated with constantly looking and plans falling through. I told my mom that I just wanted to lock something down. I told her I wanted to pick the first apartment complex we looked at. The rent was $1500. My mom told me that I can only stay there for 6 months because it's so expensive. So we got the lease and started the process. However, my mom also starts guilt-tripping me about not picking this basement apartment an hour away. She told me the rent was $1400. I told my mom that it was unfair for her to dismiss the place we started to sign the lease for because of how expensive it was when the basement apartment was equally the same expensive. My mom didn't care. She started getting into fights with me about how I should have picked that place. On top of that, she start getting annoyed at my new job as well. All of these fights started happening after I signed the lease. Fast forward to now, she is still annoyed at me. I have been moving into my new place and my mom has barely been helping me out. And to make it better, I recently got covid. Instead of supporting me, she gets really nitpicky about everything. I am been feeling like a horrible daughter in my mom's eyes and I don't know what to do."
wu5ovn,2,2022-08-21,Advice for recent grad with no experience?,Tryphex_ZMan,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wu5ovn/advice_for_recent_grad_with_no_experience/,"Hi,

I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering. I never got an internship during my studies, and I'm currently struggling to find a job or even gain some experience. I've sent hundreds of applications over the past 2 months but never got interviews. The only two interviews I got where from when I got referred.

I honestly don't know what to do right now, maybe I'm not applying to the correct jobs (entry level positions for web dev or soft dev or support engineers), maybe it's my resume that needs work. At this point, I just want some sort of experience so that I can start applying myself with more confidence when job hunting.

I've tried to find internships, but 99% of the ones I've seen are for students still in their studies. I keep coming back to the idea of applying to recruiting agencies like FDM Group. Is it worth it? I have no need for immediate money, but I do want the experience that comes with it. Is it worth to go with recruting agency groups like FDM Group or just keep applying?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I have no experience so job hunting is hard. I want experience. Recruiting agencies can offer experience but for a really low salary. Should I keep applying to jobs or go with a recruiting agency?"

wu7g29,2,2022-08-21,Senior Year Class Problems,ibepurpleee,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wu7g29/senior_year_class_problems/,"Hello netizens of a2c!

I'm kind of in a pickle right now with my class schedule. I am currently debating whether or not to drop a class right now and kind of need some guidance. Honestly if it was any other year, I think I would've soldiered through but now with all the college apps and new teachers, I feel kind of stressed to take 7 classes again.

Here's my schedule (all weighted):

0 - AP Calc BC  
1 - AP Physics 2  
2 - English IBSL (Senior class, I wasn't able to take AP Lit but already took lang)  
3 - AP Chinese  
4 - AP Gov/ AP Econ 2nd semester  
5 - Computer Science IBHL2  
6 - NJROTC

Bit of bg info: Asian male in decently ranked tech school. I really want to get into a branch of engineering or cs. Not sure which gpa is best but 10-12UW is 3.93. I mostly took ap/ib/honors classes. Only had reg classes for freshman and sophomore year (jrotc and math). Decent ecs along with a research/development internship at a UC.

Right now the two classes in question are jrotc and chinese. Chinese is hard because I'm not a native speaker, so the listening and speaking in extremely hard for me. We even have vocab quizzes like twice a week so studying for these characters are kind of time consuming and tiring. JROTC is for sure less academically stressing but I do have to memorize all these standards and wear uniforms and such so it's taxing in another way. The biggest problem is that the physical requirements of the class are kind of hard (4:49 mile is 100%, 9:00 minute mile is 40%, the teacher made some ""adjustments"" to the navy standard so now unless you do marathons and work out everyday, it's basically impossible to pass).

I know taking both of these classes are obviously better than just dropping one, but I do want to make time for college apps and I especially don't want to go mentally insane and burn out. I'm way better academically than physically but don't really want to study so many foreign characters every week. 

The minimum class requirements for seniors are 5 classes in my school but also don't want to look like I didn't try my senior year. What would you guys say is the best choice? Thanks all!

Applications are going to be so painful to finish T\^T 

TL;DR: I don't really want to take 7 classes this year to make time for other stuff, but don't know if I should drop chinese or njrotc."

wudrml,0,2022-08-21,Fast Track Pathway,Courage-Firm,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/wudrml/fast_track_pathway/,"I was in nursing up until a year ago, took a long break and fiddled with learning Python recently. Growing up, I played Minecraft a lot and loved the aspect of Redstone and it's complexity. My current job as a administrative assistant requires me to use a lot of Google Sheets and functions to make my life easier. These two contributed to the question of software development being the right path for me, which I feel it does. After speaking with some people at my job, a dev that works for a big company is in charge of managing her own team. She told me if I wanted to land a Jr. position at the business she works for, I can fast track an 8 month course and she can get me a recommendation. Based on this, I did a bit of digging around, read "" New? READ ME FIRST "" and wanted to know what you would do. 

I'm located in Canada, so the use of ""degree"", ""certificate"", ""diploma"", etc. might be of different use to you but here goes. I currently have 4 options I'm exploring:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Object Oriented Software Development - Certificate - 8 Months
2. Software Development - Diploma - 2 Years
3. Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) - Bachelor - 4 Years
4. Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Software Engineering) - Bachelor - 4 Years

&amp;#x200B;

Now while I can dim witted, take the 8 month course and pray to the Gods that my referral can land me a Jr. Dev job, I feel that I will be illy equipped to make my resume stand out. I have a friend who completed option #4, applied at 100+ positions and landed a job. That's with a 4 year program and a Bachelor's, while if I don't land the job, I'm competing in a much harsher environment because I only have a certificate and minimum experience if any. All options still make us do internships so I will get hands on experience. Now, if I do go with #1, I feel that I need A LOT of projects and work experience to make up for the fact that it's a certificate.

Alright, now if #1 isn't a go, I'd obviously go straight to #2. Which I'm thinking is a fast tracked version of # 2 &amp; 3. But I've also read that in Canada, recruiters have a preference for those who have Bachelors. So while I might learn everything I need, would this be a viable option to go with to land a job with just a diploma?

If you were in my position, what would you do? For those of you who do recruiting, does the difference between a certificate, diploma, or bachelors affect your process if they all have sufficient project experience?"

I wasted this summer (I know, really dumb) and now I am thinking of devoting my time to creating a web dev project in a short time span while applying for internships. My question is, what projects should I be creating as someone with no prior experience in projects that will be presentable and showcase in-demand skills on my resume? And what resources should I utilize to create these projects in a relatively short time span while also still retaining enough knowledge of it? Ig what I'm asking is, if you guys have experience in creating projects how do you advise going about learning the skills not taught in school and applying them to your own project?

I'm trying to gauge what interest students would have in a low paid freelancing software gig. It could be a fixed sum of money paid on completion of a given task. Maybe start small so we're sure we are on the same page.

i came to this country many moons ago in the hope to find the ""american dream"" but instead i faced disappointment,to a point which i have started to regret a lot of my decisions especially about coming here

i financially struggled in the beginning and had little support so worked shitty jobs and made shitty money with no growth.i went to college on my own to earn a degree and hopefully find a better job that could turn into a career.they gave me some scholarship but i still had to pay a lot on my own which was very difficult given the fact that i had no family or support system.so i worked two jobs every single year of my college experience.after i graduated and started looking for jobs,employers did not like my ""work history"" as i never worked anywhere longer than a year(duh i was in school!) and i was constantly told ""why dont you get an unpaid internship for the experience?"" and im like BECAUSE I HAVE BILLS TO PAY!

then i was advised to go to graduate school in the hopes of honing my skills so i decided to to do even more schooling.but then covid happened and everything went to [shit.so](https://shit.so) here i am: jobless with a broken resume that nobody even looks at and fuckton of loans to pay back while i need to live a life and pay my bills

it seems to me that employers are no longer interested in people and what they offer.they want to pay entry level wages to someone with a masters degree!

i am at a tipping point here where i have failed to even get an interview at the 250+ companies that i have applied to.WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

* 21	Any info on sports mba and is it really effective? How can someone with btech get into the sports industry?(For ex, working with ISL through IMG Reliance as data analyst or something)
* 22	Economics and what can people majoring in economics do to be more employable.
* 23	Alternatives to CA for commerce kids

I had checked with them about staying and had communicated that I would be leaving this morning, shortly before they returned. It turned out I was off by one day as to when I could move in to my place for the fall, and would need to stay the night at my aunt and uncle's this evening as well. In my inattentive idiocy, I forgot to tell my aunt and uncle this and they were surprised to find me still here when they got back home. What I did not know was that this was their anniversary, and I realized I was basically intruding on their evening. I apologized and offered to leave, but after gently communicating to me that they need me to communicate better, they said it would be fine for me to stay. At this point, it felt like it would be more rude to just rush out of the house and leave, and I tried to be a charming and thankful guest as we all had dinner this evening.

&amp;#x200B;

I also forgot to add an important attachment to a work-related email today commissioning artwork from an artist, with my supervisor cced on the whole thing. Haha...

&amp;#x200B;

It's just so rough when it feels like you try so hard to avoid failures and mistakes to the point of fearing risk-taking, and your own stupid brain causes you to fuck up anyway. I want so badly to believe in myself and my own intelligence and abilities, but it's really hard to not let stupid, careless mistakes feed into negative, self-reinforcing narratives about yourself."

1.) Asian-American female

2.) Highly competitive/high income area

3.) Majoring in Computational Science/Data Science

4.) Top choice schools: Stanford, MIT, Caltech

&amp;#x200B;

Stats (a bit complicated):

SAT: 1580 (780 english, 800 math)

Total APs/ect: 10 AP's, multivariable calculus

Freshman-year grades: All A's

Sophomore: very *very* bad (I am not exaggerating this) due to severe covid/mental illness complications 

Junior: All A's, but one B in AP Lang (but I got a 5 on the exam)

&amp;#x200B;

Extracurriculars (this gets interesting, all STEM related except for #9 and #10):

1.) Research at Caltech

2.) NASA Internship (first and only hs student to work on a specific project--won't list due to privacy reasons)

3.) Lead of Data Analytics Intern (for an electoral campaign)

4.) President of the Data Science club (partnered with a T10 school--won't list bc I don't want people I know reading this lol)

5.) Secretary of a district-wide STEM organization 

6.) Self-driven ML and AI research at a semi-prestigious organization (20% acceptance rate)

7.) Started my own organization partnered w a local tech company to promote underrepresented women in tech

8.) Paid private tutor (teaching math)

9.) JV swim

10.) TBD! (I am planning to become a certified Udemy instructor for Physics)

&amp;#x200B;

Extra notes:

1.) I have written my Common App essay, and a Stanford admit (who is well-known for his writing) actually likes it! My AP Lang teacher also likes it, too. 

2.) I'm assuming I have two strong letter of rec's because one is from my mentor at NASA and the other is a STEM teacher I am close with. The third is a maybe, but she was my former AP Lang teacher!

3.) I had very horrible grades sophomore year because of major depression. I have never experienced depression and had no idea how to cope/reach out. I have sorted things out w my counselor and the ""Additional Info"" section of the common app."

Think businesses still need their system implemented in 10yo IBM tool because their end users save a few hours a week using it. 

I want to get into software development but I transferred out of CS during my undergrad in year 2 and completed by degree in a less technical degree. I don't have high level courses like compliers, operating systems, cyber security or even things like discrete mathematics. Software development comes easier to me and I'm happier to overwork myself when I'm solving problems in SD/SE because I believe it's rewarding and I'm still young so should I get into the door I'd be very keen on succeeding at the job. 

I have a couple of internships at banks/big 4 companies and most of them are technical focused. But the thing is I don't have ""deep experience"". It's so hard finding a job because every day I'm presented with two options: 

1) apply for jobs 

2) self teach/cry about tutorial hell/work on projects that demonstrate my experience. 

I'm afraid that doing projects is wasting time I could be spending on finding jobs. And then there's the technical interviews which I sometimes can't succeed on. I have software engineering knowledge learned from a undergrad, built up from computer science basics like C/C++ so I know things like DS+A, OOP, BigO, problem solving, and programming in general. And I can warp my head around concepts like async, JS frameworks, back vs front end, etc. 

But gosh  I am not on the path of a new grad getting a 100k+ in SF and getting to L5 by the time their 30 earning well over 200k in TC. I would be grateful for a front end job or a python, .NET or Java job connecting one API to another but it's almost hopeless for me right now, I never ever get software engineering interviews and I just don't know whether it's better for me to say: take 10 weeks and build out a project, go to a bootcamp, self teach myself programming to get a job... or to say: apply to jobs now and even if I don't land in SD I can follow that path eventually... But I'm off the SD/SE/SDE track as of now. What should I do? Can any experienced engineers rant on what someone should do at this point? A graduate from university who has a bit of CS experience that wants to become an SD?"

I just received a phone interview a week ago that wanted to start me off about double what I‚Äôm earning.

So I‚Äôm thinking about leaving my current company when that time comes unless they can make a significant counter offer.

For school I‚Äôm working on this research project, it‚Äôs a hassle to assembly the board so I might be pushed on this summer class until the end of September.

Damn. My emotional pressure was higher than i thought. 
I went to my supervisor, for good purpose, in order to have more responsibilities to my internship. I just wanted to learn a lot of stuff.

The only thing i did wrong is that i told him that i believe that i have learned the most of the position I work on.

He said that I'm not the one that can judge this. By saying that, i underestimate the people that has this responsibility. I show negativity against the company, and  a lot more.

Then i fixed my request by saying that ""I would like to have more responsibilities, and i would like to learn whatever the company has to offer to me.""

He changed his glance, in a good way. Then said that this is the proper way to ask things from a supervisor. This is the way you can show positivity to the company, and he will look forward to accomplish my request.

I thanked him for the information he gave me, about how to talk to a supervisor and also thanked him for listening to my request.


I regret it hardly, for the ""i believe that i have learned the most of the position I work on"" I said. 
I must fix my speech. Today i fcked up, but also i learned a huge professional lesson.

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm 24 years old and having struggled mentally for almost my whole life, I am now doing great but I‚Äôm in a predicament and de decision is quite big for my future.

About 2 years ago, in the middle of the pandemic, I finally decided to start working on myself. I took some time off of college to do so because I had no energy to put into it.

Shorlty after the lockdown was over, I started to feel a lot better. So I signed back up for college but since I had missed the start of the year, I started working untill I could start halfway through the year. But now ever since I started school again, I feel like I‚Äôve been waisting time sitting in school learning absolutely nothing usefull. All the knowledge I gained to be in my field of work (which is in Real estate) I gained during an internship I had last schoolyear. 

I am learning more about social issues within our society, which I quite honestly don‚Äôt really care enough about to study that in school, than I am learning how to sell or rent a home. 

I want to enter the workfield and start building my life. Get a job, start my plans for building my own place to live, etc‚Ä¶ 

I just got a very good job offer which really started to make me doubt whether I should continue and get my degree or not since it makes no sense to me that I basically didn‚Äôt learn a single thing there.

This is where I feel stuck because I am ready to start building my life and move forward but college is holding me back so badly that it started draining me again and that‚Äôs the last thing I want since I am now in a very good place on a personal level."

Didn't enjoy my project at all, it focused on design engineering and I didn't like it at all. My learning curve was a hard hurdle; I didn't quite understand my project in the beginning so it took me a while to get the hang of it. By a while, I mean 2.5 weeks. Once I finally started designing I realized that I didn't enjoy it. I don't think I learned a lot from the project specifically, but I tried my best. 

As time went on, I kept hitting road blocks like manufacturing time, trying to get help from people who were on vacation, hunting people down for assistance, getting parts welded, getting maintenance on things I needed to use. I got to the very last 2 weeks and I thought I was going to be able to start testing. Except I couldn't. I hit another roadblock, the vehicle I was using kept running hot so I couldn't use it and there wasn't another I could use, so I had to put in a work order. I have 4 days left and my project isn't finished. I'm extremely sad because people kept pushing that they wanted to see some data but I couldn't get it done. Then to top it all off, I filled out the performance form incorrectly and pushed it through way too early. I asked if I could offboard a week early once I saw my project go up in flames but my mentor advised against it. I get that it's taking the easy way out, but by this time I'm depressed and exhausted because I wanted to do well at my internship, finish a project and make a statement. Instead, I sucked at my internship, failed at my project, and made a giant fool out of myself. I wanted to leave the company behind me. 

Now the fun part comes at the end where the company sends out offers. I'm almost positive they won't offer me one, because who would give a position to someone who can't finish? I graduate in December, so now I'm trying to figure out what to do next. I'm thinking I should try to go back to school for another year or something because I feel so **unprepared** for the job. I don't want to start a job not knowing how to do anything like I did this internship, except this time the expectations are different. I've applied for jobs so God help me.

Not sure what to do next."

CGPA : 9.2  (Top NIT, not sure of the tier)

GRE: 325 (Q: 169, V: 156, AWA: 4)

TOEFL: Yet to give ( Assume &gt; 110)

Research experience: Worked for a feature selection (ML) research project during my final year of undergrad for 4 months but no publications.

Internship: Worked as a cloud development intern in a reputed MNC for 3 months.

Work Experience: Working as an SDE for another reputed MNC for around 20 months in cloud networking. ( By the time of applications).

The reasons why I left were

1.) Commission Only

3.) As I sat there I realized how much of Financial ""Advising"" was basically putting clients money in mutual funds and profiting off their clients being na√Øve and not educating themselves on proper investing. It just felt shady since so much of this advising can be done on its own.

I have recently graduated (MEng CompSci) and am looking for graduate roles in Markets / S&amp;T. I previously did a markets summer internship at BNP Paribas, but unfortunately had some problems at the time and did not get a return offer.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, should I be applying to summer internships instead of grad roles? As I get the sense they are much easier to get, and it might be hard for me to get full time roles at more presitigious banks. But they all ask for graduates of 2023 and onwards, but would they allow me? Could I apply to both summer internships and graduate roles at a given bank?

wuxqp5,6,2022-08-22,Should I quit my full-time job and focus on my studies?,ayvikenedy,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/wuxqp5/should_i_quit_my_fulltime_job_and_focus_on_my/,"Hi, I am a third year college student and I started working full-time last year, during the second year of my studies(most of my classes were online, but this year it might be on-site).

I got this job quite ""accidentally"", I was looking for an internship opportunity but one of my parents' friends recommended me in his workplace (corporation). I got invited for an interview and ended up getting my first job ever! I was very excited even though the job was not fully connected to what I am studying. I really wanted to gain experience, I wanted to learn new things and the money was exciting for someone that is not from a rich family. I did not know what I was signing up for.

It has been 9 months since I got this job and I am tired and exhausted. I do not like what I am doing and I actually never liked the idea what I was going to be doing in this exact job, I took the opportunity because I wanted to start somewhere and get some experience. Some parts of the job can be interesting, my colleagues are really nice and friendly, but I do not know if this is worth it anymore. I am not sure whether I should quit either.

So, for the reasons to leave we have: I do not like the job, I feel depressed, My classes are starting soon and I am afraid of being stressed again (I actually have no idea how I managed to work full-time and get great grades. I was very exhausted at the end of it but yeah).

For the reasons to stay: There is a possibility that if I stay for a full year (3 more months of me being miserable) in the company I will not have to complete the mandatory internship on my fourth year of studies, money I guess, and the fear that I am an ungrateful person, who does not value what they have because some of my friends are working in way worse conditions and get paid less. I am afraid I might regret this and not be able to find anything better. Obviously, some of my friends do not work at all, so idk. Also, if I quit, I will concentrate on my studies and not look for a new job any time soon and I am afraid that the gap on my CV will be concerning and will destroy all the hard work I have been doing.

The question is: should I stop complaining and stay or should I leave and focus on my studies and not get ahead of myself?

P.S. I live with my parents, so I have some financial support from them and they are okay with me leaving the job."
wuxuhr,2,2022-08-22,Profile Review at time of matriculation: 730 GMAT - 3.81 GPA - 24-25 White Male,SnooHedgehogs938,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/wuxuhr/profile_review_at_time_of_matriculation_730_gmat/,"Hi Reddit,

I am a 23-year-old white NY male looking for a profile evaluation. Appreciate everyone's input!

Summary at time of matriculation:

GPA: 3.81

GMAT: 650 -&gt; 730 -&gt; 730 q48 v42 IR 6 AWA 4 (Was a long gmat journey, I did an in-depth interview with GMAT club for anyone that is interested in learning about it)

Age: 24-25

WE: 3-4 Years -&gt; 1 year at small PE as asset manager and hopefully 2-3 years at household name PE firm (I just started here last week and enjoy it)

Academic Background:

Attended a decent university (I loved it and really enjoyed my time here) ranked around #200 overall with a 65.5% acceptance rate. I graduated May 2021 Summa Cum Laude with a 3.81 GPA and a major in finance with a minor in data analytics. I was very involved in extracurriculars and belonged to 3 clubs as well as a competitive investment team where I lead the entrepreneurship group to a state championship victory.

Highest GMAT:

730 Q48 V42 IR 6 AWA 4 

Work Experience:

I have extensive internships at some well-known firms throughout college. My first year out of college I worked for a small Private Equity firm where I was promoted from analyst to asset manager and ultimately ended up managing a book of distressed debt worth about $25M. I recently wanted to transition to a stronger name in the PE credit space and will be working in a fund level credit structuring role at one of the largest PE firms in the world(Top 10 Private Equity Firm). I will be working out of the NYC office as an associate. I plan on staying here till I decide to officially apply to get my MBA and maybe even after, the firm seems like a great place so far. I would like to apply with 3-4 years of experience under my belt.

Extra Curriculars:

I am a lover of history and am very involved in the metal detecting community. I have put together groups that orchestrate archeological hunts in historically rich areas, which have produced some very special finds that have been donated to historical societies and museums. This is in an in-depth process and requires great research which we facilitate through the use of topographical maps. I've been doing this since I was 12 years old and will soon be traveling to Europe to see what I can find over there.

I competed in bodybuilding from ages 19-23 and went to nationals while also winning some state championships. This sport takes extreme discipline and was a huge challenge for me. I plan on competing again once my work schedule stabilizes.

I have a large social media following of over 150k followers and a verification on social media platforms. I've used this platform to raise awareness for animal charities and donations for underprivileged communities. The events I have helped put together with my family have produced over 1.2M in donations. I am currently working on a new non-profit that should be well underway within the next few months. I am the founder of a foundation raising donations to ensure we can provide holiday experiences to those in homeless shelters in some less fortunate areas. I am very passionate about this program and am hoping it will be a success. 

I have started a small real estate investment LLC that enters RE positions through the acquisition of distressed 1st lien assets. We have been successful in the past year, deploying 500k and generating an attractive return. I plan on continuing this going forward.

Recommendations:

I have strong recommendations from some industry leaders and need to ensure I perform well at my current job as I would love to have a recommendation from where I work, of course.

Purpose for MBA:

This may change, but I would like to use the MBA to transition into a role that would allow me to gain the experience necessary to rise the ranks and secure a C level spot at my current firm or another shop. I am sure this would end up being a role in either postgraduate IB or PE, which I will have confirmed as I apply. I also would like to start of my own entity one day. My post MBA role would continue to allow me to find the optimal structure and investment strategies for my own fund. I have this whole plan very detailed and continue to add to it. The MBA purpose will depend on how things go with this new job over the next year.

Can someone please give me an idea of the range of schools they think someone with my profile at the time of matriculation would have a decent shot at getting in at? What do you think my chances at an m7 or t15 would be? What should I do going forward over these next few years to increase my chances?

There are a lot of prestigious programs out there that I would be honored to receive admission to and would really appreciate some opinions on where they think I could end up. Thank you again for your time!"

wuzl31,94,2022-08-22,Snagged My First Job.,TheDulceMan,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/wuzl31/snagged_my_first_job/,"Hey guys, just snagged my first data analyst job out of college, and I thought I‚Äôd share my job hunt process. I‚Äôve sent around 50-70 applications, had 5 phone interviews, 2 of those turning into in person interviews, then finally 1 offer. This will be geared towards the US, as I am in Texas. Here are the steps I took: 

1. Bachelors Degree:
Around 99.9% of all the jobs I applied for needed a degree. I have a Degree in Math, all jobs usually wanted some type of STEM related degree, however any degree could work with a good resume and portfolio. I had no internships or any job related to data in college. I have heard you can break into the field with no degree, however it would be extremely difficult to do so I think. 

2. Tailor Your Resume:
This sub helped me out a lot here. Others have posted resumes that were really good, so I just took ideas from those and made my own. YouTube also has good tips for data resumes so I‚Äôd look there as well. Put projects on your resume, with a portfolio link so employers can view it. 

3. Projects:
Common knowledge, but I can‚Äôt stress this enough. Every interview has been centered around my projects, I had to do a presentation for the data team for one of the interviews. You can message me for more details, but my project process was: Obtain an open dataset online -&gt; clean in excel -&gt; ask myself questions to solve about the data-&gt; solve them in SQL-&gt; Visualize with tableau. I had 3 projects total. 

4. Applying strategy: 
After finishing your resume, I think this is what is more important. I started out applying on indeed, handshake, and linkedin. I stopped using Indeed half way into my process, because there is way too much competition there. So I focused on linkedin and handshake. I always filtered with jobs posted within the last 3 days to a week,  nothing ever after that. Any ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù job listing is something to ignore, too much competition. The big thing I‚Äôd emphasize is as much as I‚Äôd want an at home job, snagging an entry level remote position without any experience is slim. I‚Äôd see a remote position have around 300-800 applications sent in. Again, too much competition. Look for On Site positions. It cuts the competition way down, to maybe 40-70 for smaller companies. All you need is that first data analyst title. So I even though I want a remote position, the title means more than anything, so on site it is. Also apply for anything that wants 1-3 years of experience. You never know what job make take a chance on you, as that was the case for my job. Be careful applying to any of the WITCH companies, you can google to see why those are not recommended. (Although I have heard some good stories working for those companies, as it gets your foot in the door.)

5. Interviews: 
Here thankfully I haven‚Äôt had a technical interview, since they were more interested in my projects. I‚Äôd struggle in a technical interview for sure, so again, projects are good. I was definitely under the gun for both interviews, but confidence is key. 

So yeah, Just thought I share that. I was definitely nervous about how much of a struggle entry level jobs are to get, but I just kept my head down and just kept applying. I also learned lots of stuff from this sub, so thank y‚Äôall as well."
wuzmgj,1,2022-08-22,Resume question,tsell28,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/wuzmgj/resume_question/,"I‚Äôm new to CS and only in intro classes right now. I found a local internship that I want to apply for in Summer 2023, but I have no resume regarding software development. Their only qualifications are pursuing a degree in CS and having a GPA 3.0+, with preferred (not required) skills in various languages and software. I will obviously have more programming experience &amp; skills when the internship starts, but I am wanting to apply now. Any recommendations on creating a decent resume to apply?

*There is a ‚Äúno resume‚Äù option where I can put contact info only, but not sure if this is a smart option. Also an option to input resume info manually."
wv0cg9,4,2022-08-22,The manager made me feel guilty for not completing the internship duration.,KSJ_SINGH,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/wv0cg9/the_manager_made_me_feel_guilty_for_not/,"Long story short, I'm not completing the internship tenure by 1 month as I'm going for my master's. He's making me feel guilty for leaving the project and refusing to issue me an experience certificate. What can I do about the latter and have you guys faced something similar?"
wv0x0r,2,2022-08-22,Should I quit my full-time job and focus on my studies?,ayvikenedy,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/wv0x0r/should_i_quit_my_fulltime_job_and_focus_on_my/,"Hi, I am a third year college student and I started working full-time last year, during the second year of my studies(most of my classes were online, but this year it might be on-site).

I got this job quite ""accidentally"", I was looking for an internship opportunity but one of my parents' friends recommended me in his workplace (corporation). I got invited for an interview and ended up getting my first job ever! I was very excited even though the job was not fully connected to what I am studying. I really wanted to gain experience, I wanted to learn new things and the money was exciting for someone that is not from a rich family. I did not know what I was signing up for.

It has been 9 months since I got this job and I am tired and exhausted. I do not like what I am doing and I actually never liked the idea what I was going to be doing in this exact job, I took the opportunity because I wanted to start somewhere and get some experience. Some parts of the job can be interesting, my colleagues are really nice and friendly, but I do not know if this is worth it anymore. I am not sure whether I should quit either.

So, for the reasons to leave we have: I do not like the job, I feel depressed, My classes are starting soon and I am afraid of being stressed again (I actually have no idea how I managed to work full-time and get great grades. I was very exhausted at the end of it but yeah).

For the reasons to stay: There is a possibility that if I stay for a full year (3 more months of me being miserable) in the company I will not have to complete the mandatory internship on my fourth year of studies, money I guess, and the fear that I am an ungrateful person, who does not value what they have because some of my friends are working in way worse conditions and get paid less. I am afraid I might regret this and not be able to find anything better. Obviously, some of my friends do not work at all, so idk. Also, if I quit, I will concentrate on my studies and not look for a new job any time soon and I am afraid that the gap on my CV will be concerning and will destroy all the hard work I have been doing.

The question is: should I stop complaining and stay or should I leave and focus on my studies and not get ahead of myself?

P.S. I live with my parents, so I have some financial support from them and they are okay with me leaving the job."

wv1dp9,1,2022-08-22,Should I quit my full-time job and focus on my studies?,ayvikenedy,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/wv1dp9/should_i_quit_my_fulltime_job_and_focus_on_my/,"Hi, I am a third year college student and I started working full-time last year, during the second year of my studies(most of my classes were online, but this year it might be on-site).

I got this job quite ""accidentally"", I was looking for an internship opportunity but one of my parents' friends recommended me in his workplace (corporation). I got invited for an interview and ended up getting my first job ever! I was very excited even though the job was not fully connected to what I am studying. I really wanted to gain experience, I wanted to learn new things and the money was exciting for someone that is not from a rich family. I did not know what I was signing up for.

It has been 9 months since I got this job and I am tired and exhausted. I do not like what I am doing and I actually never liked the idea what I was going to be doing in this exact job, I took the opportunity because I wanted to start somewhere and get some experience. Some parts of the job can be interesting, my colleagues are really nice and friendly, but I do not know if this is worth it anymore. I am not sure whether I should quit either.

So, for the reasons to leave we have: I do not like the job, I feel depressed, My classes are starting soon and I am afraid of being stressed again (I actually have no idea how I managed to work full-time and get great grades. I was very exhausted at the end of it but yeah).

For the reasons to stay: There is a possibility that if I stay for a full year (3 more months of me being miserable) in the company I will not have to complete the mandatory internship on my fourth year of studies, money I guess, and the fear that I am an ungrateful person, who does not value what they have because some of my friends are working in way worse conditions and get paid less. I am afraid I might regret this and not be able to find anything better. Obviously, some of my friends do not work at all, so idk. Also, if I quit, I will concentrate on my studies and not look for a new job any time soon and I am afraid that the gap on my CV will be concerning and will destroy all the hard work I have been doing.

The question is: should I stop complaining and stay or should I leave and focus on my studies and not get ahead of myself?

P.S. I live with my parents, so I have some financial support from them and they are okay with me leaving the job."
wv1f2u,4,2022-08-22,My Sick Day Rant,goatxking,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/wv1f2u/my_sick_day_rant/,"I've been perusing this sub for around a year now. I've been working in schools since I was 19 years old, when my former high school opened a GYOT program. For the record, I'm in Texas and all my experience has been in public charter schools. 

Today I took a sick day, because I'm actually sick. Usually I would tough it out for my students and to save myself the fake sympathy and gaslighting that comes from my coworkers and admin when I return. The difference this time is that my 2 month old son caught whatever I brought home. For whatever reason, this triggered me beyond reason today...

Fuck this. Fuck school. Fuck education in general, and fuck all the people that continue to support this failing system.

 Save for the 2 years I attempted to invest in myself and work on my small business, I've spent my entire professional life in schools. I started as an intern doing menial tasks, monitoring kids, and selling my particular school's brand to the community. I worked my way up, eventually becoming a TA, demonstrating excellent professional skills and the dedication you would expect from a top tier teacher. When my school's ""behavior intervention teacher"" quit mid-year, I was given the opportunity to fill her place. I was immediately hit with a 25 student caseload- mostly ED, some with criminal records. I was offered no guidance, mentorship, or legal protection regarding the IEP work and was expected to make it work. The physical and mental duress (I was stabbed among other things) I experienced that year landed me in an involuntary hold at a local mental health treatment center. 

Afterwards, I took those 2 years to invest in myself. I tried to build my contracting business, did multiple side gigs, and earned money however I could using my professional skills. However, the pandemic and a job market that lends itself to service work and fast food made finding offers for well paying jobs hard to come by. I had to return to education in 2021 when I ran out of money. I got an offer from another charter school that has a contract with a large district in my city. It has been a nightmare. 

My certificate expired while I was outside the field, so I spent the entire last year proving to my alt-cert company that I was worthy of being re-recommended. This meant that I was doing the job of a SPED teacher, while being compensated as a TA. For a short time last year, I was running the department alone due to the other staff quitting. When they hired new staff, I was responsible for onboarding them. Roughly 40% of my campus is SPED or ELL with around 90% at risk. The numbers are insane. The workload is impossible. Any bit of honesty regarding the situation is met by admin with toxic positivity, or the famous ""if you don't want to be here, don't."" This year has been even worse. In addition to my two intervention classes I host, I also do inclusions for 6 separate classes. I have morning, lunch, and afternoon duty. My planning times have been consistently eaten up by meetings that have no resolutions, because parents won't help us with the plans for their kids. I have absolutely zero time to actually work on IEPs and have never received adequate mentorship for how to do it correctly. I have a 30 minute morning commute and an hour home due to traffic. We are expected to be there at 7:15 and stay until 4. Classes start at 7:30 and end at 3:15. It's too much. Now I have an infant at home, who's sick from something I thought home from my students. The only reason we had sick kids in school is because they have us harassing families that don't bring their kids in. Literally calling them multiple times in the day. I'm a SPED teacher and I'm making attendance calls so my school can get their money. The only people on my campus I see successfully doing this I know are divorced, never married, have no kids, etc. I know I'm rambling at this point, so I'll cut it off here. 

To wrap it up, here's my points:

1. Education has become toxic to anyone who works there. The only people who refuse to admit this are letting other parts of their lives suffer or are willfully contributing to that toxicity. 
2.  The content most of us teach does absolutely nothing to form a competent citizenry. We don't teach kids anything about how their community works, we hardly teach history or science, and the way we are teaching math doesn't seem to stick. 
3. If your child is SPED, they're screwed. There's just too many kids and not enough people who can keep up with the federal requirements to educate your children. Most schools do not have the basic resources needed to adequately educate your child and some kids get all the attention due to their or their parents' behaviors. 
4. I would never recommend this path to anyone who wants a family, or a healthy mental state. Most of the teachers I know are abusing some substance or are on medication just to show up every day. 
5. If you're considering leaving education. Do it.  There are other opportunities for talented people. Other industries need to see why we are leaving and what we bring to the table. 

I'm sure people's experiences vary, but I know my experience has been the same as many in this sub. Yes, I've only been in charter schools, but I'm a member of several educational communities and have friends in private and public schools.

 Sorry in advance for formatting. I'm on mobile and honestly just had to get this out there."
wv1hng,17,2022-08-22,How do you have enough time for everything?,Missing_Back,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/wv1hng/how_do_you_have_enough_time_for_everything/,"I was listening to the Lex Fridman Podcast episode with John Carmack, and man that dude is interesting. He made me realize how much you can do with the same 24 hours that everyone has. 

He's an extreme example, but even with productive CS majors here: how do you have enough time for everything? I suppose a better way of asking it is: How do you make the most of your time so you can get everything done?

For example, I work part time 19 hours a week in web development. I also take classes. I also need to continue my LC grind, and I would really like to spend an hour a day working on OpenGL in preparation for an internship I start in January. And that's just my CS/programming learning-related topics; I have a hard enough time with this stuff. Add on top of that applying, OAs, and interviews, and that's all the CS career stuff. and then any hobbies (exercise, piano, foreign language), social life, and getting enough sleep, and I'm not sure how it's possible. Even if I were to completely cut out the non-CS stuff (which I've done for stretches of time) it's a bit much to fit into the time I have in a day.

Any tips?"

Tw: Su¬°c¬°de

‚ú®I‚Äôm really disoriented right now so if please bare with me. ‚ú®

I‚Äôm an international student from a place where people don‚Äôt really care ab college apps like that. (For context, someone from my country applied to Stanford, and on their admissions file the ao noted that they never got an applicant from this place before.)

In 2020, I was introduced to college apps n stuff and have since dedicated myself to getting into a good college. And yeah I already know international no aid blah blah blah. 

I graduated last year and well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been so fucking depressed and I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit that it‚Äôs over a girl (I‚Äôm 18f and bi). I‚Äôve actually made plans to end my life but I rather not get into that. 

I‚Äôve never had many friends and she was my best-friend. Idk how to explain this properly but I still remember the times when she‚Äôd shun me at school and cut me off when I‚Äôd try to talk about college and stuff to gossip with other people/ she‚Äôd barely listen to me. She‚Äôd go out of her way to exclude me :/  there‚Äôs more but yeah. After we graduated she BARELY made an effort to keep in contact with me. I remember at graduation I was the only person (well one of the only people) with no friends to take pics with and normal stuff.

I remember cutting her off at one point which was incredibly difficult for me. This was last September and I still remember every little tiny detail that she prolly doesn‚Äôt even think about. 

This was the same month I got into an A Level Program in my country. The separation fucked me up so badly that I failed almost all my classes and I now have to redo the academic year. (My failing grades will be replaced by the grades I get this upcoming academic yr) ü´§ü´§ (btw where I‚Äôm from‚Ä¶ most schools don‚Äôt have 12th-13th grade so you‚Äôd have to attend a new school for a 6th form program) 

I was so lonely with no friends that In March (the same month I had finals) I texted her and I got gaslighted _relentlessly_  and she blamed me for leaving her in September when she was literally making me suicidal :/ 

It‚Äôs much more but she really meant so much to me but I feel like I was just some stupid high school phase. Not needed anymore. Discardable. This summer was the worst ever with her filled with crying, SH, Su¬°cidal ideation. Im at my lowest but I don‚Äôt know how to leave. I‚Äôll be seeing a therapist next month hopefully. 


What the fuck does this have to do with applying to college? Well? I‚Äôm fucking depressed.. I feel dead I feel like something inside me has died, my eyes are lifeless. My hobbies abandoned. The SAT practice tests I printed? They‚Äôre on the shelf gaining dust. My sketch book and painting supplies? Catching dust under my bed. I feel like I‚Äôm losing myself and I‚Äôm so fucking embarrassed. Fuck I even had a whole binder folder where I stored a bunch of colleges admissions stuff. That‚Äôs catching dust as well. The books on my shelf that I loved to read? Catching dust too. The things that I love to do? I haven‚Äôt been doing them because I‚Äôm burning in my own private hell of loneliness, depression, and abandonment. Nonetheless I still try. 

Redoing the academic year means that I have a chance to replace my failing grades with A‚Äôs. I have a chance to get help. I even got an internship this summer (only 25 ppl chosen regionally), I got another internship with an ed tech startup too. Both paid. I‚Äôve been working on a research project with a professor from a Canadian college. 

Mayne I‚Äôm fucking trying. Even tho I think about taking my life everyday I‚Äôm trying. This might sound dumb to you guys but idk idk what mental illness I have but this shit feels like I‚Äôm on fire 24/7 just because my best friend abandoned me when I needed her the most. I sound stupid. Y am I even still friends with someone who makes me feel this way. Idk. Ig I‚Äôll find out in therapy next month. 

But here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ school starts this FRIDAY. My internship ends on Friday, so I‚Äôll be going on Monday and guess what? We go to the same school. Im worried. What if I fuck Up the year again? What if she does something that hurts me again and makes me spiral? What if‚Ä¶. 

What if I flunk the SAT this year because of depression? What if I don‚Äôt get better? This year means a lot to me because it‚Äôs the last chance I have to prove to AOs that I‚Äôm academically prepared for college. I really need this esp as an intl _needing full aid_ :( 

Sometimes it‚Äôs just so fucking hard. I keep trying to remind myself every day why I should keep pushing but christ this is HARD. This is just so hard. I literally have no support system no friends no nothing absolutely nobody and nothing no fucking resources nothing. No there‚Äôs no ‚Äúhotline‚Äù or free resources where I‚Äôm from. None. Nobody knows about US admissions. I was called crazy for wanting to apply to more than 10 schools as _an international needing full aid_ I‚Äôm all alone in this shit. On top of this‚Ä¶ my best friend fucking abandoned me lmao. And btw I live in a small place so yeah. Those who get it will get it. 

Ik this was a ramble but ig the point is.. I‚Äôm so worried about this school Year. I‚Äôm mentally sick and I need to do well to get into college. I can‚Äôt make mental illness get in my way again.


Btw I‚Äôve lurked this sub since last year august.. right after I graduated. Ik the whole gag.. Ik academics alone won‚Äôt get me into college but I am also working on my hobbies and ecs that I love. 


If you read this whole thing. Thanks for even giving me the time of ur day. I‚Äôm out. Wish me luck or something."

**My background:**

I have a BS in mathematics, and I'm about to start my 2nd year of grad school studying computer science.

Most of my coursework has been related to software engineering, AI, or more mathematical computer science topics. Nothing related to cybersecurity, other than what is sometimes mentioned in software engineering classes. I have no previous work experience in IT at all. I don't even have any software engineering work experience. 

This summer, I was lucky enough to do an internship in cybersecurity. It was not a technical role, more GRC and vulnerability management. Honestly, I don't know why I was selected for the internship, during the interview I couldn't even tell them what the CIA triad was. 

**Studying for Security+:**

I started studying for the exam late May this year, at the beginning of my internship. 

At the start, I would average around 2 hours a night watching videos and taking notes. I slowed down in July, and really kicked it back up these past two weeks.

In total, I probably spent around 100 hours preparing for the exam. 

Resources I used:

* Pluralsight (free through my company) Security+ - Chris Rees
   * This was the first resource I used. I watch all of the videos, taking notes the whole time. I would make note of which topics were the most confusing to me, and watch more in-depth videos when I had the time. I did not do any of the labs.
* ABC E-Learning CompTIA Security+ App 
   * This was a great resource. After finishing taking notes for one of the objectives, I would use this to test myself and identify gaps in my knowledge. Really great app.
* Professor Messer videos
   * I would supplement Pluralsight with Professor Messer's videos. Hearing things explained by two different sources helped a lot. 
* Professor Messer practice tests
   * Excellent. Started taking them after I finished Pluralsight. I really took the time to review my wrong answers, or any questions I was not confident in.
   * I took 2 of the exams twice. The order I took the exams and their scores:
      * Exam A - 75%
      * Exam B - 75%
      * Exam C - 89%
      * Exam A - 89%
      * Exam B - 93%

**Advice:**

Follow a course, pay attention, test yourself as you go. That's all it takes!"
wv3gjw,1,2022-08-22,What kind of Letters of Recommendation do I need 1+ year out of Undergrad/How to ask for one?,chloecoolcat,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/wv3gjw/what_kind_of_letters_of_recommendation_do_i_need/,"Hi, I hope someone sees this and if you do, thank you for taking the time to read.

Lately I've been considering applying to a museums studies masters program or MLIS program but I didn't plan for graduate school while in undergrad. 

I was dealing with undiagnosed mental health issues that made it hard for me to manage my time and turn in assignments (which I'm now seeking help for.) As such, most of my degree I spent scraping by (mostly B's, A's in my major, 5 total C's, plus I opted for a Pass/Fail, and a Withdrawal in two electives my last semester) and I didn't take the opportunity to attend office hours or make any personal connections with my professors. 

Having worked full-time for the last year (planning to stay at my current job until my lease is up next summer) and now seeking help, I'm in a better mental (and financial) space to return to academia than I was before, and I've found things I'm passionate about. But I'm afraid that my previous lackluster performance and lack of networking will impact my application process (end GPA: 3.213, no extracurriculars, research experience, or academic achievements)

I guess my first question is, what kind of letters should I be looking for? 

I'm currently embarking on a project to digitalize a recovered archive overseen by my main manager, our company's archivist, and a consulting archivist. Would recommendations from these professionals be sufficient for an application, or do letters need to be academic in nature?

I also had a summer internship in 2019 at a local museum. I enjoyed it immensely and I did build a decent relationship with the director. Should I reach back out to him?

If I do need academic related letters, how should I go about reconnecting with my professors? Given the time passed since I was last in their courses and my lack of engagement in class or outside of it, I don't want to just email them right out of the gate asking for a favor (and in all likelihood, I don't believe they'll even remember me).

Should I look into taking an online or community college course and start fresh? Should I try to focus on building more of an academic record (e.g. independently writing items for journals, attending or attempting to present at conferences, etc.?) Or would it be best to take the time to build a relationship with professors from my undergraduate department (given that I went to a somewhat prestigious university?)

Thank you!"

Im 20M from India, currently entered final year of my undergrad (CS),  i have a feeling my profile is not good enough to get into my dream schools (Cs in Georgia tech and Purdue). I plan on going for fall 2023 as soon as I graduate.

It'll be very cool if you guys can suggest unis i can get into with my profile, and tips how i can improve them.

**Degree** : Information Technology

**College** : Tier 2

**Cgpa**: 8.4 (out of 10)

**GRE**: 152V, 156 Q 

**Internship**: 1 (2 month internship at a mid sized company as a data engineer)

**Projects**: 1 good python framework which uses many saught after CS techniques (eg, OOP paradigm, unit testing, static typing)

**Open source**: minor bug fixes in libraries like flask, numpy and httpc

**Research**: 1 (yet to by presented at a conference)

**Club work**: worked as outreach volunteer


I do realise i have weak gre score and plan on giving it again and hopefully score around 320. And i also plan on giving TOEFL in a week and expect a score well above 110 since i have a good English background.

Any input and tips on how i can improve my profile is appreciated.

Thanks"

As a 23 year old college graduate with a GPA of a 2.5, I'm having a hard time finding internships and job opportunities involving my major or any related interests. My senior project before graduation was designing and constructing a modular synthesizer and I'd love to find more opportunities that involve electronics and other aspects of my major that were involved in that whole process. 

However, the only jobs that are even considering my applications (I've only looked on LinkedIn and Indeed for jobs and internships) are construction related jobs because of my extensive experience that's highlighted on my resume. 

I'm also currently studying for the FE electrical engineering certification and am taking the free cs50 Introduction to Computer science in the hopes I can strengthen my resume, but if anyone has any advice on where I should be looking for internships or jobs it would be a HUGE help."

I am thinking about applying to some data science, information sciece and computer science programs that start Fall 2023. My background looks like this:

1. International student with an undergrad major in Econ and Stats
2. Undergrad cumulative GPA of 3.6/4.0 and major GPA of 3.7/4.0
3. 1+ YOE at FAANG as a contractor with software engineering and data analytics work
4. 1 internship as a Data Analyst at a startup in Summer 2019
5. Took some CS classes but never got a major nor minor, which might or might not disqualify me from certain CS Bridge programs

Here are the choices I am thinking about now:

Lotteries:

\-  Yale MSCS, Georgia Tech MS Computational Science and Engineering, UChicago MPCS, UPenn MSE in Data Science

Match:

\-  Northwestern MSCS, USC MSCS (Scientists and Engineers), Duke CS, NYU Tandon CS, Rice Professional MCS, CMU MISM

Safe:

\-  Georgetown MS in DS and Analytics, Northeastern CS (or Align CS), Cornell MPS in Information Science, WUSTL MSCS

My concern now is I don't have a lot of Safe or Match options and it is only getting harder each year, yet I don't want to add a list just because it is 'safe' to get an offer but rather it is an actual school I want to go to (WUSTL for me is a bit reluctant). 

Do you guys have any schools/programs that you recommend and isn't that hard to get in for someone wishing to break into software engineering? Does this list look good or some of my choices are irrational? All suggestions are welcomed!"
wv5wwd,14,2022-08-22,Successful Career Transition Summary,soma92oc,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/wv5wwd/successful_career_transition_summary/,"Hello everyone,

I found the posts of other users who successfully transitioned into data science to be very helpful and encouraging in dealing with my own feelings of rejection and self doubt. 

I just accepted a position as an econometrician in advertising tech, without any relevant real world experience (internships, jobs, etc.).

Here is the summary of my experience.

\- Went back to undergrad for two semesters to brush up on calculus, econometrics, and statistics

\- That got me into a fairly well reputed STEM Econ MA program.

\- I took elective coursework in statistical learning, game theory, Python/SQL/GCP for big data, and of course, lots of work in R in econometrics.

\- I did several ML/DS projects to reinforce my skills and learn independently, and competed on Kaggle

\- I completed the IBM deep learning with PyTorch cert on coursera, and posted two tutorials on how to build neural nets for simple binary classification and convolutional networks for multi-class classification

\- I made three resumes for specific fields (tech, consulting, and general)

Over the course of 2.5 months: 

I made 143 job applications 

Had 11 phone screens

Had 4 technical assessments

Received 2 offers

On it's face, it seems like a numbers game, but that really doesn't capture how involved the process was. With each rejection, I resolved to be better.

\- Was the code in my repos filled with detailed comments?... No, I fixed that

\- Was my github organized, professional, with detailed readmes?.. No, I fixed that

\- Was I blindly applying? Yes, so I started reaching out to other data scientists for advice and referrals

\- Was my resume showing projects that highlight desired skillsets? No.. you get the picture.

All in, this took me about two years to go from someone with no coding, math, or statistics background to break into the field. 

If I can do it, you can probably do this faster and better... but this was just my experience.

Best of luck, and happy hunting!"

I had never quit a job before, and it was quite a sad departure, as I developed a connection with my co-workers and boss before abruptly handing in my resignation for the above reason.

While my dad doesn't disagree with me quitting to be able to study and have better networking opportunities in my career, we had an argument about how I'd have no qualms quitting any job if I was offered a comparatively better position elsewhere. He says that I shouldn't put my reputation at stake for what seems like good opportunities, and that employers would see me as volatile and disloyal.

I'm wondering what your opinions are on this discussion, because to me I believe that changing jobs is the best way to increase your salary.

It is newer than LeetCode, HackerRank, etc, but the questions are specific to data-related jobs. There are good question categories and you can also filter by position.

It's far from perfect but I'll be honest I'm kinda proud of it because it's my first project and I tried to avoid looking up stuff online when I was confused, or at least tried to look up stuff in a way that didn't directly involve solving the question I was asking, more like the concept needed to solve my question.

Also, I know there is a way better to solve for the logic of the game than brute forcing if and else statements, but my little brain couldn't think of any.

I'm currently doing a part-time internship at a large tech company as a software engineer intern which takes up a lot of my time (15 hours a week), so I have much less time for hardcore ECs like science fairs and prepping for national olympiads. If I continue to do my internship and have less time for more traditional extracurriculars, would this put me at a disadvantage and should I consider dropping the internship for now? (The two things I love about the internship is I can save money for the future and it gives valuable experience that helps a bit more with college internships)"
wv8jtw,1,2022-08-22,Trying to overcome self-doubt in my abilities and find my path,Realistic_Disk_8452,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wv8jtw/trying_to_overcome_selfdoubt_in_my_abilities_and/,"It wasn't until the end of high school that I decided I wanted to go into STEM. Up until then, I just didn't have a direction or perform well academically. But towards the end of junior year and beginning of senior year, I started to seriously work towards majoring in engineering.

As a result, I graduated high school with a pretty average GPA without a lot of preparation. I immediately enrolled in my local community college to take the introductory math and science classes. I got through all of calculus, calc-based physics, gen chem, and other gen eds within two years and began the transfer process to my state university for engineering. Inconveniently though, this coincided with the beginning of the pandemic which messed up my entire transition. Ultimately, I had to withdraw due to complications surrounding a COVID-related death in my family

This time away from school was very insightful for me, because it made me think and ask myself why I chose engineering. For a while, I thought about not returning to school, but eventually I changed my mind. I returned to university and as of today, have just resumed my degree progress from where I left off two years ago. The only problem is, I'm still not sure how I'm going to reach the end goal of finding employment and becoming self-sufficient.

A big part of my doubt is that, while I love science, and have done alright in my coursework, as a 22 year old sophomore, I have absolutely no relevant experience to show an employer for an internship. I have no projects and very minimal programming knowledge. The only experience I have are the various retail and food service jobs I worked at, as well as some experience working as a calculus tutor. That's it. I spend so much time just trying to understand my coursework that I neglect every other part of my life. I have no social life, have missed almost all social rites of passage among my age group and countless other opportunities. Obviously, I want to live a more balanced life now that I'm at university, and have actively started taking steps towards doing so, but I'm afraid as the semester progresses, I won't be able to handle it and wind up reclusive again, only focusing my time and energy on school and passing my classes.

I guess my biggest question is, is it normal to feel this tremendous kind of doubt?! Am I overthinking? What are some tips for not getting too burnt out and focusing on things outside of coursework that could look appealing to an employer?"

What are the skills and to what level do good companies expect a good SWE/SDE with this much exp should know so they they‚Äôd hire em. 

My strength is Python. Other skills are Java, MySQL, R (boring af but easy), Linux (still learning) and systems design (obv learning still cos it comes with more exp). 

Now, let‚Äôs take Python for example since that is my greatest selling point. If I want to be hired by a good company, how much Python should I know and what all should I be able to do with ease and/or with little difficulty ? 

Lastly, what all other things I can do to improve overall (including current skill set and etc)  ? I know lc is there but I think one gets better in that with practice and answering the Python part would also answer this one too.

We can at least get into 1 of 900, can't we? We basically have 99.9% chance of success at that point. Failure isn't even a possibility, once you consider achieving last place to be a resounding success. 

Maybe it's okay to settle for less, especially if that means not living in a constant state of panic and dread over the future."

Maybe it's \*okay\* to work for a mid-tier or even shit-tier company. According to Levels, there are Over 900 companies willing to pay more than minimum wage to interns. We can at least get into 1 of 900, can't we? We basically have 99.9% chance of success at that point. Failure isn't even a possibility, once you consider achieving last place to be a resounding success.

Maybe it's okay to settle for less, especially if that means not living in a constant state of panic and dread over the future."

A couple Java/CS courses and I barely know arrays. 

Now in my internship, I'm placed as a QA engineer in the backend portion of our applications, working with APIs, automation testing, writing scripts, etc. There's a bunch of tools I've never used or seen before, in languages I'm not proficient in. Jira, TestRail, Jenkins, bitbucket, selenium, ReadyAPI.  
 I've tried watching videos on Selenium for beginners, soap vs. rest APIs, etc. but it's all a little difficult to grasp and really dive deep into. It's not something I'm necessarily passionate about but I would love to get converted into a full time position and hopefully move up into Cyber Security later on with more experience.  


Is there any advice someone could give to help get a grasp of everything?  
Anything is appreciated!"
wvfo2m,0,2022-08-23,How do I help my friends get started with programming?,ResolutionKey8502,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/wvfo2m/how_do_i_help_my_friends_get_started_with/,"I'm a CS major and I'm trying to get some friends to start learning programming. I think it'll be good for them to start before applying for internships because they can make side projects to see what they're interested in. A few years back, my parents got me into programming, and that's how I knew I wanted to do CS. My friends know that almost all of my programming knowledge is self-learnt, so they sometimes ask me for help and tips.

They have also shown interest in some stuff I do (mostly web dev and a little data science) and are always amazed by things I show them and always say they wish they could do what I can. I have said that I can help them get started and they can come to me when they run into issues. 

So both wanted to get started with web development, so I send them a video to watch. It was one which I watched too, so it definitely could benefit them. But it's been a few weeks, and it seems like they never have time. 

Is there anything I should do different to make it easier for them to get started? I am very open to sitting with them from time to time and doing things together, but the reason I didn't suggest that yet is because I want them to get started on their own and rely on themselves. When I started programming, I really had no one to ask for help. I'm glad I didn't because now I know how to best phrase my Google searches.

So does anyone have experience in teaching and know how I can make it easier for them to get started?"
wvfoc1,8,2022-08-23,The way employers feel entitled is SICKENING!!!,miiidragunx,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/wvfoc1/the_way_employers_feel_entitled_is_sickening/,"Okay, 

I know I come on here a lot and make statements about jobs, job interviewers, and experiences that I have experienced. The only place I want to come and express myself is here on reddit because it's just a more realistic environment than any other social media platform and I love hearing other peoples perspective whether it is negative or positive. 

Anywho, 

I was looking for jobs in the process because I do currently have one that is super part-time I mean like I only get about 3hrs because it is an intern position and I only go every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday. However, I enjoy it because it is in my field and I am gaining the experience and exposure I need, but obviously I have to live as well. ALSO, this job requires you to either bring your own materials or use the BULLSHIT that is there and I decided to bring my own materials of quality which I am paying for out of pocket which was NOT an issue when I had a second job. Due to my car accident I could no longer work two jobs and I decided to work here and that cut my funding for bringing materials, therefore, I provided them and would give my receipts to the director of the company and receive reimbursement, which has been a HUGE problem because he would either forget and I would have to remind him constantly. I just got tired of it and began looking for jobs and I lucked up on a job that pays extremely well and I will be full-time

However, I start this week and I did not expect to start so quickly but hey it's a job that I am in dire need and I informed my former boss about it today and she was not having it. I told her that I could still come in tomorrow but afterwards I will no longer be working there and I apologized for not letting her know sooner and I should've gave her a heads up which I acknowledge and did not dismiss. As I was trying to talk she kept cutting me off and being extremely rude and saying things like, ""  I pay you on time all the time and for you to do this to me, how could you!! and how she believes in karma and etc. That did not sit well with me and I told her I did not respect the way she handled this and for her to be a yoga instructor you would think since they are all about "" ENERGY"" the response would've been a bit more intelligent, but you know sometimes that shit is an ACT!!!! So now, I had to use palo Santo to  protect my energy and cleanse because I feel like she is trying to mess with my energy and that is honestly scary!

 How can an employer speak to someone like this? She is going to get her karma tomorrow because I am not showing up to work --- and I do not give not one fuck because she could've approached the situation much better but you know people process their emotions differently which is a true reflection of themselves as a person. I did not deserve that because I have always showed up on time for my sessions and received compliments doing so! she's a phony and I do not want any parts of her or the job!  you are not God and never will be .. three hours for each day I worked is not fucking worth it. suck my d\*\*\*k! 

I am done."

I'm interested in research in computational biology, so I was planning to go for a PhD after I graduate, since I believe a PhD would eventually be necessary to advance in my career, be it in academia or industry. Would you agree?

I'm also considering getting a year of industry experience before starting my PhD. I'm unsure whether I will continue in academia or switch to industry, but I'm leaning towards industry as of now. This year I will be interning at an academic lab for 9 months, and I've done two summer internships at academic labs before, so I have some experience in academia.

Here's why I think a year or two of industry experience might help:
1. I will get an idea of the skills required in industry, and will be able to work on them during PhD. 
2. I might be able to collaborate with industrial labs during PhD.
3. My choice of project, PI and university will be more informed.
4. I'll pay off my undergrad education loan (the loan is not much), and I'll have some savings before I start PhD. 

What do you all think? It would be great if you could share your thoughts and experiences. Thanks!"

I don't want to summarize the entire industry, but does this imply that employers don't really care if you lack the technologies they use because they expect you to learn those things on the job? So instead, they would care more about your general knowledge?

I'm asking because I've been working on a personal project for over a month or two now and I believe it will be very effective at showing my programming ability, but it is written in technologies (Golang, gRPC, mongoDB, planning to incorporate redis and python) that are most of which, rarely used in my area. Job postings request more traditional stuff like .NET, javascript, and SQL.

I have other projects that use those things, but I'm curious how much less appeal this project would have to employers that use none of those technologies. Thank you for reading."

Looking for some feedback on my profile, currently working on applications for R1.
*Would also be amazing to have some insights on what should i focus on in the essays...*



**Work experience:**
Went straight to MBB (Italy) after my master degree, where I've been working for 2 years (3 at the time of matriculation) - worked on telco, manufacturing and banking for Italian and international clients - about to move to India for 6 months for an office short transfer



**Academics:**

* 3.9G GPA (3.7UG) in Control Engineering from the top Italian Engineering school (among top 10 in Europe and top 15 in the world), graduated with honor 

* double degree from the second Italian Engineering school in Mechatronic Engineering, graduated with honor 

* 6 months exchange in Japan (lot of lab activities) 



**Extracurriculars:**

* Active participation in the social events organization for my company

* Volunteering during Covid emergency (full-time procurement and delivery of groceries for people with financial needs)

* Elected student representative for two years in my double degree program

* Joined a student consulting association where I worked on projects for both my University and external clients (also designed and organized two editions of a university-wide event with 500+ attendees focused on communication design)

* 6 months ""internship"" in a FabLab (3D printing, Arduino and stuff) 

* Tutoring of mid and high school students with difficulties in math, physics and science for over 3 years (4-6 hours a week)

* Semi-professional swimming (long time ago unfortunately)



**Why and goals:**
Truly believe that an MBA will have a lot of impact as I never received proper business education; post-mba I would love to find a job in the tech field (strategy, business development, project management) - maybe after some more years in MBB?





**Reach:** HBS, Stanford

**Target:** MIT

wvp8dw,1,2022-08-23,How do you judge if intern should not get a return offer?,CaseOfInsanity,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wvp8dw/how_do_you_judge_if_intern_should_not_get_a/,"I've been coaching this intern for several months now.

In terms of soft skills, I'd say he is above average. He gets along with colleagues really well and confidently presents himself to senior management in conversations.

However, his coding skills leave tons to be desired.

It's totally understandable to have gaps in knowledge that need to be taught.

For example, there are many basic concepts that he didn't know when he first started such as interface in OOP.

And there are times when I asked him to change something in the code in code reviews. Despite explaining how to do the code change more than twice, his next commit still doesn't do what I asked him to do. Another time, I spent days with him going through an existing git repository to help familiarise him with how the application in the repo works. Yet he still had no idea when he encountered a bug and deferred all troubleshooting to a more senior dev.

I can tell he has improved somewhat over those several months. And he does try to work on his feedback somewhat. Like I recommended a book on coding patterns and he picked it up right after the meeting.

But now there's only 3-4 months left before the end of the internship. And I think his skill level would be that of a struggling junior dev. (There are some junior devs at work who are also shocking too. But that's another story)

For example, you would expect a junior dev to at least have basic troubleshooting skills to look at unfamiliar code, understand the coding pattern (e.g. how values were passed from a config file using dependency injection), and replicate it in his own code. Instead of saying ""actually I couldn't understand what the code does. So I did things my way which doesn't follow the standards implemented in the rest of the codebase""

Though I don't know full details of past return offers at my company, it seems virtually all interns who wanted to stay got a return offer. I heard this year, things may be a bit different and return offer may not be available to all interns. But that's not confirmed yet.

So I am trying to be prepared so that there's no surprise for the intern when the time comes."

wvu8bj,14,2022-08-23,Best Way to Get Into GIS? (Particularly Working With Wildlife and Conservation),classicalgibbons,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/wvu8bj/best_way_to_get_into_gis_particularly_working/,"Hello GIS community!

First, just some quick background about me. I have two bachelor's degrees, one in Biology and one in Software and Information Systems. I started out wanting to do web development, but over time I feel like I might not be fulfilled in that line of work. I love science and especially Wildlife Biology and conservation topics, but I do also enjoy programming.

I have done Biology field work with sea turtles and piping plovers, and while I really enjoyed the work, it is seasonal, it is difficult to get a permanent position and honestly I've gotten tired of living with random people and want to have a place of my own.

I think GIS is a great way for me to combine my two passions and skill sets and to help the Earth.

I am working on completing a bootcamp in Web Development, so my Javascript and general programming skills are refreshed and fairly decent at this point. My next goal is to start learning Python and then R as I know they are important in GIS work.

My final goal would be to get a GIS job with the National Park Service or another environmental agency and (preferably) be able to go out into the field on occasion and maybe even get to work with drones and drone data in the future. I would like my work to benefit wildlife and conversation, and an extra plus would be to work in a coastal area.

My question is, what is the best way for me to break into the GIS field and complete my goal? I have been looking and see that there is an online GIS graduate certificate at NC State that seems to fit my needs. 

Is this worth the effort and money or should I focus on learning on my own and getting a GIS internship? I've seen a few GIS internships on some conservation sites I check. How did you get into the GIS field?

Also, do you all have any questions you would recommended me asking about the graduate certificate if I was to go that route?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for any insights you can provide, I truly appreciate it!!"

I've always loved computers and over the years I've started to really examine them and how they work, troubleshooting issues and learning about what else makes a computer run like networks and other IT related things. I don't have any formal training or certs rn. I was exposed early in the IT world. My uncle who's a sys admin was able to let me shadow him for a day  and it was my first real look at how an IT department functioned &amp; I loved what I saw. (I was on good terms with my high school IT department but I wasn't  able to really spend much time there seeing how things worked.) We cloned drives and made rounds regarding tickets and it was great. I left that day feeling like I knew what career I wanted but I didn't know what specific area I wanted to pursue. My next break came when my experience and connections got me an unpaid internship at my local school district since I knew a few people and I was tasked with helping kindergarten age children with using ipads to type their names &amp; helping them plug in headphones. I was able to meet more senior IT staff but I wasn't able to work with any real equipment like servers or networking equipment. After a few months of that, I left since things weren't challenging enough. I then moved on to selling electronics at a big box store during the lockdowns before leaving for university. My senior year at the university landed me a paid job working as a student technician troubleshooting classroom remote learning equipment. An email had popped into my inbox saying that the IT department needed student workers and I  jumped at the chance. Most days were slow but my boss was super cool and laid back and let me hang out with him while he did equipment replacement.  I graduated university and now I have no idea where I should start when it comes to what path I should take. I tried using  indeed for jobs and I nearly got a job. I was in the final round of interviews but I ended up not getting the job. I posted that experience here assuming I'd get the position but it didn't work out so now I'm stuck. I've looked into the following positions: Sys admin, network engineer and maybe cyber security. I love that the pay is great, especially if I move back into the city. I'm not sure what I should do  so I'm asking here to get insight. Also if anyone here works as a sys admin, network engineer or in cyber security could you share what your experience is like? 

Thanks."

I also have a few Teaching Assistant roles.

I'm not sure which ones to prioritize on my resume. My previous resumes were all 2 pages long, so maybe I should cut to 1 page and prioritize the most relevant work experiences.

Should I remove all my part time roles? In the past I listed them separately - 1 section for ""Internship Experience"" and another for ""Work Experience"". I see how that could be confusing. Should I combine all these into one section? But then my internship experiences could be hidden by the less relevant part time jobs.

Another question: I've had 2 internships with Company X, and 1 with Company X Subsidiary. Should I list these together as one experience? What about the dates - should I just add the Start-End YYYY three times in the date section? Or list them separately, eg. Company X separately from Company  X Subsidiary?

I am currently a master's student at a decent UC school for CS. I have a physical disability and for the past years, I was not able to get internships at medium to bigger companies due to my disability as well as my mental issues. So all I interned at was the no named unpaid remote internships where I feel like I am not learning anything. Last month, a Fortune 500 company sent me an email regarding my application for the software engineer internship that I applied for (I didn't even remember) and set up the interviews. Everything went well. And I got the offer. However, the only downside is that school starts next month and that internship requires full time commitment (40hr/week). Should I take a gap quarter and do this internship? I feel this is a good opportunity for me to get a taste of working in a larger organization. Plus it is remote and paid.  Can I hear your opinions? Should I take a quarter off for the internship?"

I don't mean this in a ""if you enjoy it u should do it kind of way"" cuz I am going to do it regardless, I'm just unsure of whether its worth the time commitment now for college apps or if it won't add value and I should push it to later

the 10 I was thinking of listing, please lmk if I should swap out some I have no clue

2. *Researcher @ award winning NPO*
3. *Research @ Organization*

Now that I have completed my engineering (without failing once), I want to go for the CS program in the master's level education. 

I have done some coding projects on my own in respective languages but I don't have any internship or job experience.

wwalim,1,2022-08-24,BFF and I have clearly grown apart and I'm worried that the clashes in our personalities are hindering our support for each other,nugratz,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wwalim/bff_and_i_have_clearly_grown_apart_and_im_worried/,"Early this month I finally decided to escape my abusive parents. I was working on temporary housing solutions and my friend convinced me to come stay at her old place. to note - I never asked her if I could stay there, she offered cuz she wasn't living in her old apartment since she moved into her bfs place a few months back so she had a free available bedroom.¬†

For more context, this is someone I've known for 19 years and has always called me her BFF and vs versa. I guess when I came down I expected more than just physical support (housing) but also some regular friendship activities?? I actually had a temporary housing solution for a petsitting gig in PA. I told her about it and that if I was gonna be a burden I‚Äôd be fine with that living situation even though I would be isolated. She was adamant about me coming down here cuz she says she misses me and thinks it's best I stay in state for job interviews/school. I recently completed a research internship and have been in the process of looking for full-time salaried positions while I locate permenate housing. 

Since being here this month we've hung out very little and the few times we have I had to low-key beg her to hang out. I'm not gonna go to great lengths here about the situation with my parents...That kind of conversation is for a close friend, but we spent only 30 mins discussing the situation before she voluntarily decided to go in early to work due to a ""milk crisis"". Within that conversation, she went into full mom-mode and just started lecturing me about financial and situational setups' that I was already aware of. The other few times we hung out we primarily focused on her: struggles with her sister, work, and her relationship. Friendships are reciprocal so I'm happy to talk about her life too. I'm also the kind of person who struggles with opening up emotionally so if someone switches the conversation about themselves I probably won't try to talk about me again.

And that's fine...really. I have a therapist, if she doesn't want to extend any emotional labor I get it. But I would appreciate some distraction from what I assumed were basic friendship expectations of being there for each other when things are extremely difficult. When she was a teen, she faced a multitude of issues with self-harm, ED, and similar family struggles. I spent a vast amount of time during that period checking in with her and trying to gently promote healthy coping skills. I never once treated her like a burden or played devil's advocate while she was struggling with severe mental health issues. 

Of course, my life has not been easy as well but I try to keep my struggles private. However, after uprooting my entire life and finally having the guts to escape an extremely unhealthy living situation I realized that I would need to reach out to my social circle for support. So even though my friend's schedule was fairly busy I thought she's want to make some time to do some activities when she was free and seemingly wanted me to visit. Apparently, this was an unexpected request. Now I'm worried I'm being too needy and demanding of her time. I don't really have anyone to talk to irl in this area and I thought she would make it a little more of a priority to hang out with me. She does have a hard job as a barista and is in the process of moving her things to her boyfriend's place so I wasn't expecting to do a lot but truly it's been a limited amount of interactions and more roommate ones at that.

So she's been pretty much doing her own thing and I've been busy as well with job applications, online learning courses, and searching for permanent housing most of the day. So maybe she figured I'd be doing that stuff 24/7 cuz we obviously had some miscommunication initially about my two-week stay at her place. I can tell she's irritated about me trying to insert myself into some of the plans she already had in place. There was a small party that she went to yesterday and I tried to subtly see if I could tag along and that was shot down QUICKLY...like didn't even bother checking with the host if it was ok. A few days ago when I knew she had a free day I asked if we could hang out but she wasn't sure cuz she might be seeing another friend and the concept of all of us hanging together wasn't even an option even though I knew this other friend. She also had plans to make dinner for her boyfriend most nights. Here I was more understanding cuz I'd be the 3rd wheel and he hates me but also I'm trying to save money so I haven't eaten much in two weeks and she hasn't offered to cook us dinner once even though she's a skilled chef and usually loves to provide snacks for friends and coworkers.

I've been throwing out suggestions for things to do while I'm here (basically begging her to do something: go to a movie, get brunch, stay at her old place and just chill with me and her dog) **YES I'VE BEEN PETSITTING AND DOING MOST HOUSEHOLD CHORES IN EXCHANGE FOR LIVING HERE SHORT-TIME!!**¬† I've also offered to help her pack and bring anything she needs at work. Her free time isn't too extensive and I can tell I'm a LOW priority rn. She offered to hang out with me once, does not want to include me in any activities and overall I get the sense that she finds me tiring and annoying.

This could be contributing to my clear apprehension of her bf. She's 21 and he's 41 and from what I've seen there are a LOT of red flags beyond the age gap. Like the fact he didn't have any furniture...hasn't dated since college and is at a very different intellectual level than her. I did gently address some of my concerns about her relationship situation to her and also that I didn't like that her bf promoting ED-style dieting and his overall mansplaining attitude. We've both struggled with ed‚Äôs and she admitted privately that she was upset with his fad diet trends and that he can be hard-headed in his opinions. 

But with all that being said...I'm fucking pissed. I hate that I spent most nights alone in her bedroom crying and only being able to rely on virtual friends when what I'd really appreciate is some bonding time with someone who I care about and thought cares about me. From what I'm gathering her letting me stay here is more out of obligation from the things I've done for her and long friendship history. TBH if we just met today we‚Äôd probably not be friends because our personalities are pretty different. 

I'm currently in crisis mode and scared to lose any more people I care about but the way she's been treating me is making my mental health situation somehow worse. And towards the end of my stay (which I'm leaving even earlier than anticipated) we've already had a few discussions about the reciprocity in friendship and while she appreciated me for communicating that, she hasn't really apologized for anything. I only have like five other friends so I'm hesitant to lose another one but the person she is when she's in a relationship, is honestly a terrible and my dry humor and snarkiness are clearly offputting to her. 

I'd like to figure out a way to maintain the longest friendship I've ever had but it seems like a chore for her to hang out with me and this kind of dynamic is just going to cause more conflict in the long run. Ideally, I'd like to have a long discussion with her to address this so we can better understand each other's perspectives. However, I'm not even sure she'll give me the time of day."

Yes owe cause his money is his money and my money is my money and since we are not married we don't share a bank account. 

Yesterday me (25f) and my parter (26m) were in bed and he asked me if I got paid Monday. I said yeah but  that I had to buy some clothes for my upcoming internship. I told him I find it weird for him to ask me about it cause he never ever did. 

He always waited for me to give it back or for me to mention it. He always had more money than me due to his jobs or easyness in life.  For example  I had bills to pay and food to buy for the house and he never had to do that. Up to very recently his parents bought his clothes and all. He mostly had full-time jobs and I had part time jobs. Because of my money shortness he would often give me some 
 Either for our vacations or cause I truly needed it. And I ALWAYS gave it back.  Sometimes I would take some months but I always gave it back. Never once he got upset and always understood my situation. 

S√≥ when he questioned me I was taken back by it. He also mentioned that he gave me x amount for my dog's fur trimming (was an emergency) and that I was supposed to give him the change but didn't.  I explained that I was kinda hoping for him to have the next day off and spend it on trash food. But then I apologized and gave it back on the day cause I realized I was being a dumb dumb. Yesterday he told me that he only asked for it cause on said day he was meh and stressed (dogs trimming day was extremely stressful) and that he was just petty. 

Friday I get paid and even tho the original plan was for me to get a job after the internship and then pay him back I will pay him sooner so that we don't fight over money again.  But I really didn't like that he mentioned that and this never ever happened before... We have been together for 6years and I am currently living with him and his parents so it's not like I will get up and run without paying. 

Should I be worried?... 


Edit : we had an agreement about said money and when I would give it back. 

Also I will talk with him tonight about it.  Thanks everyone 
Tl;dr: my 6 years partner is now asking me to return his cash.  He never did this. I always give it back and this was never an issue for us."

wwh8fu,5,2022-08-24,Need help squishing 3 years into 1 as a student,Top_Drawer_1912,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/wwh8fu/need_help_squishing_3_years_into_1_as_a_student/,"Hi, I looked at previous posts on this sub but couldn't find anything similar enough so I am making this post.

First some info about me. I just started my 5th sem of my BTech last month. I took JEE in 2020 and got admission in Electrical Engineering in a tier 1 college as I had no branch preference at that time, I liked physics and math so I took EE as it seemed closest to it, and also it was the ""best"" branch I could get.

But after doing core EE courses in my 2nd year, I have realized it's just not for me. It feels exhausting and mind-numbing. I want to change fields and go into SDE for two reasons (It involves problem-solving which I like and it pays well, at least from what I've seen).

&amp;#x200B;

Now the issue is that as I had no intentions of switching earlier, So I didn't study the required topics during my first 2 years. So I am essentially 2 years behind everyone else. I have to do an internship next summer if I want to have any hope of getting an on-campus placement (and also my college requires one for graduation).

So I want to get the necessary skills before next year \~march so I have 1-2 months to apply for off-campus internships, which leaves around 6-7 months to prepare my CV for the profile.

Some things I have an idea about like I know C  and Python from EE courses and learned some MySql and HTML (I did a project in which I hostel a server on RaspberryPi and took data through a webpage) but nothing else.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be really helpful if someone working in the same field could guide me about what things I need to necessarily learn.

I have started studying DSA (using [CLRS](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)) (implementing examples using C++) and Operating Systems (using [Intro to Unix](https://www.amazon.in/Design-UNIX-Operating-System-Prentice/dp/0132017997)) on my own along with taking 2 CS electives this sem. And plan on learning  Database Systems and Compiler Theory after I complete the previous two.

Few questions at this point:

(1.) Are any of the above topics redundant in SDE field?

(2.) What else major courses do I need to study other than the above 4?

&amp;#x200B;

The next major thing I want to ask is how helpful will CP be in this role, I have seen some people including their CodeForces, CodeChef, etc rating, and also a few companies asking for the same.  I am currently following ([CPH](https://github.com/pllk/cphb)) as doing problems helps me in understanding algos better but also I don't want to spend more time on it than I need as I have less than a year.

Coming to projects, how many and what level of projects do I need to show that I am a good fit?

Do I need a big standalone software or multiple small ones that do/optimize some niche tasks. What looks more impressive?

At last, any tips on Github? I have started uploading all the software-related class work that I do on Github (scripts used previously, implementations of algos learned in class, etc) and I started looking for foss projects to contribute to. Anything else I should keep in mind?

Please do add if there is anything else that could help.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance :)

My plan is to create a professional looking pitchbook to show my skills.

Graduated in 2020 and my plan was to take the year off and get a full time job last year but covid pushed back my plans and ended up taking a longer break than I anticipated. Started applying for full time jobs over the last 3-4 months but with almost no luck. Even after acing the psychometric tests (Morgan Stanley ones I received above average/ above requirements for all 4 sections) I struggle to get interviews because my CV is mediocre. I never worked a full time job in my life as I always had other ways of making money and put a low regard on professional experience. For the last 4-5 years my main sources of income were: stock trading, a small clothing business and reselling sneakers. All these only took a few hours a week but provided a decent income for a student to enjoy life and travel.

During all this time I was always interested in IB so I learned on my own how to do most of the things required from a junior analyst. I learned how to code for basic tasks such as data collection, web scraping, general things. I can also do financial modeling: DCF, 3 statement, merger models, a basic LBO, etc. I have all this on my CV but I have the feeling recruiters dismiss all this as a lie because of the lack of experience. 

To show these skills are real I want to create a buy-side pitchbook about a battery producer which could be the target of a takeover/acquisition. I have been invested in this company for a while and have extensive knowledge and already used it a lot to learn different valuation methods. The company has no debt and its PPE+cash are 3/4 of its market cap alone which is why I think it would be a good example as its flown under the radar. To finish everything I estimate it would take me a few days.

Do you think this is useful to help boost my CV or do you see it as a gimmick? Also, how would you go about using it; contact recruiters directly or just attach it to my application and hope someone actually reads it?"

One of the universities that is currently an option to me has a new computer technology degree which is focusing in cybersecurity, which I would be able to transfer my credits towards. I have also considered keeping my major, and just minoring in something like language or international affairs, but I'm not sure if that is worthwhile.   


Can someone give me an idea of what an IC employer (private, state, or federal) may be looking for in an aspiring intel analyst? And a quick note: next year I'm planning on obtaining an internship that'll teach me GIS, so hopefully that'll be worthwhile as well.

wwwqk3,281,2022-08-24,Is there no hope to start a career in software engineering without an internship?,Undesirable_11,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wwwqk3/is_there_no_hope_to_start_a_career_in_software/,"Title pretty much. Our school never made us aware of internships, so I didn't think it mattered too much. Now here I am applying to pretty much every _entry_ software engineering position and only one company has reached out for an interview. I tried looking up internships too but they don't want any graduates... So I'm kind of in a limbo, where I exceed the qualifications for an internship but _lack_ them for a full time role. Anyone been in a similar situation?"

A bit about me:

- I have a 3.5 GPA/1440 SAT from HS

- I currently have a 3.97 GPA, and will have taken 2 grad level classes in my intended major (math) by the time I apply

- I have completed an internship at a startup crypto hedge fund, at which I played a pretty big role (built out lots of data analysis tools, was co-managing a team of interns during the summer)

- Am currently interning at a data science startup, at which I‚Äôm essentially doing all of the business ops alongside the founders, since the only people on the team rn besides me are engineers.

- Have some volunteering experience from HS but nothing since college.

- Am a part of 3 clubs but no leadership position.

- Am an amateur programmer who can build some ML stuff in python, knows C++ fundamentals, and is learning web dev.

- Looking to get into research, and will likely do an REU with a prof next summer (we‚Äôve verbally agreed to it).

- Was selected for a seminar of 15 students from a class of 1,000+ to discuss social justice issues and work on papers of our own in that direction, as well as rehabilitate former incarcerated folks.

There‚Äôs a few different directions I‚Äôm considering taking:

1. Leaning into programming and building websites, although this may have a low reward/effort ratio

2. Starting my own business, which would sort of fit in to my narrative I think.

3. Start writing for my school‚Äôs newspaper and try to get work published. Although I want to do math I consider myself a pretty good writer, and have a good knowledge of econ, literature, etc that I‚Äôd like the showcase.

4. Along the same vein as 3, I could start an art portfolio or some other creative endeavor.

5. Try to really excel at math, take more advanced courses, and get a strong spike on that end.

What do you guys think? I‚Äôm no genius academically although I am strong, but I think I have a relatively interesting blend of talents and activities, just looking to go that extra mile to make my app Ivy-worthy."

So basically since going to university 5 years ago my mom has stopped buying groceries on a regular basis and instead maybe does it once a month then asks my brother and I to pay her back. (The fridge is legitimately barren, other than condiments)

Along with other things:

Not allowing me to pursue internships during my summers in University. Along with making up bogus stories about my grandma and how she was about to die, making me panic to come home. 

Making me panic to even be around her let alone in the house. She‚Äôs constantly yelling and making me upset.

Making me pay for her when we go out for dinner.

Making me pay for my own groceries/food then getting upset when I don‚Äôt get her anything. Tonight I don‚Äôt even have any money for food, and there is none in the house, so I‚Äôm just starving. I asked her what se could do for dinner and she told me you figure it out for yourself.

Telling me that she will start charging me rent, because she needs the money and I‚Äôm a lazy kid. (I have a job)

Asking me to sign over some of my cheques to her, to ‚Äúpay her back‚Äù and help her pay her credit card bill.

She is very emotionally manipulative, and just manipulative in general. 

Refusing to acknowledge serious problems with our house (we have had cabinet doors off the hinges for over a decade, she hasn‚Äôt got them fixed, appliances have become over 30+ years old and have slowly stopped working, but refuses to get them replaced. Along with the house just becoming an utter mess.)

-Her hoarding has become an ever increasing problem, with stacks of rubbermaid containers and clothes to the ceiling. There is only one chair I can see that doesn‚Äôt have stuff on it. 

-she constantly tries to suck me into her problems at work (which with my therapist (who my dad pays for) has told me to stop letting happen.)

-she projects a lot of issues on to me and if she‚Äôs in a bad mood everyone will be in a bad mood.

-Blaming/accusing me of things I‚Äôve never done. (Which has been a common theme through adulthood)

-I broke up with my girlfriend, and went to my dads office and started crying, she then came in and told me the shut up. Then kept insulting me when she came home and made me feel small and insecure.


I know this makes me sound ungrateful. I‚Äôm not trying to be, but I see my friends and their parents don‚Äôt make them do any of this stuff. Let alone do anything my mom does. It just feels weird, I feel like Im trapped. 

I can‚Äôt even have a conversation with her without her getting upset or angry about something. To which I said last time ‚ÄúYou are not fun to talk to. I don‚Äôt know why I even bother.‚Äù 

Also we are not poor off. Infact we are very well off and she earns 6 figures along with my dad whom they both own a business. She doesn‚Äôt have any debt, neither does my dad. I don‚Äôt expect them to share their wealth but I also don‚Äôt understand why my friends parents treat them differently.

I feel like she is just trying to make me financially/emotionally dependent on her so I can never move out. 

My dad had enough of it when I was 11 and started living at my cottage. So my brothers and I split time between the two. So I could go live up there with him, but my older brother whom I have a lot of issues with/gave me a lot of personal problems is there and it‚Äôs very nerve racking to be around him.

I‚Äôm not sure what to make of all this. Any thoughts would help. i think right now I am in a very emotionally vulnerable place. So please don‚Äôt be mean."

wx36ji,1,2022-08-24,Habit of Belittling my Work,Pipipomu,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/wx36ji/habit_of_belittling_my_work/,"Drawing has been my hobby since I was a kid and it stuck with me till my adulthood. I took drawing as a sheer hobby in middle school and enjoyed it a lot. I saw myself looking up to many skilled artists, and would ALWAYS draw whenever I found myself the free time after school or during weekends. My drawings were not the best, but it never stopped me from continuing to draw. After high school, I decided to take it seriously but then saw myself comparing my work with other students' work constantly. My drawings were never hung or shown as an example for people to follow. This unlocked my new sense of insecurity. It became something that got added to my puberty stage and hasn't left since.   


In college, however, things were looking a little better. I saw myself learning to draw by taking art courses and even saw myself enjoying it. Seeing all levels of artists excited me and I saw my art was being featured on campus and even went on to win an award that was hosted by campus at an exhibition. It truly felt great and I thought to myself that maybe I am a good artist, just that I'm overlooking myself. However, art courses were the only period of time I saw myself being able to draw. I didn't draw outside of campus nor did I show an interest in posting it on social media. I was too busy with my classes, that I never thought of drawing during my free time, as those times became days to rest and procrastinate. Seeing how things had become, I realized that I was not improving my skills anymore. I began to look at my artwork as ""not enough"", and didn't like how I didn't improve which thus led to hating my work again. The high school experience was repeating all over again. The more upper-level art courses I took, the more I began feeling insecure and judging my artistic skill.   


I saw myself comparing to others' work a lot. I don't know if this could be seen as jealousy, because never in my life have I ever felt the need to belittle others' work, but I definitely did so to my own work. I hated how my art looked and it got to a point where using references didn't help either. I experience art block every day and when there's a rare chance that I don't experience an art block and start drawing, it doesn't look like how I imagine. This then leads to repeating the same old cycle (feeling insecure, hating my artwork, etc.) Now, I ignore looking at other artists as an inspiration because I keep telling myself that I'll never be like them or be able to achieve such a level. I keep telling myself that if I wasn't able to improve for this long, how can I expect to improve just by watching a couple of minutes of videos on Youtube? I don't follow any artists and when I come across artists online, I feel the need to compare myself to them right away. It's not that I despise them, but I despise myself for being this way and I absolutely hate it. My parents never complimented my work and I have always felt embarrassed to show my work to my friends and family.   


Now, 22, I chose to work in the field of art and pursue my career as a Graphic Designer. I just got out of uni, and I am having a really difficult time landing a career. My family keeps telling me not to worry, but they do constantly ask if I've heard back from anywhere I've applied so far. It's been stressing me out since I haven't even landed the interview part yet. I m at a point where I feel like I'm not good enough and that my portfolio isn't good enough to pique recruiters' interest either. I feel like choosing it as a career was a worse decision in the first place. I worked as an intern graphic designer for my campus and most of the clients I've dealt with loved my work. Before I left, my manager and the team told me that I set a bar for other interns who were taking over my position since I was leaving. You would imagine I would be happy hearing this like I did when winning the award at the exhibition, but it was the complete opposite. Instead, I questioned whether I'm even deserving of such a compliment. Almost felt like I didn't deserve it. Now I feel nothing but doubts.   


I really want to improve and I don't even know where to start. I'm so stressed and I feel like it's really affecting my mental health. Where do I even begin now? What can I do to improve and how do I learn to love my work... I sometimes wish I could go back to being the way I was in middle school when I drew carefree and couldn't care less about how my art looked."

I graduated in December 2020 with a bachelors in SE and a focus in AI/ML and landed this job as a new grad.

While I was in college, I had every ounce of ambition to reach the place I‚Äôm at today. I worked full time internships while also being a full time student, and I was coding almost every hour of the day that I was awake. I loved it. I‚Äôd go to work, then school, do homework, then work on solo projects until I fell asleep. I had all the drive in the world.

My entire focus was on becoming a successful swe. I cried the day I got the job offer and worked my ass off, staying overtime and completing assignments as much as possible. Now it‚Äôs been almost 2 years at this company and I feel completely miserable. I hate waking up for work, I feel miserable throughout the day, I can‚Äôt even stand to look at code anymore. It pains me to open my laptop and I cringe at the sound of a MS Teams notification. My team is on our 4th new team lead since I‚Äôve been here and I just don‚Äôt care anymore. I get so jealous when one of my coworkers sends in their 2 week notices, but they always just have another job lined up and idk if I want that. I‚Äôm slacking off completely, I feel a resentment towards my current company, and I feel like this career isn‚Äôt for me anymore.

It‚Äôs sad that I invested so much time into this, only to begin hating the actual career. It‚Äôs to the point where I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I got fired tomorrow. I even make excuses and will call in sick just to avoid the daily standup meetings because I don‚Äôt want to participate anymore. I now take forever to complete small stories and I feel so trapped. Like I‚Äôm unhappy here, but I have this this degree and I got used to the salary.

I just feel like I don‚Äôt enjoy coding anymore. I want to spend more time outdoors and doing hobbies that involve physical exertion. My friends and family say they‚Äôre disappointed by this and they make me second guess everything. Constantly telling me how fortunate I am and that I could be ruining the biggest opportunity in my life and I‚Äôll regret a bad decision for the rest of my life. I don‚Äôt know anymore, has anyone else experienced this? Is it just burnout? Does it ever go away? When does it become time to finally walk away? Is it best to just keep pushing through?




EDIT: I have been receiving many private messages about my TC (total compensation) from this job. I didn‚Äôt want to make this about money so I didn‚Äôt include it in the original post. I will share this information solely for the sake of others wanting to compare and gather TC expectations.

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/vyoqiw/humans_are_cosmic_horrors/)

Clark was pretty sure he was dreaming at this point. Only a couple of hours ago he‚Äôd just been performing his duties as a humble cleanliness engineer. Scrubbing the floors, cleaning the toilets, the whole shebang. And now, he‚Äôd just had a pillow fight with an off-color Ewok. Only to then beat up two more for bullying the first one he'd met.
Admittedly it hadn‚Äôt been the first time he‚Äôd drop-kicked a Care Bear but at least this time he‚Äôd had a good enough excuse.

After intercepting the distress signal they were only supposed to check if anyone on board needed help, as well as figure out which government they‚Äôd have to inform (and perhaps taunt a diplomatically acceptable amount). But now Clark feared he may have complicated things a little bit by potentially mucking up a first-contact scenario. One might argue that beating up two out of three aliens might have set a bad precedent, then again perhaps it wouldn‚Äôt be too bad of an idea for humanity to not set the bar too high for themselves. At least the one he saved seemed amicable enough, if perhaps a little strange. Truthfully, Clark was secretly hoping everyone else was faring about as well as he was in regards to interacting with these creatures. That way he wouldn‚Äôt have to feel too bad about choosing violence so recklessly.

Hell he might actually get his wish fulfilled. Stella had just contacted him regarding a certain kerfuffle going down at where they‚Äôd assumed the bridge was. He would have loved to stay with his new alien friend but unfortunately Stella could get ‚Äòunpleasant‚Äô when people tried to tactically evade her too often. And so with a deep sigh and after rubbing the sleep out of his eyes he got up, waved his new friend goodbye and headed out to go do his job. Cleaning up other people‚Äôs messes.

It didn‚Äôt take long for him to reach his colleagues, only to be met by the sight of 2 of them trying to kick down one of those futuristic looking, sideways sliding doors. While from the other side he heard what sounded like muffled bear-like grunts and squeaks.
‚ÄúOkay I‚Äôm here what‚Äôs going o-‚Ä¶ wait, where‚Äôs Marshal.‚Äù Clark asked to which he practically immediately got his answer as a loud thud could be heard coming from the surprisingly spacious vent above him. Followed by a heavily accented: ‚ÄúOuch, fuck ‚Äòn shite.‚Äù

‚ÄúQuick lend us a hand here will ya.‚Äù Stella loudly demanded. ‚Äù It appears these ‚Ä¶ whatever they are, are trapped and are becoming increasingly anxious. We need to rescue them as soon as possible before something bad happens. Poor widdle fluffles, they sound like they might die from fear any second now. DON‚ÄôT WORRY DARLINGS MOMMA‚ÄôS COMMIN!!‚Äù
She roared before kicking the door as hard as she could.

‚ÄúAs you‚Äôve no doubt noticed we‚Äôve already send our resident doctor and disappointed father figure into the vents to try and unlock it from the other side.‚Äù Stella informed him with a surprisingly calm tone of voice and composed demeanor, which after her previous outburst made Clark‚Äôs head spin.

‚ÄúUm should I be worried?‚Äù He asked while standing behind some debris and keeping reasonable distance between himself and his friends, who management had dubbed ‚Äúthe uninsurables‚Äù.

‚ÄúNah not really, they seem very sturdy and probably haven‚Äôt seen that much wear and tear yet anyways.‚Äù

‚ÄúI meant Marshal.‚Äù Clark annoyedly added.
‚ÄòThat‚Äôs our Stella alright, more concerned about the ship she‚Äôs on than her own colleagues. Then again usually the only thing standing between a human and the dark cold vacuum of space is often a ship so perhaps such a mindset wasn‚Äôt entirely unreasonable.‚Äô Clark thought to himself.

Suddenly various loud bangs could be heard from the direction of the vent at which point the fuzzy little bear-creatures seemed to quiet down and relax a bit.

‚ÄúUm ‚Ä¶ guys, they‚Äôre all staring at me. What do I do!?‚Äù Marshal yelled through gritted teeth from behind the bridge‚Äôs vent. He refused to look away in case the little bastards decided to bumrush him.

Not even a few seconds later one of the aliens seemed to yell something. It seemed scared, an emotion that had undoubtedly claimed hold of all of the room‚Äôs occupants and who‚Äôs control was now growing ever so rapidly.

Like a room full of contractor‚Äôs who‚Äôs pay had been withheld for a month too long, they all collectively began to tear down the large pile of shiny space-machinery. They made quick work of the makeshift barricade after which they streamed out of the room like a flood of fluff and fright. Probably one of the more preferable floods one might find out in the cold vast nothingness of space. Various emotions washed over the humans, nervousness, cute-aggression, confusion and of course the ever so common ‚Äòurge to administer a very enthusiastic and memorable colonoscopy‚Äô to whomever had decided to design the vents in such a way that they‚Äôd be just big enough for a human to fit into.

The Enoweians frantically ran past them and if it hadn‚Äôt been for Jeremiah and Clark restraining her, Stella would have probably managed to grab one of the little buggers, after which she‚Äôd have undoubtedly mothered it to death. All the various dolls she‚Äôd vivisected, melted and/or ‚Äúsplatted‚Äù as a kid could attest to that. Then again, if those Pixar movies were anything to go by, they most definitely couldn‚Äôt.

She huffed and softly cursed under her breath as the teddy-bear like aliens ran past them before disappearing into the distance.

Stella‚Äôs not a bad person or anything. She‚Äôs just been blessed with the general tact and grace of a silver-back gorilla holding a hand grenade.
She tends to be a little too excitable and has a strange affinity for breaking the things she touches, qualities not entirely sought after in an engineer but at least she balances out her destructive nature with sheer talent and stubborn headedness.

Not even two seconds after the fuzzy teddy-bear-like creature‚Äôs cries and shouts had fizzled out in the distance or yet another hairy and unintelligible creature had sought fit to voice his displeasure regarding his current predicament. This strange inhuman creature was of course one of the crews resident doctors, Marshal.
A man commonly know for being as pleasant and patient as a kitchen timer taped to a hydraulic press. He claims to have found a loophole in the hippocratic oath and we all suspect that his medical license may be more theoretical than the tangible variety most physicians claim ownership off. Once one of the cooks asked him if he was actually qualified to treat people. To which he let out an amused snort before hurriedly walking away from the conversation, mumbling something to himself involving the word ‚Äòpeople‚Äô.

‚ÄúUm here you go sir.‚Äù Jeremiah the last of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù said to Marshal before helping him get back into his space-suit. Jeremiah‚Äôs a polite young man, or well more accurately he‚Äôs an intern and so sucking up is practically part of his ‚Äònot-an-actual-job‚Äô description. On one hand he‚Äôs a hard and kind worker, he always runs errands and gets us drinks whenever people tell him to. But on the other he‚Äôs got this annoying habit of never being around when you need him.

‚ÄúSo um, should we maybe, retreat to our vessel and document our findings? I‚Äôm pretty sure the captain would want us to report that we‚Äôve found alien life as soon as possible. What‚Äôs more I‚Äôm pretty certain we‚Äôve already broken countless protocols so I reckon it would behoove us to keep our heads down and await further orders.‚Äù Jeremiah suggested politely.

‚ÄúYeah, sure why not. After all I‚Äôm pretty sure Stella can only carry back so many alien-doohickeys. Ain‚Äôt that right ya grubby thief!?‚Äù

Marshal yelled accusatorily while looking at Stella who was now frantically rummaging through a pile of alien machinery that not even a minute ago had been a makeshift barricade.

Our suits didn‚Äôt exactly have much in the way of pocket space, a problem Stella easily circumnavigated by simply opening up her suit and dumping the various alien devices directly into it. Apparently she‚Äôs been looting the ship ever since we‚Äôd boarded and now after practically shoving an entire barricade worth of shiny new tech into her suit her kleptomania had become painfully apparent. At this point her suit was bursting at the seams making her look like a bulbous humanoid mass of excitement and gleeful mischief.

After having just escaped a brush with death the startled Enoweians managed to regroup in what was essentially a large supply closet. This time making sure to cover the vents (and any other opening however small with stray pieces of cloth. Figuring that Gaian‚Äôs vision was probably based on movement. Once their super secret blanket fort had been secured they began to chat among themselves.

‚ÄúGood thing we‚Äôve got the captain with us. If we hadn‚Äôt followed his advice most if not all of us would have been dead by now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah they couldn‚Äôt even touch us, and not for a like of trying mind you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you see how big they were? Even Maltik barely reached the short one‚Äôs chin.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah the one with the ‚Äòhead-tail‚Äô and ‚Äòchest bumps‚Äô looked ravenous. I was sure it was gonna eat me.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what about the one in the vents I was sure it was gonna jump out and spit acid at us or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúPffft that‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù Gallyth remarked. ‚ÄúThat heavy chested one actually managed to cut me with one of her talons.‚Äù he said while rolling up his sleeve to show off the minuscule cut he‚Äôd gotten from Stella‚Äôs fingernail gently brushing against his upper arm.

‚ÄúI think I saw a documentary about Gaia once and I‚Äôm pretty sure that surviving an attack like that practically makes me an honorary part of their pack.‚Äù he said arrogantly while the other Enoweians rolled their eyes and looked at him as if he‚Äôd just farted through his mouth.

‚ÄúPfft you mean the one they show every year during the harvest festival?! All of that‚Äôs just fear mongering and imaginative guesses. For example everyone knows that Florigators aren‚Äôt real, not even on Gaia, and don‚Äôt even get me started on that whole ‚Äòsea of sodium chloride‚Äô bullshit.‚Äù All pure believer ought to only watch proper church-approved media, won‚Äôt rot your brain as much.

‚ÄúYeah right,‚Äù retorted Gallyth. ‚ÄúTheir theories are just as baseless and outlandish. Like how Gaians can apparently fire up to half a liter of gastric acid from their mouth when threatened. And well ‚Ä¶ did you see anyone melt a minute ago?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell no but‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ um Gallyth, are you okay. You look pale and you‚Äôve been panting for a while now.‚Äù Gallyth  argumentative rival asked concernedly.

‚ÄúOh um yeah don‚Äôt worry. I just um, I just think I gotta lay down for a little bit. Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôll take more than a Gaian attack to keep me down.‚Äù Gallyth tried to ease his contemporary's fears before loudly coughing.

He tried to gently lower himself onto the ground but found that most of his strength had already left him, and so with a hollow thud, fell to the ground helplessly. While starring upwards Gallyth could see all his fellow Enoweians crowd around him. Their expressions had become deformed with concern and fear.

‚ÄúIt must have been those Gaian‚Äôs, they sucked out his soul.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs that scratch, they must have poisoned him. His insides are probably turning to soup as we speak.‚Äù

‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT BE DIM!‚Äù The captain yelled at the murmuring crowd while pushing past a couple engineers to get to Gallyth. He grabbed his arm and knowingly nodded. ‚ÄúYup, it‚Äôs just as I'd feared.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know what this is captain?‚Äù

‚ÄúAy lad, only seen it a couple times before though I‚Äôd recognize it anywhere. My mother-in-law was a priestess who specialized in exorcisms after all. You see young Gallyth here ‚Ä¶‚Äù The captain paused for dramatic effect ‚Äúhas been cursed by the Gaian‚Äôs vile soul magic.‚Äù The crowd gasped.

‚ÄúSo ‚Ä¶ is ‚Ä¶ is he gonna die?‚Äù

‚ÄúAy, or worse. You see if Gallyth manages to cling on to life for more than 12 hours after the initial scratch he will start to feel his body twitch and shake as it grows increasingly hotter. His limbs will grow rapidly to disproportionate sizes. It will feel as if bugs are wriggling beneath his skin. He will sprout fangs, horns and claws. And then‚Ä¶‚Äù  Once again the foolish captain paused for dramatic effect ‚ÄúHe will turn into one of them!‚Äù

The crowd gasped.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll eat us!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll turn us into Gaians too!‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe we should‚Ä¶ you know.‚Äù

Gallyth could barely hear anything as his body continued to be at the mercy of this strange Gaian influence.

It was like torture, pain dulled his senses, he felt oh so tired but he knew that if he fell asleep now he might not wake up again.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry everyone.‚Äù The captain bellowed. ‚ÄúWe need not resort to such ‚Ä¶ extreme methods just yet. There is one way to rid young Gallyth of this curse‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need to kill the creature that did this to him!‚Äù

wx6gtd,114,2022-08-25,Comprehensive Overview on Types of Quants,big_cock_lach,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/wx6gtd/comprehensive_overview_on_types_of_quants/,"Hi everyone! In my early retirement (or sabbatical? Retirement isn‚Äôt as grand as everyone suggests‚Ä¶) I‚Äôve been offering some advice here when I have the time. As I‚Äôm sure everyone‚Äôs aware, there are 3 very common questions:

- What degree/major should I do to be a quant?

- What books to read?

- What is the difference between these 2 quant roles?

Now, we have a list of textbooks and a list of degrees/majors as well. So, I decided to provide a review on the different types of quants to provide a review on that too. I‚Äôve taken a liberal definition on what constitutes a quant too (sorry to the purists/snobs/students who don‚Äôt include quant devs and quant traders) just to clear any misconceptions. I also included actuaries since they‚Äôre the same thing but for insurance really, and why not? I‚Äôve also included alternative roles for backup positions or for those wanting to consider exit/entry opportunities.

Also, while I have friends in most quant roles and have done some research, I‚Äôm not completely knowledgable on all roles, so feel free to correct anything and I‚Äôll edit it to make some changes.

For a basic reference, all degrees are STEM and you can see the post on degrees for more details. Essentially anything in STEM works, computer science works best for quant dev and everything else is better for other quant roles (but you‚Äôll still want some programming skills). As for getting in, strong technical skills and internships are easily the most important, good schools and networking can help get into prestigious firms immediately when paired with the former, but they aren‚Äôt necessary.

Crucial fields to be know are programming, maths, data science, and statistics. Machine learning is needed to get in, but you probably won‚Äôt use it, at least not for a while. Stochastic calculus is helpful and I‚Äôd recommend knowing it, but you will never use it outside of doing so for fun or to understand older literature.

Finally, I‚Äôll do this overview in the comments due to the length, if that comment could be pinned that would awesome thank you! I‚Äôve tried to include everything (bar specific skills/knowledge) that people seem to be interested in as well."

Hello Reddit,

This post is just a rant and probably doesn't really serve any purpose.

I just graduated with a bachelor's in computer science a few months back. During my placements, I bagged a decent offer for internship+fte in a product based company and everything was looking good. Unfortunately, I found out my mother has cancer in the middle of my internship and had to let go of the job to take care of her(fortunately, she is doing extremely well rn and has had a complete response to her treatment). As of right now, I'm not having much luck finding jobs except for an extremely shady startup that is willing to pay me significantly less than what I was making in my internship.

During this time, I noticed a lot of people online and people I know in real life exploit the online nature of interviews and bag amazing job offers. This isn't a post complaining about people cheating in job interviews (Although we'd hate to admit it, I feel like most of us would do the same if we didn't do much throughout most of college and had to figure out how to get a job through placements)

But I can't help but be extremely mad at the world. If so many people are getting extremely lucky, why am I getting showered with bad luck? I don't expect to get lucky but I don't want situations out of my control to screw me over for no reason either. I genuinely feel like my career is over. Nothing is panning out. And this career situation plus family stress has left me with bad mental health that has hampered my learning (be it Leetcoding or learning languages/frameworks or whatever). The longer I do nothing, the worse my career prospects will become. I just wish there was a restart button in life.

Rant over,

Thank you."

Heres my interview experience after 2 yoe. (backend java, lcol, only remote options, not really targeting faangs at this time). 

~70% applications rejected/no response. I only had 2 yoe and no internships, so I wasn't super surprised. I also modified my resume a lot during the process, and as it went on, I did get more callbacks it seemed like, so in retrospect I should have applied to random companies early on to fine tune my resume. 

Phone screens:
Probably did ~20 initial screens with hr, got to a second round for maybe 8-10. Didn't really see any pattern to when I would get moved on. One recruiter said he'd advise a ""strong recommendation"" to move forward, and then nothing happened. 

Coding round:
I prepped by doing neetcode.io. Did around 120 lc problems. Most questions in interviews were around array/string manipulation. Felt more like I was in control of passing these rounds, although a few times I felt like I bombed it and moved on, and vice versa. 

Final round:
Got to final round for about 6 companies, and got offers from 2.

Accepted offer with base ~100k. I'm in lcol, so am pretty content for now.

Misc notes:

Most companies didn't really ask crazy hard lc questions, just typical array/string stuff. Knowing hash maps pretty well also saved me a few times.

Indeed/Amazon had the hardest problems, final interview round for indeed was ~6 hours and involved sys design, code review, whiteboard (djikstras), and hacker rank (fuzzy search).

Amazon started lc easy, then quickly ramped to medium/hard once interviewer got a gauge of my skills.

Unfortunately failed final round interviews for these 2, but was a great experience, feel confident I could pass with more prep in a year."

Context: Last weekend I had my feedback call with the Principal and Senior Associate at a PE firm I have been interning at. In the call, they discussed the possibility of me extending my internship with them and continuing for another 4 months. They told me they fully supported the idea but that they couldn't give me a definitive yes or no until they received approval from higher up. They told me they would let me know by Monday, Aug 21st. It is now the 25th with no word on whether they will be extending. We are still working together every day but nobody has mentioned anything. I want to ask for an update but my Dad‚Äôs advice was to hold my head high and avoid asking since the ball is entirely in their court now and asking would come across as needy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have begun feeling slightly demotivated, not putting in the extra hours, etc. I hate that I feel this way but I'm in a transition period and I would hate to think they are just keeping me along till my contract ends and then cutting me off. I just want a definitive yes or no so I can make the necessary preparations in case. Should I just ask? Or should I just keep my head down continue working and wait?

- Is it better to be somewhat knowledgeable in most fields (web dev, data science, cybersecurity, AI, etc.) or just focus on one?
- Is it better to be (a) an active leader in orgs, (b) join relevant competitions/activities, or (c) create my own projects? I don‚Äôt think I can do all three which is why I‚Äôm asking. **EDIT: What competitions/activities are out there for university students in the tech field? I only know of hackathon and ADSE for Data Science.

2. WHEN should I start looking for internships? I recently found out that the curriculum of my school doesn‚Äôt include OJTs or internship. How do I know if I‚Äôm ready/have enough skills?

3. DOES your school matter if you‚Äôre looking for an internship?

I‚Äôm still a freshman, yet I‚Äôm already stressed

Additional question: I ghost write papers, speeches, and emails for my dad, who is a Head Manager. Is that something I can put/say to get an internship?"

[Levels.fyi](https://Levels.fyi) puts the new grad avg at \[150k Base, 23k Bonus\].

&amp;#x200B;

* My concerns are that C3 AI stock is very shit.
* Strong sponsorship and immigration support are essential to me as an international student.
* Is it possible to negotiate these two offers against each other, if so how?
* C3 is expanding very rapidly, isn't that a good sign for career progression?
* I am expecting a Meta offer later this year when they start rolling out offers for interns. So most probably I will dump whatever offer I get here later. Is it ok to do that after accepting an offer?

Given the circumstances what would be your suggestion?"
wxlm8z,3,2022-08-25,Best kind of job for Software Dev Student--before being qualified for Software Engineer/Dev internship?,Mr_Chaffles,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/wxlm8z/best_kind_of_job_for_software_dev_studentbefore/,"I'm currently a Cybersecurity Analyst, roughly 2 years of experience. It's honestly detracting from programming--I feel. I get paid $24 fully remote, though, so that is helpful, and it pays the bills with only 20 hours a week, living with my S.O. in a cheap apt.

I have an A.A.S. in Database Development (80% of which I've forgotten), which was also a lot of basic programming courses--also which I've 80% forgotten, having been in Cybersecurity the past couple years. I know the fundamentals, and I'm in process of completing a B.S. in Software Development at WGU.

Does it matter what kind of job you have before you can land an internship? Is one kind preferable to another?

Firstly, I did a capstone research project instead of a internship and I'm pretty sure that that may have skewed my chances because it's not formally a professional development environment. I also neglected to seriously apply for jobs during that time, as we were supposed to be spending 40 hrs a week on the project. Since then, I've probably put out about 100 applications in one way or another.

Next, I have a hard time trusting the calls I keep getting from ""Spam Risk"", even if it is a legitimate recruiter trying to reach out (and yes, my resume is on Snagajob, ZipRecruiter, Dice, LinkedIn, Indeed, and Robert Half), so how do I differentiate the two?

Third, since I've graduated, I've only had a total of 2 interviews, both at different locations of the same company, both were for SWE positions, and 1 of which I've not heard back from yet (the interview was last week and the interviewer said that they were urgently hiring but that doesn't seem urgent to me). The college that I graduated from has a career services office that I have yet to take advantage of, should I start there?

Finally, I have done some resume review with my professional connections in the industry, and I've put all the keywords that were suggested to me by LinkedIn (not sure if that will help at all, as when I ran the updated resume through the system again it still didn't recognize the same words it suggested to me). I'm not sure if I should just keep changing my resume until I get responses or just keep it as is because I don't know if it's getting through the algorithm to people who can make hiring decisions.

I've been learning the LeetCode patterns to reinforce what I learned about algorithms and complexity analysis during my degree, and I've been working on my backlog of unfinished projects to make my portfolio look like it's not just full of unfinished projects.

I know I have the skills to be able to produce efficient and effective software solutions, but I don't seem to be getting any chances. I don't want to give up because I've come so far, but I'm getting extremely discouraged and thought that maybe the community might be able to give advice. What should I do y'all?

If you've made it this far, thank you for listening &lt;/rant&gt;"

Basically I need to know If I should give up and re route or if it is realistic for me to try to push through. 

I graduate with a degree in Computer Information System in December but I've only been in Uni for 2 years. I took college classes in high school thinking I would be ahead but that probably wasn't a good idea. 

I struggled through half of my classes and I've worked through most of my time at school. Between trying to keep up in my classes and going to work I did not have enough time to try and focus on side projects and internships. Before I knew it I was considered a senior and I have no experience and no confidence in my skills. 

I've had a meeting with a counselor in the career center but I don't think she understands the severity of my situation. I keep bouncing around doing the things I'm told a senior is supposed to do whose starting their job search but I never fully commit to one thing because I'm too busy trying to check all the boxes. I don't even know exactly what I want to do with this degree. 

Every time I go on handshake, LinkedIn or way up to try to find anything promising I always feel way worse afterwards. I swear I'm on the verge of a panic attack about it almost everyday. 

The career counselor gave me a resume template and told me to use my in class projects but I still don't think that's enough for someone who can barely code, has social anxiety, and no redeeming qualities. I thought about quitting my job for an internship but from what I've seen from my school website there are no openings. 

Right now all I do is leetcode, bounce between projects, and try to learn new languages. I'm really focusing in on sql because I think I may be interested in database design but I feel miles away from a job. I'm also taking some cyber security classes but their intro level and apparently you have to get certifications anyway so that's not exactly an option either. 

Anyway next month I'm just gonna start applying and see what sticks. In the meantime you can tell me if I am way in over my head or on a somewhat decent path."

Therefore, I have started working towards building a research protfolio that is worthy of Top-20 US Colleges. I already have some decent research experience. I am considering applying for the fully funded globalink research internship at UofT and UBC. I wanted to know what value will the research internship add to my profile in terms of grad schools. I can either go to Canada in my Junior summer and do a 12 week internship, or I can stay back in my country and work on research projects that might let me have a greater involvement in the project. It's also important to note that I will be preparing for the GRE in the junior summer aswell. I'm just confused if it is worth going for the research internship (I am hoping there's a good chance I get selected with my experience and recommendation). However, I only want to consider it if it significant value to my profile. Any input will be appreciated, thank you!"

Compared to finding internships, I've found it difficult to sort through appropriate listings to apply to as a new grad. I'm looking for new grad-specific positions, not just junior positions (like, postings that expect a start date after May 2023, and don't require 1-2 YOE). 

I've found the big programs that people talk about, i.e. C1, Amazon, etc, but I feel like it really isn't enough. When I applied to internships I applied to 75+ each year, and that's what I expected to do while looking for a new grad role too, but I just can't seem to figure out how to find the places with new grad programs. 

Does anyone have any tips on forums/boards/websites to look at, keywords to search, or better yet, a list of companies with open new grad programs?"
wxw6mh,1,2022-08-25,Career at a Crossroad,_csyang,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wxw6mh/career_at_a_crossroad/,"Hi everyone,

I'm a first-time poster and long-timer lurker on this forum and I thought that I should ask for advice.

To the mods:  No worries if this post needs to be taken down.  I'm cool.

Since 2010, I've been at a company that is in optical telecommunications focused on R&amp;D.  Our team is responsible for stitching different hardware components and making controls available from these components to other processors where our customer SW resides.  When I joined, I was a newly minted MBA grad (already with 15 years of R&amp;D experience) hoping to make a difference with my ""new invincible powers"". 12 years into the company (now with 25 years of experience), I haven't made any headwinds in landing a job internally where I can flex those so-called powers.  I've gone through a rotation in product line management and I've even moonlighted with their teams, but still no hits.  Then the pandemic waves came and I felt it was harder to network.  After a few months into the pandemic, I decided to take a leave of absence to spend time with my daughter before I had to send her off to kindergarten.  This brings me to today.  I've been on a leave of absence for about 1.5 years.

I got a call from my manager/director who asked if I was going to come back.  Apparently, HR in my company was wondering that, and apparently they would not typically allow a leave of absence for more than a year.  oops...   Hence the phone call I guess.  Something keeps holding me back...  a couple other things came up... and I'm sorry if they're not in order.

1. During the pandemic and prior to going on a leave of absence, I felt that the work was getting pretty mundane.  Even though I was promoted to the level of an individual contributor (one step above senior engineer).  I thought this might be because my director knew that I was going on leave and gave me ""crappy"" work that an intern could do.  My last year of work was really nothing to write home about.... if you know what I mean.  When I talk to my previous supervisors, they admitted that they thought the work I was doing was a waste of talent.  True... I was bored out of my mind.
2. As an SME, there would be times when I would have to persuade my director to take a specific path that all other SMEs also recommend, but I've found that my director would instead take other recommendations from non-SMEs.  I'm not sure if I have any value to the team.
3. I can't find any headway in business-related work in my company.  I know that there are other approaches, like getting a mentor.  So yes I know there other angles of attack.
4. Speaking to my director he wants me to come back to help with at least one more project and then I would be ""free"" to switch to another department (if there is availability and if I'm wanted).  I'm worried that I'm just going to get caught up in the work and have no energy in looking for something else (and feel too comfortable).
5. I've been recommended by others to quit instead of joining back.  The thought was that if I joined, I would feel ""obligated"" to stick around while another opportunity (internally or externally) slipped away.  If I quit now, it wouldn't be so bad because I've been out of the ""game"".  And... I could be burning a bridge if I joined and then quit suddenly.  I live in a small city.... everybody knows everybody (or at least someone you've worked with).  The risks are bigger, not necessarily the rewards....
6. Others have recommended that I go back and slowly get used to working since I've been on leave.  Then look for internal openings since I could leverage an internal network and if that didn't work out, consider leaving after a year or so.  I'd bring in some $$$ and benefits at the same time.  Keep hustling.
7. Reality Check:  I obviously don't have enough years and work experience in where I want to go..  I can totally understand if I can't find that job in my company or elsewhere.
8. Reality Check:  I could move to another company doing what I do in my current company.  Demand is high for my technical field, but not what I'm looking for.
9. Reality Check: As an SME... you stay as an SME.  There isn't anything after that unless you go into different work (business or technical)... so maybe I've hit the limit?

I'm at a crossroad.  I know that I'm needed in the company (otherwise I would have been let go) and that I would be good at whatever I was thrown at.  I'm worried that I ""might"" be wasting opportunities.

Other things in my life:

1. Daughter going into kindergarten.... she's never been in school before.  There is no way that I'm traveling for work.
2. Wife is half study and half work.  Scheduling is tough.
3. Money saved is good.  We think we can live comfortably for half a year and then would need to dip into long-term savings.  We have no debt/mortgage.

What would you do?  Quit and look for opportunities? or Stay and look for opportunities?

\---------------------------------

TL;DR:  Leave of absence is ending, should I go back or try for a job that is a complete 180?"
wxxjse,5,2022-08-25,"Is a high salary and career advancement worth relocating for a year in another city, if it means spending less time with family and friends?",caroandlyn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wxxjse/is_a_high_salary_and_career_advancement_worth/,"I recently finished an internship at a large company (rainforest) and was given a return offer. The only caveat is that I would be required to relocate to a city in Texas for about a year or possibly more for some specialized training, given the specifics of my role. That would require me to leave everything and everyone I know behind, especially my family and my aging grandparents, who I want to spend more time with now that they're both getting behind on their years.


At the same time, this role would definitely advance my career by a lot. I don't claim to be a strong programmer, and I probably wouldn't be able to get another position at this level of company for some time. The pay is also pretty competitive, from what I've heard around my peers (it's around 170k including stock). If I refuse this offer I'll probably only be able to make about a half to three-quarters and my career will probably stall for a few years in comparison.


I have about a week to decide; I don't want to renege on my offer since I heard there's a chance the company blacklists you forever after that. Would most people in my position choose their careers? Their families? Work for some time and leave early? I'm 21 and a new grad ‚Äî does it even matter if I start at a smaller company and have less career advancement early on? Would be interested in hearing what people have to say."

So I'm technically sophomore/junior? I haven't coded in 2 years bc I've been working for two years not in school and I'm worried if I apply to internships now I won't pass a single interview since it's been so long and I'm rusty. Would it be worth it to try and apply now or should I wait until next year ? I'm juts really anxious about the coding interview parts because I've never really been good at coding under pressure like that.

wy01he,13,2022-08-26,is ASU MCS easier to get into than MSCS ?,notMyMainAcc666,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/wy01he/is_asu_mcs_easier_to_get_into_than_mscs/,"

Hey, i plan on applying for fall 23 in MCS. I have an average profile, and I'm scared I'll get rejected from even safe Universities considering ASU rejected a lot of people with similar profiles to mine in fall 2022.

I already know MSCS is very competitive but what about MCS ? Could anyone rate my chances ?

My profile: 
Im 20M from India, currently entered final year of my undergrad (CS)

Cgpa: 8.4 (out of 10)

GRE: 152V, 156 Q (will give again....aiming for 320)

Internship: 1 (2 month internship at a mid sized company as a data engineer)

Projects: 1 good python framework which uses many saught after CS techniques (eg, OOP paradigm, unit testing, static typing)

Open source: minor bug fixes in widely used libraries like flask, numpy and httpcore

Research: 1 (yet to by presented at a conference)

Club work: worked as outreach volunteer for the offical computing club of my college.

And i also plan on giving TOEFL in a week and expect a score well above 110 since i have a good English background.


And Any input and tips on how i can improve my profile are also appreciated.

Thanks"

So I had applied for a full-stack internship at Expensify some time back (6 months back) and wasn't able to clear their challenge round; some aspects of the challenge fell short and I was rejected. Now I'm thinking I want to apply again since  I believe I can solve the challenge in a much better way (they provided feedback)

1. Should I go forward and apply again or will they reject my application just because they rejected me once before? If someone could help, that would be really appreciated. Thanks!"
wy3d0i,3,2022-08-26,"Okay, what just happened!?",Magog322,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/wy3d0i/okay_what_just_happened/,"Okay, without giving too much away, I was hired to teach at risk teens. Here are some of the most bizarre things I witnessed.

1. While still an intern there , one of the teachers arrived to work an hour late, pulled me out of my office and begged me to come up with a lesson plan for his class literally seconds before he was meant to teach! I said, I'm not doing anything without preparation, but I'll sit with him to lend support. The class went fine. I was livid.

2. With practice, under half decent conditions, I sort of got the hang of teaching and taught various subjects. That is a miracle considering during this time I'd been hit on (by boys and girls), threatened, cussed out and had to break up fights (while am intern). 

3. Like I said, I only sort of got the hang of things. Still, they insisted on hiring me full time. Seeing one colleague quit, another was in hospital following terrible injuries in an already understaffed environment, they were probably desperate. The money offered to me was A LOT.

4. So, I gave the job my all. First to come. Last to leave. Always was there to listen to a kid's grievance. Always did what my supervisors told me. 

5. That's when the real problems started. A ton of my stationary went missing one day. Seeing we always keep our office locked, it must have been one of my colleagues.  I found out the colleague who ironically bought everyone new pens the following day, circulated rumors about me supposedly teaching triggering subjects I never even taught. 

6. That same colleague began criticizing everything I did. When, I eventually confronted her, after several weeks, along with a colleague, she twisted the story to make herself look better.

7. I got furious. It probably made me look defensive. Seeing she was there longer, my boss suggested it's best if we parted ways. He half claimed he wished I came to him earlier and half gaslighted me on mentioning the behaviour I experienced. I mean how do you rationalize, possible theft, incriminating rumors and outright lies!?"

The answer is that in Germany office there is no standard procedure about all these, but if the outcome is good then it is definitely possible. The thing is from my observation about people doing internship in FAANG companies in Germany, they are usually converted to Werkstudent(working student), and after that there will be interview again for transforming into full-time. It seems like there is no direct return offers in Germany.

Anyone can share more experience with this? Thank you."

 I was trying my best to learn and grow at the same time, but after the client gave us a task for 3 weeks, he stopped giving them because they wanted my friend to work full time for them and because he was already doing the job he could not commit to full day only 4 hours a day but I was fully happy to do all day because I had promised my family that I would be earning from this month and finally help my family because my father isn't well now and he was the one running the house but now he is in the rehab center and it is very hard without him, I kept waiting for a week more but then my friend said we lost the project, and after that, I was building some portfolio project.

Now, I don't know what to do, there have been many debts to pay and the month's end is near, and I have no job at hand nor any savings, all I want to do this sincerely work as a developer and earn some money but always this kind of shit happens in march too I was doing n internship and they said they would pay 5k per month it is very less but still, I was more than happy to give it my all but after working for more than 3 weeks they kicked me out of the company saying you are inexperienced, of course, I am that is why I was doing an internship at the first place

I don't know why it happens to me always, maybe it is because I do not have a degree, but I have been trying to become a Frontend developer since 2020 now and I have not made a single penny with code, I feel like giving up but after coming so far there is no backing down, I love to code I want to be a developer but now even my family is thinking that I am hopeless and I will never make any money with programming, I read the success stories of other people I envy those who make it but why it has to be me the one never makes it.

I am feeling nothing now,

Moving is pretty much the only choice that makes sense for me and Switzerland seems to be the perfect country, CS is valued there and I'm willing to move, I already did some research about landing jobs there and this sub has been very helpful.

- I switched from a music and premed double major(hadn‚Äôt taken any premed courses yet) to a music and cs major last semester as a rising junior now 
- I‚Äôve only taken the intro to programming class for the major and Calc I
- I go to a pretty good school (top 25)
- I applied with no referral and a few personal and school projects to my name
- I grinded ds &amp; a self study and leetcode this past summer and took a Codepath interview prep course

I say all this as motivation to say that you don‚Äôt have to be the best in the world at Leetcode or have super cracked internship experience to make it, and that you‚Äôre almost there! All you need is the motivation, desire, and drive to know that you will get that offer! I applied to hundreds of places last semester for this summer, got rejected by all, and decided that I was going to take time to study and try again.

I finished my master's degree in Education this year and did my internship in a secondary school with a class of 15 years old. Worst experience of my life, I decided I won't be teaching in secondary school/high school anytime soon because I ended up traumatized.
Since then I've talked with a lot of teachers, old and young, and everyone agrees that teaching now is more difficult than it was twenty years ago, that they have to make content easier for students because they don't want to study at home, that they have to fail a lot of students even if they don't want, that the attention span doesn't exist...
I am 26 and I can only talk about my experience in a rural town in the south of Europe but in my class there were maybe 6 kids who were disruptive and didn't want to study but most of us even if we weren't brilliant we tried to pass, God forbid we didn't! And we attended class in the evenings and payed teachers to help us do homework etc. I had social media as well as did all my classmates so I don't know how that'd be an excuse. Does anybody have an answer on why this happens?"

I don't know what to do, I've been suicidal since i was 16 or so. I've wondered why i haven't, am i too lazy? am i too much of a pussy for it? Is it because I don't want to hurt those who care for me? Idk, I'll go on these internet expeditions sometimes, looking for posts of people on the same boat as me and cry about it, I've read somewhere something along the lines of ""I don't want to die i just don't want to hurt anymore"", I've realized that's true for me

I don't WANT to DIE i just don't want whatever this is.
Completely failing at school, i repeated 7th n 9th grade cuz i never studied and barely failed, rn I'm trying to finish 12th which I should've already but i have like 13 exams (have done 10) + 200hrs worth of classes i skipped because i couldn't get up in the morning + internship + final essay to finish.
I started taking my driving license last year but i have two months left and i barely started, 800‚Ç¨ down the drain.
Working out feels like a drag, I'm not weak per say but it feels like i never actually improve.
I don't have control over my diet cuz yk i live in my parents house.
Likely addicted to gaming because there I'm actually capable competition and it gives me an illusion of accomplishment (immortal in valorant lol).

I have a hard time feeling any type of way towards anyone, i hardly feel like i love my mom even tho i feel like she's a reason as to why i haven't kms.
I was on instagram removing followers/following turning it into a ""friend account"" of sorts and realized it was just girls I'd often have meaningless sex with and noone i would call an actual friend so i deleted every social media i had at 3am.
I've been in 2 relationships, I didn't love them, stopped dating.
There's this one girl i feel differently about which is why I'm like trying to try now ig.

I have no self-control, no discipline, depressed, physically mid, gaming addicted, no friends, would rather have no bitches, no faith, no luck, no help, no ambition, no dreams
The only dream I'd say i have is white picket fence, big house, good wife, good kids, but i mean... the way i am now just let it end already, leave it for another life

I'm not actually gonna kms, i mean I've had like 4 years already I would've by now if i was going to do it myself, but i mean FUCK do i feel like dying, i think it's ""suicidal ideation""?, every fucking day"

I am set to graduate EOY with a great offer encompassing comp that just barely exceeds my high target/goal and in my 1st choice city. I have completed 5 CS internships with one FAANG and some big names and in different focus areas of CS (front end, back end, cloud, iOS, design) The internships were all consecutive with no break in between (many of which were parallel to school). I am having a difficult time deciding between recruiting for something better or just accepting my offer (and relaxing, focusing on myself outside of work, etc). The current market conditions as well as the immense amount of grinding/prep required to recruit is what is demotivating. That aside, I‚Äôm just tired from the past few years of pushing myself to the limit. At the same time, I realize my resume likely stacks up quite well and internships may not be valued much after graduation.

* **Graduation**: May 2020
* **GPA**: 9.16/10
* **GRE**: 324 (161V, 163Q)
* **TOEFL**: Yet to give but I am confident about scoring 100+
* **Research Papers**: 2 published. 1 in Springer and the other in MIND 2020. Both ML related.
* **Internships &amp; Work experience**: 2 years 8 months. 6-month Internship followed by full-time employment at the same company (it's a gaming start-up)
* **Current position**: Senior Software Engineer
* **LORs**: 2 LORs from managers at work. 1 from academia from the professor under whom I worked and published the aforementioned papers.

I have done some googling and consultations from friends who have been through this process and have come up with a categorization for schools to apply.  
Here's my list:

**Ambitious**

* CMU MSAII/MCDS
* UIUC PMCS
* Georgia Tech MSCS

**Moderate**

* Purdue MSCS
* PennState MSCS (vs UMass Amherst MSCS)
* University of Wisconsin--Madison PMP

**Safe**

* USC MSCS
* University of Colorado--Boulder MSCS
* Northeastern MSCS (vs TAMU MSCS vs Rutgers MSCS)

wyk583,3,2022-08-26,Should I learn C++ or Java for HFT?,No_Ice8923,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wyk583/should_i_learn_c_or_java_for_hft/,"Most of my programming experience lies in C#. I'm in college and would like to get into HFT as a software developer. I'm wondering whether I should focus practicing my Leetcode skills in Java or C++. I looked at a lot of job listings at HFT firms, and nearly every single one of them asks for programming skills in either Java or C++ (so Python isn't an option, won't be able to interview in that language).

It seems, however, that if you learn C++, you can easily switch to Java (but not the other way around), although it is a lot more difficult to learn in my case (given I have only mostly experience with C#/JS). Most of the top Leetcoders / competitive programmers also use C++. So I'm really unsure which of the two to learn, what do you guys recommend? I'll also apply to FAANG/big N internships, I think language at these companies is a lot less relevant (e.g., Python is also fine).

I was thinking of both learning Java and Python (because of it's very easy syntax) for Leetcode, Java for HFT and Python in other cases, but that seems a bit difficult to combine the two?"

It affected me a lot, and it made me really awkward in talking to other people. People around me would say that if I lost weight I‚Äôd be cute, I‚Äôd be able to get a boyfriend etc etc so it became a thing in my head where if I could just slim down, all my problems would be solved. 

Within the past 2 years, I managed to drop 15 kg and I can be considered average size now. I still have a decent bit of fat on certain parts of my body (like my underarms), enough to make me insecure to show them, but I‚Äôve been feeling more confident in myself. I dated people and I felt that while I couldn‚Äôt be considered pretty, I was at least a bit cute. 

But recently, I‚Äôve been feeling the same insecurity I got when I was much fatter. I had a crush on a guy in my internship, only to find out he‚Äôs currently pursuing a girl who‚Äôs actually pretty. Looking around I‚Äôve started to realize that being pretty is in a sense the average? There are so many pretty girls in my environment that being average makes me feel so inadequate. It also feels like at where I live, the bare minimum for guys are pretty girls, but this doesn‚Äôt apply for the opposite case. I recently jokingly remarked that I felt ugly, and a guy friend said that I‚Äôm not ugly, but I wasn‚Äôt pretty either. I know that it‚Äôs just a fact, but it hurt me a lot. It feels like I‚Äôll never be happy with how I look unless I‚Äôm actually pretty, and there‚Äôs nothing much that can be done about that. On some days I really do feel like I‚Äôm cute, but it‚Äôs a constant back and forth between that and feeling like I‚Äôm not good enough/I have to work harder for love because I‚Äôm not naturally pretty. I really want to be happy in my own skin but I‚Äôm too affected by what‚Äôs everyone saying/doing around me. What can I do to be ok with myself?"

Having the best start to college is not at all a factor for your quality of life, or even for your college career. Yes, things like major placement are a big deal; however, you are not going to fall way behind in life just because you took 2 STEM instead of 3 your first quarter. You also aren‚Äôt going to fail in life  just because you didn‚Äôt get 5 internship offers your freshman year. The simple fact is that, regardless of your intended major, staying calm and taking your classes one at a time, quarter by quarter, will keep you in far better mental health than stressing over the fact that some computer science student can solve more LeetCode problems than you. Not everything has to set up your career, and not every RSO has to be for networking. Just enjoy your time at first, relax, make friends, and things will come together at a good pace.

I am a self-taught developer based in Toronto. I have been learning to code for almost one year but having no success in finding a job.

I have been very consistent in learning even though I have a full-time job. I dont know what is it that I am doing wrong.

I apply for a lot of jobs and I have given a few interviews, most companies would not consider me after first interview after saying they are looking for someone with more qualifications and experience even though these are entry level jobs.

I applied for the backend internship at Shopify in the past and made it to the final round which was a technical round but did not perform well in it. So, I started practicing a lot of leetcode. Recently I applied for a support engineer job in a company and got the opportunity to interview for it. Everything went good and I got positive feedback from the recruiter after each round including technical, after 5th round (final round) they rejected me out of nowhere.

I feel exhausted at this point and wondering if I am just wasting my time. I absolutely love to code and learn new technologies but sometimes things are just not for you. I feel this way beacuse most self-taught developers are able to land a job within 6-12 months and I am not even close.

I did not join a bootcamp because they are super expensive and last year all of them were online due to covid and it did not make sense to spend 10-15K on online classes when there is so much content on YouTube and Udemy.

I consider my self good in Python and its libraries like Django and FastAPI. Maybe that is a reason as most companies require Javascript?

But most people suggest that I should focus on improving my skills in Python instead of shooting for multiple languages.

I am posting my resume and github as well. Any advise is appreciated.

wyspge,13,2022-08-26,Megalania,GhostoftheSnow,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wyspge/megalania/," All of my research, all of my grant proposals, years of my life and most of my career hinged on this discovery. Days, maybe weeks of time spent hunched over marsupial bones, brushing them clean, cataloging that same type of teeth, counting vertebrae, and examining coprolites for traces of ancient foods. Everything pointed me towards a desolate area of the Australian outback, where it‚Äôs rumored an oasis littered with gold nuggets and opal veins hides. Legend also says that it is guarded by horrible venom spitting beasts of aboriginal legend, or dropbears if you ask any drunkard familiar with the story.

A young prospector took faith in the oasis, but disregarded the rumors. It seems he had some luck, as he came to town one day with a sack full of gold, and a large reptilian skull. He claimed to have killed the beast, but everyone called it a hoax, that he simply found a malformed and dead crocodile. When asked to explain how such a croc made it so far into that desolate wasteland, they grumbled about undiscovered rivers and streams, with one guy claiming Papier-m√¢ch√©. I came across the image by accident, from a ‚Äúfact‚Äù page that claimed it was a dragon skull found in china. Luckily, they failed to crop the original watermark, which sparked my curiosity. I fell down the rabbit hole of reverse searches and fruitless messages until I got a message from the man who found the skull. I explained to him that I was a paleontologist working to find more complete skeletons for megafauna endemic to Paleocene Australia.  

Since I was in Australia for my work, I offered to meet with him, to which he accepted. He promised me the skull was very real, and relayed his story behind the image. He did not bring the skull with him, but did take several clear photos. He admitted that he didn‚Äôt actually kill the creature, simply found the bones sticking out of the ground. It took a lot of assurances that my only interest was fossils, and more money that I would like to admit, but he agreed to guide me to this secret oasis in the center of the bush. With the departure date set to a week, I took up the task to prepare. 

With my gear packed and my truck loaded, I met up with my guide. His vehicle was slightly more damaged than a regular car, but just as loaded with gear. It seemed to run just fine, and it's all this man apparently cared to bring. He already had a camp set up, which he had taken care of the day before. His dog was leashed up at this camp, the reasoning being that the dog needed a night to settle or else he is more likely to be aggressive. The worry on my face must‚Äôve been obvious, as I was promised that he had trained the dog well and would listen to him. He even said he would have the dog secured with its leash just to be safe. Still anxious, I decided to push the feeling down and focus on getting to the site where I would make my mark on history.

We left under the cover of night, the reason my guide gave me was so that nobody would be awake early enough to follow him. I cared little, since I wanted as much daylight as possible to begin my digs. The drive took us out of town very quickly, and smooth-ish roads with it. I prayed none of my more fragile equipment would be damaged, and that I had packaged it properly. Admittedly, I left most of my equipment with my interns at the lab, as I wanted to establish a preliminary dig site, and hopefully make some solo discoveries. Once the week was up, I would head back to collect my colleagues, and the dig would begin in full. Of course, I made a note of the coordinates, as I believe I could petition the government to sell the dig area for cheap. While I‚Äôd technically be telling the government where a possibly large supply of gold or opal is, I‚Äôd be keeping my promise that I was only after bones. 

We drove for a day before we made it to the camp. A third of the gas I brought had been used up at this point. The term oasis described this area perfectly. The loose, red sand had given way to clay mixed soil, with thick scrubland and stubborn forests that made for a decent camouflage. This would be paradise to anyone who found the place, which is why I wondered how this place stayed as such a myth. We drove up to the camp and it was in shambles. The small shack he had built, which was little more than a tin box with wooden supports, had been ripped open. His foods were strewn everywhere and spoiled. The place he had left his dog the day before was painted with blood. Something had come into his camp, and we were sure it was rival treasure hunters. Of course there's a chance some unknown group of aborigines trashed the camp, but my guide was now out for blood. Though illegal, he produced a rifle from a shallow hole he had dug under the shack. Rubble and trash covered the spot, so if people had trashed the place, they wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the firearm. 

Despite the obvious dangers, I assumed that while our attackers might be formidable, there's a chance they don‚Äôt have any guns, making our position more powerful. At least I hoped. But I had come too far to turn around and run with my tail between my legs, and he refused to let me leave just in case I was working with whoever did this. I now had to prove I was not some criminal, but the scientist I was. So I began to dig. When my shovel entered that red dirt, it instantly hit something hard. So I dug more, tapping the tip of my shovel around until I could make out an outline. It was a skull by the feel of it, and so I sought to bring it up. I cleared away the dust, and uncovered a potch jaw. The bone had opalized, though it held no color. Still, this discovery was bound to secure my legacy for time immemorial. And I wouldn‚Äôt have to share a single ounce of credit with my peers. I dug until my guide called out to me, having repaired the shack and set up a tripod stand to keep watch for lights in the bush. 

I did not rest for long, as I was awoken by the loud report of my guide‚Äôs rifle. Then another shot, and then another. Then I heard a scream, and the bush fell silent. The sound of flesh being ripped and torn apart echoed in the night. I almost convinced myself I was having a nightmare, if not for the fact that I could feel how cold the night air truly was. The light from the small fire outside leaked through the planks of the shack, illuminating the campsite. When I went to peek through the gaps in the wood, the light was blocked by something. I could hear it sniffing the air, taking in deep breaths in its search for food. I clamped my hands over my mouth and nose, taking short, shallow breaths. I couldn‚Äôt allow it to find me. When it brought its head close to the shed, I could smell the fresh blood on its jaw, mixed with the meat rotting in its mouth. It took more willpower than I believed myself to possess in order to not vomit. The creature picked up a scent and made a beeline for the cars. My guide had left some food in his vehicle, which the creature found enticing. It lumbered over to his window, and reared up onto its back legs. With a loud crash that set off the alarms, the monster fell down upon the car, tearing into it with it‚Äôs claws. 

The only reason I still live is because those alarms it set off caused the creature to flee in shock. I seized the moment to leap into my truck, crank the engine, and drive out of there. In the soft light of dawn I could see something approaching my truck as I sped away. It was a dark brown or black, with four muscular legs. It had an unnaturally long tail, and the jaws of a crocodile. In my shock my foot lifted off the pedal, bringing me closer to the jaws of the thing. I snapped out of my haze and floored it, speeding away just as its maw snapped shut, barely missing my fender. The creature gave up the chase, having decided that I was not worth the chase. The sounds of the road faded as my heart pounded in my ears. I could feel my body shaking, and I thought I‚Äôd vomit at any second. I do not think the creature would have affected me so badly if not for the torn face of the guide hanging from its putrid maw, stuck by the eye in a gap between its teeth. It was frozen still in some silent horror, a fate I wouldn‚Äôt dare wish upon anyone. 

That is the truth of what I saw that day. My legacy is not worth the lives of my colleagues or the people of the town that rested blissfully unaware of what wretched dangers lie seemingly so close to them. What kind of distance could a hungry predator of that size cover in a single sun scorched day in the outback? How far would a hungry, thirsty beast be willing to go in search of an easy meal? A chill runs down my back to think of the devastation it could wreck, the many lives that could be lost. I can only pray to any and every higher power I can that there is enough food to keep the creature contained. But what if it catches the scent of more foolish prospectors looking for their fortunes? How many must die before such a secret must be made known? I do not know, but I will take the knowledge of this place to my grave, and may God have mercy on whatever poor souls stumble upon that hell lost in time."

I really want to major in CS and get a good career out of it. But I‚Äôm worried that the path I‚Äôm taking might not get me there. So I have a couple of questions. 

1. Will going to community college first and then transferring to UH put me at a disadvantage? I know that just having a degree isn‚Äôt enough and internships and projects are just as important. I‚Äôm worried that if I go to community college I won‚Äôt have access to these internships. 

2. Is it worth spending time on MIT‚Äôs or Harvard‚Äôs free online CS classes like CS50 or Intro to CS and Programming? While I‚Äôm taking a gap semester to work, I don‚Äôt want to be not learning something. Would it be better to take a coding bootcamp instead? And if so could that get me a small part time gig that gets my foot in the door? Could any of these options give me a small boost for actual college CS classes? 

3. Is it realistic to attempt to work 20 hours a week while pursuing a degree in CS? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know it‚Äôs going to be hard work. But I‚Äôm willing to at least try. I want to hear if anyone else has done it and how did it go. 

Sorry for this long post. I‚Äôm just a little lost and want to hear from people who are or have gotten a degree in CS."

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

Essays: 6-7/10 (compared to the average T20 applicant). I am not sure how good these will be, but I have worked hard on them, am working with an experienced college counselor, and will use scholargrade's essay review. So suppose above average, but nothing amazing.

LORs: 5-6/10 (compared to the average T20 applicant). I didn't have a very close relationship with either of my teachers, and I just got a new counselor this year, so my recs will probably be positive but generic.

1. What are my chances of getting into HYPSM?
2. What are my chances of getting into at least one T20?

wyyi45,18,2022-08-27,Tier 1 Banks are the absolute worst,Comfortable_Owl9049,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/wyyi45/tier_1_banks_are_the_absolute_worst/,"I recently interned at a top bank for the summer and after not getting the return offer, I have realised how terrible their culture is. I was extremely ill for the entirety of the internship but I still managed to come in to the office and do my job on time which was well-received by my peers. They did remind me there are support services for my health and if I needed to take time off, I could but I never took advantage of that. 

Fast forward to the review and I received the worst feedback ever! They suddenly had a lot to say about my work when everytime I asked, they only had good things to say (for context, they‚Äôre also using my template for future projects - if I was so terrible, why would they?)

They even mentioned I had no passion for the industry when I was taking my work laptop to the hospital and completing tasks. I never even took a day off despite being too ill. So why is my passion in question?

I am just extremely confused by the feedback received as I had received only good things during the course of the internship. I am inclined to believe they didn‚Äôt want to take my temporary health issue as a liability. If this was going to be a problem, they could‚Äôve told me midway as I would‚Äôve gone home to get it checked (I am an international student).

I don‚Äôt believe it is fair as I had given my 100% despite the circumstances I was in. I feel betrayed and used as during the last week (when the decision was made), they showered with me all sorts of work to the point where I would finish early in the morning (mind you, i was severely ill)

Also, during the feedback there were things mentioned that I had never done / said, so I believe they‚Äôve taken the most generic feedback from others and used that on me as well to not give me an offer! I had asked my team for feedback every 2 weeks or so and It was all good on their end, so why did the narrative completely change on review day?

I am completely disappointed. The banking culture seemed so nice from within so I thought it was comfortable to share my health issues with them, but turns out it was the worst. Top-tier banks portray themselves to be a welcoming bank, but i have first-handedly experienced misogyny, racism, and unfairness.

I am now worried about my future prospects in the IB industry as I love the job and want to pursue it further. I am certain there are better banks out there, but I am worried the outcome of the summer internship would kill my chances.

P.S. I have also told them I have a history with anxiety, maybe that could have been an issue as well? Just don‚Äôt think it is fair on my end, having worked so hard and still receiving trashy feedback - i am confused more than anything!"

wz0jcc,8,2022-08-27,Rage Quitting: aka the thing we all wish we could do,Creepy_Cheetah2105,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/wz0jcc/rage_quitting_aka_the_thing_we_all_wish_we_could/,"Now that I‚Äôve settled in at a new company, I feel like this is a great time to tell you all about the hell that was my old job and my extremely cathartic rage quit.

(These are all fake names obviously)

When I started at QRS Construction we were 2 months into the pandemic and it was the first job I could get after finding myself on the receiving end of the slew of layoffs from my old-old company (but that‚Äôs a different story) and I loved it. It was a small construction company that was focussed on scalability and had a steady stream of ongoing projects for the local school district and contracts with surrounding cities; it was pretty much perfect in my book, exactly the kind of company I saw myself growing in. Looking back there were so many red-flags that I was just too optimistic to see.

The first 8-9 months were great and despite commuting 3 hours each day (1.5 hrs one-way), I genuinely enjoyed going into work; I liked the projects I was working on, the people, the clients, it felt like a family. And just like a family, the boss, Ethan, (owner of the company) would just not shut up about politics.

In those 9 months I was given the responsibility of cleaning up the carnage left behind from a project manager who was truly horrible (now that‚Äôs another post entirely)..along with my newfound responsibility came a $1/hr raise and a job title change. The change in job title only happened because clients felt better having a ‚Äúproject engineer‚Äù running their jobs instead of a ‚Äúconstruction administrator‚Äù.

After that I became the go-to for cleaning up and managing the worst projects. At one point I was managing 16 projects as well as acting performing all of the various project roles associated with them (Project Manager, Project Engineer, Superintendent, and even onsite labor on occasion). I was 12-14 hour days on the regular, skipping lunch, and was still constantly behind. The only time I got paid overtime was the Saturday that I had to physically go to a jobsite at 7 am (which I found out about at 7pm the night before); I did get a small ‚Äúbonus‚Äù added to one of my checks that was worth about 5% of what the overtime pay would have been‚Ä¶super generous right?

Amazingly, that summer from hell was not the driving force behind my leaving. At that point I still loved my job, I was getting burnt out sure, but obviously the boss had to be seeing all the great work I was doing and how capable I was. And surely with my education and previous experience it was only a matter of time before I was promoted again, right? It‚Äôs easier to hire a new PE than it is to find a capable PM, RIGHT? 

The next time a new project manager was hired I justified it in my mind, she didn‚Äôt last long (but damn her personal life kept us entertained). Once she was let go I was once again tasked with cleaning up the mess. It was at this point that I realized that I would only ever be seen as the DTP (designated terd polisher - a term coined by my coworker/friend, Samantha) and started casually applying for jobs.

As time went on, it became very clear that there were two classes of employees at QRS, the people who mattered (generally terrible people, tbh) and the people who didn‚Äôt.

All the while I was also dealing with Ethan‚Äôs political ‚Äújokes‚Äù and opinions. I chose not to engage, it was a lot of ‚Äúmmhmm‚Äùs while silently begging him to shut up so I could get back to work, I had tried to explain that I don‚Äôt like discussing politics and would appreciate it if we could keep conversation away from it. I only snapped back at his comments 3 times: the first was to call out his hypocrisy, the second was letting him know that his ‚Äújoke‚Äù was not actually funny and actually pretty offensive, but the third time was the worst. The third time he made offensive comments about trans people which resulted in me informing him that one of my parents is trans and that his commentary was completely inappropriate. That was the first time I filed a report with HR.

I am so lucky that the HR ‚Äúdepartment‚Äù at that company is exactly what HR is supposed to be, an advocate for the worker. Samantha (the same friend who coined the term DTP) was/is HR and she is an absolute angel who does not take any shit. Samantha was the only reason I had the courage to submit an HR complaint against my boss, the owner of the company. To his credit, Ethan gave what felt like a heartfelt apology and (supposedly) enrolled in a sensitivity/diversity training course. I say supposedly because he was also supposed to set up these same trainings for the rest of the company but they never happened in the 4 months I lasted after that and I highly doubt they‚Äôve happened since I left.

After that incident is when I started applying for jobs with gusto, which is also when I learned that my pay range was in the bottom 10% (taking into account education and experience) in my area, it was insulting. But not as insulting as finding out that the new PM Ethan hired was 5 months out of college with a grand total of 2 years of experience working as an intern. 

To be clear, instead of promoting one of the 2 project engineers (myself and Alan) who each have 8+ years of experience and had been busting our asses for months, he hires a kid (Cody, aka fuck face, aka FF) fresh out of college to manage them. To give you an idea of what FF was like‚Ä¶our first conversation was him offering to make sure that I got ‚Äúboots on the ground experience to help me move up in the company‚Äù. FF never said anything that wasn‚Äôt dripping with condescension, at least not to the people he deemed lesser than him; it wasn‚Äôt long before I started printing up 90% of our email correspondence as a cya measure. His emails were condescending, ethical nightmares, and full of terrible direction that he wouldn‚Äôt accept anyone's opinion on.

Things with FF came to a head one day when he sent an email to a new superintendent and myself laying out his ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù of us. I forwarded the email to Ethan and Sara and told them in no uncertain terms that I wasn‚Äôt going to put up with his attitude and directed them to a folder on my desk (I was working from home while recovering from COVID) that had the printed up problematic emails, including detailed notes. When I got back in the office we had a meeting about the issue that was FF; well, I thought it was an issue, Sara thought it was an issue, but not Ethan. According to Ethan, the condescending emails were just ‚Äúcommunication differences‚Äù and FF is ‚Äúyoung and ambitious‚Äù and ‚Äúhas a fire about him‚Äù‚Ä¶.and because he didn‚Äôt want to address this with FF directly, instead he scheduled an all (office) staff meeting to talk about respect.

It occurred to me during this non-solution ‚Äúsolution‚Äù that FF was firmly in the ‚Äúpeople who matter‚Äù court; he was the golden boy who could do no wrong and got all the perks, despite pissing off coworkers, clients, vendors‚Ä¶no one liked him, except the boss.

At this point I was job hunting with a fury and was in the late stages of interviewing for a position that seemed too good to be true. I was offered the job in the middle of a project meeting with FF (good lord, that meeting was something) and excused myself to take the call, waited a day to get the offer letter and immediately emailed my resignation to Samantha and Ethan. Ethan was on vacation and checking emails periodically..I decided that emailing him on vacation was better than only giving him a week‚Äôs notice. The next thing I know I‚Äôm getting a call from FF, nice as can be, letting me know that he‚Äôs really enjoyed working with me and all the normal platitudes you give your colleagues when they leave the company. 

After the world‚Äôs most awkward phone call, where FF spent a solid 5 minutes fishing for an ‚Äúit was nice working with you too‚Äù, I checked my emails, figuring that the boss had emailed me some sort of response‚Ä¶nothing, not even an acknowledgement. But then I got a phone call, it was Ethan!‚Ä¶who was trying to call someone else and dialed me by mistake‚Ä¶ I figured ""no big deal, he doesn‚Äôt want to deal with that on his vacation‚Äù, in that time I had half the company reach out to me wishing me the best and wanting details‚Ä¶ so when the day Ethan was returning rolled around I was a ball of anxiety wondering what he was going to say, if he was going to counter offer, etc. 

When he did finally return, he said nothing to me; it went on like this for 3 days, the few words we did exchange were about his vacation. But don‚Äôt worry, he had plenty of time to talk about it with everyone else.

It was after a long lunch with my two good friends/coworkers Samantha and Opal that I got the courage to confront Ethan about everything; I packed up my desk, cleared out my devices and waited for him to be free‚Ä¶

I walked into his office with my pile of tech, put it on his desk, and told him I was done, effective immediately. 

He looked‚Ä¶shocked and asked ‚Äúwhat brought this on?‚Äù

So I explained that ‚Äúit‚Äôs become blatantly obvious that the opinions and experience of one group of people count for nothing while the opinions and experiences of the other group count for everything‚Äù and that ‚ÄúI want to make it perfectly clear that I am not quitting because of FF, he‚Äôs the symptom of a larger problem and I‚Äôm done putting up with it.

He then asked me to close the door and told me he didn‚Äôt understand, so I reiterated. Then he wanted to know what triggered my quitting right now instead of waiting.

I told him that it‚Äôs probably because we just had an entire meeting on ‚Äúrespect‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt feel very ‚Äúrespected‚Äù that he couldn‚Äôt even pay me the ‚Äúrespect‚Äù of acknowledging my resignation:

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt Samantha reach out to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course she did, but YOU didn‚Äôt. YOU‚Äôre my boss and you didn‚Äôt have anything to    say to me.‚Äù

There was a non-apology apology of course.. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way‚Äù

After that it kind of fizzled out with me saying something like ‚ÄúI wish you all the luck in the world, see you around‚Äù and then leaving.

It was loud..the few people who were in the office heard everything, even with the door closed and I have zero regrets.

According to my Opal, bossman took about an hour to emerge, looking like a kicked dog, and said he felt really bad‚Ä¶and then she laid into him for all the crap he put me through (this story barely scratches the surface) and made it perfectly clear that this was his fault entirely and that he feels bad because he should feel bad. Not sure how I got so lucky to have a friend like her, but she‚Äôs a keeper.

The news/story of my departure spread and over the next few days and I had calls and texts from half of the company‚Ä¶people wanting more details, people apologizing that I had to deal with that, people telling me that they‚Äôre proud of me‚Ä¶the outpouring of support was astonishing. I honestly expected for people to be upset with me, but the opposite happened.

I enjoyed my time off before starting my new position and still keep in touch with a few good friends from QRS, let‚Äôs just say that the updates have been‚Ä¶interesting.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I know that my rage quit might not sound very ragey, but I‚Äôm a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make waves‚Äù type of person, so for me it was a big deal.

Also, if this sounds like an overreaction to everything please understand that there was so much more going on at that job that I didn‚Äôt include and that I had reached the point of being so stressed out that I was getting physically ill on a near daily basis."

I haven't been to the dentist for years because I'm afraid of it and my anxiety isn't helping, I've had an infected tooth where I woke up crying from pain in the night; I still couldn't call the dentist because I was so anxious about calling and going.

From the past few months, I can't focus much on my job and because of some existential issues, falling into depression. I recently changed jobs 4 months ago which has been really demanding, and which I don't think I am doing a great job at. Every day I fear that they will fire me and I will be jobless. The nerve wracking thought train continues and I fear that I won't be able to find a new job in the next 3 months and eventually, I will be deported back to my home country.  


I really like living here in Germany. It's nice, calm, people are mostly very nice. I can drink clean water, breathe fresh air, walk safely on sideways, ride my bike everywhere into the beautiful nature and so much more. I don't want to go back to my third world home country. I have been working here for 20 months as a software engineer on a blue card visa. Unfortunately, since I don't know enough german, I can't apply for Permanent Residence and I need to have a stable job for living. But my mind is totally messed up now and even as hard as I am trying, I just can't seem to be able to focus on work very well, and this makes me very scared.  


The upcoming winter is not looking good, many companies are doing layoffs, the news of recession is floating around and I feel that if I lose my current job, I won't be able to find another. I researched a bit and found that they give you 3 months to search if you lose a job. But what if I can't find a job within those 3 months? I read other sources that they say that you can apply for a job seeker visa post that, but I don't know whether I can apply for that while being in Germany itself or if I have to go back to my home country, to apply for that visa. If I have to go back to my home country, it's kinda game over since the waiting times for appointment runs like 3-4 months, there is no guarantee, and my entire life that I have built here will be uprooted.  


My only saving grace is that I have been working full time for 4 years and 1 year in internships and part time work. Through that, I have managed to save 60K euros  in total. Not all of it is liquid and a part of it is in my home country but if push comes to stove, I can make arrangements to show proof of sustenance to authorities. 

I just want my mind to stop making these worst case scenarios and this constant fear of dread and anxiety. I will be really thankful for any advice and feedback regarding this. Thanks!"

2013: Went to kota after completing my 12th from UP board.

2014: got 6 digit rank in jee due to me not being serious in Kota, was feeling guilty of waisting my parents hard earned money ( they sold some land and took loan from relatives to for my education).Ended up taking admission in a private university in MP and took CSE. ( father insisted to not take education load, most of the college was funded by either selling ancestral property or loan from relative and friends )

2018: Graduated from college with an average grade ( 6) , During my college days I had done  3 internship ( 2, 2 month long and 1, 6 month long). 1st internship was unpaid ( but got some money in bug bounty ) , but the later 2 payed 12k and 16k respectively. Ended up joining a mid sized service company from off campus since i was not allowed to sit in campus due to poor grades.

2019: Performed really well in my first company , got 100% hikes after 7 month ( I was hired at 3.6LPA , 6 month later got a promotion and CTC was raised to 6LPA)Ended working at the company for 1 year while also prepared for the interviews. at mid of 2019, got an offer from one of the unicorn companies as a SRE.

2020: Got a promotion at the product company after 9 months of joining , became an SDE 2 (I work in platform/SRE group).Started o think about switching companies due to lack of exciting work in the org. Got an interview from a US based silicon valley company for their London office. Found out that i have already worked with the hiring manager of the company on an open source project. I pinged him in morning had a chat about the role and what I am looking for, ended up getting a call from HR in evening.

2021: I already had an offer and visa at this point, flew to London in march 2021, for first 6 month didn‚Äôt stayed in London and just bounced off to new city while staying in Airbnb‚Äôs and used th opportunity to explore different cities ( Edinburgh being the favourite one)

Came back to London in October 2021, since then I am living here and working from home (I go sometimes to office but mostly for social stuff)"

I have no personal projects, no portfolio (I just learned coding last year so I didnt have enough time).

&amp;#x200B;

This year, I'm going to college to study IT. I'm looking forward to graduating and starting my career. Recently, I talked to my brother's good friend. He graduated from college and now works for this [Search Engine Optimization](https://www.webcitz.com/seo-services.html) company. He briefly explained to me what they do, and it sounds pretty interesting. I didn't have a chance to ask him all the questions I wanted since it was like a 5 min talk while he was waiting for my brother near the door. Still, according to my brother, his friend is pretty successful. He managed to repay 50% of his student loan quickly. I don't know how much he borrowed, but I know he doesn't come from money, and he was chasing any scholarship opportunities he could find.

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from good income, working in the IT industry seems interesting to me. I heard from a number of people that SEO services are in high demand right now, and those working for SEO companies are financially comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the college I'm aiming for doesn't have any program that mentions SEO, so I'm kinda bummed about it. Since I can't choose any other college due to certain circumstances, I have to select the most SEO-related program, and I wonder which one is that. Will it be better to go for Business Administration, Communication, or Information Technology? I'll probably take additional online SEO courses and try to find an internship, even an unpaid one if it's in a great company.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be thrilled to hear from people working in SEO companies about their experience and journey. I'm especially interested in degrees that allow you to work in SEO and the approximate income of a low-to-mid-level employee in such companies.

Many thanks in advance!"

I have major depression and chronic anxiety for past 5-6 years left untreated because my parents did'nt believe in the concept of mental health. Now that I am earning, I can afford medication and learnt I had these mental health issues. I don't know how I landed such a good internship but coping with mental health, learning so much new in this startup is taking a toll on my anxiety. There is so much to learn, people are so ahead of me, know so much about various tools and technologies while I struggle with bringing myself to learn these things. I want to learn new stuff but having been depressed for so long, I can't be efficient for more than 2-3 hours of work each day without feeling burnout.

I like programming but when I am up against a timeline, too much to learn and too little time my anxiety shoots up. 

I just wanted some words of encouragement from you guys. How did you guys cope with imposter syndrome, any neurodivergent programmers out there sharing their stories of making it in this industry, any stories of how you struggled in your first internship.

Would like some comments to cheer myself up and keep going!"

A bit about me:

- I have a 3.5 GPA/1440 SAT from HS

- I currently have a 3.97 GPA, and will have taken 2 grad level classes in my intended major (math) by the time I apply

- I have completed an internship at a startup crypto hedge fund, at which I played a pretty big role (built out lots of data analysis tools, was co-managing a team of interns during the summer)

- Am currently interning at a data science startup, at which I‚Äôm essentially doing all of the business ops alongside the founders, since the only people on the team rn besides me are engineers.

- Have some volunteering experience from HS but nothing since college.

- Am a part of 3 clubs but no leadership position.

- Am an amateur programmer who can build some ML stuff in python, knows C++ fundamentals, and is learning web dev.

- Looking to get into research, and will likely do an REU with a prof next summer (we‚Äôve verbally agreed to it).

- Was selected for a seminar of 15 students from a class of 1,000+ to discuss social justice issues and work on papers of our own in that direction, as well as rehabilitate former incarcerated folks.

There‚Äôs a few different directions I‚Äôm considering taking:

1. Leaning into programming and building websites, although this may have a low reward/effort ratio

2. Starting my own business, which would sort of fit in to my narrative I think.

3. Start writing for my school‚Äôs newspaper and try to get work published. Although I want to do math I consider myself a pretty good writer, and have a good knowledge of econ, literature, etc that I‚Äôd like the showcase.

4. Along the same vein as 3, I could start an art portfolio or some other creative endeavor.

5. Try to really excel at math, take more advanced courses, and get a strong spike on that end.

What do you guys think? [repost, if anyone has any thoughts, do share!]"

I hold a bachelors degree in a CS-related field and now going into masters in another CS-related field, both in the UK. I have also done 2 summer internships. My question is regarding a future job. When I have graduated from my masters, can I apply directly for non-junior software developer/engineer roles or any other non-junior (and non-senior) roles in similar fields? The way I get it is that many graduates take graduate and junior roles, however, given that I have taken masters, can I skip that and apply directly for normal software developer/engineer roles? Is that something realistic? How does one decide whether to apply for a junior or non-junior role? What is the practice?"

I‚Äôm 24 years of age, living in Sweden and I am one year into studies as civil engineering within software development. Basically this is a bachelors and a master together, atleast in Sweden.

As we all know, it‚Äôs not exactly easy to get into the US for work. After doing my research for a couple of hours, I have filtered my options of being able to work in the US down to this.

1. Simply apply to jobs where the company sponsors for a H1B- visa.

2. Apply to, preferably, any of the FAANG companies in Ireland for example, work for some time, and then try to get a transfer to the US.

Google, for example, lets people with a finished degree, apply to internships as long as it‚Äôs within 12 month of graduating.

3. The US embassy states that they dedicate a certain number of work (or permanent, not sure) visas for each country, for those with a advanced degree (masters or Phd for example)

(BONUS! I know some of you will probably say this one, but it is not so viable for me, as I will already have a masters at that point)

4. Studying a masters in the US. Not sure why people recommend this one. As this means you have a F1 visa and that only applies to studies. After your studies are finished, you have to leave the US, as I understand it.

I guess I just want to get some opinions on this. Are they reasonable? Is it likely to get a transfer for example?

What are your thoughts? Maybe you have had similar thoughts and came up with other options? Or you are a EU- citizen currently working in the US, and can tell about your experience?


Figured it would be more relevant to post this here as most of us are EU- citizens I would assume."

I am a recent college graduate with a BBA in Finance. Currently I am employed as a business analyst intern at a Fortune 500 company but in all honesty I hate working there. Upon reflection I discovered that I am extremely passionate about anything encompassing the field of business whether it be analysis, product management and project management.

My personal studies have provided me knowledge in VBA, Python, and a little SQL. I am also a candidate in the CFA program, and I am also pursuing other certifications such as the SIE, Oracle SQL and when the time comes potentially the CBAP. Of course I realize that these certifications are all over the place but at the end of the day I value the education/familiarity it offers me in regards to the industry.

In conclusion, I discovered I enjoy data manipulation and analysis, and to be clear my current job isn‚Äôt dissuading me because of workload but more along the lines of company culture.

With all the information I just provided above my questions are:

What position/role in a company do you feel most aligns with my passion/experience?

Does anyone have any experiences or wisdom they can impart on how they got their first post college role?

Anyone have any guidance on what certifications carry more value with employers when demonstrating experience?

Any company recommendations strictly based on company culture and job growth when fresh out of college?

Thank you all for your time and consideration, feel free to reach out if any other information is needed to answer any of the aforementioned questions."

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to post this to get this off of my chest. I feel already quite down on state of affairs and trust me am well aware of some of the mistakes I will go through here.  


2 years back I went through a local program for a business idea, and I got 100k to get started (it was an accelerator program). This was my first funded startup, as I am a first time founder. I was a finance person prior. Anyway, I ended being a solo founder and managed to get into a program that gave some funding. Went through the program with the idea to build our first iteration. Problem was first iteration sucked and we had to pivot. I then started running another iteration and with that traction was able to get 1M dollars of funding (I know crazy, all with sub 1k MAUs). I got a VC and a some big angel investors. Well I made some really dumb mistakes on hiring (it was rough during pandemic and fully remote). I ended up making too many hires too quickly, was told by a lot of folks to go and hire (not their fault at the end of the day I made the decision). So fast forward and I am 2 years into this thing, less than 200k in the bank left, and I cut down my team to basically two developers, some interns, and myself. We finally made our first revenue (we are software startup btw, with investors who wanted growth). We are also still sub 1k MAUs and we are on 4th iteration (ie what we do for users and who they are etc). I have enough runway to make it for 7 months at our current burn. We got our first chunk of rev from an advertiser.

&amp;#x200B;

Without getting into the weeds, I guess I just feel rather dumb and like a failure. I managed to raise a lot of money because I am good at selling, but then when it came to executing I floundered. I just feel horrible for letting down my supporters and backers. I have not taken time off in almost 2.5 years. I just am feeling rather down cause I burnt through a lot of money (one point I had so many people we did like 100k a month in burn), and now we are down to 25k ish (ironically enough we are actually moving faster). I am going to keep trying, but at some point I just wonder when I should just suck it up and admit defeat. 7 months is a long time, but consider how much I have screwed up I seriously question if I can pull all of this off. My backers are still encouraging us of course, and they believe in me as does my team. It is just when I say the above out loud I am just shocked at how much I messed up. I didn't get all of that funding btw at once, it was in chunks over 2 year period. Now if I don't get our metrics up and get more revenue we wont get funding for sure and it's game over. I even stopped paying myself (I wasn't paying myself anything either, was 30k a year of salary, but now its like 100 bucks a week). Luckily I take care of my family members so I have a roof over my head. I also feel guilty about that.  


I just want to know some outside perspective.   


1. Have any other founders screwed up like this? I feel rather incompetent not going to lie. I over hired and spent more than I should before PMF.   

2. Given that, I still want to try, but given my track record I just lose sleep over these mistakes. I am great at raising money, telling a story, but my execution just has been mediocre, especially on the hiring front. I am trying to get better.   


I ask to not be too harsh as trust me, I already beat myself up over it already. I see so many founders who are amazing and would kill to have the funding I have gotten and probably could have done a much better job. I feel very lucky and am thankful to have even gotten the chance, just sucks when you come up short on your own expectations and dreams.   


Advice and perspective appreciated."

What do I do now ?",zrev6,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/wzc5hz/studying_computer_science_engineering_was_my/,"At 14, seeing hackers in movies got me interested in this topic. After high school I was confidently operating a small linux server with podman containers, writing SELinux policy extensions, configuring linux desktops and mikrotik routers from scratch, so I thought ethical hacking was absolutely the right direction of career for me. I started the university, learned a lot about OOP, threads and networking, and got invited to a job interview to a security auditor company from a local hackerspace community. I was surprised that my current skills are totally irrelevant, they were asking for bug bounty results right away, while I was expecting to gain the skills for those there as an intern. Or start gaining it. I don't think I'll be able to work in itsec as a junior. Everybody I talked with about this recommends software development, but I haven't chosen that as my specialization at the university a year ago, so I won't be able to study related subjects, and most of my hobby-work is OS and networking related, so I don't know what area would be both motivating and not too hard to work on as an intern. I tried developing a demodulator software last year for a mikrocontroller, but I got nowhere with it. My other development-related project was a set of extensions to a standalone DJ unit built from a raspberry pi and a controller, which turned out to be fun and a success, but I don't think there's market for that knowledge, it was midi events mapped to js functions. How could I find an area in CSE that could make me motivated and be able to progress, to become hopefully later the foundation of my future career ?"

I have no money right now, and I'm not expecting receiving any for at least some weeks (I have a scholarship).

I feel I fucked it up and it's the worst period in my life. I suffered a traumatic experience last year (from substance abuse) and got PTSD afterwards. I felt that I hit rock bottom that time in my life, and took long time to recover from it, but the consequences were always there. Constant suicide thoughts everyday, general anxiety due to drug abuse and killing myself with drugs (I ""only"" use cannabis) to the point that I became addicted to drugs and dependent on them to just be functional.

Right now I feel I hit rock bottom. I had a vacation lately when I just wanted to rest and prepare for school, and do cozy things. It's been a long time since I haven't had a proper vacation (between studies and internships), and really wanted to rest well in this one since I missed it. But the surprising thing is that it just left me with my suicidal thoughts, till I found myself that I'm dying every day and getting worser and worser in my life, with no substantial change. I spent the next weeks just smoking everyday, to the point of sometimes not eating just to feel that I'm still alive.

I have no money right now, and I don't know how to tell my parents. I have no family here, and no friends since it's my first time in here (coming from an exchange program). I'm just sitting on the couch telling myself now that this is it, nothing is gonna ever change and that I'm going to remain the same. I just brought pain to my family and I don't want to burden them anymore. It's just that I can't handle the pain of my parents knowing that I died.

I feel I need help, the help that I neede when I first got traumatized and just kept on internalizing inside of me, afraid of telling anyone what happened or to accept it and seek help. I stayed on denial and just telling myself that it will go with time, but it doesn't change. It's been 2 years and everyday I feel like I'm killing myself and it's becoming unbearable."

I (19M) am currently pursuing an associate‚Äôs degree at a community college with the plan of majoring in computer science or computer engineering. I am, however, contemplating the idea of just dropping out and going to a coding bootcamp to find a job fast and leave home as fast as possible. I honestly feel like a inferior loser for still living at home and seeing my HS classmates already getting married. I am unsure of this idea. If it goes well I would be employed and finally leave the boring comfort of my parents house. I am somewhat hesitant of doing this because I would feel somewhat dumb for throwing away my opportunity to get a free/ very cheap Tech related degree without worrying about the costs (it is covered by Pell grants and scholarships (and I also pocket 60% left after costs)) and having my parents provide me housing as long as I keep doing well in school and help around the house.

I am interested in these 3 bootcamps (which are located in my hometown: Las Vegas, Nevada: 1. My community college has one powered by Promineo Tech (  I did read some good reviews about them, but most of the reviews are too old (2- 3yrs) )and costs around 4k. 2. My local university has another powered by ThriveDX/HackerU for around 15k. 3. The third one is called Punchcode and is owned by Techimpact and costs around 15k also.

What is your opinion of my idea?

TL;DR: I have the opportunity to go to college for almost free because I receive scholarships and grants that more than pays for my community college and pays a very significant amount of university fees without taking out a penny worth of student loans. Despite that, I want to drop out and go to coding boot camp to find a high paying job and leave the house as fast as possible because I feel like a loser. I listed the three coding boot camps above. I want to hear your opinions.

P.S.  I know I am in an IT subreddit and not a CS/ software subreddit, but I am not allowed to post on there yet. Hopefully I can post this here.

Edit: Thanks everyone for taking the time to give me advice. Although I would still like to ask this question in other forums, I now think it would be a more beneficial to just stay in college to acquire my degree and take advantage of the special opportunities my uni can provide (internships, coding extracurriculars, feedback on my coding practices from my peers, etc.)."

1. What to do when you get a job offer but you‚Äôre not sure if you want to accept it yet. Wouldn‚Äôt asking them if they can give me a few days to think about it be a bad sign to them? Would they just decide to choose the other candidate?

3. If it were up to you, would you rather accept a job where you work with a mentor that you really hit it off with that is kind of small company and maybe not so well known , or accept a job at a more well known and famous place?

edit:
4. And also idk if I will do this, but how would you suggest negotiating your salary? I‚Äôd be scared that i‚Äôd look bad against a candidate that wouldn‚Äôt say anything about the pay

At my college I'm in something called the Corps of Cadets. Basically, it is a military org within the school that takes up a lot of time. I decided to do it because it is good leadership experience, makes me a better person, gives me friends, and gives me a chance to commission.  

Now fast forward to today and I'm worried about finding a job after college. I've read online that in order to get a job I have to get an internship. In order to get an internship I have to join clubs and make projects related to engineering. I'm worried that if I participate in the Corps that I won't have time to participate in these clubs and thus won't be able to find a job after college. 

I'm worried because if I don't have any technical experience then how will I find a job, wouldn't leadership experience not count for shit if you don't have technical experience. Wouldn't technical experience be much more appreciated by employers especially for engineering?

I'm just trying to figure out how to best use my time and what is going to be worth it in the long run regarding jobs after college if I don't end up commissioning.

Thank you guys for reading through, I just started college so I'm feeling really lost and scared and I feel like everyone has their shit together and I don't lol."

I‚Äôd like to add that my GPA isn‚Äôt exceptional - around a 3.5 - but I do have an economics research assistantship where I used R for network analysis. In terms of my coursework, I‚Äôve done all the calcs, prob &amp; stats, diff eqs, numerical analysis, discrete math, lin alg, advanced lin alg, and computer programming in R and Java. I‚Äôm currently taking a python for mathematical computing class, graduate statistical computing, graduate regression analysis, and mathematical modeling.

Keeping USA in mind, I'm not sure which unis to choose. I'm sure i won't be getting top unis, and I've heard that moderate or safe unis in tech cities would help land a job. My budget would be around 50 lakhs (since my aim is to land a job, should I prefer a lower ranked cheaper uni to an expensive higher ranked?) 

I've shortlisted CMU(DS program), GTech, UT Austin, UCSD, Uni of Penn, UT Dallas, UC Irvine, UIUC, Cornell, Purdue. Most of these seem ambitious, let me know which I should remove and which safe or moderate unis i should apply to. My worry is I don't have any papers published, neither did i pursue project type courses. I am expecting moderate-ish to strong LoRs.

my_qualifications: BE CS, MSc Economics (dk if it helps), GPA: 9.07, GRE: 333, TOEFL: yet to give. papers published: none. projects: thesis at my uni, course related projects. Experience: 6 months internship at a cloud computing company, 2 months internship at a top MNC, working here currently (been a month)."

Setting up my computer for web development seems easy when I'm told what the install from a brief or instruction sheet. 

But when you're actually hired and on the first week of your job (not internship), are you given clear instructions for what to install or how to best prepare your computer so that your machine is ready for the specific project you need to work on? Or is this something you re expected to know or figure out what to do?

I guess a more tl;dr version is how much handholding is to be expected and for how long?

wzo1pf,17,2022-08-28,Resume Advice for Professionals,TallEstimate,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/wzo1pf/resume_advice_for_professionals/,"Hello people,

I am writing this post to explain good resume etiquette. It is meant to help those who are looking for a new job or are new to the job market or just looking to improve their resume in general.

This advice works for India and applies to jobs in MNCs, indigenous software and IT Tech and managerial and business profiles (middle management). I would not say that it would apply for applications to higher studies, but some parts of it would.

*Why am I offering this? What makes me qualified to offer this advisory?*

Well, I see a lot of posts from people looking for jobs on r/india. I also review around 50 resumes a week and feel that \~70% of those could do better. I don't work HR.

Personally I have around 10 years of work ex with Banks, MNCs and IT Tech in both business and tech profiles. I have interviewed \~200 candidates across various roles and levels and have been interviewed for  \~250 rounds of interviews across companies. I also hire very regularly for my organization, so I would hazard a guess that I know a bit about resume and professional presentation.

*What is a resume?*

A resume is brief writeup about (1) your professional accomplishments, (2) the impact you have created thus far, (3) the knowledge and abilities you have and (4) your ability to solve problems. 2 and 4 are the most important. A resume is an invitation to get someone piqued enough to interview you. That is the sole purpose of a resume. A good resume is like a miniskirt, short enough to attract interest, long enough to cover the important bits.

A resume is not a biodata. You don't need to provide information on (1) your vitals stats (Yes, I have seen people write '38DD-24-36' on their resumes), (2) your exact address, (3)  your place of birth, date of birth, gender, father's name, mother's name, nationality, gothram and the like. A big no-no is adding a picture of yourself. It is a resume, not a Tinder profile.

*General Advice on Format*

1. Stick to a 1-page resume unless you have &gt;10 yrs of experience.  Use standard fonts - Calibri or Garamond, 11 or 10 pts. You can narrow down margins to use all the available space on the paper. If you are in tech or data science, a LATEX resume is very much preferred. Personally I use LATEX. You can get sample templates on Overleaf. A 5-pager when you have 2 years work ex is a recipe for rejection.
2. Follow the natural reading flow. An average recruiter spends 30 s on a resume. There is no time for someone's eye to wander over three columns and multiple callouts. If you want to help me understand your body of work or talent, just list them in reverse chronological order and highlight the parts which you think you did best.
3. Keep a simple structure - first line should be your name and contact details, Linked In and Github profiles (if you have one ). Don't go for fancy multi color formats. There is no need for superfluous nonsense like career objective, introductory para, mission statement and the like. Just get to the point.
4. Submit resumes in PDF formats. Other formats will break.
5. There is absolutely no need to waste space on a word cloud or tags, or on rating yourself in stars on skills you think you have. These mean nothing and are a headache for anyone who sees them. What do you mean you rate yourself 4/5 on Soft skills, or 8/10 on Python. Sir, this a resume, not a Zomato restaurant page. If you are very good with something, let your body of work say that. if you are only 2/5 for something, why are you even showing that.
6. There is absolutely no need for wasting space on your scholastic achievements from the fifth standard when you have already graduated from college. Include details about when you were exceptionally good - like department topper or ranker, but leave that local chess championship where you won a pressure cooker out of your resume. That said, if you were a chess grandmaster, do point that out in a single line.
7. There are no brownie points for showcasing software knowledge. Many people including a laundry list of software they know - Word, Excel and blah and a favorite with the tech newbies is to list 5 or 6 new languages. Well, unless you built an application in that language, there is no point adding that.
8. Get your friend or a senior to review your resume and point out the obvious flaws, break in logic or flow or any innocuous mistakes which you may have ignored.
9. Do not waste your time trying to tell anyone that 'You certify that contents of this resume is absolutely true.' Nobody is looking for an affidavit.

*Language Advice*

1. A resume' language is formal. The standard way on how to represent yourself on a resume is the Harvard resume guide. See here [https://hwpi.harvard.edu/files/ocs/files/undergrad\_resumes\_and\_cover\_letters.pdf](https://hwpi.harvard.edu/files/ocs/files/undergrad_resumes_and_cover_letters.pdf) and follow it.
2. Take a day to think before you start to write your resume. Each work experience you list should be a story of thoughtful application and accomplishment. Each line should have 50 word story behind it. This will help you prepare for your interviews as well. However, this is not a call to start embellishing your resume. Read below to understand more.
3. A resume should show a high bias for action. A work experience of 4-5 years can be distilled into 5 or 6 succinct lines. So, begin by thinking about what were your most important contributions  or accomplishments. Then distill those into the situation, the action you took and the outcomes. In the end it should look like 'Performed XX activities to take control of YY problems to generate ZZ result.' You can reverse this to also say 'Generated ZZ result by performing YY actions against XX situation' to get the point faster. Just stating something but not adding an impact value of your work is like saying that I made love to my date all night, but still could not bring her to an orgasm. Well, you did nobody any good then.
4. Even the most intense work you did for a project for 12 months can be summarized into a line, or two at best. Don't write paragraphs, don't write essays on the work you did.
5. Scratch out the mundane. I see a lot of resumes mentioning a laundry list of everything they did in that job. Adding lines upon lines of content is useless. With resumes, less is more. The more you profess knowing and doing, the more open you are making yourself to questioning in an interview.
6. Steer clear of stating inaccurate facts or lies in your resume. Be ethical, do not take credit for what you have not done. Don't add jargons, don't speak legalese.
7. Lot of people debate if they need to add their CGPA or the awards they won during their college stint, or their personal interests. Well, if you are new to the market, adding CGPA shows that you have a high level of academic accomplishment and gives you an edge. More than 2-3 years of work ex? Better leave it out. Exhibiting personal interests can be useful to some extent, but those are a footnote in the profile. Be sure to make your professional life the star of your resume.

*I am looking for my first job, what should I do?*

Welcome to the job market! People taking on the job market should prioritize listing the work they have done as part of their internships, smaller professional engagements and their impact there. Your academics should talk of what you did best in school. Nobody wants a list of courses you did, but if you did object oriented programming very well, it would be worthwhile to point that out. People from IT/Tech background should definitely hustle in side projects and showcase that.

*Career line specific advice*

* Middle Management - Do list out the impact of your work in your last org. Impact will be in terms of dollars you added to the topline or the bottom line. If you are not sure, mention impact in terms of headcount saved, SLA improvement or operational metrics. If you are in finance, talk about metrics important to your line of work.
* Data Science - Do list out the kind of challenges you worked for in the past. We are not looking out for jargons on the algorithms you used. We want to know how you helped solve a problem which required a lot of human judgement. Everyone knows SVM, Random Forest and XGBoost - what matters is how you applied that and when. Did you write any paper?
* Tech - List out the effect of the software you or your team built - improved uptimes, processing speed, scale, automation etc. List out the technical intricacies of the job. List out any open source collaborations you might have done. Did you write any white papers?

Finally, a resume is a document you own.  You should think of resume as a marketing tool with a cliffhanger, the person who ends up reading¬†it should feel like he needs to speak to you after reading it. That's all a resume is supposed to do. Rest is up to you to manage in a face to face conversation.  

I hope this will help you project yourself better for the job you are gunning for and hope you land in front of an interview panel.

I graduate in December. I will be working 40 hrs a week and taking 5 classes at a time online. Yes I know it will be tough but I can do it. I've always had to work while in college. I start this job in 5 days. I'm getting nervous. I'm worried that since the title is mid level engineer maybe they will expect me to be better than I am? They know I'm in college and they know I love learning and this is my passion. I also am pretty experienced for still being in college ( I think ). But I wouldn't consider myself mid level yet seeing as this is my first engineer job. The only other software engineer experience was an internship. Maybe this is what people call imposter syndrome? I just don't want them to think I'm stupid or anything.

I really do love coding and I am excited to start this job. I have worked so very hard to get here and it still does not feel real that I am a software engineer now. But there's this voice in my head always telling me, ""Do you really think you're actually smart enough for this?"" I've always kind of doubted myself but maybe that's imposter syndrome or I just don't feel confident in my skills yet. I have built many projects on my own but just not sure what to expect on the job. I know I need to learn Salesforce because I've never used that before.

What kind of tasks do you think I will be doing for the first month and what do you think they will expect out of me? It's a full stack position. Mainly C# .NET, SQL Server, Angular, JS, Azure, Salesforce, etc."
wzpby8,1,2022-08-28,How similar is learning a computer language (Java) to a foreign world language (Spanish)?,BlackSnowMarine,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/wzpby8/how_similar_is_learning_a_computer_language_java/,"Hi all, this might sound like a weird question and it probably is. 

I'm trying to go for new and different learning styles because learning to code Java for future internships hasn't been clicking much. I'm in a CS major at my university but the concepts in Java hasn't clicked for me yet, whereas other students can understand and write code just by glancing at it. Pretty sure I'm mentally impaired at logic/coding but it doesn't stop me from trying. 

On the other hand, I've noticed that learning world languages (Spanish, French, German, etc) has so much more easier for me to comprehend because I can parallel English subjects, verbs, grammar, so on, with foreign languages. I became 3/4's fluent in Spanish in little over a year because I was able to see the overarching topics in my head, but I could not get much traction with Java coding at all. I was wondering if there's any parallels with learning Java to learning foreign languages like Spanish that could help with my coding. 

Of course there's a lot of contrasts. 

* Computers need extremely precise language to run, whereas spoken language has nuance, slang, and a lot of details meant for other humans to hear and follow along. 
* Java and other coding languages have to be logically correct with no typos for the computer to process, whereas English literature can be erratic, broken, and nonsensical with flowery details and it still would be grammatically correct. 

But I feel like I found a lot of parallels with coding and natural spoken languages

* Both need you to know the syntax and grammar, both need practice to master
* Me having a solid foundation on Spanish, this made grasping French and Portuguese much easier, similar to how knowing Java helps you learn C and C++ and the other way around. (Python too?).
* ""Hello World"" programs don't take long to learn, but mastering Java or C++ can take years. Learning ""good morning, how are you?"" in Spanish is easy, but becoming fully fluent in the language and mastering the subjunctive form can take years of practice. Or learning how to pronounce ""Entschuldigung"" in class versus mastering the German case system.

Anyone else had this thought and tried comparing programming to our natural languages? What're your thoughts?"

However, now that I have graduated I am finding it really hard to land a decent job which will grow my career and pay atleast a livable salary. An opportunity came my way to work under a well known lawyer in my city. However, it is completely unpaid and the hours are long (10am - 10pm) with no weekends off. The perks of this opportunity is that the lawyer is really well known and using his brand name could open up several opportunities for me. However, I am extremely conflicted. On one hand I am not getting any call backs from the law firms etc that I had applied to and this opportunity would atleast give me the opportunity to learn. There is a prospect of earning in the future if he finds me reliable enough allow me to directly assist him in a matter and charge a fee per appearance.

So I've been offered an internship in a small startup in the country as a data science intern. I've been told that I would be exposed to code and will be working with it along with the team. The lead was the one that interviewed me as well, and they were quite nice.

Pros:

\- Flexible time

\- Familiar with the stack to be used. Initially learned Python to get into data science.

\- Data science looks good on your resume (?)

Cons

\- Unpaid

\- ??  


I was also offered a front-end webdev intern role, but I'm leaning more towards the the data science one, since I want to diverge from my ""web dev path"".

I am applying to start the post-bacc at the start of 2023. Given the amount of travel and hours I work in my current job, I plan to quit and do OSU full time. My questions are as follows:

1. Since I will be aiming for the 1.25 year track and most likely ending up in the 1.5 year track starting winter, I think my best bet for internships is in the fall/winter. Does anyone have examples of FAANG or other highly regarded internships they have gotten ‚Äúoff-peak‚Äù internship season?

2. Has anyone translated this degree into working in the blockchain space? In my current role I have spent a lot of time on these companies/protocols as an investment opportunity so I think this would be a cool route to at least try and haven‚Äôt seen anyone say anything regarding blockchain. I understand blockchain is quite controversial, but that‚Äôs not a discussion for this post.

3. What do you think is the most lacking but necessary part of this program (ex. A certain programming language or concept, etc)

Thank you so much for your help. I look forward to starting soon!"

I will be moving to Bremen in Germany for my master's degree in October and I have started to look for ""working student"" jobs. 

Could you share some tips about finding these type of jobs ? 

I tried to look them up on LinkedIn but I feel like there is not much of them (do they appear later, after summer ?). Or should I look up local companies there (maybe on some job boards for students at the uni?).

I have over 2 YoE (mainly C++, Go, Python in backend and sre. Also did one internship in embedded) , so maybe at least with that exp it should be easier to find something.

I'd be grateful for any feedback as I am bit unfamiliar of work culture in Germany, particularly with those student jobs. In my country it's usually called internships that are part/full time and don't have that strict requirement of max 20 working hours in a week.

Thanks in advance!"

The only work experience I have was with a small start up I did under a community Makerspace. Me and a few interns used 3d printing software to model, print, and sell topographical maps and landmarks. I‚Äôd definitely want to explore something similar to that in the future.

**Oct. 23, 2173 ‚Äî Rexel 3**

‚ÄúOi, careful around Rufus!‚Äù

Versint jumped at his human co-workers‚Äô sudden outburst, nearly dropping the gel dummy and bumping into the large steel assembly in the middle of the testing chamber.

A pair of large hands quickly scooped the dummy from the palotin‚Äôs claws and set it down before breathing a sigh of relief.

‚ÄúSeriously, Versi. I told ya to watch your step,‚Äù Morven said. ‚ÄúThe whole thing‚Äôs secure, but I wouldn‚Äôt wanna be dancin‚Äô around like that.‚Äù

Versintal couldn‚Äôt stop a snap of his beak in irritation. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why we need to recreate an ancient human experiment, much less a *failed* ancient human experiment,‚Äù he said sharply. ‚ÄúI know we‚Äôve only just entered the Galactic Union, but we should be-‚Äù

‚ÄúLearnin‚Äô to walk before ya run,‚Äù Morven finished. ‚ÄúI know your kind are brilliant engineers, but you lost a lot when ya skipped over fission and went right to fusion.‚Äù

Versintal held his tongue. The human was right. Electricity flowed across the planet like water, but the miniaturization of a fusion power plant was at least a century away. The rest of the universe had left their cradle and explored their gate system using long-lasting fission engines.

The palotin had entered the greater galactic community on hydrogen rockets, much to the shock of all.

But to them, it made the most sense. It was easy to create fuel from water when you had a limitless supply of energy. But the government balked at the cost of building a fusion power plant on another planet or moon, hampering any plans to create a remote refueling outpost.

So began the human-palotin exchange program. The United Nations of Earth would send its best and brightest to teach the palotin all the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôt‚Äôs of nuclear fission, and the palotin would work with the UNE to build the first intergalactic fusion plant on Earth's soil.

But Versintal knew it wasn‚Äôt because the Galactic Union trusted and respected the humans to do this. It was because they had been the youngest member ‚Äî until the palotin.

‚ÄúWhy is it even called Rufus?‚Äù Versintal asked, not expecting an answer as he went for another palotin stand-in.

‚ÄúI figured calling it the Demon Core would give ya the willies.‚Äù

Versintal stopped midstride, his feathers standing on end. ‚Äú*Demon* core?‚Äù He asked, almost dreading the answer.

Morven nodded somberly. ‚ÄúAye. You see, me and the team figured that it would be best to show ya folks the accidents we‚Äôd done over the years.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt answer the question.‚Äù

Morven clicked his teeth and then sighed. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say there‚Äôs a problem with one of your fusion reactors. What do you do?‚Äù

Versintal played along. ‚ÄúWe shut it down.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ turn it off? Stop the reaction?‚Äù

Morven nodded and smiled. ‚ÄúYes. You stop the reaction. Easy in fusion. Hard in fission.‚Äù

The human leaned in and cocked a thumb towards the apparatus behind him, now looking more ominous. ‚ÄúThose are two plutonium-gallium hemispheres, separated by a ring,‚Äù he said, pointing at the suspended sphere. ‚ÄúAbove and below are a half-sphere of beryllium on hydraulic arms. Put together, they create a neutron reflector and can create a supercritical chain reaction.‚Äù

Versintal felt a lump form in his throat. He had read the required documents but hadn‚Äôt internalized them yet. But he knew what a chain reaction was.

‚ÄúAnd I take it *that‚Äôs* how it earned the name ‚ÄòDemon‚Äô?‚Äù

Morven opened his mouth to continue but was cut short by a loud buzzing. Looking towards the end of the room and through the shielded glass, Versintal could see one of the interns.

‚ÄúDoctor Versint, sir? We‚Äôve got a delivery that requires a supervisor to sign off on.‚Äù

Suppressing a sigh, he shot the human a look before he left. ‚ÄúYou will tell me this story by the end of the day.‚Äù

He nodded, gave an affirmative gesture with his thumb and index finger, and watched Versintal walk away.

Versint‚Äôs mind wandered as he followed the intern. It was still early in the morning, and the three of them were the only ones on site.

He wasn‚Äôt ten strides into shipping and receiving when something blunt and heavy hit him square in the beak.

‚ÄúYou, grab him!‚Äù

In a disoriented daze, Versintal felt the world spin and tumble as his hands were forced behind his back, and he was dragged back the way he came. Looking back and forth among the group of his own kind, he was shocked to see them all armed.

‚ÄúWha-‚Äù

Another blow came down on Versint‚Äôs face, courtesy of the rifle butt one of the insurgents held.

There had been talks of rebellion, some more fervorous among the population not content with the handlings of galactic politics by the current administration.

‚Äú45291,‚Äù the intern recited as they reached the test room door. Versint balked. He hadn‚Äôt told him that code.

‚ÄúYou betrayed us?‚Äù He asked numbly.

The intern scoffed ‚Äî he didn‚Äôt even bother to learn his name.

‚ÄúNo, brother, *you* betrayed *us*,‚Äù he said, watching with glee as the seven soldiers surrounded the human, who slowly raised his arms.

‚ÄúDo as we say, or we kill you and your traitorous friend,‚Äù the supposed leader said in a snide tone.

The human‚Äôs lip curled in a snarl. ‚ÄúAlright then. Whad‚Äôya want?‚Äù

The rebel leader‚Äôs eyes turned to the Demon Core, and the human‚Äôs face turned white.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said quietly at first before shouting. ‚ÄúNo! That‚Äôs-‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly what we need,‚Äù the rebel leader finished. ‚ÄúNow prepare it for transport. *Now*. Or we kill the traitor and make you watch.‚Äù

Versint was unceremoniously tossed to the floor, and as he lay, he could hear the distinct sound of a gun being cocked. Looking up, the former intern pointed a pistol at his head.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù the human spat, turning to the holding apparatus and turning on the terminal. ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre settled in for a wee wait.‚Äù

That got the rebel leader‚Äôs feathers ruffled. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre stalling, I‚Äôll-‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know,‚Äù Morven grumbled. ‚ÄúBut the thing‚Äôs got redundancies on redundancies. I can‚Äôt disengage the locking mechanism without going through the proper procedure. Five minutes, give or take.‚Äù

The rebel leader let out a breath and glared. ‚ÄúFive minutes. Now do it.‚Äù

It was a tense few minutes for all but the human he seemed.

‚ÄúLotsa firepower for a science experiment,‚Äù he joked. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôchya got planned for this thing? Paper weight?‚Äù

Humor was something lost upon the stuffy officer. ‚ÄúNo such thing,‚Äù there was a pause and a dry laugh. ‚ÄúBut I might as well tell since you‚Äôre coming with us.‚Äù

Morven looked up from his terminal.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve received some lovely plans from some human privateers,‚Äù he said gleefully. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre for a weapon. Supposedly, the third that was supposed to be used during the end of your second global conflict ‚Äî though it never saw the light of day. Your enemy surrendered before it could be used.‚Äù

The human‚Äôs typing stopped. Those in the room could see a mix of emotions dancing across his face. Looking at the human, the rebel leader‚Äôs grin grew.

‚ÄúBut I assure you, we won‚Äôt let it go to waste as your kind did.‚Äù

Versint could barely see what was happening with the windows higher than the floor. But he could hear the smile in the human‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúReally now?‚Äù Morven asked. ‚ÄúWell then. If you‚Äôre gonna take it, might as well get a history lesson now.‚Äù

The rebel leader opened his beak, but the human kept talking.

‚ÄúSee, we planned to use it but never did. Instead, we started learning from it. Hoping to understand how dangerous it was,‚Äù he said, his fingers typing feverishly now. ‚ÄúBut one man? Oh, he liked to play with the damn thing. Said he was ‚Äòtickling the dragon‚Äôs tail‚Äô and was so very confident in his abilities. But then, one day, the dragon bit him back. Killed himself and nearly every one else in the room.‚Äù

By now, Morven was raving, and every gun in the room was trained on him. The rebel leader glowered at the declaration that the very thing they stood next could kill and drew his own pistol.

‚ÄúAnd what? You plan on mirroring his stupidity and ‚Äòtickling the dragon‚Äôs tail‚Äô yourself?‚Äù

The human‚Äôs manic grin made everyone in the room flinch.

‚ÄúOh no, I‚Äôm not tickling it's tail,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM SLAMMING IT IN THE FUCKING DOOR!‚Äù

(1) What‚Äôs the best way to get started? Any books I should read? Should I try to get involved with a lab ASAP or should that wait?

(2) What kind of background is required to do ‚Äúcutting-edge‚Äù work in this field? In terms of CS, mathematics, other skills? E.g. an understanding of OS, measure theory, etc.?

(3) Is AR/VR just a fad right now? It looks very interesting, but I don‚Äôt want to spend so much time on something for it to just go obsolete in 15-20 years. 

(4) How would I make my CV competitive for AR/VR internships for top companies or start-ups? E.g. what‚Äôs the interview process like, in comparison to say a FAANG research scientist role?

Thank you very much for any thoughts!"

I‚Äôm self taught, started working as a dev for online game servers back in high school part time. Then started college (CS of course) after HS, got an internship at the end of my sophomore year, and have been working there year-round since (about 1.5 years). 

I haven‚Äôt graduated, but at my experience level, I‚Äôm not learning much at all and only want to finish because a degree can open doors.

Because of this, I expressed interest in going full time so that I can start my career/life and just chip away at the last little bit of my degree while working.

So I eventually got a call from our COO who gave me an offer‚Ä¶ for 40k. It‚Äôs entry-level in a low COL area, but insultingly low when you consider that I‚Äôve literally helped train some of the newer guys who struggle to do anything more than super basic code changes. Of course I negotiated, but haven‚Äôt heard back yet on a final number or received anything anything in writing. My payroll is updated to the new rate for the time being, so at least they aren‚Äôt messing with me.

I really enjoy this job and the company though, otherwise I would have no problem jumping ship. I was told there can be rapid raises, but I don‚Äôt know what that looks like or how much I believe that when it would take a 50-60% raise to get me to where I‚Äôm worth. The company is growing and doing very well, so it‚Äôs not a budget issue. I‚Äôll take what they give me since I haven‚Äôt been looking elsewhere, but I‚Äôm wondering if I should start now or see where I am in a few months when raises happen."

I am from India.My parents are divorced and I‚Äôve been living with my mother since then. I do visit my dad frequently. Now I‚Äôm currently 21 yrs old and I‚Äôm going to study in Canada this December. I recently graduated in May and started working as an intern in a Fintech earning 15k Rupees per month. The expenses for my further education is being funded by my father. 

My mother  owns her own jewellery business. Since covid it hasn‚Äôt been doing well and I feel she has been taking it out on me quite often. Whenever I try to stand up for myself I‚Äôm threatened into being thrown out as she knows I have no where to go. There have been times where I have left the house because I can‚Äôt take it anymore and don‚Äôt return for hours. My friends then get to know from her that i have not returned home and check with me whether I‚Äôm okay.

What happened recently is one of her friends came last morning to our house. She insists that I make a business plan for my mother. I simply told her that it was not possible for me to do so as I have no experience and I was not invested in the business. Not only was I being grilled on the subject but my mother started shouting at me sometime later just because I was late in bringing glasses for her friend. At this point I haven‚Äôt eaten anything and I‚Äôm already at an all time low after being humiliated in front of a guest. Too calm Down and feel a little better I thought of ordering some food for the time and having the meal cooked at home later in the evening. When my food arrived my mother shouted at me again and asked me how dare I ordered food when there was food in the house. When I tried to explain why she just didn‚Äôt listen and said I had to ask her before ordering. I was shocked. Can‚Äôt I even order food for myself at a time like that? She said that I crossed the line and hence has been threatening to kick me out if I try to voice anything more. Today she said because of my behaviour I would have to give her 75% of my income what I‚Äôm earning currently every month till I go to Canada or she‚Äôll kick me out. The worse part is that she has the her entire family on her side because of the numerous times she‚Äôs bad mouthed about me to them. 

There is nobody else left for me instead of my father. But going to him is not an option, as I live in Mumbai and he lives in another state called kerala. I have lost all hope in life at this point and don‚Äôt have clue of what to do next. To every person who read through this, please give me your insight‚Äôs."

I want to take the offer but I'm worried about the background check for 2 reasons. First off, when I applied, I put myself as double major computer science and data science. I'm already declared in Data Science but it'll take a while for my college to process and declare me for computer science. Does anyone know if it'll be a problem if I'm not declared in both by the time I accept my offer?

The second reason is that I put a data science internship from a company called data glacier on my resume. Thing is, the internship was designed more like an online course that I actually had to pay $25 for. I didn't take it seriously and didn't finish it on time. So by the time I accept the Amazon offer, I won't have gotten my certificate of completion. I think it'll take another 3-4 months for me to get mine. Does Amazon look into this kind of stuff? (Note: this company isn't US-based, I'm pretty sure it exists only in India)

I should also mention that when they asked for my most updated resume before the final round, neither of those 2 points are a problem. I clarified that I am not yet declared in CS and removed the Data Science Internship from my resume. Does anyone know if I should be good or if I'm screwed. Any input appreciated!"

I've been coding I'd say for an year -  year and a half now.  Two months ago I started my first internship as a backend developer with NodeJs and Express.  Overall all is going well. I like working on the backend.

The problem for me now is that I actually like frontend too. Id say they both interest me equaly. But I kind of fear that it's harder to find a job as a backend developer ( at least I read that).

I have kind of made already my plan on what to do but I want to hear other people's opinions too. Should I continue fully as a backend developer after the internship and now focus fully on the backend, or should I spend my free time after work learning React and frontend in general as there are a lot of job listings for that considering that I like backend and frontend equaly. Which option has what pros and cons by you?

Note : The reason I care about job listings is because I live with my girlfriend and I want to be sure I can provide so we dont get kicked out on the streets and live comfortably."

I regret changing my major to math since I‚Äôm still pursuing a career in CS but I always found math classes more interesting. Due to my economic situation, I had to work full time as a fast food manager all throughout college including summers so I never got an internship or any other relevant experience. My only personal projects are the ones I did for my college courses. I do enjoy coding and building algorithms but the only practical knowledge I retained from college is how to do backend stuff with Java, c, and python and how to build algorithms and implement data structures. I know other stuff like html, sql, etc. from cs electives but I‚Äôm not proficient enough to do full stack development or anything. I think I would be a good candidate as a Java developer but my main concern is my marketability. 

My resume is minimal, all I have is my degree and fast food management experience. My plan after school is to interview prep for a few months as I am currently doing by doing leet code and practicing stuff I learned in college as well as teaching myself stuff I may not have been exposed to all that well.

If I reject the offer and Lockheed does not reach out, I plan to study my algorithms and data structures and work on personal projects. I would say money is kind of important right now so I could just accept the offer in the meantime and commit 6 months.

I have been a long time lurker on this subreddit, but I need your expertise / help on something.

Right now I am doing an internship as a data analyst, but the thing is, all I do is tableau and SQL (which is all fun), but I feel like this is not the field I studied for. If in the future I manage to earn money just by doing tableau / SQL, I would most definitely not complain, but I don‚Äôt want to limit myself to just being able to do queries and tableau. 

Luckily, the internship does have a lot freedom to experiment and play with the data. I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on what else I could/should do with the data. Such as correlations and hypothesis testing.

Thanks in advance :)"

I love art, I love being creative, I love working on art for others especially since I get to work in a lot more styles and they give me very cool ideas and try things a bit outside of my comfort zone, and money is nice  
Issue is.. While I love doing commissions, the moment I'm being paid for work I get extreme anxiety  and can't focus on my work at all (this usually kicks in when I have more then 1 lined up)  
Something that would normally take me days will take me weeks, and the moment I have a deadline looming I go into panic mode  
For a while I just did a lot of freebies and while I enjoy doing that obviously I can't live of off just making others happy, but somehow the complete lack of pressure and deadline means I'll finish it in mere days rather then the weeks it takes me now

Smart thing to do would be to only ever accept 1 commission at a time, but I hate rejecting commissions since I'm finally getting any at all and I don't want to waste this opportunity now that I finally get any engagement at all  
I stall, I'm restless, I can't concentrate, I can't sleep well, but again I'd really hate to waste this opportunity, and I also feel like forcing myself to work (which I am doing) just makes the work I produce a lot worse then it would normally be

All of this also applies to jobs, I love working and being busy and helping people and having something to do but then the moment money gets involved... Yeah I'd much rather be on a permanent internship   
(but I obviously don't want to be a burden to my family forever, and I want to live my life a little more)

I'm really not sure how to become more chill and calm tf down, it just feels like a lot of pressure :/"
x08f5p,1,2022-08-28,How do I handle being the only employee in my company with my type of background?,Crenshawd,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/x08f5p/how_do_i_handle_being_the_only_employee_in_my/,"**So a little bit of background:** Last summer I did an internship with a large private upstream Oil and Gas company where I essentially had an identical role as I do now (Automation and Controls Engineer), just paid less (current TC \~100k). I just graduated from college in May with a degree in Computer Science and started working full-time here in June. As it stands, besides two IT administrators based out of our corporate office, I believe that I am currently the only employee with a Software/Computer Science background in the entire company. This is not to give the impression that this is a small company, quite the contrary actually. This company is easily worth 10+ billion and has probably over a thousand employees. They are just a little behind the curve.

In the past, my duties were contracted out to many different 3rd parties, which ultimately has led to an array of inconsistencies in how our automation and SCADA (data acquisition) system operates. Over the last three months, I have been working to smooth all of this out and create a more coherent system. All of this while also learning the ropes in the industrial automation scene, something I had zero experience in before working here.

**Now for my actual request in terms of career advice:** How do I function, learn, and grow in an environment where I constantly have to catch myself to simplify my communication with my co-workers?

This is not to say that my co-workers are unintelligent. However, almost all of them are Petroleum/Mechanical Engineers who don't have any formal background in technical/computational fields. Because of this, I am essentially left to my own devices as to how to implement solutions, what solutions to implement, and what to do in order to maintain our system. In terms of career opportunity, I believe this could be great, in that I am on the ground floor of what is currently on a trajectory to be a very large part of this company going forward. The direct impact that my decisions have on the day-to-day operations of this company seems a bit overwhelming for a fresh out of college, 21-year-old.

On the other hand, and this being my main complaint, I am left to my own devices **with zero guidance.** I have no junior or senior engineer to go to if I have questions. I have no precedence to follow in order to build and maintain effective solutions. The people that I have to go to for questions about our current mess are the 3rd party contractors who live 15 hours away that I am meant to replace (a situation where I could easily see a conflict of interest popping up). Basically, how do I know I'm doing anything right if I don't have anyone above me to give me guidance or structure?

I believe I have been doing a very good job honestly, but I don't really have anyone to compare myself to in order to actually judge that. Has anyone else been in a similar situation as me? How did you learn about your field effectively and what measures did you take to not make those 'pioneer' mistakes?"
x08k05,1,2022-08-28,Deciding whether to invest more time in health or invest more in my academic career,Glad-Opportunity-927,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/x08k05/deciding_whether_to_invest_more_time_in_health_or/,"Background:

A little background, I am currently in my Junior year of high school, I am a bit of an overthinker (hence why I am in this subreddit), and am taking five honor/AP classes.  I have been a straight-A student for most of my life except for last school year.  

Freshman year:

I was a freshman during the pandemic which meant that I had no one to be my person of accountability, (in the past it had been my classes) which meant that I was to be that person for myself.  This transformation caused me to have terrible habits and eventually burn myself out with my honor classes and have a sour taste about school since then.

Sophomore Year:

I initially took three honor/AP classes that year but decided to drop out of English because I found myself not being able to manage my time wisely with English and got scared when I had a ""C"" in the first few weeks of school and decided to drop out of English honors, but at the end of the year, my straight-A streak was broken when I got a ""+B"" in AP European history in both semesters. 

Junior year (now):

My mindset has changed where I would not have been scared of that ""C"" but now I find myself with substantially harder classes this year than I had the last which has made me think during class and when doing homework, ""Why am I doing this?"" 

My main concern:

I do not know what I want my career to be in the future which has led me to take classes that I am not interested in.  In the past, I have taken honor classes so that I could be able to go to a good college and possibly get a scholarship, but now I am in the position where to pass my honor classes, I have to put all my effort and attention into that again (such as missing sleep) BUT the problem is that I don't know why I want to go to college, obviously, I have been told that people go to college to pursue their careers and build a solid base for it.  I was told by my counselor that many college students change their majors but it doesn't help me feel much better because I do not have a solid idea about what area I want to pursue other than film and acting which I have no experience with (risk). 

Hence, all of this has led me to the dilemma of whether I should drop out of some honor/classes to make some more time for myself so that way I can focus on what interests me (such as film )and what could interest me such as applying for internships to see how some jobs are, volunteer more to help out my community, read books that interest me and could help me grow as a person such as ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear, ""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport, and ""The 4 hour Work Week"" or even a simple story book I like such as ""The Ballad of Songbird and Snakes"".

I've made it seems like my choice might be obvious but the problem with the first option is that it brings many risks because dropping out of some honor/AP classes might mean rejection from colleges or missed opportunities from scholarships since although I can get A's from normal classes, some colleges want more than just college prep classes.  Freedom can be terrifying, thank you for reading."
x08n7b,1,2022-08-28,What should I do?,ExtensionGas7868,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/x08n7b/what_should_i_do/,"LEAVING BIG 4

Hi. I am 22 years old currently working in a Big 4 company - tax intern. Besides that, this year I finished studying management and I also study law - 3 years still to study. Moreover, I run a small e-commerce company that gives me great profit for my age. Mixing my e-commerce earnings and my big 4 intern wage, I earn roughly more than 90% of society here in my country. When it comes to being hired as an intern in Big 4 it was really random. About a few months ago 2 seniors from Big 4 came to my university and organised Tax Competition. I won this competion. I was really interested in tax and I wanted to be tax advisor or notary in the future. The main disadvantage is that if you want to be the notary in my country, you will be around 27/28 years old after law studies and another exams and courses for notary. It is a very profitable job but it takes years to learn for it. So the first thing I wanted to do was to at least take a job in taxes because if you want to be a tax advisor, you just need to finish studies (I finished management) and take a tax advisor exam (very hard). I wanted to have at least a bit of experience before an exam so this tax competition was great for me. I am finishing my intern work within 1 month, because I had a contract as an intern for 3 months. Right now I really don't know what should I do. I really like working as a tax intern, I am performing pretty well and Im 100% sure that Big 4 will offer me an amendment to my contract and that they will take me for longer period for sure. I also know that when my academic year will start soon (in October), it will be hard to work in Big 4, study and run my business. Moreover, first month in Big 4 was really okay, but the deeper I go, the worse it gets. First thing that really bothers me is that I feel like working in Big 4 sucks my soul. It just eats me like a piece of cake and takes all of my energy into it. Let me explain. I go to work at 8:30 and work untill 17/17:30. When I come back home, I run my e-commerce - I pack all the orders, answering e-mails etc. Usually it takes 2-3 hours. While I am doing all of that, I only think about Big 4 responsibilities for the next day. I can't focus on anything else. Even when there is a weekend, I think about this work. I can't imagine what will go through my mind, if I will come back to study in October - I probably won't focus on it due to being in Big4. Even though I am performing really well, I have learned a lot etc., I feel like I don't belong here. What should I do with that? Should I:

1) Leave big 4 after my intern agreement will terminate before October, focus on studying law and expanding my business, seeking new opportunities and maybe apply for a job in a smaller law firm, that will not suck my soul up and I will have freetime and won't think about job 24/7 or

2) Stay in a Big 4 at least a few months, learn more and then resign?

I will be grateful for all of the answers.

My only goal from getting a master's would be that I get farther ahead in my career because of it, being able to do certain roles like ASIC architect, working at some company like Apple as a hardware engineer, etc but I don't know if it's worth it to go to school for that or to just grind out a few years in the industry. Is it possible to get those roles or get into those companies with just a BS and some years of experience? Or am I blacklisted and just screwing myself but not going for the masters.  

Thanks again everyone."

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?

I already had 16GB and thought I'd just buy another kit of the exact same RAM, and this worked fine with windows and linux for weeks. Then I started looking into activating secure boot to try to prepare for an eventual Win11 upgrade, but gave up. Even though I don't think that made a difference, the system started acting strange (couldn't boot 4 sticks unless on its side) and I eventually just lost usage of two of my ram slots. I've since gotten a different board from the same manufacturer and am going to RMA the old one, but now I'm having a different problem in that I can boot all 4 sticks with the XMP profile in windows again, but now can't boot linux with or without XMP. I re-watched [a video by Jay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu9U7TVNImI) warning of issues regarding 12th-gen intel and DDR5, but I think the issue may also be relevant to DDR4. Since i'm trying to avoid buying new RAM, is there some clocking strategy I can use to keep these 4 sticks i've already got and just keep booting into both operating systems?

The position pays decently (about 70k) but Living in Toronto, the cost of living is overwhelming and the amount of work is affecting my mental health and relationship.

Have you been in a similar situation and how did you manage? What can I do to find a better job but still something to help progress my career in marketing?

x0fsyf,0,2022-08-29,Need help deciding whether to take an unpaid internship before going to Uni,Gene5i5X,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/x0fsyf/need_help_deciding_whether_to_take_an_unpaid/,"Hello, I am an aspiring freshman enrolling to the CS major early next year (Jan-Feb 2023). Since I decided to start the semester next year, I pretty much have a half-year worth of free time before enrolling to my accepted uni. Fortunately, I was offered an internship (albeit an unpaid one) for a teaching assistant position at my recent high school. While I can't deny the many benefits of internships, I am having trouble deciding whether to take it due to these reasons: 

- The bad rep I keep hearing regarding unpaid internships
- This internship requires me to be at school for around 6-8 hours, not accounting for travelling times (roughly 1.5-2 hours for a back and forth car journey; mainly due to traffic rather than distance) 

Another problem is that I was initially planning to use up my free time to improve my CS skills. Since I have started doing stuffs like Android app/software development (although still a noob at it), I plan on continuing it in addition to broadening my horizons a bit by dabbling in game development (which I am very interested in). I also plan to take some online courses along the way to get a head-start in uni. However, taking CS-related internships may not be possible for me yet as I still feel underqualified for those.

So, here's my question: should I take the internship or should I just dedicate my free time into CS? If I were to take the internship, I have way less time to do CS stuff. However, I feel like passing up the offer might come back to bite me in the future(?) since internships will look good in your portfolio (plus the learning experience thing). Actually, since I already have a part-time job as a tutor, will this internship matter as much as I thought? (I never participated in an internship before so I don't know just how important it actually is)

While I am inclined to reject the internship offer, I still feel indecisive regarding this matter. Feel free to post your thoughts/replies/suggestions."

I've also held senior SWE title at my last job at a software automation startup, working with both large business client projects (end to end) and the company's cloud platform.

My grad school experience is focused on AI/ML.

With all this background, I joined a young NYC startup as an MLE intern this summer, and with the benefit of prior knowledge of performance metrics, engineering practices and all your usual SWE KPIs, I pretty much exceeded all expectations of not just an intern but a full time employee. This was pretty much my intent, as I wanted to go above and beyond to secure an early offer that somehow matches my past backend experience and my recent ML knowledge.

However, despite numerous perfectly positive feedbacks from my manager and their enthusiastic expression of interest in extending my internship into my final semester, the best offer for full-time, despite multiple negotiations, was $125,000 base with the option to buy discounted stocks for an MLE in NYC. Considering that I was basically fixing or improving every little thing in their stack with 0 supervision for 3 months, I expected better than what's not even a good new grad offer.

Am I being unreasonable? Given that I've politely mentioned all the relevant facts in my negotiations already, is there anything I could do to make this better? Lastly, should I even extend the internship at the expense of a grad level course that I could do instead?"

It seems pretty obvious that I should continue to build up my portfolio and apply for Android developer positions BUT after browsing job search website in my area I found that most of the companies are not hiring junior position anymore and instead expecting &gt;= 5 years experience even for an entry level role. Not even to say that job listings for Android dev are significantly fewer than web dev.

I am a bit insecure about my choice now. I am thinking about switching to backend development but I have only minimal knowledge on HTML and CSS, and almost nothing about JavaScript and any framework in use now.

Should I keep on doing what I wanted to do (as I am interested in Android dev) or moving to a seemingly more secure choice? Is it realistic to pick up essential stuff that is required for a junior web dev position within six months? Can't afford to be jobless after half a year cuz I am too broke :(

If I had done bachelor's degree in circuital branch, very less courses overlap with their bachelor CS programme. Applicant has to compensate with other criteria such as research, internships, work experience, some minors, extra curriculars then he/she may be accepted for Masters in CS. Doing BTech from good colleges such as IITs and BITs also helps. But it is a risk, as I have read testimonials in Quora that some students of ECE in IITs were rejected when they applied for Masters CS in USA, and their CS peers were preferred.

I have learnt some technologies and languages  till now like C, Java(including data structures and algorithms), JavaScript, full-stack development, ethical hacking, also I am exploring  Open Source currently. Right now, I was thinking of doing some  internships, hackathons, open source programs, creating some projects and other CS related competitions to increase my skills but recently got my 4th semester result, I have got a backlog in a subject. Also I have one more backlog in my 3rd semester. So, I have total 2 backlogs in 2nd year.

Now,  should I focus on extra skills and competitions I mentioned above as they are more important (in my opinion) for building my career in CS as companies see how much you have achieved beside college studies or should I, solely, focus on college curriculum (which is highly outdated) and clear those backlogs ?

As people always say one should avoid backlogs in engineering. Does these backlogs will have some negative effects (even after clearing them  before completion of my degree) at the time of placements ?

Also how will my CGPA will be affected with these backlogs and how to improve it to keep it between 8.0 - 9.0 ?

Will these backlogs be an obstacle if I ever go to abroad(US, UK, Germany etc.) to pursue masters ?"

x0p6xx,1,2022-08-29,Should I (21M) move on from (20F) or try again?,Zestyclose-Ad6874,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/x0p6xx/should_i_21m_move_on_from_20f_or_try_again/,"Hello everyone, I apologize in advance if this seems longwinded, my thoughts and emotions have been a mess for a while and I really need some advice .I'm a university student (21M). I started texting this girl (20F) a few months back, we had some good moments, I met her in person a couple of times at events, but ultimately things seemed to die out and she wasn't very receptive to me.

In most situations I understand that this is a sign to move on, cut my losses and find someone else. The reason I feel that I am so hung up on her is that I never really got a chance to show her my real personality. I feel that if I try again, be authentic with her and even if I get rejected at least I'll have the closure I need and I won't be filled with this giant feeling of regret.

The reason I feel that I didn't have a chance to show her who I really am, stems from me, and this is probably what I need advice on the most. Last year in August 2021 I got an offer for an extremely prestigious internship for May 2022. I kept that offer a secret from everyone around me, except for my family. I thought to myself ""don't celebrate too early"". But even when I started working and ultimately finished my internship this August I still kept it hidden from my all of my friends (even my really close friends). I've had this issue ever since I was young; I have no problem talking about my failures and mistakes, but when it comes time to my successes or anything good, I keep it hidden or downplay it. I see myself as a bottom-tier character so it's hard for me to accept that some good things can happen to me.

This extends further into my hobbies as well. My favourite hobby is martial arts; I train all the time, I even compete and fight. It's one of my biggest passions outside of my career, but I never brought it up with her. I recently posted a picture of me training and my best friend (whom I have known since I was 12) told me that he never knew that I trained. I never wanted to tell her all of these things about myself because I wanted her to like my personality, but I'm starting to wonder if those things ARE a part of my personality and that when I keep all of those things hidden about myself I hide my real personality and come across as super dull. I'm just really scared of coming across as a braggart or arrogant, I don't know if what I'm doing is extreme though.

Should I try again with her, but this time be more honest about myself (at this stage I don't think she knows anything really substantial about me)? All of my friends say end it and move on, so I want a second opinion. Did I mess it up too much, or is there still a chance?

Thanks

TLDR: I feel like I kept many parts of myself hidden and got rejected from a girl. Should I try again but this time be more honest?"

A while ago I applied to a position that seemed perfect. I had lots of experience with many of the required techniques, in depth knowledge of the subject, and I did an internship that was very closely related to this position. I was invited to a first and second interview. In the end I got rejected. 

All in all I am disappointed, but i get that they had to make a choice (between me and 2 other candidates) However, the reason is what keeps bugging me. You see, I am quite introvert (especially in the beginning). During the interview I was asked to give a presentation and my nervousness was very noticeable. 

This is also what they told me in the rejection letter. They doubted my social capabilities and if I was able to interact with the colleagues on the different departments I will be working with. They did tell me that my lab and writing skills were very good and I should not let this prevent me from looking for a PhD.

I have a hard time moving on from this and I am feeling extremely demotivated. I feel like almost all employers can't look past this shyness as this has also been a problem in the past. Also, this is simply my personality. It has been a problem all my life and not something I can just change overnight. 

This position felt perfect for me and if I have not found anything I like this much in over a year. I also feel that everybody is going to reject me over this in the end and a PhD is just not a option for me. How do I continue?"

My role was to optimise the flow of stretcher-bearers in hospitals. I had to mathematically model the stretcher-bearers‚Äô jobs using linear constraints and solve the problem using CPLEX. 

This involved learning about their job, retrieving and storing data from the stretchers, formatting large amounts of data from relational databases (SQL). I also had to research things such as soft time windows in order to correctly model the process as well as program a solver (OPL/Python).

x0r2wu,1,2022-08-29,I told my father to hide the keys to the gun cabinet,ReadyToCheckOut69,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/x0r2wu/i_told_my_father_to_hide_the_keys_to_the_gun/," Small intro, male 22 just told my father to **hide the keys to the gun cabinet** because I can't trust myself anymore.

Throughout my whole life, I have been **an overachiever** (the best musician of his generation, an excellent student but always sad and lonely). My family has **a big business** that they had to take care of so they never had the time for my brother (who was always more fond of other people than his only brother) or me for that matter.

As a kid, I had anxiety and panic attacks that I told my family about, but they just shrugged that off as me being dramatic and a bit of a pussy, and I remember it clear as day - 4th class of elementary school, kids running around me and me sitting still as a rock having an anxiety attack in the middle of the classroom and then for the first time in my life it hit me - ""**Why don't you kill yourself, can't be worse than this hell you're going through**"", and at that moment all my anxiety and panic went away (it was fucking chilling for a little kid to think that, but it helped). And I started to use that thought as a drug that would ease me anytime that panic or anxiety was starting to kick in (which was horrible because the idea just grew **in my head as a tumor**).

In the 5th grade, I started to fall into depression and the thing that got me out of it was music - I really got into it and became fantastic at the electric guitar. So fucking good that at the end of a 3-4 year period when I got my music diploma I was pronounced the **best solo guitarist of my generation** (that took so much fucking effort and practice that you couldn't believe, it felt good to be good at something - but all the time practicing I was again alone, which is something that has been common for most of my life, loneliness was and is my only friend).

But at last, again, **nobody from my side of the fence fucking cared or gave a shit**, when I went to high school I was always bullied and looked upon different because I was different, because of my families business (and the rest of the class thinking I was super fucking rich), my music - because they thought that I wanted to stand out from the rest, because of my physic (this was still when I was in bodybuilding and was quite big - but the reason why I was really bodybuilding was my messed-up spine and back). **So those 4 years have been also hell** and I don't remember much from that.

The thing that I remember from high school was that I picked up the accordion and became really fucking good at it (because that is the instrument of my region) but **at last again nobody fucking cared**.

Because of my ambitions at the time, my parents enlisted me in **a private university** that they pay for, at that university I have been so fucking good that I got **a scholarship**, great grades, and multiple opportunities or internships in places like the American Embassy, freelanced web-design a lot and got a lot of experience and have become great friends with a bunch of professors there. Again overachieving not thinking about myself. I remember opening up, just a tiny bit to my English Teacher at uni about how I was feeling and she could not believe me, because I have this image of a person who has everything under control and could not be happier (**WHICH IS A FUCKING MASK AND A LIE**).

I **havehad a girlfriend for 5 years now** (yesterday was our anniversary) which is about the only good thing that has happened to me, but fucked-up as I am right now I care so little and am **so numb that I'm having a hard time not to kill myself just because of her**. Just to clarify she is the most amazing person in my life, she showed me the most affection than I have ever felt, is proud of me and my achievement even more than I am (**or my family is for that matter**) - she told me that she can only see herself with myself and nobody else - and that is the truest aspect of love that I have ever felt in my life - but again as the title shows I can't stop thinking about checking out to which I have started to develop plans to.

I have freelanced through corona and at the start of my 4th year I got a job offer from an agency that was looking for me, I accepted the offer (**of course what else can I do right**). The pay that I receive there is more than any student in my country could wish for, I even like the work that I do - which is quite interesting for me and I'm quite fucking good at it - so good in fact that I received a pay raise in the first 2 months that I worked there and am receiving another on at the start of September.

My team in that agency has been **so happy with me** that my mentor allowed me to take a break for almost 2 months - because I explained to him that I had to go back to my hometown and help my family with their business which was booming in that period of the year - and because I fucking saved a project that we were working on, he 'kinda' **had to allow me that**'. - Remember that this whole time I'm going to university and studying how to be even better at my job that I'm already doing.

Just to clarify I have been working through the summer in my family's business since I was in elementary school - **every fucking summer** I'm working in the hotel or the restaurant or a combination of the fucking two.

I'm always under some kind of pressure, be the job that I have to return to, my instrument that I have not fucking touched for 3-4 years because I'm that fucking busy, my university that I'm about to graduate from (what the fuck am I supposed to do after that), the family business which I'm supposed to inherit and run after my studies (**I'm only 22 fucking years old**), my girlfriend which I'm not sure will want to come back to my hometown with me to run the family business - I'm overwhelmed and the way that **I'm coping with this is Marihuana** \- that's the only thing that has been able to calm down my fucking nerves even though I understand that weed is not the solution and even on weed I still have these thoughts that I better just end it altogether.

To make matters worse, my brother who has had gambling problems in the past has just gotten into trading and is really fucking good at it - now money has never been a motivator for me so even **if he was making 2000 euros a day** I couldn't give a fuck because I wouldn't know what to do with that money even if I had it - but then I had an idea. Maybe I can trade some money for me, **to pay the debt of my university fees back to my parents**. He took me under his wing and in just 2 days I managed to **lose 800 fucking Euros**, he said that my bad luck is un-fucking imaginable and that that has never happened to him (that's roughly the monthly paycheck that I receive from the agency - just fucking gone).

This has put me further **down the fucking hole** and even though this money that I lost isn't a deal breaker I have quite a lot more, it was the worst fucking thing for my mental state.

I have **pushed away most of my friends** because they wanted to go out with me in the past - and going out for my mental state is the absolute fucking worst nightmare that I can have. I'm living with an **empty feeling** in my chest and a **constant strain** on my belly.

I have told all of this to my family multiple times, that I'm not feeling good, the thoughts that I have, and what I'm battling on a day-to-day basis. All of this has **just been laid off**, I think that nobody wants to deal with the problems of **a suicidal child**, nor to ever think that **their child could think of those things**. And even though I told my father to **hide the keys to the gun cabinet** the last time that we spoke about my problems..... I don't think that it will be enough.

I have been making plans, **hiding pills** for my last consumption, and **shaping a knife** that should do my job. It's crazy that I look at the veins on my arm and that is the first thing that pops up in my head. I've achieved too much in this fucking life to feel this fucking bad, stressed, and overwhelmed all the fucking time, **I've looked at the world** and the way that it's going and I'm not sure that I want to bring kids into this fucking place nor be a part of it.

Now typing this **I'm seeing how ungrateful of a fucking piece of shit I really am**, I have some things regarding my family and their business that I have to take care of and after that, I really think that my time to check out might be coming.

I think it will be funny, but he was such a polite and amazing guy - happy even, how could he do that - well, **I'll show you how**. Now reading this I thought that I was doing this 'life thing' by the book, but I don't know anymore."

when   the covid hit i was in my senior undergrad year and so i decided to   take a gap year, because i didn't want to study remotely and thought   that maybe gaining some real life experience would be more beneficial. i   got a job in europe at a reputable company worldwide, interned there   for 2 months and then they offered me a full-time position. i also had   some other internship experience here and there, which accumulates to 1   year of professional non-internship experience and around 6-7 months of   internship experience.

my  question  is: since I am an international and graduating this year,  should i look  to apply to early career (new grad) positions or rather  to regular  positions? the thing is that when I apply to regular  positions, I get  ghosted or rejected most of the times and I assume  it's because I am  still in school and they are looking to fill in the  spot right away. on  the other hand though, i need to have an offer  before i graduate so that  i don't mess up my visa situation without a  job.

yeah, i hope this makes sense. would appreciate ur insights.."

My manager told me the tool I made (I completed building it) would have a lot of utility for them. Much of the projects thesis needed to change due to a recent infrastructure update that made the tech stack I would have used unable to interact with standing infrastructure. 




I just finished an internship at FAANG. I'm extremely grateful to have had this opportunity.

 Some days ago I was called on the phone and told that I did not get the return offer by the recruiting team. 

They asked if I saw my performance review and if I wanted a copy. I said sure. 

I'm looking at the copy now, and I think they had attached the ""manager only"" responses by mistake. 


Well, I see that was given a ""No"" for a hire recommendation. 






When I had started the internship, I was blocked on many things. 
We needed to change much of the project because part of the tech stack I was supposed to use did not function with their new infrastructure (they had made a lot of updates to infrastructure recently and part of that was not factored into what my project would need to interact with). 


I was given an overall positive review, with it mentioning that part of my areas of growth is something that comes with industry experience. 

Well, this was in the feedback that was meant for me to see...







For the manager only section (which I think was mistakenly sent to me), it simply says ""No"" for hire. 

What I thought was weird was that towards the end of my internship, my manager told me that the tool I ended up making was going to be used in production and that it was very important and had a lot of utility. 

I had ended up completing my project. 






The manager review was filled out 4 weeks before the end of my internship at the same time I filled out my review. 

I asked my manager if I was doing anything wrong and if I needed to improve my work standards but I was told that I was moving along well. 
But this was all the while the manager had given a ""No"" for hire recommendation.


I'm confused about this? I feel as if I'm not good enough. This was my first internship and I'll be graduating university next spring. 

Right now I feel dejected. Maybe I wasn't as good as I thought, but when I asked for feedback from both mentor and manager, it was generally positive. 

I went to the office every day this summer and gave it my all. I guess I'm just complaining at this point, but I'm just lost right now.

I've done about a year of software development studies at a tech school, self studied for awhile and got involved with a startup as an intern outside of school. There, I got to work with the apps backend api, Linux servers, docker, and running, testing, things in containers. 

I like the devops tasks much more than developer, and I like what I hear from mutual friends working in devops. 

I was thinking since aws is the most used cloud provider and has valuable certs to start by getting the aws cloud practitioner, sysops, devops pro, learning cloud formation, docker certified, kubernetes certified and spend my time practicing the tech in labs and projects to where I can do it in an interview. Hoping to get my foot in the interview door with the certs as well as a solid understanding to prove my knowledge by following structured learning like the aws certs.

I'm ahead of myself in this, most people here wouldn't take an internship at this point, though I'm already working remotely for a software company (informally, this ends in September). But most companies don't seem to be looking for someone graduating in 3-4 years. Most of my skills are self-taught. Do you think these aspects would severly harm my chances of finding a good opportunity? What I'm trying to understand is, what is my position and chances currently like?

I made about 20 applications two weeks ago. Not very modest, they were big tech companies. So far I've only received an answer for about 4-5 of them. Is this good / bad / typical? I really don't know.

[Here's my resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/wye8zc/im_a_computer_science_sophomore_trying_to_apply/)."

Come this Wednesday (the end of the month), I will be out of a job. However, my team lead is acting like I'm still going to be around. She's making references to how we'll figuring out what I'll be working on after the restructuring later this week, but I won't be here.

Should I say something? Should I ask? Should I just stop showing up to meetings on Thursday and see what happens?"

x0ynn2,1,2022-08-29,Extracurricular Advice (Junior Year),vietnamese_kid,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/x0ynn2/extracurricular_advice_junior_year/,"My ECs have been lackluster so far. I need some advice and recommendations on how I can improve my existing ones and what other activities I can do during my junior year. Here are some of my extracurriculars and hobbies thus far. I plan to major in something business-related and maybe minor in fashion.

1. clothing brand - started a clothing brand with some of my buddies. Engaged in everything from the design, marketing, social media, and business aspects of the brand.

2. clothing reselling businesses - started two online clothing reselling shops‚Äîone of them focused on archival, designer, and trending shoes and clothing while the other focused on thrifted goods. The former made around $6000 in sales while the latter made around $2500.

3. volunteering (only around 50 hours) - tutored english to asian students online through a nonprofit. organized lessons, learning activities, etc. also did other small volunteering gigs on the side

3. sewing and clothing - passionate about clothes so I‚Äôve done some small sewing projects in the past and also did some sewing for my clothing brand. plan to start another clothing brand / art collective as my sewing skills progress.

4. work - i work at a convenience store combined ice cream shop. over the summer i probably worked around 18-30 hours a week.

5. asian association club - includes organizing and volunteering for our clubs fundraisers. i plan to take a leadership position in the club this year.

6. homeless mission club - organized events and goodie bags for the homeless population around my area.
 
What are your recommendations for how I can improve on my existing ECs or use them to find new ones?

Getting a business internship and starting my own clothing art collective is definitely down the road for me. I also want to fulfill some leadership positions in my school clubs."
x0yvop,1,2022-08-29,First financial analyst interview,joemstock,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/x0yvop/first_financial_analyst_interview/,I recently got asked to do a phone interview next week for a financial analyst position. I was reading through the job listing again just so I can get a feel for what I‚Äôm going to be asked about and it states ‚ÄúSAP experience and deep knowledge is a MUST‚Äù. Problem is I don‚Äôt have SAP experience and nothing in my resume insinuates I do. I know my chances of getting a second interview are pretty slim since this is my first finance position (I graduated with a degree in accounting and all my internships are accounting based) and I don‚Äôt meet this qualification but is there any way I can answer the inevitable question about it in a way that will get them to at least consider me?

x10pf6,2,2022-08-29,Sophomore Pol Sci Major switching or minoring in CS? Is it too late? Need advice.,Legitimate-Ad-7609,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/x10pf6/sophomore_pol_sci_major_switching_or_minoring_in/,"I just transferred to Rutgers and this fall will be my first semester here. I have seen a lot of mixed opinions on Pol Sci as a major and its shortcomings in general (lack of jobs, not many internship opportunities, nothing without law/grad school). I have an interest in computers and technology but don't have any idea that doing CS (probs BA) as a double major or minor is doable. Politics really interest me so that's why I am hesitant about switching to CS completely. I have some coding experience in high school (AP CS), but due to my shit math skills, I was very demotivated in the course since everyone in the class knew what they were doing because of the higher math classes they took. As a sophomore now with Calc 1 done, is it doable to pursue a Pol Sci and CS degree as a double major or would I be better off minoring? Any advice will help a ton!"
x113eq,3,2022-08-29,What Options Do I have For Dealing With A Temper Tantrum From A Boss?,Filthy-G,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/x113eq/what_options_do_i_have_for_dealing_with_a_temper/,"After completeing my shift today, one of my superiors lashed out at me, in front of employees from another department. 

He raised his voice at me and demanded that I complete a task that had not been included in the work order, as,""we always do that,"" which is not true.

I have a had a decent relationship with him up until this point, but I am absolutely unwilling to deal with this type of behavior. I have always given 110%, and I routinely volunteer myself to complete extra tasks and pick up more hours to help them improve things. 

We are severly understaffed at the moment(with less than 50% of labor hours scheduled for the upcoming two weeks), with only a single pending application. The two others with whom I share my position have expressed frustration with poor management in general(though my boss has never lashed out at either of them to the best of my knowledge).

I am considering going to him and telling him his behavior was unacceptable, and stating that I will quit on the spot if it happens again. I am also considering inviting my coworkers, if they share my sentiment(I plan to field this to them before our next shift).

Someone suggested I contact HR, either instead of my present plan or in addition to it. I see the potential value in this, but I fear they will simply take my bosses's side and worsen the problem. 

Further, this is an on campus job at a university I attend as an undergraduate. I am in good academic standing(4.0 + dean's and provost's lists) and I have another on campus internship(paid) that I just started in an unrelated position/department.

I am concerned that this individual(and possibly HR) could damage my reputation if they wanted to, and harm my chances of advancement in other areas(other on-campus jobs + internships, etc.).

Please let me know what ya'll think of my present plan of action, what options you think would be best, and share any similar experiences.

I appreciate all and any advice/support.

Thanks"

My resume looks good as I have high level projects and the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certificate to boot, but I still get rejected by companies.

Is it really that bad? I've seen online forums where people are claiming its fine, but if its fine why am I not getting internships?"

No matter how skillful I am, I guess I could have some setbacks compared to many on this sub. I would guess most people are already from the USA, but I am actually a Middle eastern in North Africa, And as I only have like 2 summers left till graduation and I need an internship atleast one. I wonder how are the chances for me to land an internship (paid or free) in EU or USA, let alone landing a job after graduation in the West coming from the MENA ? I would be more of a headache for recruiters, immigrant so visa works, and different race/culture, couldn't that make it harder for me ? or am I just worrying over nothing or overthinking it ?  


My plan isn't to just straight away from graduation find a job in the West, I plan on multiple paths; either ML-AI-DataSci Masters/ One year of full practical training by an IT institute in my country which is pretty reputable/ hooking up with any entry level to gain experience.  


I just want to know what are my chances as an Mid. Eastern and not a western in the West specially USA for the highest financial reward."
x13uyd,123,2022-08-29,My Journey from unemployed to FANG,No_Chest7120,cscareerquestionsCAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/x13uyd/my_journey_from_unemployed_to_fang/,"I've always been a lurker in these cs career subreddits. I thought I would share my story to motivate the people that didn't start at the top, I rather started at the very bottom of the bottom. You could say I started my career in the worst way possible.

I started in another Engineering department completely unrelated to Computer Science. After 3 years and some internships, I decided to switch into CS and completed my degree in a total of 5years at one of the ""top"" uni's in Canada, I honestly don't think where you did your degree matters unless it's Waterloo coop (coop being the important part).

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated in 2019 and had 0 software internships under my belt and 0 job offers. I was unemployed for a whole year from 2019 to 2020 where I saw my peers progress in their careers and lives. A lot of the people I went to school with ended up in FANG or some other unicorn company in the States or Toronto. This was really my own fault, I didn't put in the time to even try to interview, I was sucked into a game called World of Warcraft Classic and blamed it all on the pandemic. I really got a wake up call when my gf back then broke up with me. I really thought wtf am I doing with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Job 1: Mid 2020, somehow, a local company gave me a chance in a Software Analyst role, I was expecting 50k, but they offered me TC \~63k CAD, I was so happy. This role really wasn't what I was aiming for, but you grab onto anything you can when you've been unemployed for a year. After 10months, I knew this would make my career die since there was no real software development being done. I was simply a customer relations software analyst. It did develop some social skills that I'm grateful for. This is when I discovered leetcode and I started to apply to other jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

Job 2: I've sent probably around 200 applications to all kinds of companies in both tech, finance for a software engineer/development role. I just got 2 replies, one from a big bank and another from Amazon. I thought I was on top of the world. I actually got replies!! During both interview process, I had ""done"" around 200 questions. But I put ""Done"" in quotation marks because most those questions were easy and anything above easy, I mostly just copied and pasted the answer while trying to understand... If you had asked me what is topological sort, I would have said is that even a english word??? Let's get the failure out of the way, somehow I go through the whole Amazon process and even did their virtual onsite. But that was a rough wakeup call, out of the 4 rounds. I did 1 question right and my LP answers were horrible due to my lack of experience. Quick rejection. Big bank's interview process was much simpler, it mainly consisted of some basic knowledge check in java and OOD. But even so I thought I completely bombed the interview since I didn't even know basic design patterns back then when they asked. Somehow I ended up getting an offer TC \~85k CAD.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been pretty happy with my current role, there was a lot of learning and has really been an eye opening experience. There were so many things I've never even touched before, Unit tests, Integration tests, work flow diagrams, architecture decisions to name a few. Back then, I didn't even know wtf was JIRA before I started, sprints? epics? stories? They might as well have been talking in a foreign language. Over the past year, I've really settled into my role and I have even become a mentor to new hires and interns in my company.

&amp;#x200B;

However I started to become unhappy at my job not because I stopped learning or because of my compensation level, but there was clearly an unequal distribution of work and my team got a new manager that had no idea how to manage things. For example, a team mate of mine that was hired at the same time as me worked on 1 ticket for 2.5months that was originally estimated for 2 weeks and broke the CI 3 times for that 1 ticket. Following that, he picked up another ticket worked on it for a month and just left in the middle of it to go on a 6 week vacation. The work was left for me to complete... In the same span of time (4 months), our team completed 2 epics with \~ 15 stories total. I did all the rest of the work. There is 0 responsability and 0 ownership and nothing is being done about it.

Another example of our manager, I had done a ticket that was assigned to our team outside of product area, I've mentioned it plenty during standups and meetings. There was a ticket on our board and it got QAed and there was actual prod code merge with multiple PRs. Somehow, the product manager that had asked my team to do this created a clone of the original ticket and I caught the notification. I was asking what is going on?? Is there more work to do? No.. my manager simply thought we never did any of the work and told them that. There are many other stories, but you get the gist. Moral of the story is, if you have a toxic work environment, leave and never look back.

&amp;#x200B;

Job 3: During this time, I kept grinding leetcode. I told myself one day, for sure no matter how many times I try, I'm going to get into a big tech company. A few recruiters from different FANG companies reached out to me, but I was scared, I never answered them because I thought I wouldn't pass their technical interviews. One week ended up being a month, a month ended up being half a year. I got a wakeup call after my team mate went on that 6 week long vacation and left his work to me, I was fed up, I couldn't continue working in this environment. I started to speak to recruiters from different companies to see where it would lead.

Timeline:

June: leetcode all day everyday until I was sick of it, initial talks

July: moving, not as much leetcode, had the phone interviews + online assessment interviews

August: Final push, hermit life for 2 weeks grinding \~150 leetcode mediums. I highly recommand getting premium and do the top 100 questions tagged for each company and also grind75.

End August: Final virtual onsite rounds

Result: 200k CAD offer with 2 YOE at a FANG company.

&amp;#x200B;

I was stressed out of my mind the past few months, I really wanted to leave my current job and I had no idea if I had the ability to pass the bar at technical interviews. Even before I got the job offer, the recruiter simply emailed me can we talk soon? I had no confidence on my interviews and my heart was beating at 200km/h while waiting. But somehow I did ended up getting 1 offer :)

&amp;#x200B;

Some tips for interviewing:

LEETCODE specific:

Premium and use questions tagged and sort by frequency!

Grind 75: Covers most concepts: data structures, algorithms, [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75)

Initially if you don't know anything, don't try to solve it yourself. You are just wasting your time, go look at the solutions and start doing problems with the same solution pattern. Ex: Monotonic stack, start with something easy, once you understand the concept. Apply it to other questions. Then take a few days of break. Come back to those questions, do them from scratch. Rinse and repeat. This will slowly allow your brain to recognize patterns in the questions.

&amp;#x200B;

System design: [https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)

Also for system design, definitively go on youtube and just search for the most popular things:

How to design tinder/instragram/spotify/google maps to name a few.

Prepare stories for behavioral questions. Some companies really like to grill you on those!

&amp;#x200B;

TL DR: My journey wasn't easy, you see all those posts of new graduates that end up earning 300K right out of school. Those are the exceptions and not the norm! Everyone follows a different path. Don't compare your level 1 to someone's level 20. I started in a different major, ended up being unemployed for a year and somehow got a FANG offer in 3 years. If I can do it, you can too."
x1485i,115,2022-08-29,Feel like there‚Äôs a lot of paranoia on getting into the right companies. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs justified,TemporalCoral,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/x1485i/feel_like_theres_a_lot_of_paranoia_on_getting/,"Not here to flex, but if that‚Äôs what you take out of this, go crazy then I guess. 

I was a mechanical engineering major who went to a state school. 3.2 gpa. Kinda put the bare minimum into life. I realized I needed to get my life together like early junior year. So I started getting into coding. Added a cs minor to my education track. Got a software internship at a no name small company of like 6 people. Got paid dogshit tbh but fuck it, it‚Äôs experience. 

I kinda just hoped that the minor and the internship were enough to pass the resume screening. I could practice leetcode until I killed every oa and onsite, which is what I did. Did like 700 problems. Def overkill. I looked at the solutions a lot at first since I kinda had to as a someone with little DS&amp;A experience. But eventually a year later I got good at it. 

Now I‚Äôm sitting on multiple faang offers and joining one in a couple of months. I get it. Only sample size of 1. But it‚Äôs interesting to see people post things like ‚Äúcan I get into faang if I went to a state school/have a sub 3.5 gpa/am not a cs major/only have one no name internship?‚Äù

Like literally all of those things applied to me and I had no problems. There‚Äôs no catch. My dad‚Äôs not the ceo of google. I‚Äôm an US citizen Indian male. There was no resume fraud or anything. Literally just grinded to get that first internship just to have something and then grinded leetcode. Like that‚Äôs all you have to do imo. Amazon for sure will give you a shot at least at an OA. Use that offer to leverage other ones."

There is no room for growth and leadership is blind to the issues we are facing. There's also been a mass exodus of talented engineers and PMs leaving and I don't want to be here when the ship eventually sinks.

I'm currently enrolled in a certification course that I'm hoping will help me properly start my career in the direction I want. They offer internship opportunities to gain practical experience and have a lot of connections in the industry. When I first was looking for jobs I did not have the practical experience which is what, I feel, kept me from moving on in the hiring process. However, I feel pretty confident about getting hired after the course (many of my friends and colleagues have gone through the same)

However, the course is long and I'm not sure if I should stick it out at my current job and start job searching after I'm done or, jump ship while the job market is still kinda good and figure it out after I've completed the course.

Any advice or insight would be appreciated, thank you!"

Am I just an unattractive hire?,Mayro_Biscuit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/x182kw/job_is_offering_measly_40k_yr_for_junior_react/,"Background: I am a University newgrad with a 4-year Bachelor's in CS from a state school. 3.48 GPA if that means anything. I've been on the job hunt for a while but with little to no success. I'm either too underqualified for jobs IF they respond. Otherwise they have my resume and I don't hear back from them ever again. I didn't take any internships while in college so I don't have any ""work"" experience. Not to mention the job hunt gets even harder when companies post mid to senior level positions labeled in the Entry Level category. And I don't want to work for one of those places where they train you and then lock you in for 2 years with a threat of a large fine.

So anyway, I found a listing that advertised 40k for a junior React dev. I did a React site in college with some others that worked when hosted, so I felt like I could handle it. When I applied, they actally responded asking for an interview. It's been a long time since I've been asked for an interview. I might take it, even if it's just for the experience. I know I'm getting underpaid, but what choice do I have?"

I'm a junior in college majoring in psychology, but I have no idea if this is what I want to do in life. Everyone around me seems to know what they want; whether they're already studying for the MCAT, on the EBoard for a club, or talking about their aspirations and goals. Meanwhile, I can't ever comment on what I want to do. When someone asks, I simply say I want to go into clinical psychology.

This is a lie. First of all, how the f am I supposed to know whether or not I like a career without ever experiencing it first-hand? All I have under my belt is listening to psychology lectures and studying for hours for exams. That's it. And of course, in the comments you could recommend me to do shadowing or an internship, but what happens if I realize I don't like it? The soonest I could realistically do so would end up trailing into my senior year of college, where the biggest decisions have to be made. At that point, it's too late for me to switch a major or do anything different. I'd have to commit.

And then-- what haunts me the most is that I'll hate my future job. I'm so scared of being dissatisfied with my life that it had always kept me from wanting to pursue certain things. Realistically, I have many interests, and I'd be totally willing to learn new things, such as a new programming language or pursuing visual arts in cinematic production. I feel like I'm good at many things but I'm not an expert in any particular field. Again, I'm so incredibly indecisive and frightened by the ticking clock of my undergrad years ending soon that I'm too scared to take any new risks.

So my main concerns are:

1. How does one learn what they excel at, or are talented at *and* simultaneously enjoy what they do?
2. How do I know I'll be happy? What if I'll get stuck doing something I hate, upon realizing it years into my PhD track?? How tf do you make a change in your life *that* late? 

I feel very alone and lost. For now, I'll proceed with my psychology courses."
x18wru,0,2022-08-29,Ridiculous low credit limit on HSBC credit cards,Tyloo_wNv,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/x18wru/ridiculous_low_credit_limit_on_hsbc_credit_cards/,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

My partner recently applied to HSBC world elite credit card. She's been working for a few years (\~$80k) but recently she's on a full time graduate study so her income was around ($40k) in the past year from her internship. Today she got her card but HSBC only gave her $1000 credit limit.

&amp;#x200B;

Her credit score is about 850/900 with two credit cards for many many years.  Last time she applied for a card was probably back in 2016. She barely uses her credit cards so the max usage rate is about \~20% with overall $10k credits adding up two cards. And she always paid the bill in full amount, every time. The card application asks for a individual income of 80k or household 150k. She put about $60k on her income and a way-beyond-requirement household income from me.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any reason why she gets such a low credit limit on her new card? $1000 is ridiculous and can barely buy anything. She applied for that card to save foreign transcations when we tranvel around the world but this credit limit makes it useless. Can she ask for a credit increase on day 1?"

*For your consideration, here's a pilot for a series about people who build things on places where they shouldn't.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Jinmai advised against Pavlo Kravchenko when he tried to change clothes after the two passed through the airlock.

""I won't do that if I were you, intern,"" Jinmai said, taking off his helmet and replacing it with a fur hat, ""Sorry for the temporary inconvenience, my boss is denser than the neutron star.""

After a short walk through the station's office district Pavlo soon realized the reason. Jinmai stopped at a door with a thin frost on the surface, and scanned his ID card to open the door. The door revealed a short corridor behind it, and belched out a thick fog. Jinmai rushed Pavlo into the corridor before any more fog could spill into the office district.

The corridor past the door was freezing cold. If Pavlo could look into any mirror without a thick layer of frost, his would see him puff out a white fog from his steaming head. He could feel already feel his sweaty hair become cold like a wet towel just few steps into the place.

""Oh, I almost forgot. Need this?"" Mr. Jinmai asked Pavlo with a spare fur hat from a coat hanger. Pavlo obliged. The two walked down a short corridor, and Jinmai knocked on a door second furthest from the entrance. A potted plant - or what seemed to be one - was placed right next to the door. The dead plant was bare, frozen stiff and brittle to the touch. The door creaked open just by knocking it a couple times with Jinmai's knuckles.

""Come in."" A voice said from the inside.

""Good luck."" Mr. Jinmai patted Pavlo on the shoulder, and went separate ways to disappear into the next room to the end of the corridor.

The room wasn't spacious for the highest ranking individual in an architectural consulting firm. On the other hand, it was still big enough to hold a dozen bookshelves, each filled with hundreds of tablets.

""Are you wondering why I'm not in the big room next door?"" The man asked, his eyes still fixed on the display on his own desk.

""I think I saw another person walk into the room, Mr...""

The man's table had a plaque that read: ""Ookashira Jinmai"". The man walked out of the desk to reach Pavlo.

""Ricci. Andrea Ricci. This used to be Jinmai's room until recently, but we are using each others' rooms for short time... for reasons."" Mr. Ricci said, shaking Pavlo's hand. ""Call me Andrea, Mr. Ricci, whatever. Just don't call me Boss.""

""Understood, sir. Umm... Mr. Ricci, why is this office... so cold like this?"" Pavlo asked, watching Andrea use an espresso machine. The whole machine started to release steam in the cold, as if it were on fire.

""You saw the planter right outside this door?"" Andrea asked Pavlo as he handed over a cup of espresso.

""Sure, what about it?""

""I brought it here when I got it as a present. It was from a species I recently worked for in a construction project. Building a windfarm plant to be perfectly impervious to frequent wildfires. The delivery was delayed because of some technical issues, and when it reached here, enough time passed for the plant to self-pollinate and mature its seeds inside the package. Unfortunately, that potted plant had something to do with the reason they asked for my expertise when they were building those windmills in the first place.""

Andrea emptied the small espresso cup in a single gulp.

""Its seeds are small, but it is attached to a much bigger ball of fine lint. The smallest air current can make them drift away in midair.""

""Like a dandelion?"" Pavlo asked.

""Close, but with a ball of cotton instead of a tidy umbrella. A room in a space station has subtle air flows anywhere. At the moment I opened up the package without hesitation those seeds flew out of the package and followed those air currents, and ended up in places where they shouldn't. For example, into the air ducts in our office's climate control systems.""

Andrea continued his explanation while he brewed a second cup of espresso.

""The fluff on those seeds aren't technically cotton. They don't fluff themselves with just good old cellulose. It's made up of vac-cing nitrocellulose.""

Pavlo almost spitted out his coffee. Flash paper?

""Metal, right? When wind blows, their plant releases seeds covered in nitrocellulose all over the place. When the seed dries up, something happens in its outermost skin to spontaneously burst into flames. A single stalk of those plant can burn down an entire grassland. It kills all competition, and fertilizes their hilariously barren native soil. A plant that does slash-and-burn, you could say.""

Andrea sniffed into his second cup of coffee.

""Someone should come be here to fix the burnt up climate control system... someday. In the meantime, I'm using this smaller room while Jinmai is using what was my room. The wall on my back is the only part where this room touches the outer hull of this station, while my old room...""

Andrea abruptly stopped as the two heard a sneeze across the wall.

""...has three sides to radiate heat into outer space.""

Pavlo warmed his cheeks with the empty cup, still warm from the coffee it was holding.

""Mr. Pavlo Kravchenko, was it? Can I call you Pavlo?""

""Sure, sir.""

""Got it. Welcome to the Brunelleschi Backseat Builders, Pavlo. We help people build structures with one criteria and a million complications. You want more?""

""Sure, thank you, Mr. Ricci."" Pavlo said, as he handed over the still steaming cup to the person who he will be working for as an academic intern from now."

I haven't officially taken any classes about statistics or machine learning, only taught myself about ML by reading 'hands on machine learning with scikit-learn and tensorflow',  'Mathematics for machine learning' and first few chapters of 'all of statistics', hoping to start 'Intro. to statistical learning' after these months. 

So currently I know the basic ideas of stats and fundamental ML algorithms but am unable to understand it in a statistical way / math-heavy equations. However, I don't see myself understanding the math by teaching myself, so I shall study it seriously in coming semesters.

A brief background of what I've learnt/done:

1. languages: Python(sklearn, pandas, some TensorFlow), java, C, SQL
2. projects: two projects to show on CV, several Kaggle competitions (currently ran out of ideas)
3. experience: research internship at school for past 5 months, didn't do much work though
4. BI: slight experience in Tableau, will learn more about it later

so for the coming few months, I am wondering is it beneficial to get some certificates from cloud provider: Azure / AWS (cloud practitioner, solutions architect, hopefully ML specialty) to apply for internships, is it a huge boost for DS position nowadays? Or should I be focusing on something more fundamental that I skipped?

After graduation, I didn't immediately start seeking out a job because I didn't want to work in my field so I started doing courses to transition to UI/UX but kept hearing taunts by them that all your class fellows have jobs and you're doing nothing, this went on until I recently got an internship in this field and in the beginning they were happy as they were fed up of me staying at home all the time but now after only a week, they have again started complaining that why are you doing an internship in a startup, you could have gotten a job at a bigger company, all your class fellows have well paying job and you're still at such a junior level...This all sucks because I know I have low self confidence but them nagging all the time doesn't help it either, it's making it worse for me to handle it. I also understand that I wasted an year to try to search for relevant jobs cause I wasn't sure what I wanted to do after graduation. Not to mention the fact that I was a very bright student till college so my parents had no complaints from me ever and I was like a star child which turned into a disappointment of an adult after university and this all weighs down on me so much that I can't even do one thing right. This is probably why I self sabotage and have anxiety as well but in their eyes, ""I'm fine and you're underestimating yourself"" Yes I may be underestimating myself but why can't they see that their words hurt me a lot too? Why do they always have to compare me to others if they want my happiness?"

Most of the people I know already have paid internships at companies, while I just have a low-paid thing at my school. I haven't really been qualified for what I applied to so far, and it's been kind of stressful. At this rate, Im probably not going to have an internship this spring/next summer. I was hoping to get into FAANG when I graduate, but I feel like I'm inadequate and already so behind most other people here and elsewhere. My projects aren't complex - I only ever made a sudoku webpage, and I've been working on my personal website on-and-off for the past few months. I know you're supposed to come up with projects that solve problems, but I can't come up with any problems to solve. Plus, I've seen other people's projects, and they're way more original complex than mine, even the ones I was considering doing. I haven't practiced much leetcode and I'm only now about to take data structures this upcoming semester, when I see so many other people already know the ins and outs and also get high scores on code signal etc. I also see people make heavy six-figs and show of their WFH setups/apartments and it makes me feel so bad about myself. I know it takes time to get to where they are, but they were often times rather than not doing more than me when they were in my position. How do I handle this?"

x1o0pp,45,2022-08-30,The Property Up North,tropical_rabbit,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x1o0pp/the_property_up_north/,"We went up north for an end of summer vacation before our last year of college. My friend Sam‚Äôs grandparents owned a bunch of land in the upper peninsula somewhat near Paradise that included a nice lake and a cottage, and they were kind enough to let us use it. I was talked into coming here after Jenny broke up with me the day before we were supposed to go on a road trip to Florida.


We had a great time those first two nights. There was lots of laughter, fun, and alcohol. This morning I awoke with a mild headache next to Phoebe in her bed. She did a wonderful job helping me forget about Jenny last night. She was still sleeping so I put on some clothes and headed downstairs for breakfast.¬†


I looked out the window-filled wall and could barely see the lake through the morning fog. Sam was already in the kitchen eating a bowl of Lucky Charms. He looked up and smiled at me. ""Feeling alright this morning? I think we went through half of our beer supply last night.""


""I'm sure I'll be good after breakfast."" I said as I gathered some eggs, cheese, and bacon for breakfast. ""How about you?""


""I've already been for a run around the lake this morning. I‚Äôm feeling great. It sounded like you got plenty of exercise last night though."" He said with a wink.


""My bad, I guess the walls are pretty thin here. Probably just a one time thing though,"" I said.


""I wouldn't be so sure of that. She's been waiting for you and Jenny to break up for a while now.""


‚ÄúI‚Äôd be happy with a few more nights like last night, but we‚Äôll see where it goes.‚Äù¬† I began making a big breakfast for everyone and enjoyed the peace and quiet of the morning.


A little bit later, Todd and Gretchen came down the stairs and entered the kitchen. ‚ÄúGood morning!‚Äù I said.


‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre awake from all that activity last night,‚Äù said Gretchen.


‚ÄúOh man, you heard us too,‚Äù I said lowering my head.¬† ‚ÄúWell, maybe a good breakfast will make up for it.‚Äù


‚ÄúHey, I can deal with that if you cook us breakfast every morning,‚Äù said Todd. Gretchen and Todd grabbed plates and silverware for everyone while I finished preparing the breakfast.¬†


Phoebe came down last. ""Nothing better than the smell of bacon first thing in the morning,"" she said as she walked past me and traced her hand across my lower back.


I dished out food for everyone and we all sat around the table. After some discussion, we came up with a plan for the day. We were going to pack lunches and go for a hike through the woods to explore the property. Then we'd take the boat out for a while and finish the evening with a bonfire. After breakfast we all went our separate ways to get ready for the late morning hike.¬†


We met up on the deck in front of the lake once we were all ready. It was a beautiful view looking over the private lake surrounded by trees. There was a dock in the water with the small pontoon boat that we had taken out a couple times already. Sam said that his grandparents owned about a square mile of property that ended at a state park, so there was plenty to explore on our hike.


The weather was much cooler than usual for this time of year today so it was a perfect day for a hike. We chatted about what we wanted to do after graduation as we walked through the evergreens and oak trees. Todd and Gretchen were planning on moving to Chicago together. The company Gretchen had her internships with had already given her a job offer that she accepted.¬† They were looking forward to being able to walk home from the bars and told us to come visit anytime once they get settled.¬†


Todd looked over at Sam and me and said, ""Maybe I‚Äôll take my time finding a job. Then you guys can come over and we can play video games and drink all day while Gretchen works.""¬† This resulted in a smack on the arm from Gretchen.


Sam was planning on staying in Michigan to help his Dad with the sign shop he owned. Before Phoebe or I had a chance to talk about our plans, we came across a large pile of small bones and partially eaten animal carcasses.¬†


""Ew, that is disgusting,"" said Phoebe, ""what is that from?""


""Birds?"" guessed Todd.¬†


Sam grabbed a large stick and pushed it through the pile. Some of the bones disintegrated and a cloud of dust went into the air. Sam started coughing as he unintentionally breathed in some of the dust.¬†


""I think I just inhaled a squirrel,"" he said through fits of coughing.


The rest of us quickly moved away so we wouldn't have to breathe in the dust cloud too.


""You all right buddy?"" I asked Sam.


He finally stopped coughing, but seemed to struggle to breathe normally again. ""I think so,"" he said, ""but my chest burns when I breathe in.""


After letting Sam compose himself, we moved on. There was a thin trail of dead animals and bones that continued on the way we were headed; smaller piles of bones were also scattered here and there. We all thought it was odd, but wanted to continue on our hike.


Soon we came to an area filled with birch trees. ""They all look dead."" I said and ran over to one with a hearty ""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"" as I pushed it over. It made a satisfying crack before breaking and falling to the ground.


""Hercules, Hercules!"" Shouted Sam, while clapping his hands. Then he walked over to a huge white birch tree.


""No way you're getting that one over by yourself,"" said Todd. He started walking over to help. Sam pushed on the tree and his hands busted straight through it right as Todd got next to him. This caused the tree to start tipping towards them. They quickly tried moving out of the way, but the tree crumbled like it was made of sand. It knocked them to the ground and covered them and the air around us with a thick dust.


We ran over to help them up and tried not to breathe in the dust. Both of them were fine other than a few scrapes from falling on some rocks.¬†


""I took a mouthful of it."" Sam said as he tried to spit it out. ""It feels all fuzzy in my mouth."" He grabbed his water bottle and gargled some water before spitting it out.


We all began brushing the dust off our hair and clothes and then tried to help Sam and Todd, who¬† had gotten the worst of it. They tried to rub it off, but it only served to smear it more across their faces.¬†¬†


""Let's head back and get cleaned up, I don‚Äôt like how this feels in my hair,"" said Gretchen. ""You and Sam look like ghosts with it all over your face.""


Everyone was in agreement so we began heading back toward our cabin without stopping for lunch. We went past the pile of dead animals again, but it looked larger than when we first passed by an hour or so ago.¬†


""That creeps me out,"" Phoebe paused, ""did it get bigger?"". She walked closer to me and leaned in to me.


I put my arm around her waist and gave it a little squeeze. ""Looks like it. Let's get out of here.""¬†


Our path back must have diverged from the path we took on the way out because we soon came upon a small lake. There were long reeds and cattails around it and it looked a little swampy.


Sam stopped. ""I'm going in,"" he said. ""I've got to get this off me. It itches everywhere, I can't take it anymore.""


""That water looks disgusting!"" said Gretchen. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just wait until we get back?‚Äù


""And it is probably full of leeches."" Phoebe added.


Sam ignored them and set his backpack on the ground. He took off his shoes and socks, ran into the water, and dove in with the rest of his clothes on.


""He's crazy,"" Phoebe whispered to me. ""That water is disgusting and probably full of bacteria.""


I grabbed the extra shirt out of my backpack and used it to brush more of the dust off Phoebe‚Äôs clothes and then she did the same for me.


After a few minutes went by, Todd walked closer to the lake. ""Hey Sam, hurry up. It is starting to bother me too, let's go back,"" he said.


I looked back to the lake and looked at the calm water. When he didn‚Äôt surface, we all ran toward the water shouting his name. I scanned through the shallow water, but didn‚Äôt see him.


‚ÄúShould we go in?‚Äù asked Phoebe?


‚ÄúGo in where?‚Äù Sam said from the left side of the lake.¬†


There was a moment of silence as I‚Äôm sure everyone else was just as confused as I was seeing Sam appear.


The silence was finally broken by Todd; ‚ÄúWhere the hell did you come from?‚Äù¬†


Sam just stared at Todd and didn‚Äôt respond.


‚ÄúHey! I said where did you come from?‚Äù said Todd.


Gretchen pulled out a blanket from Todd's backpack and wrapped it around him.¬† Sam grabbed it and then just stood there like he was waiting for one of us to lead the way.


‚ÄúUm, aren‚Äôt you going to put your shoes back on?‚Äù said Phoebe.


Sam looked around and when he saw his shoes and socks, he went over and put them on. After he was ready, we started back to the cabin. ‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù I said to Sam.


‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôm good,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go back.‚Äù


I‚Äôm sure the cold water had affected him, but I was still weirded out by how none of us saw him get out of the lake.


We were mostly silent the rest of the way back and I kept getting the feeling that someone was watching us. I didn't express this feeling, but I think the others felt the same; I saw them stop and look around at various times on the trip back.¬†


Sam was struggling to keep up, but I checked on him every so often so we wouldn't lose him.


When we were almost back to the house, I looked back again to check on Sam, but he was gone. I stopped and yelled his name a few times.


""Hey, wait up!"" I yelled to the others. ""Sam fell behind.""


""Can you guys look for him?"" asked Todd. ""I'm covered in this stuff still and I need to get it off.""


""No problem,"" I said.¬†


Gretchen, Phoebe, and I walked back and started calling for Sam. We walked for a while back towards the small lake that Sam had jumped in.


""Listen,"" said Gretchen. ""I think I hear someone coughing.""


We ran towards the sounds and found Sam sitting on a log just outside the lake.


After he finally finished coughing, he looked up at us and said, ""Why did you guys leave me‚Ä¶and where are my shoes?""


""What? We didn‚Äôt leave you‚Ä¶you came with us and then fell behind,"" I said. ""Why did you come back?""


""Very funny,"" said Sam, ""you guys were all gone when I came out of the lake.""


‚ÄúMaybe that dust messed with your head,"" said Phoebe. ""Let's just get back to the house.


We stayed together this time, but didn't say much on the walk back. Once we were back inside the house, Sam grabbed a beach towel to dry off and said he was going to lie down for a bit before taking a shower.


""That was weird,"" Gretchen said. ""I'll go check on Todd down here and you two can use the shower upstairs.""


""Sounds good,"" I said.


I followed Phoebe upstairs and said, ""You go first. I should go check on Sam and try to figure out what‚Äôs going on.""


""This is too weird, I don't really want to be alone right now. Besides, I could use a little help making sure I get all this stuff off me."" She grabbed my hand and pulled me into the bathroom with her.


She turned the shower on and we carefully took off our clothes, piling them neatly on the floor to avoid spreading the dust. She grabbed my hand again and led me into the shower with her. Most of the dust had been on our clothes, but our hair was pretty covered with it. We took turns scrubbing our faces and washing our hair and then she told me to check her body for any more. I inspected her body closely and rubbed my hands across her smooth skin until I came across a rough patch on her lower back. It felt like sandpaper.


""Did you find something?"" she asked.


I looked her over another time and then rubbed the rough patch again. ""Just this one spot,"" I said. I picked at the edge of it. ""Does this hurt?"" She shook her head no. ""Okay, I'm going to try to pull it off."" I pulled at one of the edges and it came off like a band-aid.¬†


She let out a small yelp. ""Sorry, did that hurt?"" I said.


""Kind of. It reminded me of the first and only time I waxed my legs.""


I pulled her over toward me out of the water and looked closely at her back. About a hundred tiny drops of blood appeared on her lower back, like when the doctor pokes your finger to get a tiny blood sample.


""What is it?"" she asked.


""You‚Äôre bleeding a bit, it must have dug into your skin. I'll put some antibacterial cream on it when we get out.""¬†


""Okay, let's get you checked out now."" She said and proceeded to slowly explore my body with her hands. You're all clear...and apparently ready for action.‚Äù¬† She grabbed onto me and started kissing me.¬† Her tongue felt strangely rough, but I was quickly able to look past that.¬†¬†


When we were finished, we grabbed our towels and dried off.¬† I found some antibiotic cream in the cabinet and rubbed it on her back.


A few seconds after I finished, she yelled, ‚ÄúOh my god! Ow, it burns! Get it off, get it off!‚Äù¬†


She fell to the floor crying. I quickly turned the shower back on and helped her in. I grabbed the soap and scrubbed the cream off as fast as I could.¬† I helped her get out and dried her off carefully. Her lower back was all red and blisters had already formed. She was still sobbing as I wrapped her in her towel and walked with her to her room.¬† She laid down carefully in her bed on her side and I told her I‚Äôd be back with a cold towel.


A scream brought me down the stairs at a quick pace. I ran over to the bathroom and knocked on the door. ""What is it?"" I yelled.


Todd opened the door wearing a towel with blood dripping down his face, neck, and arms. Gretchen was standing in the bathtub covering herself with a towel.


""Oh my God, are you all right?"" I asked.


Todd grabbed another towel and started wiping the blood off. ""It looks worse than it feels,"" he said.


""Phoebe was bleeding a bit after I pulled one of those things off her back,"" I said pointing to the pile of moss-like strips on the floor. ""Don't put any antibiotic cream on it. I put some on Phoebe and it burned her.""


""Sorry for the scream, I didn't expect to see that much blood when I pulled open the curtain,"" Gretchen said.


More blood began to slowly bubble up on the hundreds of tiny holes poked into Todd's body.¬†


""What the hell are those things? It just looked like dust when it covered us. I only had some on my hair, but luckily I didn't have any of those things on my body,‚Äù I said.


""I don't know, but it hurt like hell pulling them off,"" Todd said.


""Gretchen, did you get any on you? You know, I could check you over if you'd like,"" I said trying to lighten the mood.¬†


""Hey,"" Gretchen said,""there's a cover charge to see this nice of a show.""


‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt have any on her,‚Äù said Todd.


""I'll go grab the first aid kit so you can get bandaged up."" I said. I went to the kitchen and rummaged through the cabinets.¬† After locating the first aid kit, I raced back over to Todd and Gretchen and gave it to them. ""Remember no antibiotic cream."" Todd gave me a thumbs up and closed the door.


I headed back to the kitchen, grabbed a towel and loaded it with ice from the freezer. Then I noticed a wet trail along the floor and over to the stairs. I followed the trail upstairs and saw that it led towards Sam‚Äôs room. Before checking on him, I stopped in Phoebe‚Äôs room to see if she wanted the ice. She had fallen asleep still wrapped up in her towel. I lifted the towel to look at her back; the blisters had gotten worse and yellow pus was oozing out of them. I covered her back up and then went back into the hallway, closing the door behind me.


I went up to Sam's door and knocked. ""Hey Sam, you okay in there?"" I said.


No response. I knocked louder this time and raised my voice, ""Sam, are you okay?"" I grabbed the handle and opened up the door. The handle was all wet. I pulled my hand away noticing the blood on it and then burst into the room, ""Sam!"" I yelled and looked around. The shades were down and the room was dim. It looked like Sam was lying in his bed covered with a thin blanket staring up at the ceiling.¬†


""Hey, are you alright?"" I asked. He didn't respond and continued to stare at the ceiling.


""Sam!"" I yelled.


After another minute, he finally moved and slowly turned his head to look at me. Then he opened his mouth, but didn't say anything.


I took a step closer to the bed and was about to say something when I realized that it wasn't a blanket on him. His skin was covered with fuzzy tendrils that were slowly moving like tiny caterpillars reaching up for a leaf.


His eyes got big and he looked really scared. Then he opened his mouth even wider and¬† let out a loud burp. I quickly retreated back to the doorway as he vomited out a thick cloud of dust.


I slammed the door shut and ran back down the hallway to Phoebe's room. She wasn't there. ""Phoebe,"" I called out.


The reply I received was a piercing scream coming from the bathroom. I ran down the hallway and pushed through the door to find Phoebe crying and holding onto something by her mouth. When she turned toward me, I saw blood dripping down her chin. She opened her mouth and there was another one of the rough moss-like things partially attached to her tongue. It was much thicker than the one that had been on her back. She tried to say something, but it only resulted in more blood coming out of her mouth.¬†


‚ÄúDo you want me to try to get it off?‚Äù I asked.


She nodded her head up and down and let go of the growth. I grabbed onto it and started pulling it gently at first. She screamed in pain and shook her head no. She made a motion with her hands that looked like pulling a bandaid off fast. ‚ÄúYou want me to pull it fast?‚Äù I asked to confirm. She nodded her head again and then grabbed onto the counter for support.


‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶one. Two. Three,‚Äù I said and then pulled it as quickly as I could. Her head jerked to the side as I pulled and I could feel it getting stuck before it finally came free. Phoebe crumpled to the floor. I immediately felt the thing grip onto my hands.


I tried to shake it off, but it hung on to my hands tightly. It wouldn't let me let go of it. It felt fuzzy on my hands and I could feel it latching on to me. I kept trying to pull my hands apart and was finally able to pull my right hand free. It moved in a wave-like motion on my left hand and looked like it was growing and beginning to split in half.¬†


I looked on the counter for something to pry it off with and saw the antibiotic cream. Leaning my arm on the tube, I was able to unscrew the cap. Then I squeezed the entire contents of the tube on top of the growth.¬†


It immediately reacted to it, with bubbles forming on its surface. One part of it was starting to lift off my hand. I walked over to the bathtub, thinking I could scrape it the rest of the way off with the metal faucet. Suddenly it felt like hundreds of needles were stabbing into my hand. I shouted in pain and started scraping it against the faucet.¬† After quite a few scrapes, it finally came off along with some of my skin. It fell to the bathtub floor and squirmed as the bubbles on it grew bigger.¬†


I quickly closed the shower curtain and went over to Phoebe. She had stuffed a towel in her mouth to stop the bleeding.¬†


""Let's get out of here,"" I said. The bubbles on that thing look like they are going to burst.""


I grabbed her hand to help her up and we rushed out of the bathroom, shutting the door behind us.


We stopped at the top of the stairs. Sam was standing just outside his room watching us. I whispered to Phoebe that she should go downstairs. She nodded her head and slowly went down, watching Sam with a concerned look as she went.


I stared back at Sam waiting for him to say something. He didn't look fuzzy like last time and had the same clothes on from when he was in the lake. I waited a very long couple of minutes, but he remained silent.¬†


I backed down the first couple of stairs keeping my eyes on him. ""Sam,"" I said more to myself than to him. ""What the hell is happening to you?""


He didn't say anything, but took a few steps towards me. I went quickly down the stairs and found Phoebe with Gretchen in the living room.


""Where's Todd?"" I asked. ""We have to get out of here.""


""He's resting in our room,"" said Gretchen.


Sam was moving slowly down the stairs. ""Let's grab him and get out of here. I don't think that is Sam coming down the stairs,"" I said.


Gretchen ran down the hall to their bedroom. I saw our car keys on the kitchen counter and quickly grabbed them before running to the front door with Phoebe.


Gretchen screamed. ""Hey, you scared me Todd,"" she said.¬†


""Guys, hurry up!"" I shouted. Sam was at the bottom of the stairs. Luckily he was moving slowly, but he was only about twenty feet away‚Ä¶and I just noticed that he looked bigger than when I saw him outside his room.


""Todd stop! What are you doing?"" shouted Gretchen.¬†


Just then, the front door flew open and Todd was standing there still wrapped in his bandages.


""Guys, that isn't me!"" he frantically shouted.¬†


Gretchen screamed again and ran into the living room bumping into Sam. A cloud of dust flew out of him and he fell back a few steps. She kept running to us and we all made it outside, slamming the door behind us.


Todd was coughing like crazy and leaning on the railing.¬†


""I've got to go rinse off,"" said Gretchen. ""That dust got all over me when I bumped into Sam.""


She ran down to the lake and jumped off the dock. Phoebe and I followed her with Todd stumbling behind us as he continued to cough.


Gretchen came out of the water holding her arm out to the side. I could see something growing on her arm.


""It won't come off,"" Gretchen said.


It had grown a lot faster than the other ones had. I figured it may have had something to do with it coming off of Sam, or whatever that was that looked like him, instead of from the trees.


I heard a thump behind me. Turning around, I saw Todd on the ground. He began dry heaving in between fits of coughs.


""This thing is digging into my arm,"" said Gretchen. ""Help me!""


Phoebe had lost the towel during our escape outside and I could see fresh blood on her chin. Everyone was in need of help except me, but I was struggling to figure out what to do next.¬†


Then Phoebe ran over to Gretchen and began tugging at the growth that had spread across her entire arm.


Todd was convulsing on the ground and I watched in horror as he vomited a large fuzzy growth out of his mouth. It was about a foot long and it immediately slithered across the ground towards the woods and burrowed into the ground near the trees. Todd rolled over on his back and was wheezing and gasping for air.


His mouth was moving like he was trying to tell me something. I cautiously stepped back, afraid he was going to spread dust like Sam did earlier.


Finally, he started making some sounds and in a raspy voice he said, ""I'm losing control.""


""Losing control of what?"" I asked.


His mouth started twitching and his eyes were darting side to side and up and down. He closed his eyes and clenched his fists.


""My mind‚Ä¶it is taking over my mind,"" he said.


He rolled awkwardly onto his stomach and tried to push himself up, but fell back to the ground.


""I'm not doing this,"" he said.


Gretchen screamed in pain behind me.¬†


""Get out of here‚Ä¶and keep Gretchen safe,"" Todd said. ""It wants to hurt you.""¬†


He started trying to stand up again, but fell back down and rolled onto his back.


""Please go now,"" he said. ""I'm not me, I'm not‚Ä¶come over here.""¬†


I backed away further from Todd and glanced over at the house to see Sam and the other Todd walking towards me. Sam was moving faster than before.


""Let's get on the boat,"" I said. ""I don't think we can make it around them to the car.


Phoebe had successfully helped Gretchen get the thing off of her arm. It was motionless on the grass, but looked even bigger than it did a few minutes ago.


""Todd!"" Gretchen shouted. ""We have to help him!""


""I don't think we can,"" I said.


Phoebe grabbed onto Gretchen and started pulling her towards the dock. Sam and the other Todd were now running towards us. I looked back when we got to the dock and they were almost to where the real Todd was. Phoebe started up the boat and I went to work unwrapping the rope from the cleats on the dock.¬†


""Hurry!"" Gretchen yelled. ""They're going to get us!""


Todd pushed himself up and collided with Sam and the other Todd just as they were about to go past him. A thick cloud of dust flew into the air as the three of them tumbled to the ground.¬†


I finished freeing us from the dock and pushed off of it while Sam and the two Todds got up and made their way to the dock.¬† Phoebe pulled the throttle all the way back into reverse, nearly sending me flying off the front of the boat.¬†


They stayed on the dock and watched us go towards the center of the lake.¬†


""Who's that?"" Phoebe mumbled in a barely intelligible voice. That growth must have really damaged her tongue. She was pointing to a girl who was sitting in the grass¬†


""That looks like me,"" said Gretchen.

x1s0ap,1,2022-08-30,"I‚Äôve been a bad sister, how can I help and bond with my brother before it‚Äôs too late?",One_Resolution5328,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/x1s0ap/ive_been_a_bad_sister_how_can_i_help_and_bond/,"I‚Äôm 18F and my brother is 16M. Today I left for my sophomore year of college. I asked my brother if he‚Äôd miss me and he said ‚Äúprobably not.‚Äù. He always seems withdrawn nowadays and I didn‚Äôt take it seriously, teasing him he‚Äôll miss me and the likes. Usually he‚Äôd crack a smile but today he didn‚Äôt smile one bit. He elaborated on why he wouldn‚Äôt miss me, saying I don‚Äôt do anything around the house when I‚Äôm there and he does all the work. Then he said it‚Äôs the same whether I‚Äôm there or not.
Then on the drive to the airport my dad told me my brother broke down crying in the car shortly after our conversation because he felt bad but he really wouldn‚Äôt miss me and finally revealed that he‚Äôs depressed and has anxiety to my dad, something I tried to get him to do before (though half assed) and failed. It seems like he doesn‚Äôt trust me anymore. Before I talk about that though I have to explain our dynamic.

We used to be really close, I‚Äôd tease him but I knew a lot about his life and stuff and we‚Äôd do things together. Fast forward to 2-3 years ago. I started to excel at school, I always had pretty good grades but I was getting school awards, then regional and national, getting into my dream Ivy League college. My parents were ecstatic. My brother felt overlooked and with good reason. He was struggling at the end of middle school due to bullying from his teachers and his entire class making fun of him. My parents forced him to go different high school from his middle school friends cuz they had an ‚ÄúAP program‚Äùduring COVID and it got wayyy worse. He was struggling to even pass, he knew nobody in school to work with and all his middle school friends slowly cut him off. My parents were always yelling at him for doing bad in school, asking me to help, etc.
I know I should have done more during this time. During COVID despite being in the same house for almost a year, we barley interacted. I‚Äôd be on my phone and He‚Äôd be on his computer. When my parents asked me to help I tried but it stressed me out to keep him on track with his HW especially with my then undiagnosed ADHD, which I learned about a year ago. 

When I was getting constant praise, it hurt my brother severely. With his struggles, I think he felt like my parents were subtly saying why can‚Äôt you be as good as your sister. Today, He told my dad he felt like my dad favored me, always buying me whatever I wanted and helping me out with deep cleaning my room, etc. i noticed it a little bit, when we were in the car at church after thanksgiving and my brother commented on how my mom spent the whole time praising me and said barely anything about him.

It‚Äôs a lot to explain but I had a troubled childhood, from having no friends and widely disliked in school from 1st-9th grade (from 5th grade I had friends but they were all actually bullies and my self worth was so low I didn‚Äôt care/realize) to my dad having severe psychotic manic episodes when I was 9-13 and sexually abused me during that time, though he doesn‚Äôt remember. When my dad did things for me, I mentally considered it payment for what he did to me and didnt think about what it looked like to my brother. My mom constantly criticized me for my lack of time management skills, messiness, and micromanaged my home life, also repressing my attempts to do extracurriculars and hang out away from home. The things I got later awards and praise for they‚Äôd constantly tell me are a waste of time. 

When I went to college, I think I failed him. After I went to college, it felt like my life changed for the better and I wanted to leave my shameful home life behind. I called him maybe 5 times over the whole year and 3 of those 5 I was probably asking him for something. I cared about him, but I didn‚Äôt show it when he desperately needed someone to care. 

During the summer, I had two internships and was home twice, 4 days at a time, aside from our week long family vacation. Whenever I was home I was wrapped up in my own stuff and didn‚Äôt prioritize hanging out with him. I tried to watch shows with him but I‚Äôd flake on him to talk to my friends and he would just watch it without me. I reassured myself thinking since he never said anything he didn‚Äôt care. 

But really I knew he was depressed. My brother was always a little quieter, but nowadays it‚Äôs bad. He‚Äôs always gaming, withdrawn from everyone. Half the time he‚Äôs in his room on his bed. He has friends but I think they‚Äôre mostly school friends, which I know what that feels like. Exactly how I was at my lowest point. One day on vacation, I noticed his Lock Screen. It was a black screen that said smth like ‚Äúnobody cares about me. If I disappeared who would notice‚Äù. I broke down crying realizing he might even been close to ending it, which I really hope this doesn‚Äôt get to. I‚Äôd urge him to join clubs and getting a job, secretly hoping it would help him build the social network he needs but he doesn‚Äôt see the purpose. He acts like he doesn‚Äôt care to meet people but I think secretly he gave up. I tried a bit, but still for the most part did stuff on my own because I had a bunch to do before going to school and it‚Äôs hard to manage it all with the ADHD. If I‚Äôm running to the gym last minute there‚Äôs no time to ask him if he wants to come. I‚Äôve been trying to self improve form physical health to career, but I think in the process I‚Äôve become self centered and not appreciating his or my parents efforts to clean after me and do chores.  

After today that all feels selfish. I‚Äôve been so wrapped up with my own goals I might be on track to becoming an only child. I know I want to call him once a week now to show I care but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs enough. Today he told my dad how he felt like we all overlooked how hard he worked to set up for my graduation party and how he doesn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd even care to come for his. I‚Äôve really taken his giving nature for granted. I‚Äôve tried to talk to him and help him with his struggles once or twice, but he never opened up. I mentioned how his phone screen worries me and he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just from when I was in sad boi hours‚Äù but still didn‚Äôt changed it. I think I‚Äôve been treating him like a burden then my only brother. What do I do?"

It's been a snowball effect and even women who initially were attracted end up losing it because they can sense my lack of enthusiasm. 

This is all due to not having a positive feedback loop or many relationships with women in my developing years (teens/early 20s) and now even though I look and dress good I don't have that reference point in my life so I basically have the experience missing in my code.

How do I break this cycle?

I have social skills because guys gravitate to me easily (I look like a cool dude) but with most women it's really stiff like they're unsure for some reason.

x1v7tr,24,2022-08-30,Is trading still a good career choice for fresh graduates?,Trade_r,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/x1v7tr/is_trading_still_a_good_career_choice_for_fresh/,"Background: I'm a graduate student in a target university (Harvard/MIT/Princeton/Stanford/Columbia) majoring in applied maths &amp; finance. I've already had one internship in BB (MO quant), one machine learning research internship in a big bank, and several research projects in finance.

My feeling: I sometimes feel that the job market for FO/quant research roles is overcompetitive (too much demand for a decreasing number of roles), so you end up doing 10 hardcore interviews for an insecure job that is not always intellectually stimumating or revenue generating for the firm. A lot of people told me that finance jobs attractiveness is dropping among top talents, and that tech/healthcare/climate related jobs (data science/ML research) are the new sexy jobs of the 21st century. When I look at all the companies and sponsors of the university, there would be plenty of investment banks &amp; hedge funds 5-10 years ago, but now every sponsor/school project is about climate change/data science/healthcare, with a very small number of hedge funds.

During my internships at the bank (quant BB), I felt that the technology used by the bank is very old (excel 2003, a lot of manual stuff), I didn't feel to be in an innovtive environment because all the (stochastic) models were created an implemented in 2008-2010, and most of the current job consisted in recalibrating parameters/managing the risk, or working on model ""details"". In other words, I felt that the business is already well established, revenue generating and highly regulated, so new joiners don't have the same impact they would have had 10 years ago. During my ML research internship in the other bank, I also felt that the team was simply using tools developed elsewhere (tech companies) to apply them in finance. People in the bank didn't necessarily understand these tools, and I didn't have the feeling to be in a creative/innovative environment (i created a lot of new tools, but I felt that it wasn't the right place to do it).

I was wondering if being trader or quant in the buy-side was still a sustainable career choice in 2022, compared to a data science/ML research job in a tech company, with a similar compensation and the feeling to be at the forefront of innovation.

I have only had a very few number of experiences in the field (no buy side/FO sell side experience) so I wanted to get your point on views on my thoughts. Thanks :)"

A little background about me; I am currently a senior at a large public university and I am a part of their business honors program. I am majoring in finance with a minor in economics and I am expecting to graduate Spring 2023. I currently have a GPA of 3.8 and I am the Vice President of a professional Business and Engineering organization on campus. 

I have taken a while to finally decide where I want to go in the finance realm and that is asset management. I had an internship after my freshman year at a commercial real estate loan company, but I was unable to land an internship during the  Summer of 2022 after applying to around 100 positions. 

As a part of the business honors program I have to get and internship and take a class simultaneously to reflect on the internship. I also feel like I need more work experience before applying for jobs. I am currently trying to find non profits in my area to work for during the school year, but I also don‚Äôt know what course of action I should take to set myself up for a career in asset management. I would want a part time internship during the this semester (Fall 2022), winter break, next semester (Spring 2023), or even during Summer 2023 if that is all I can get. I honestly am pretty lost on what I should focus on right now and discouraged from last year as I put a lot of effort into my internship but had no results. 

If anyone has some relevant advice or even criticisms I would be happy to listen!!

Thanks in advance."

Because of that I decided to take a gap year and go to university fall 2023 instead of this year.

I‚Äôm nervous and not sure if I made the right decision to build up work experience for a year before going to school. It was a great financial opportunity as well since they‚Äôre paying 70k which will help a lot when I‚Äôm in school.

I got this job through a portfolio I‚Äôve been building up for the past 4 years, I have tons of side projects and freelance work.

x1x24a,3,2022-08-30,I just started school and already want to quit,Crafty-Winner-637,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/x1x24a/i_just_started_school_and_already_want_to_quit/,"It's the middle of the night while im writing this. I have to get up early tomorrow to go to school and im already dreading it.  


I dropped out of my old school last school year because i wasnt happy with how a lot of things got handeled there. My grades began to drop until I just didnt care anymore. From what i could tell i was burned out. At first I just didnt know what to do until my mom and i rediscovered a school i had actually considered attending the year before but decided to stay at my old school even though it was already going downhill at that point. I had a really good friend at my old school but i still decided to drop out and repeat a year at my new school.  
I just started. Today was literally the second day of school and i already feel like this wasn't the right decision.  
My new school is focused on arts. You have a lot of subjects focused on arts so its usually pretty late when i get out of school. The school is also quite far away so i have to take the train and the bus there. That means my parents can't drive me there if i ever miss the bus or train. On top of that the public transportation in my country is not very reliable. Today i missed my train because the bus that was supposed to drive me there which is also a replacment for another train was 15 minutes late. Yesterday the same. My train ended up being late by over half and hour. Because of this i end up being home even later. Idk how i am supposed to handle this. Being home this late and on top of that learning for school. How am i supposed to do that?  


From what I've seen so far the school is more relaxed/easier in some aspects and more stern in others in comparison to my old school. The learning environment also seems to be much better.  
My classmates all seem pretty nice. Im not one to approach people so I've only interacted with them if they talked to me first or if it was necessary. I used to be quite extroverted but because of a lot of bad experiences with kids my age i became more and more closed of. Adults are fine in general but teens/kids are a real problem. It can be a random person walking by me on the street and i get anxious about them. My social anxiety also spiked up again today in class. I ended up trembling, my heart speed up and i felt like throwing up.  
All of this overwhelms me. I came here because art is smth i enjoy but never wanted this to make my career even though a lot of people told me so. But now im here. I had the first official class related to art today. It was horrible and what really makes me believe i cant do this. We have to do a project in each class and i really cant see myself attempting or even completing it. The others either already had ideas or definitely seemed to receive this better than me. Its not even just this class. I can and at the same time can't express why that is. I hate textil design but even if it was another class i couldn't be motivated or passionate about it. At this rate im definitely falling back into old patterns again.  
All of trouble i have to go through to go here seems to be not worth it. I have to do an internship at my school to. Im way more thrilled about the internship than the actual school especially since the internship is closer to where i live. On my first day of school i wasnt excited for the subjects about art but other ones like English. But even those seemed to fail me today.  


I came here with the option to do smth else with my degree once i was finished which i had originally planned. I wanted to become a nurse... smth practical. I also had other ideas but that was one i actively considered.  
My mom worked her ass of for this. She made so many arrangements just so i could go here. She drives me to the train station when she can and looked up everything. What is she going to say? I'm not only a disappointment to her but myself too. I'm a nuisance.  
I want a stable and independent life. I feel like school atleast like this isnt for me. I dread the idea of it. I think i actually want to work. Even just spectating the class and not even interacting with the teacher and students is a nightmare. I tried to push these thoughts aside but they consume me more and more and i dont think i can go to bed without writing this down. I think im going to see how this week goes and then talk to my mom on the weekend. I think it's better to end this early and maybe do a year of odd jobs instead of unnecessarily dragging this on. I dont think this degree is going to get me where i want. 

Sorry for my poor grammar, formating and the long text. I just had to get this of my chest.

It would be nice if you could leave your thoughts on the situation."
x1x2s3,131,2022-08-30,Bootcamp Vs Degree: From someone who did a bootcamp and now pursuing a degree,SetCrafty,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/x1x2s3/bootcamp_vs_degree_from_someone_who_did_a/,"TLDR: If possible, GO TO SCHOOL. Bootcamps are expensive gambles. If you really insist on doing a bootcamp, you must be ABSOLUTELY sure that the specific bootcamp you attend will set you up for success. 

Couple things though before I start. I am male, live in the U.S., and currently in my early 30‚Äôs. I understand that not everyone gets the opportunities I get. But I just wanted to give my personal experience with my CS journey so far and perhaps it pertains to you as well.

I wanted to give my insight on people who may be thinking of joining a bootcamp or for those who are on the fence about going back to school. Most things here are nothing new, but just thought I‚Äôd add my input as someone who actually has done both in a consolidated post. Just like many of you, I was drawn in to a bootcamp by the promises of saved time and money I‚Äôve read and heard about. I mentioned this part in a comment on another post. After completing a bootcamp, I can tell you that in my cohort, only about 20% of students are doing anything tech related today. Out of those 20%, majority of them already had technical degrees or experience. So in reality, less than 10% were people were people  who were looking for a complete career change with limited programming experience. This is all from Linkedin and perhaps there are a couple more people who did make it and are not updating their profiles. But the fact that so many people aren‚Äôt working a programming job to this day should be alarming given that we all spent a good chunk of change with aspirations to break it in the field. I understand not every bootcamp is like this, and perhaps some are very successful. But wanted to mention this is an outcome that could happen in the one you join. Overall, I wanted to lay out reasons why people want to do a bootcamp, and why I think school is a good better choice if you are on the fence it.
 
**Why people want to do bootcamps and cases against them**:

1) **Cost**: It‚Äôs dramatically cheaper to do a bootcamp right? In reality, I don‚Äôt think so. Bootcamps range from 10k to 20k. For most of us, if we are investing that much money on anything else, wouldn‚Äôt we expect more guaranteed return (unless we degenerates on the stock market lol)? The certificate itself doesn‚Äôt hold much value, and I already mentioned in my particular bootcamp, only about 20% made it. But say you join a bootcamp that even 50% make it. 20k to spend on something that you have a coinflip chance of an opportunity? I‚Äôm not a true fan of those odds either. I doubt 50% of the people in the bootcamp were just lazy, especially since we dropped a shit ton of money to do it.
 
Now the case for school when it comes to cost. Given how expensive bootcamps can get these days, I think it‚Äôs more worth it to spend up a bit more for a degree that companies will still give more value to. There are also things you can do like start out at a community college and then transfer to your local state school to save money. In my situation, I am pursuing my masters. I wasn‚Äôt a CS undergrad, so I had to take some undergrad courses before beginning my graduate courses. I would say overall this degree will cost me bout 30k. But one thing to keep in mind are internship opportunities. You can generally only qualify for internships if you are pursuing a degree (at least in the U.S). This can help offset the cost AND get your foot in the door. I got an internship over the past summer that paid about 32K (Including housing comp. I had a friend who lived near the internship. He gave me a major discount on rent so I got to pocket most of it). This came out to be over 24k after taxes for 10 weeks of work, maybe a little less if the housing comp gets taxed. This was NOT at a MANGA company. Just a typical large company. I believe the more competitive tech companies will pay you even more. But as you can see, I paid off a huge chunk of school with the summer internship.  I was also offered a spot for a job for after I graduate, but I wanted to explore one more internship first at a tech company before I commit to anything. The networking and relationships I built were also very valuable. Also, since I didn‚Äôt work last year (this is a caveat, I know not everyone can do this), I received a grant that pretty much paid for 70% of this years tuition. Something to think about as well.
 
2) **Learning in demand skills without the fluff**: Argument is that instead of wasting years of more senseless theory courses, you are getting right to the source technology that will get you job ready. IMO, the information goes way too fast for most people. You won‚Äôt be able to grasp most of it to be job ready. If you don‚Äôt have any programing experience before, you are really trying to learn three major concepts at once: learning the basics of your first language, learning programming fundamentals, and learning a specific technology. I‚Äôm probably missing something in between, but you get the idea. In school, you probably spend about 2 years getting down the first 2 concepts. Even then, students struggle at schools. So imagine trying to get all three of those down in 3 to 6 months. You really aren‚Äôt going to and are probably going to be weak in one or more of those concepts. In reality, not many people can actually grasp everything. It has nothing to do with how capable you are to learn programming. Most of us just aren‚Äôt built to succeed in a situation like this. If you aren‚Äôt the type of person who was able to learn fast and just grind everyday to meet your goals, don‚Äôt expect that to change just because you join the bootcamp. It‚Äôs just not enough time for most people to be able to stay completely focused and actually absorb all the information.

3) **Time**: Besides cost, this is probably the biggest one. Some of you guys have families to take care of or other responsibilities where you only have a short window to sacrifice. When it comes to time, can‚Äôt really argue. However, if you are doing a 3 month bootcamp, you will have to quit your job and spend every single day committed to the camp. At the end of it, nothing is guaranteed. If you do a 6 month bootcamp, sure you can still work. But you are still sacrificing every weekend and every hour you‚Äôre not working. All that mental energy and time on top of work for something that is not guaranteed. I understand that a degree also doesn‚Äôt guarantee anything, but I doubt you will have difficulty finding a job eventually. In the case of my bootcamp, 80% have not found a programming job 4 years later. There is no ‚Äúeventually finding a job‚Äù. When you get a degree, you always got the foundations to learn thing on your own quickly and the clout of the degree. I know one student who was bragging about how he got his first job doing the bare minimum in school.  To me, it was really nothing to brag about given that if applied himself at school, he‚Äôd make twice that even if it‚Äôs not a top tech company. But when you go to a bootcamp, you are competing against many 4 year university students for these jobs and they will be hard to get. Another student I got acquainted with at my school has a 2 year old son. He works during the day and takes night classes. I‚Äôm rooting for his ass so hard since I can‚Äôt even comprehend the responsibilities of having a family. But at the same time, it seems like he is taking it slow and will ramp up his studies during the tail end of his education. He sees the overall value of the education even though it will take time.
 
**Degree is truly not an option**: 

I get it. Even if these are good cases to pursue a degree, you still might be in an impossible situation and can‚Äôt commit to a 4 year university or a shorter masters program. At the end, it is still technically cheaper and takes way less time. Then you better make damn sure you know all about the bootcamp you are joining. Talk to actual people who know who have completed the EXACT bootcamp you are interested in RECENT TIMES, not like 5 years ago. Know their backgrounds as well. How extensive was their network already? What kind of experience did they already have? Are you in a similar situation as these successful people?  Also, make sure it‚Äôs the same exact bootcamp and teacher that taught the successful cohort. A bootcamp brand can be good in Chicago but terrible in Los Angeles. Within the bootcamp, the teacher can make or break your experience. This is VERY VERY important. Make sure they really do care about you succeeding and provide you with many resources and opportunities to make it.  If after you researched all that, really REALLY make sure you are ready to do the bootcamp. It‚Äôs pretty rough, and you may think this time you will try hard once in your life. But be very realistic about who you are as a person. Don‚Äôt expect to have an epiphany to turn your life around just because you joined this bootcamp.

**Final thoughts**:

If you are serious about this career, you‚Äôre better of going all in and getting a degree to dramatically increase your chances of success. If it‚Äôs a cost issue, I would really look into how much it will cost to do things like going to a community college first and transferring vs bootcamp. Or if you already have a degree, maybe look into a masters program. Keep in mind that there will be a chance to get a paid internship that will help offset the cost and possibly save you a spot for a job for when you graduate. If it‚Äôs a time issue, truly think about whether you have to be job ready in 6 months or if you are just getting drawn into the advertisements. Perhaps think of taking your education slower. Try studying on your own first. Maybe take a programming course at your local CC and see if you even like programming. It would still be cheaper than just committing to a bootcamp blindly. Worst case, you find that you don‚Äôt enjoy programming for a fairly low cost and time commitment. Best case, it can now be credited toward a degree.

Finally, just wanted to say I really hope you all succeed which ever route you take. Be aware though that even if you pursue a degree, you will still have to be on top of your shit. Personal projects, networking, and studying interview questions are still very important and can make your experience more worth it. I obviously have high bias toward school. But the core idea is that I just don‚Äôt want you guys to blindly jump into something that takes a fairly large commitment without truly exploring all options available. Good luck out there!"

Here's my context, I'll try to make it as short as I can. I graduated as an Architect four years ago just to find out that this area was absolutely dead in my country.  
In the last few years I've struggled to be a freelance graphic designer/illustrator, which I actually love doing and I believe I am competent at. But I've been struggling to get consistent jobs/employment because I'm really bad at finding clients and have very little ""proven experience"" aka ""worked in an actual company"".  
So I started a Systems Analyst graduation to pass the time during lockdown. Which is sort of fun when I'm exploring and learning things most of the time. I love computers, and I do want to be a half decent programmer some day so I can make dumb little programs, UI customizations and simple indie games.  
The plan was to take it as a hobby and hopefully have a plan B in case my career path dies out and I need to start over again.  


Now that lockdown is over, I'm hiring a headhunter to help me finally find a stable job. So I have to make a very difficult choice regarding which path I should to take. And I'm really struggling about this.  


I can either stay in graphical design/illustration. Which has fewer job openings and lower wages.  
BUT I already have a good experience and know-how, AND I have much more affinity to.  
IF my head hunting agency manages to find a decent stable job in the area, I can use it to get actual proven experience, networking, experience, contacts and grow from that, and thing's will be fine.  
But it's not guaranteed that they'll find something like that.  


OR I can drop this thing I actually know and do well to, and restart my career over in IT. Which has a lot more oportunities and highter wages. BUT I feel absolutely unprepared to work in, I have zero experience, no internship and less affinity to it.  


I like the idea of learning how to program, but I'll be honest. I'm crap at it, I can make calculators and small text adventures on an IDE but never managed to finish a single project for my github.  
I want to learn how to create THINGS on a computer, but I don't have the skill/knowledge to do more than a semi-decent webpage. So if i'm ever hired, I'll have to kind of learn A LOT on the job.  


MAYBE I could try to work on something that blends both areas like web design/development or UI Design. Because even if I'm not a code wizard, I do have a rare set of skills. Designers with more than basic knowledge of coding and tech isn't all that common even if I'm not really awesome at it at the moment.  


I have to decide what direction I want to take until next week. So my decision is:

  
Do I make the ""harder"" choice, and stay on the area I have more affinity and experience but that has less opportunities? Things can work out in the area if my head hunter can find me a decent stable job that I'll be able to grow at.  


OR do I take the ""easier"" choice and jump ship? Abandon everything I've built in the last four years to be basically intern level in whatever company would hire me? I've been told by friends in IT that it isn't all that weird to hire semi-competent people for junior positions and let them learn at the job.  
But I'm not sure if i'm ""semi-competent"" and I still am very insecure about taking any responsibility.

OR do I can take a middle path and go for an IT niche where I can use my design background as an advantage?  


I'm willing to work with something that's not EXACTLY what I love doing since I have to earn some money. But at the same time, I'm afraid to just take the ""immediately easier"" choice and end up miserable in an area that I have zero affinity and thus am very bad at.

  
I'm not looking for someone to answer that for me but any good advice and experiences you guys could share might be very helpful. I don't know many people who can actually give me sound advice regarding this."
x1xcah,11,2022-08-30,Last year I was rejected by all my choices. This year I don't want to make the same mistakes and really need some advice (Profile eval and school selection),belowaveragetechie,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/x1xcah/last_year_i_was_rejected_by_all_my_choices_this/," 

Last year I applied to 5 schools and was rejected by all of them. I was too proud of my achievements and the clout got to my head. I made lots mistakes in my applications (Even calculated the GPA incorrectly). Even though my LORs were amazing my SOP was mediocre and I didn't put as much effort as I should have, on top of this I only applied to top-tier schools both in the UK and US. The months following my last rejection were quite depressing but since then I have been trying my best to improve my resume to increase my chances of getting into a good Master's program.

Here is my new profile:

* GPA: 3.9 (Calculated from my graduation transcript)
* Internships 2 - 1 in Google, 1 Research Internship which I completed in July
* 2 years of experience in Software development (Part-time during my undergraduate studies)
* TA/Lead-TA positions held at university (One in a master's conversion course)
* Extracurriculars: I lead a team 2 other students to develop a project management platform for a covid-19 response group, which received recognition from the UK government. Student consultancies from UCLA, UCB, BU etc use the platform.

A few months after I got rejection from my last school, I got my results for my dissertation (4.0) and as a result I was offered a research internship by my supervisor. It is a joint project between multiple universities which is funded by multiple BIG companies and I think the UK government as well. (It's a very big project and a lot of people are working on it). As a result of my performance I was offered a Research Associate role, which I accepted and have already started working. I have also been given the opportunity to present some of my work at a conference (It is not a research paper).

This year I don't want to make the same mistakes I did last year. Compared to other I understand now that my profile lacks a lot of things. So I don't make the same mistakes again.

I have selected UCLA, UCB and Columbia as my dream universities. However, I'd really appreciate some suggestions on which universities I should apply to in the US (I do have a list but I'm really anxious this time round and don't want to misjudge my potential and chances again) and some feedback on my profile as well would also be highly appreciated.  
Also this year I would ideally like to apply to around 8-10 universities in the US.

Thanks a lot."

I am mid-career (old) and began my part-time masters program in Sept 2020. I have participated in two different cyber related internships. 

The first one was a part-time virtual one with the (US) Virtual Student Federal Service Internship with Army Cyber. This was only 5-10 hours a week, consisting of meetings and research. My group worked on compiling data about the cybersecurity workforce, university programs, and how the Army‚Äôs civilian positions pay, benefits and roles compared with private industry. I learned a lot about different cyber roles and some details from the cyber recruiter side. Also interesting discussions on cyber in the military. I know that this program has spots in many federal organizations. 

My second internship was also virtual at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which is located in WA state (US). I was lucky enough to create a flexible schedule at both my full-time job and the internship to do both for the summer. I do not do a lot of cyber experience currently so really wanted an internship to gain some hand-on experience. I am also interested in cyber as it related to the electric utility space. I happened upon this opportunity by posting a question to an utility-cyber forum, asking for assistance in choosing a capstone project. This lead to discussions with a cyber engineer from the Lab and then to the internship. This was an excellent experience, where I worked on project around electric vehicle-grid cyber, some CTF beta testing and building out cyber tabletops related to attack scenarios against utility devices. As one project was looking at applying zero trust, it was nice to learn some of the real details behind this buzzword.

I know everyone‚Äôs situation is different and I‚Äôm lucky to be able to work these opportunities into my learning, but highly recommend it for anyone else who can also make it work. I also understand I probably had an easier applications since I had some related industry experience, but in both internships most of my peers were younger undergraduate students from a variety of programs ‚Äì soldier going part-time, community college student, full-time at well know university. So I know that getting the internship can be difficult but keep trying, they are out there."

I started a completely REMOTE internship about 6 months ago and after just 3 months I was offered a remote full-time job. It's a very large corporate financial business. I work on a really smart team and play a big role in the Java web apps as I'm the only one who knows it on my team. (Mainly a COBOL position but we have some OO stuff) 

Anyways I wasn't worried too much since I was new, but now that is been about 6 months fulltime I don't know how to feel about procrastination or work ethic. I'm assigned tasks and finish them very quickly as I am a fast learner and dedicate myself. HOWEVER, I never know what to do once I am done. If I ask for more work, I'm worried I'll start being given a larger workload. Im paid by salary so obviously it's not going to change my pay and since I'm getting MY assigned tasks done, I don't think im dishonest for feeling this way. There is an infinite amount of work so I dont see the reason in taking on more work because I'll just end up doing it next Sprint. I just feel sooooo guilty sitting around on my phone all day for hours because I have my stuff done.

I feel like this is a silly thing to complain about but I would appreciate any advice on what my mindset should be and what I should be doing from now on?

I should say that right now I'm making enough money to comfortably live on and my team seems to like me and my leader hasn't told me to step it up or anything. Meaning, I'm perfectly fine but I just feel bad for not constantly doing something.

I go to WGU and hope to finish my CS degree by the end of this year. I have no work experience like none at all, and also no internship experience. I applied to a bunch of places for internships but didn't even get an interview. I guess at this point the only thing I could do is work on projects and fill my empty resume up with projects and talk about the various skills I used on those projects in my resume. What else could I do to show experience and fill up my resume. I've heard that these days they will pretty much reject you if you have no relevant experience and I have no experience forget relevant experience. Also I suck at leetcode but I'm practicing, but my goal right now isn't really to get into any of the big companies I just wanna get a decent software engineer job as soon as I graduate."

Was just wondering if anybody else was finding it difficult to get internships for summer 2023? I'm Canadian but have interned at 2 notable companies and had a better response last year with my single notable internship versus after my current internship which is a well known name. 

I'm not sure if it's the fact I'm canadian and therefore would require sponsorship and am not legally able to work in the states without it, or if it's just because of the tech market being down and thus extending that pressure onto internships. 

It's kinda disheartening to see, since after 2 years of solid work on building my resume, working at great places to feel like I'm back to square 1 with No OAs, getting ghosted and straight resume rejections.

Would really appreciate your thoughts!"

*During my undergrad I have gone through depressive episodes and have certainly faced a lot of problems also concerning health and had a surgery. *


Covid really weakened my learning during sophomore- junior year. And In my senior year, I just thought of graduating. 

But going into Master‚Äôs I have motivated myself to get serious and change habits like waking up at 5am, working out, and setting out studying hours.

Anyways I started master‚Äôs today and went to see professor who I had been working for as an unpaid research intern during undergrad. I set an appointment and reached his office.


I was humiliated. I guess for the right reasons.


He asked me what I was there of, and I told him respectfully about restarting my research.  He replied infront of other students, saying why should I keep you in my team, so that you‚Äôd disappear again for few months? 

I replied that I take full responsibility and this time it‚Äôs different but his response was that you said that last time.

Well it‚Äôs true, there have been times when due to mental health I stopped my research and focused mainly on my health and pushing for graduating as an undergrad, but in masters I wanted to start my first day with a different mindset yet got rejected by the same professor who was excited and motivating when I got into the program. 

He told me to find another faculty as I have broken his trust and I don‚Äôt deliver.

This setback really upset me today and I did contemplate life for hours. 

Words are everything. It can definitely make or break a person.

I have alr cleared my credit bearing internship requirements in Y2 via ATAP.

Plus I‚Äôm looking to get more exp in a specific tech role and possibly get a conversion offer.

One possible workaround would be to do a part time intern stint in Y4S1 (I estimate I only have ~28MCs left by then, so I can underload 8-12MCs in one sem). But some people, including CFG advisors, told me that its difficult to get part time intern jobs especially without doing a full-time stint at my desired company first. 

The other possibility is to take LOA to do an internship full time. But I‚Äôm not too keen on delaying graduation any further, and don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs any repercussions if I do so.

So I don‚Äôt want to pass on the offer, but I‚Äôm also worried my resume won‚Äôt be strong enough if I don't get another internship and grad with only one relevant internship during my 4 years. Not sure what to do. :/"

Would it be better to renege early on before the start date and risk not getting a job by January? I could also quit after a few weeks if I do get a better offer for a January start date. I could also work until the end of December and then quit but I don‚Äôt know if that makes it any better.

I guess I just need to vent and also need some support or reassurance that my feelings are valid. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking or being too sensitive. 

I(27F) am a registered mental health counselor intern seeking licensure. I work as a substance use counselor at a community agency who also sees mental health clients (without substance use). I have 35 clients on my caseload. I see most of my mental health clients 1x weekly except one who I see 2x weekly since we are doing trauma work. I see most of my outpatient clients biweekly except for 4 who request to see me 1x weekly. I also run two 1-hour groups. 

I work 40 hours a week for $19/hour or $39k annually. No overtime allowed. I can‚Äôt afford my rent and still need help from my dad. I‚Äôm so grateful for him but it sucks bc I should be able to pay my own bills by now. 

Some of my mental health clients have severe and persistent symptoms, (e.g., schizophrenia spectrum, BPD, antisocial PD, C-PTSD, suicidality). Many need additional support outside of the session which my agency expects from me. My client with BPD is very overwhelming. I‚Äôd get to work to see they left multiple 5 minute voicemails that shifted from long angry, racist, offensive to I‚Äôm the best therapist ever to I‚Äôm the most useless therapist, and on and on. It has just been a lot for me and I had minimal support from my supervisors. 

Today I shared with my supervisor that I‚Äôm feeling a little overwhelmed- it was actually the director and not my immediate supervisor bc she‚Äôs on PTO for two weeks). She said, ‚ÄúReally? You don‚Äôt have that many clients on your caseload. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre getting assigned new clients but if you can‚Äôt do that I‚Äôll reassign them. You‚Äôre supposed to have 30 clients scheduled each week. 10 hours for documentation and notes.‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt want to be insubordinate and correct her but she must‚Äôve forgotten that I‚Äôm also running two groups and we have 2 hour team meetings, so then I‚Äôll only have 6 hours for docs and notes, referrals, scheduling, etc. Also, I have the most clients out of all the other therapists (5 including myself)! My coworkers‚Äô caseloads range from 14 to 21 clients. I have 35!!! I‚Äôm supposed to have a caseload of 60??!! That‚Äôs not feasible for me

I‚Äôm also working part time at a private practice (only two clients). My agency wouldn‚Äôt provide me with a qualified supervisor until I was there for 90 days (I‚Äôve been there a little over 60 days) and I wanted to get started on my hours. I also need the money. I wish I could only work at my private practice but I need health insurance‚Ä¶ 

I do love this job but I can‚Äôt meet their expectations. It‚Äôs just upsetting i felt like she sorta shamed/belittled me for this, especially bc she didn‚Äôt acknowledge that I actually have the largest caseload out of the outpatient counselors- half of which are fully licensed too. 

I‚Äôm just feeling really discouraged, hopeless, overwhelmed, disappointed, inadequate... 

Anyways‚Ä¶

Thank you for letting me vent"
x2bhed,5,2022-08-31,Should i take a gap year? (currently going into 3rd year),throwawaymoretren,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/x2bhed/should_i_take_a_gap_year_currently_going_into_3rd/,"Going into 3rd year economics. I entered uni 2 yrs ago with the entirely, entirely wrong mindset. I always had a very low self-esteem due to my lack of work experience. Also, my whole life I've genuinely preferred to enjoy my own life and my own unique hobbies without being part of any student societies - therefore my family and teachers had always berated me for not being involved in leadership positions - that made me very anxious about my future and my lacking CV. I was passionate about finance but I was scared my lack of involvement would hinder me from entering the industry I set my heart on since age 17. So I swarm-applied to as many spring weeks as possible and got actively involved with uni finance societies. I also got top grades in A Levels and GCSEs without rlly trying hard, so I nvr really knew how to be a good student. I got into a very very bad crowd, made all the wrong friends, distanced myself from sincere people and surrounded myself with toxic ones.

Fast forward, spring week and internship applications were a bloodbath for me. I started getting a depression at the end of first year but didnt realise it. I noticed I couldnt study/ think/ work but I thought I was just being lazy. Full blown depression starting from beginning of 2nd year. I get panic attacks when I hear economics and finance buzzwords. Therefore I applied to less than 5 summer internships. I would get a massive headache and terrible fear whenever I saw/ heard anything econ/finance/employment related and could not work to save my life.

It was a gruelling, slow, slow grind for me. I had many suicidal thoughts and endured many suicidal nights, lingering at a suicide hotline. It was very difficult for me to share my terrible mental state with my friends because they would always brush it off and think i'm joking, because they think I'm big and strong and flamboyant and a good student who wont ever get depressed. My darkest moment was in February. I walked on the street at 3am, thinking of ending my life. I figured, 'I fail at every single fucking thing I do. I'm a failure. I might as well die'. I see a tramp harassing a girl in the alley, the girl calls me for help. I think to myself: 'This is it. This is the end. I'm going to save this girl and die trying. Let the last thing I do in my life be a good deed.' I confronted the tramp, dizzily aware of what I was doing. Surprisingly the tramp left in the other way, let us go without a struggle. As I escorted the girl to safety and waited for her to call her parents, I took this as a sign from God that he wants me to keep on living.

The next day, I enrolled in a self-paced therapy programme offered by uni. For several months, I worked on my mental health full time. On the side, I enrolled in the CFA program which remains to this day the 3rd best decision I've made in my life. My innate interest for learning new things led me to persevere in the program, learning about the linkages between thoughts and emotions, and the framework of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). With a lot of strength, I was able to self-administer CBT, and I diligently kept track of my panic attacks. After months of this grind, I felt better in June.

In June, after I stopped having panic attacks whenever I hear finance terminology, I networked aggressively in my home country (in Asia) for internships because they are less competitive. With a LOT of luck and connections, I secured an equity research internship in a household-name bank in my home country.

It was unbelievable. I started to feel hungry for the 1st time in 2 years. Starting July, i wake up every weekday at 5am to start work at 6.40am. I end work at 5pm, then start my CFA studies from 9pm to 12am. Rinse and repeat. I started to fall in love with finance again, I consume knowledge about the topic and I immediately have multiple follow-up questions every time I learn smtg new about finance. This amazing coupling of work, studying what I love, and being close to my family and away from toxic people made me think depression was behind me.

Today, I realise that next week is the last week of my internship. I will be getting on the plane to return to the UK for my final year next Saturday. I feel dread. I realise that I have not fully overcome my depression, I still feel anxiety and dread when I think of the future. All I want to do rn, is to continue having an internship and study for the CFA for some more time. It lights my heart on fire and makes me hungrier and hungrier for finance.

I chatted with a girl on Hinge and she suggested I take a gap year to take a break. That hit me like a train because I was subconsciously thinking of taking a gap year. My heart and brain wants to do it to recoup, pass CFA L1, look for another off-cycle internship in my home country, write my dissertation which topic I am highly interested in, prepare for the GMAT/ GRE, while recruiting for London roles on the side.

Leaving my current peaceful environment is very tough for me to handle. I need more time to rebuild my hunger for finance and economics, and return to uni with a continued love for learning, stronger foundation and discipline, and new insights that I've gained. I've figured that I've spent most of my uni life being a depressed piece of shit and a shadow of my former self, and so I plan to further my education after I graduate by doing external professional qualifications like the CFA, FRM; and also try to get into a good masters.

But I dont know if I'm just looking for escape routes and coping mechanisms. The hardest thing is to explain my situation and gap year plan to my family and friends. I dont know what to do. I need an external opinion on this, I am sorry for the rant and I hope you guys can offer some sincere suggestions."

After graduation I took a week off and moved in with my long term girlfriend who had been long distance with me for 4 years. Everything was looking great and I was excited to start my job. I was cautiously optimistic and put my best foot forward. Within 2 weeks I was starting to lose it. At first I tried to tough it out to not worry my parents or girlfriend, pretty much just thinking it was a fear of change, and I just needed to adjust. But as time went on the cracks become more clear and my parents and girlfriend began to notice my declining mental health. 

I confided in them and decided to stick it out. Mostly because my girlfriend, despite her hardest efforts, has yet to find a job due to her field being highly competitive. But as time grew so did my resentment for civil engineering in general. Other than the normal Sunday blues and being sad and drained after work I‚Äôve seen more things that worry me about my future. ***I have an intense fear of being promoted and becoming my higher ups.*** I see them and get sad. 

I‚Äôve done research on what else I could do with my degree and all of it sounds awful. I have insight on it due to my prior internship. So I feel stuck. 

I know I need to change careers but I don‚Äôt know how. I need something that makes money so I can help provide. If I didn‚Äôt have to worry about money I would just do what my heart is telling me and become a teacher or go back to my roots and pursue music or art or something creative. I‚Äôd be okay with going back to school but I‚Äôm afraid of sinking more time into something I hate just like I did for the last 4 years of my life. 

How do I know where to start with a career change? Does anyone have experience like mine and could provide me some words of wisdom? How can I find something I am exciting about doing again? 

I know this post was long so thank you for reading.

TLDR: I hate my career so much I‚Äôm afraid of being promoted. How can I change careers?"

x2hd07,6,2022-08-31,Unsure about leaving internship at bank for perm job in SME,pemberley_,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/x2hd07/unsure_about_leaving_internship_at_bank_for_perm/,"Have been thinking about this for days, so I thought I'd just ask around here to get more opinions as I'm still undecided on what to do. 

(Long post ahead)

I'm a social science graduate from a local uni who didn't do any internships during my course, so I figured that trying an internship after graduation would be a good way for me to get used to the working world and to gain some work experience. 

Am currently an editorial support intern in a bank and I've been doing this for about 3.5 weeks now. It's mostly admin work e.g. filing, handling email inbox, which took me some time to learn as I'm not good at details (I'm quite a careless person) and get very anxious when I have to handle them.

But after two weeks I actually slowly became okay with it. I've also improved in being less careless, something which I'm proud of.

There is no opportunity for conversion to permanent role as far as I know, although they might allow me to do some actual editorial work towards the end of the internship if I'm good enough.

The problem is that I'm not interested in the sort of editorial work which they do (vetting bank correspondence letters, emails etc.) and I also have no interest in pursuing a career in banking. I'm mostly here to train myself to get better at my organizational skills and at doing detailed admin work (and for the allowance of course, because interning is better than being unemployed).

The people there are rather nice and supportive, although my direct supervisor scares me quite a bit as she's the straight-talking type, which took me a while to get used to. But I know that in the real world I have to suck it up and learn to take bluntness, so this has also been a good learning experience for me.

Essentially, I don't really like or enjoy this internship but I've been trying to push myself to continue because it is training me to get better at my weaknesses i.e. handling detailed admin work and becoming a more organized person.

A few days ago, I got a permanent job offer from a digital marketing SME for the position of content writer, which is something that I'm more interested in as I feel more confident about my writing abilities (I've even tried to learn SEO on my own in preparation for a job like this). I managed to pass their writing test and they were quite keen on offering me the position. The virtual interview and phone calls went well, and the people there seem nice (I'm aware that this can be a facade, of course). From the JD, it seems like the employee will be writing content for clients in the form of blog articles/social media posts, etc.

However, given the bad rep that SMEs have (low pay, inhumane working hours, terrible bosses), I'm still doubtful if considering a job there is a good idea. I'm afraid that the job scope might turn out to be something completely different from what I expected and that I may end up being terminated for not being able to perform or having to resign because I'm unable to cope with the demands of the workload. 

Just for comparison, the pay for the content writing job is 2k before CPF deduction. The internship is paid on an hourly basis at $10/hr. I'm aware that I have a local degree but it's a social science degree and realistically, without much working experience, it's difficult to ask for higher pay.

I've currently decided that since content writing is something that I want to do in the long run, leaving the internship for this permanent job might add more value to my resume as I would gain experience which I can hopefully leverage on for a higher-paying position in future. At the same time, I've already settled a bit into this admin internship which I don't really like but which is still relatively stable. If I do badly at the permanent job, I'll end up with nothing.

**TLDR: Debating between staying at bank admin internship doing work which I don't really like but which is stable and predictable with nice colleagues VS taking up perm job offer at SME for a job which I'm more interested in but which may or may not turn out well**

The choice may seem obvious to some people but right now I'm having quite a bit of self-doubt and apprehensiveness about starting all over again in a new place. Just thought it might do me some good to hear some objective opinions from strangers for me to finally come to a proper decision about what to do.

Thanks so much for reading and would appreciate any insights!"
x2igb4,1,2022-08-31,What do I want to do with my life?,babygarden,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/x2igb4/what_do_i_want_to_do_with_my_life/,"Hi there. I, 23(F), graduated in May of 2021 with my BSW (social work), and am still in the restaurant industry. For reference, I am in the US and I know that our culture can be very ""title/ego focused"" and some people literally \*are\* their jobs. I became a server in July of 2021 and was moved up to bartender in May of this year. In Sept of 2021, I was enrolled in grad school to get my MSW and dropped out after 3 weeks because it just didn't feel right. I do want to mention that I had been having doubts about grad school a few months before I graduated with my BSW, so it wasn't like grad school, my internship, or the coursework itself was the problem...I truly believe it just wasn't the right fit for me...at least at this point in my life. Not to mention that the work is extremely mentally and emotionally taxing with little compensation provided. 

Anyhow, I went full-time at my restaurant in October and have been there ever since. More recently I have dropped my hours in hopes of finding a ""big girl job"", getting my foot in the ""corporate world"", etc. But truthfully, I don't know if I want to...at least not right now. I finally got my groove in bartending and I know that I am a \*great\* bartender, and I truly love my job and (most of) the people that I work with. The job interviews have gone really well, but when it comes down to the nitty-gritty of things and the jobs themselves, they don't seem interesting, they seem incredibly stressful, or the work environment is a toxic, dog-eat-dog world, and work-life balance isn't a thing. Before anyone says anything - NO the restaurant industry is not perfect (far from it actually) and can be incredibly toxic...but there's something different about it. The hours are kind of wonky but I grew to love them as I have never been much of an early riser and have mostly been a night owl. Work-life balance is eh, but in a different way...working weekends kinda sucks but I'm more of a homebody anyway and that's when we're most busy/when I make the most money. I also find myself at work on my off days to see my coworkers or grab a drink with some bar regulars. I complain about the place, management, and laziness of some of my coworkers (as I'm sure anyone who works in the restaurant industry does), but I truly love my job.

Bartending allows me to challenge myself, be my authentic self (there's no type of fake personality that I have to put on), and has creative elements to it. Bartending has helped me to become more confident and assertive (by nature I was very timid, insecure, and a pushover). If I love my job, then why do I need to change it? Well, I feel immense external and internal pressure to ""get a real job"" or to ""start my career"". I have a degree and even received a full scholarship to attend the university, so I feel a lot of guilt because I'm not using my degree ...especially because I was chosen for the scholarship when there are people out there who would have loved to get the scholarship and do some out-of-this-world things with it like becoming a lawyer or an accountant or a nurse or an educator, the list can go on and on. LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, etc. have made me feel even more pressure to get a conventional job with a ""nice title"". Not to mention that the program that I got my scholarship through does regular updates about how well some scholars are doing and share their ridiculously amazing accomplishments. My parents also have played a factor as my father is an immigrant and my mother has told me that she doesn't want me to be a bartender/waitress for the rest of my life. I know I'm only 23 but so many people my age (and younger) are doing these spectacular things while I'm ""just mixing drinks"" and seemingly don't have my life together. I just feel like I'm behind...

How the hell do I figure out what I want to do with my life and  stop listening to the outside voices? Thanks in advance."
x2j7p0,49,2022-08-31,TIFU by going to the ER,frankentaler,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/x2j7p0/tifu_by_going_to_the_er/,"This story happened 2 weeks ago.

I was home, talking to my mom in the kitchen. I wanted to go to the living room because I wanted to sit on the couch. Nothing special was going to happen, I was going to sit and browse the internet like usual. WRONG.

As I was turning back to face the living room to start making my way to the couch, with the momentum that I gathered from my 180¬∞ spin, I hit my little toe on the wooden leg of our big sofa. I didn't even hit it straight forward like a kick no, IT GOT BETWEEN MY TOES.

When I fell to the ground from the immense pain and gathered the courage to look at my toe, I was shocked.

It pointed to the right.

Like it was the ""no right turn"" traffic sign, about 45 degrees.

But the fuck up didn't happen yet, well it did but it is not finished.

My mom rushed to my help and gave me some ice. We called a friend to pick us up and drive us to the hospital. While waiting the pain subsided a bit. I had cracked my ankle before and it was way more painful so me and my mom thought that I had now dislocated my toe. 

Our friend came and I walked to the car with some help, my mom and him were saying ""Yeah you probably dislocated it, if it was broken you wouldn't be able to stand.""

Anyways this is where the major fuck up begins, we made it to the hospital and after some 5 minutes of waiting they took me to a room where (I'm guessing) an intern doctor examined my toe. He looked at it and said ""Yeah you probably dislocated it from the joint"" I was like yeah I guessed so too. At the end of the day he was going to snap it back and I would go back home happily like nothing ever happened right? WRONG AGAIN.

I watched movies and TV shows, every time someone snaps their bone back into place it is very painful but when it is put in place, it is over, so that's what I expected. Again, WRONG.

He held my toe and said ""This is going to hurt"" and pulled it, hard. It was agonizing but I knew it was going to end soon and I'd be ok. He pulled for a while which felt like an hour and it didn't snap back. I was in pain, but I had the hope that it would all be over soon. Oh boy.

He pulled again. Agonizing pain. This time harder. And again, it didn't work.

Third time is the charm right, so he pulled. I haven't felt this much pain in a long time. Yeah hurting it in the first place was painful, but it was an instant. Now it felt like forever, he was pulling and trying to put the bone back into place. The pain NEVER stopped. I was sweating, my mom was besides me terrified. She was probably hurting inside as much as I was outside, no mother wants to see their child in that much pain. He tried to put the bone back 3 times, probably lasted a total of 2-3 minutes. It felt like 2-3 hours. Eventually he gave up and sent me to get an x-ray to see where the bone actually is.

I was back in the waiting room, now hoping I would never have to endure that pain again. But I knew it was going to happen sooner or later. But now I had the comfort that they were going to put it back in to place with the info from my x-ray. After 15 minutes, he came back with the x-ray results.

THE BONE WAS FUCKING BROKEN.

From the middle clean, with a 45 degree angle starting from bottom right to top left of my toe. He had been trying to put a bone back in to place which was fucking broken. I had endured that agonizing pain for NOTHING.

Then they patched it up and wrapped it tight. (It hurt like a bitch again but I was ready this time) They told me to come back and see the orthopaedist tomorrow to see if it the bone was standing correctly.

To my surprise after all the fuckery he had done, the intern had made a pretty good job of putting the bone and wrapping it with the right angle.

Now 2 weeks later It's healing and there is no more pain.

TLDR: I hit my little toe on sofas leg, went to the ER. Doctor tried to put my ""dislocated"" little toe bone back into place 3 times. Failed. Turns out I broke my fucking toe."

I'm trying to take myself to a higher level so I can make it into the better higher paying jobs and ultimately just want to be really good at programming in general and I'm looking for a bit more detailed set of advice.

I understand that the first thing to look at when wanting to improve is where you want to be and where you want to improve in, my general idea of what my options are, are pretty vague (back-end, front-end, full stack, client side, server side, REST, databases, etc etc).  Then these all play into making projects but where do I focus in to get where in my career and the industry?  There's projects like games, web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, data science-y work, fintech apps, websites etc etc.  What are the pros and cons of all these types of projects and what should I be working on to go where in the industry?  Do I just find a job posting at a company and field I want and find projects associated with their stack?

Is there a flow of fundamentals in math, algorithms, technologies that I should well verse myself in before doing projects?  And after managing to decide on projects and complete them, how important is the looks of a portfolio site/Github?  And then how best do I display said portfolio and projects to recruiters (on Linkedin, emailing etc.)?  How worth it is it to become one of those LinkedIn posters (who seem to usually post the same things over and over again) in order to get into those big tech big pay positions?  How good should I be at things like Leetcode to succeed and what are good study flows to become that good?  Like is it best to start with high level languages and then move downward?

I know a lot of these questions are sort of answered on the internet but if anyone has recommendations for a flow/order of a roadmap that I can take points from to help figure out my life I'd much appreciate it!"

Is the crying and dread my body's way of telling me this might not be the right fit? Or am I over thinking it all? Is it normal to feel stressed/dread not wanting to work for a new company?

x2kl5q,1,2022-08-31,Search funds,dodohead_,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/x2kl5q/search_funds/,A few days ago I saw a post on what to do as an 18yo looking to pursue a career in finance. One of the recommendations was to look for internships at a search fund. Most of them are part time and remote which is what im looking for since I am beginning my studies (international business management) in Rotterdam. My CV obviously looks very depressing so far but most offers dont really require any experience anyways. In short what should I do increase my chances of landing an internship? Any tips or guidance helps immensely. Thanks!!!

x2l77w,1,2022-08-31,"I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my life away at my retail job and at home, but I have nowhere to vent about it.",Individual-Ad2964,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/x2l77w/i_feel_like_im_wasting_my_life_away_at_my_retail/,"Dear r/mental health community,

I have been working odd jobs since graduating college about 4 years ago, except for one stint in marketing, and I feel like I‚Äôm just losing focus and control over my life. Ever since I graduated college, I was all alone in determining my next steps, which I was somewhat handicapped in deciding based on the fact that I did not try out nearly enough subjects nor did I fully apply myself while studying for my bachelors degree in college. I therefore graduated with a BA in psychology. It‚Äôs not that I hate psychology through and through, but more so that I simply didn‚Äôt plan ahead or make any significant efforts towards thinking about my future. This led to a state of panic after graduation which was really added onto because the environment i now had to return to, which is my childhood home, is not very conducive to having deep meaningful conversations, which I feel are the type of thing I need right now to really get my out of my head and into the world of raw action. 

Because of this, I worked in the dark emotionally and mentally to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù with my life. Yet, as a previous client in psychotherapy, I‚Äôm aware how negative this kind of being is and vitally, I feel like my resolutions and decisions are just not being made from an ideal place. This pseudo-self awareness only makes me feel more despaired, because I know on the one hand, underneath all of my issues and lack of direction there is a raw energy and a person who severely would like to get going with life. And yet, I feel somehow suppressed around my family whom I now live with/‚Äòf that suppression is so noticeable that it discourages me from acting like my true self. But without being able to see or witness my truest self, I am essentially fucked and I feel trapped inside this mental prison where half of me is this self-aware person who eants to progress but the other half is like this depressed person who feels like nothing I think or feel about my own life matters. Essentially, my feelings feel like they don‚Äôt matter as much when I‚Äôm in this home environment and it‚Äôs leading me to make some very poor decisions that almost feel self-destructive. Or at least highly limiting and far from what my true self truly wants to do.

Basically, I did fight through some intense anxiety in the immediate timer period after leaving college. I was even able to obtain an internship at a marketing agency not far from my home town. However, it wasn‚Äôt an overly magical time, and in the end I didn‚Äôt shoot for an offer and had to return home yet again. I then worked minimum wage as a delivery driver for a food service place before being laid off during the beginning of the pandemic, which I also felt deeply ashamed of despite knowing logically that it wasn‚Äôt my fault and that I had no control over the situation whatsoever. But yet I still felt deeply ashamed? 

I then got a series of checks from literal unemployment which I also hated myself for having to do‚Ä¶ I then started a retail job in August of 2021 which I am still doing today, which I absolutely hate for myriad reasons that I won‚Äôt go into now. 

To top it all off, I also wen to a really nice school which only makes me feel worse about my current lack of direction. Sometimes, I do think I have inkiings of ideas of what to do from here, but I never seem to have the full confidence to just do them. I know my inability to communicate with another person about my emotional struggles also makes my situation more difficult than it needs to be. But yet, I‚Äôve never reached out to anyone in the last 4 years, aside from my original stint I therapy that I went theougu when I was still in college. I guess I feel like I am trapped between that inner self aware part of myself and this pessimistic ‚Äúdefeatist‚Äù self who‚Äôs always saying that it‚Äôs not worth it. And I honestly just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Any advice you might have would be greatly appreciated."

x2nmma,46,2022-08-31,Frustrated with helping my parents who don‚Äôt speak English - Anyone with shared experiences?,LividPhysics6269,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/x2nmma/frustrated_with_helping_my_parents_who_dont_speak/,"For context, my family moved to Canada when I was 10 and parents were 38/40. They had a successful business in China and sold it when we immigrated. Throughout the past 13 years in Canada, they‚Äôve been purchasing properties and are landlords to many. Because they‚Äôve never had a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù here, they don't have the opportunity to use English.

Now, as their only daughter, I‚Äôve been tasked with translating and doing tasks for them, both personal and property related tasks. It could be reading government documents, making and taking phone calls from hydro companies about our rental properties, ordering at restaurants, and simply booking a time slot for yard work estimates. We are currently in a legal dispute with our neighbour and as the only English speaker, I deal with all communications and preparation work. This was especially hard on me when we first moved here because I was so young and English was **new** to me as well. My parents‚Äô attitude has been neutral most of the time but they've said a few things that have upset me in the past.

For example, when I couldn‚Äôt understand the complicated government documents when I was 14, they said that my English was bad. Or when I was telling my dad that our electrician was doing something wrong after reading the instructions and told him that he should‚Äôve listened to me afterwards, he said that I never liked to help them with things.

This was hurtful, I had never verbally express my frustrations throughout the years and only would very occasionally look a little stress because I have other commitments such as school and work. If anything, my dad is irritated at me for asking him for the context when I‚Äôm asked to make calls. Although they‚Äôve never expressed gratitude to me directly, their accountants once told me that my parents told them I always help them with stuff - I was glad to hear that my efforts were valued.

Aside from the time spent and frustrations I experience, I feel like my parents have also make my life limited. When I was dating my Middle Eastern ex, my parents explicitly told me that it is best to end up with a Chinese partner. I broke up with my ex for other reasons but I definitely had my parents‚Äô suggestion in mind after the breakup. I have a Chinese partner now, and I see that it make my life and my parents‚Äô lives easier. Almost all of my friends are not Chinese, I‚Äôve shy away from bringing them home because it‚Äôs awkward and/or tiring to translate at dinners, although I have tried a few times.

I feel that I need to help my parents because despite the fact that I didn‚Äôt make the decision to immigrate, they gave up their life in China to move to a foreign country so that I can be in a less stressful education system. At the same time, because they spend little to no time everyday on their property investment business, I don‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt learn English in the free time they have in the past 13 years.

I‚Äôm definitely at fault for building their reliance towards me. I‚Äôve always been scared/felt rude to explicitly ask them to do simple tasks themselves, I‚Äôve recently started trying to teach them simple tasks like e-transferring. They rely on me so much that when they had to communicate with white folks before my parents switched to a different company, my dad always had me replying to emails with the same sentence ‚ÄúThank you, appreciate your time.‚Äù when he could‚Äôve copied and pasted himself (thankfully, this doesn't happen anymore).

I feel guilty for the frustration I‚Äôm experiencing. Guilty for thinking that they should learn English when they don‚Äôt have to **if** they didn‚Äôt move to Canada for me. I‚Äôve also received resentment from them for giving up their business in China. But this is super suffocating. I‚Äôm a 23 year old masters student who lives at home. It‚Äôs stressful when they ask for my help when I‚Äôm studying or working during internships. I‚Äôll eventually work a full-time job and start my own family, I don‚Äôt know how I can handle helping my parents with their personal and property stuff in the future.

My immigrant friends with parents who aren't fluent in English can understand enough to sort things out themselves. Hoping that folks on this sub that related to me can share their experiences and how they deal with this. &lt;3"
