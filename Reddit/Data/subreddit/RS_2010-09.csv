I completed my Associate of Science in Computer Programming at the local community college and starting on my Bachelor of Science in Applied Science (Concentration in IT) at University of South Florida.  I am looking around Tampa, FL for internships dealing with IT (specifically; Linux server administration for bushiness.)

I would love to get an internship somewhere locally to where I can hone my skills and get experience to someday be a Linux System Administrator.  I know a little bit of bash and python scripting, and use Linux on the desktop regularly, but I feel without experience I can't actually get a job somewhere or learn as much as I could.  I've tried chaining together a network of Linux VMs to try and teach myself, but it's just not the same as having real-world experience.

I made a resume, but I don't exactly know how to get started in looking around for companies that need interns, since Tampa is such a large area, I'm just lost on how to get my name out there.

I would love to get into a business with an IT structure and system admin in place to help out and learn from, but I'm just lost on how to get started in this process.  I'm specifically interested on how samba works and catering windows clients.  I've looked at books, but I feel like I could get so much more out of experience.

Attached is my resume, if someone could look it over for suggestions on how to improve it, or suggestions on how to get an internship that would be a huge help!  Thanks Reddit!

dabty,11,2010-09-06,Why not...? Part 2,ThrowawayAccount4324,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dabty/why_not_part_2/,"Hi reddit,

i've [posted a few months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bzj1c/why_not/) and just wanted to give you an update. **There's no danger**, so please don't worry. I really tried to get a better more livable life, but it just won't work. I know it's only been 4 months, but you have to take the 10 years before that into consideration.

I still have brutal headaches every single day. In the last 3 weeks they have been even worse, because i started a 20 week internship that every college student here has to go through. Being very close to people every day for 9hours is horrible for me. The constant ""do they think i'm stupid?"", ""what did that strange look mean?"", etc. drives me insane. I just can't concentrate and pretty much stare at program code for 8 hours without being able to read/comprehend anything.

I tried pretty much everything you people told me to do. I went to three new medical doctors and got my whole body checked and all 3 results showed nothing an unusual. I'm way healthier than most people at my age. Now that's some fucked up irony, huh? They gave me a bunch of different useless pain medications and the names of some psychologists that i already visited and one that i don't want to visit, because he has a horrible reputation.

I exercise again. I still run/swim/cycle for more than 10-20km two or three times a week and it doesn't help much. It relieves my headaches a little, but it's barely noticable.

I even tried massages for 3 months, twice a week.  It helped to make my wallet a lot lighter, but other than that it didn't do much good ;).

Between all that good and healthy stuff i had some fun and did whatever the hell i wanted to. Parachuting, driving to the Italy because a buddy wanted to camp and drink at the beach, riding rollercoasters in an amusement park on ecstasy and acid (holy fuck that was an experience!)... Believe it or not, i actually had a threesome on camera, if that counts as starring in a porno. That was all fun while it lasted, but the second i was lying in bed, it all was gone again. The insomnia is/was, as always there (5 hours of sleep in the last 4 days), and the next day was/is as horrible as always. Now i'm completely broke and the thought of going to another country right now is pretty much on hold. I'm stuck here for a long time.

As i've mentioned i started my internship and damn it makes me hate life even more. No matter how hard i try, i won't be able to do any kind of job to have a decent kind of living. It doesn't matter if it's freelancing or a regular job. Just the thought of something forcing me to work drives me insane. I know how stupid this sounds, but that's just the way it is and hey, it's my life.

I went back to the only medication that seems to help: weed. I'm high right now, because i'm sure this day would have ended bad without it. It's the first time in 4 months and damn it feels good. Most of the things i wrote have been written down before i got high, so please don't think it has anything to do with that. But you know what? My lawyer called a few days ago and told me i have to be in court in a couple of weeks and he's guessing i have to do regular drug tests and pay a hefty fine! This is such a fucking joke. I will need to get a second job just so i can pay the huge fine for the unbelievable crime of smoking and owning a plant, that is harmless when compared to alcohol and cigarettes, in the comfort of my own home. No growing, no selling, just smoking and owning around 3gram of weed. Fuck that, seriously. There's no way i'm gonna pay and support that corrupt, idiotic system. But of course that's not all. They will bully me on a regular basis with their drug tests and if there's even a slight discrepancy i will lose my driver's license.

My ""friends"" are pretty much gone. We had some small adventures in the last 4 months, but after trying again and again i realized i couldn't have a serious conversation with them and pretty much stopped talking to them. It's better that way.

Last but not least, i talked to my sister. She had holidays for 4 weeks and it was a ""good"" timing. She was not as shocked as i suspected her to be. She knows i've been in pain every single day for such a long time. We talked for a long time and both cried, but at the end she understood it, at least to the point where i know she could handle it. She doesn't want me to see unhappy, in pain and struggle every single day. She said if it is the only way i can be ""happy"", she won't stand in my way.  It was so horrible to talk with her about all of that, but it looks like she knew how desperate i was and why i turned to her with such a horrible thing.

I know how i would do it. I already tried it on on some different materials and even metal burned away like it was paper. I'm guessing the only thing that will be left of me are some really small chunks of burned teeth... scattered across a huge area. There's no way anyone would stumble upon anything of my body. That takes care of the problem that somebody could find my body and be scarred for live. I'm almost a bit proud of my contraption. Wow, that's a morbid thing to say... :D

I still can't think of a reason why i should stay alive. There's really nothing keeping me alive anymore. Thanks for reading all that stuff. You people are awesome. I've said it at the beginning of this post and i'll say it again: there's no danger of me killing myself, so please don't worry. I just needed to get these things off my chest again.

Time to go to bed now. I'm not sure if i'll be able to answer tomorrow, because i have to work late."

In my last year of high school I got really passionate for my subject, but by the time I realized my goals, it was too late. My SATs were shit, I hadn't bothered to work towards making an impressive application and I had only applied to two schools. I got accepted into a state school, but instead of going there, I decided to take the community college route in California (for the opportunity to transfer into UCs).

At this point, I'm almost sure that I'm going to transfer into UCSD, and it just so happens that UCSD has a really strong computer science program (thank god). I also stand a good chance at getting into Berkeley, but I'm pretty sure my parents are in a shitty financial situation. Even if I got accepted, I don't know if I should go. 

My problem is this: I feel like I've dug myself a hole by taking this route (through community college). Lately I've been hearing that I need experience working/ interning/ researching and recommendations from professors to have any sort of chance to stand out in admissions for graduate programs. I haven't had the opportunity to do such things and when I transfer, I'll have even less time to attempt it. I can't take upper division classes and therefore I wouldn't be eligible for internships/ research positions. I don't know of any clubs or any serious local organizations to be involved in and I haven't the slightest clue where to look for internships (basically ANY sort of positions for learning and getting experience).

What the hell do I do?"

de1xx,6,2010-09-15,"Reddit ECE, I could really use some advice on research related to extending the computers we love so much all over the world.",AegisXLII,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/de1xx/reddit_ece_i_could_really_use_some_advice_on/,"*Spam filter seems to have caught the last one. Here we go again*

Hey there Reddit ECE. Thanks for checking in. I could really use some insight, especially from those already out in the field (both industry and research).

Let's start with a little background. I'm in my senior year of Computer Engineering. At my school, CE is defined as a mix of EE and CS. It's mostly (say 80%) EE, but with the classes not related to computer technology (EM Theory, some advanced physics, etc) weeded out and replaced with a strong foundation in computer science.

I got into ECE because, like many of you out there, I've always been a computer guy. I was fascinated with them as a kid, and started doing website design, webhosting (read: pissing off Comcast), networking the computers in my house, etc around 12. I was the type of kid who had a lot of online friends from all over the world. And, while some might argue that I should have outside, I think this phase of my life was really good for me. I was exposed to people and ideas from all over, and I think that helped penetrate the bubble of apathy about the world outside myself that many of us (especially Americans, though that's a whole different debate) have.

So when I saw the dropdown box on my college application, I clicked ""computer engineering."" I figured I'd like to get into making computers even better. I had this vague idea in the back of my head for a while as I worked a few summer internships, etc

Lately my interests have solidified a little bit. I think the computer revolution has, overall, been a pretty awesome thing. Communication, education, buiness, every facet of our lives - revolutionized. But that's only the developed world. Whole regions of the earth have yet to experience the potential for growth and development that computers can bring. I want to get involved in fixing this, developing the next generation of low-cost, low-power computers that can extend the range of the computing revolution. Projects like OLPC and Intel's classmate PC fascinate me. But my attempts to contact them and figure out what kind of research is going into furthering these devices has been met (not surprisingly) with little to no response.

So the problem is: how to go about doing this? Should I be looking into grad programs in computer architecture and microprocessor development, and work on the next generation of devices like Intel's Atom processor (the micro-CPU powering most netbooks). Or perhaps System-on-a-chip and embedded computing is the future? Or maybe something else entirely.

Let me know what you think, reddit. I'm counting on you.

**TL,DR: I like computers and think everyone (not just the relatively wealthy in the developed world) should have one. What kind of research should I do?**"
del29,7,2010-09-16,i can't do this anymore,jmontheedge,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/del29/i_cant_do_this_anymore/,"I'm 22 years old. I feel like I'm having a mid-life crisis.

I'm a father, I'm married, I'm overworked, I'm depressed, I'm lonely, and I just don't know how much longer I can take this.

I got married in June 2009 because I got my girlfriend pregnant. Our daughter is now 13 months old. She wanted a baby, and at the time had an uncanny ability to guilt me… I couldn't say no. So, we ""tried"" for 6 months until she finally got pregnant. Normally, I'm a very analytical person… but when we made that ""decision,"" there was no real discussion or actual planning. I just went along with it. I figured it would just be okay: I was helplessly in love with her; I was nearly done with college and had a well-paying Software Engineering internship.  I was already going to school full time while working full time. When she got pregnant, I purchased a 3-family home so we could live rent-free (until recently, the rent from the 2nd and 3rd floors covered our mortgage), using a small loan from my sister for the deposit. I graduated in March of this year and have been working as a Software Engineer ever since. My wife is a stay-at-home mother.

Our daughter was born in August 2009.  There were some complications with the labor and she had to be born quickly… luckily, she was fine, but my wife had to be cut on her vagina in order to get our daughter out in time. It took a while for that cut to heal. It got infected, but she is finally starting to feel better. She keeps going back to the Ob-gyn who has been giving her new medications. The infection is gone, but there is still some spotting… so we still cannot have sex. ""Just 2 more weeks"" Is a phrase I've heard all summer. I am so horny, so often, it hurts. 

Since early July, we have been going to see a marriage counselor: we have a lot of communication problems in addition to our intimacy problems. I understand why she doesn't want to have sex, but we could still be intimate in other ways - at the very least don't let me feel so desperate for attention! When I'm horny, she wants nothing to do with it; I'm on my own.

I love my Software Engineering job, but the commute is ridiculous 3 hours a day (luckily 2.5 hours of the daily commute is on a commuter rail; I mostly spend that time browsing reddit to avoid my thoughts of depression/suicide). I leave my house at 7:20AM and get home by 7:00PM. I'm away from home nearly 12 hours. Then I take care of the baby for an hour and a half before she goes to sleep, since my wife had to take care of her all day….

I feel so over-worked and under-appreciated. I have no fun at all. I work, take care of the baby, often fight with my wife and usually go to bed alone since she stays up late, but I can't fall asleep when she's not there.
Tonight was the 3 year anniversary of when we first started dating. My wife's friend watched our daughter for us. When we got home, another one of their friends came over and the 3 of them went out to a bar. I laid in bed, alone, for hours. We had a fight last Friday because I wanted to go out to the bar more often with her, but she said she ""out grew"" it. Tonight I realized that this was the 4th time she has been out to the bar with friends in the past 5 weeks. I asked her about it when she got home, and she said she felt it would be ""irresponsible"" of us to have a baby-sitter watch our daughter for a night just so we could go out to a bar.
So this is my life. I'm over-worked, very tired, very lonely and very depressed. I want more fun in my life. I have only 1 friend, but he and I rarely hang out since I'm often too busy/tired. I fear my wife and I may get a divorce, but I really don't want that to happen. I don't know how much longer I can keep living this life.


**TL;DR:** I just don't know how much longer I can take this, Reddit. I want to just give up and end it.

C is a language I don't have much experience in, outside of using it in my first year at university to write basic web server files and to run assembly language programs. I've used it for years, but I've never had the opportunity to really dive into it and make something worthwhile.

Over the next couple of weeks I'll be revising my C knowledge by going through the K&amp;R book, but to be honest I'm not sure what a C proficiency exam (assuming that it's a paper exam) will really want from me.

Has anyone here taken a C proficiency exam? If so, what kind of questions were you given? If not, what do you think I will need to know to be deemed ""proficient"" at Masters level?"
dfpgv,2,2010-09-18,Anyone work in HR or hiring? Any insight on my gf's WTF story from last week?,frustratedboyfriend,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dfpgv/anyone_work_in_hr_or_hiring_any_insight_on_my_gfs/,"I know certain business environments are friendlier than others, but what my girlfriend experienced in her first week at work, which would then be her last, is one of the rudest things I've ever heard of. I'll try to keep it brief:

She interviewed last Friday for a social media specialist position at a small company (45 ppl). This would be her first real job, tho she's had a few paid internships and keeps a blog with a dedicated audience, so she knows her shit. At the interview, she laid out all the variables of her situation: she lives in another state, has a dog, and plans to start looking for an apartment pending a job.

Wednesday of the next week, she got an letter and a plane ticket for Sunday so she could come up and train for a week. She made it seem like they were going to work with her to make the transition smooth. She'd stay with me in the meantime.

Monday was great. Lots of meetings, paperwork, introductions. She brought up figuring the whole next few weeks out. They were definitely going to plan a meeting soon.

Tuesday she went out to lunch w/ her supervisor. He was very reassuring that they want to make her happy so she could do a best work, and a hotel or other accommodations weren't out of the question. They talked family and the upcoming Jewish holidays and kicked things off well.

Wednesday she found an apartment at lunch. Threw down the deposit. Move in around Oct. 1. Gravy.

Wednesday right before EOD her supervisor, CEO, and her talked about the next few weeks, at which point they pulled a 180 on her and said that any sort of remote work was out of the question and they expected her to be there Monday. They went back on just about everything they promised, citing the contract she signed. She left work visibly upset. I interpreted as some sort of cruel test, but we'd make it work. She could stay w/ me longer til move-in.

Thursday was fine. Back to work as usual. Still meetings and the beginning stages of assignments, but no deliverables.

Friday morning, first thing, they let her go, saying that its not going to be a good fit. One week, zero chances of proving oneself and ""Sorry, you're fired."" What the hell?

They're paying her through the end of the month regardless, and she was able to get the housing deposit back, but now its back to square one. All I can think of is that they're an agency, and they tend to grow and shrink with accounts. Maybe some really bad news happened Wednesday morning? Maybe they were trying to get her to quit on Wednesday by being mean?

At least that was my original thought. The job is back up on craigslist.

I've personally left a job after a month because of the environment, but they were apparently nowhere near firing me. I'd say you'd need at least a few weeks of screwing up to be let go that quickly.

So reddit, if you work with HR or run a business and have any insight as to why a company would hire somebody only to fire them in less than a week's time for no apparent reason, I'd appreciate your thoughts!

**TL;DR** Girlfriend got hired, wanted to clarify working arrangements, got fired within a week having had no opportunity to actually *work*. What gives?"

A summer internship in industry finally snapped me to my senses, and with much rejoicing I have since switched over to Comp Sci. However, my perverse single-mindedness up till then had left me two classes away from a non-ABET accredited ""ChemE-lite""; two classes which I could easily fit in in my remaining time at uni.

But I'm wondering if there's any point to doing so. I'm still not entirely sure what my post-graduation plans are, but will sticking it out and getting this watered-down ChemE degree open any doors employment/gradschool-wise beyond just a CS degree? Or, in the more general case, does having a double major impress anybody worth impressing?  "

I know I need to apply to more jobs, something, anything so I can pay the bills but everything seems so daunting in my head (I know it's not objectively true, I used to be pretty good at getting shit done, got scholarships, good grades, internships etc). It feels like everything I used to do for fun is just a little bit too hard to get back into--I cracked a rim on my bike last week, my car's been acting up so I can't get outside on the weekends to climb and hike, my knees hurt and pop and click all the time (never used to do that, went to the doc twice, they said ""live with it""), I discovered the hard way that I'm apparently now allergic to alcohol (beer, liquor, wine--same result, swollen throat and hives all over my body), broke up with my girlfriend a couple weeks ago (she was headed to grad school), etc.

I know I do a lot better with exercise but I haven't found a good replacement activity, and work has been extremely stressful because they want us to get even more done now that funding will run out in two weeks.

I feel like I'm stuck, and my brain keeps saying ""YOU'RE HEADED FOR TROUBLE, DO SOMETHING, YOU'RE HEADED FOR TROUBLE, DO SOMETHING"" but my heart isn't in it anymore.

I'm not suicidal or anything but I've definitely never felt this hopeless before.

EDIT: I guess my biggest worry was, whenever I used to get stressed out like this, I'd just tell myself ""OK, go to the gym for a night, forget about everything, tackle it in the morning"" or ""OK, go out with your friends etc"" and the next day, I'd feel refreshed and ready to get shit done. Now anything I do just makes me think about how shitty things still are, I can't seem to 'reset' my mood anymore

dhfw8,6,2010-09-22,What can I do about being unemployable?,justgetmeonhere,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/dhfw8/what_can_i_do_about_being_unemployable/,"tldr; I'm just a code monkey and I don't have enough experience for companies to take me seriously, but since I'm already graduated I don't think I qualify for internships. I need some advice and/or perspective.

I'm sure that Reddit is getting dozens of posts like this a day, but I'm really starting to feel like that I'm just not cut out to be hired by anyone. I feel that the little work experience I do have is not nearly enough for most companies to even care. Can anybody tell me if I'm overreacting, things I can do, etc?

I recently left my previous job (see below) and I've only been unemployed for about 3 months now, which is hardly any time compared to the majority of people. Still, in this entire time I've only ever gotten 1 interview, and I just found out the very next day after that interview that they're not interested. And even before this previous job I had a ton of difficulty with getting recruiters to acknowledge that I even applied.

I'm just not convinced that my experience is up to snuff. I can program in java pretty well (**I** think I can, anyway), although I don't have any experience with frameworks such as Hibernate and Spring, and it seems that most java developer positions require 2+ years experience with those kinds of things. I have less than a couple of months of experience with web technologies (I know what html, css, etc are, I just haven't worked with them), and that's another major thing that shoots me in the foot because 9 out of 10 jobs are web development positions. I have some experience with relational databases (mySQL, more specifically), but not enough to be able to do query optimizations or do truly complex schema design. I've worked in C++ and C# and feel pretty comfortable using them, but that experience only adds up to a few months, and once again I have no practical knowledge of any frameworks or third party software that typically gets paired with them.

I have various books on all of these subjects and I've been doing some learning on my own, but I just don't think companies will give a shit about self-taught candidates, especially ones who haven't done professional work for other companies or organizations. I'm sure somebody wants to chime in ""do an internship,"" but I've graduated over a year ago. Don't companies only want students for interns?

I'm just worried that I've ruined all of my chances for getting employed. I don't have nearly enough experience for most companies to consider me, but I'm overqualified just enough to not be able to do internships. Even the few ""entry-level"" positions that I do find require 2-3 years more experience than I currently have. What should I do, Reddit?

Some background on me: I graduated a year ago, I've got my BS in computer science. While in school I worked an internship at IBM, which I enjoyed, but when the recession began and IBM laid off a bunch of people I was among them. For half a year after graduation I had no success in finding work.

Then finally, at the beginning of this year, I did manage to get hired at a start-up company. The compensation was very crappy (think roughly 25K a year and no benefits to speak of), but I didn't care about the money, I was after some experience. I was also too elated at the prospect of being employed to care too much about anything else. Well I tried my best for roughly 6 months to make it work, but things didn't pan out too well. I'm not going to bore anyone with specifics unless asked, but basically I started to find the work environment and the company itself somewhat toxic and lost all motivation to stay, and so I left. I think leaving was the right decision, but I seriously regret leaving them at this current time. It was particularly unwise to quit without producing a two-weeks notice (in my defense, I was told up front that they didn't require them; if you didn't want to be there, get the hell out). I'm also pretty certain that the bridges I had built over there are fairly charred, so forget about a good reference."
dj98l,8,2010-09-26,Yet another one...,redditswaccount,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dj98l/yet_another_one/,"I'm only 21 and you could say I have so much of my life ahead of me, but I just feel too discouraged with how my life has been up to this point to bother going on. I'm a senior engineering student at a top-ranked university. While others have been doing research or internships all their time here, I've been a complete failure and have done absolutely nothing to better myself for a career after I graduate. Like this past summer, where unlike everybody else I spent the summer going through therapy with no successful results. My major doesn't interest me anymore; I'm a senior now and I feel like I don't have a major. I've wasted 3 years of college and will graduate next semester with a degree in a field I don't care about. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life, and I'm in the point of no return as far as switching majors is concerned. I know I'm not the only one that feels this way about their career and stuff, but these other people at least have other stuff going for them in life.

While others have been or are in relationships and seem happy, I sit here as a lonely 21-year old that has yet to even go on a date. I've never even been kissed or kissed a girl before. I didn't even hug a girl until my sophmore year here. Sounds like something a geeky teen might say, but this is coming from a 21-year old adult. I had virtually no friends in high school and never even went to a prom or anything like everybody else here. I can't help but feel like I missed out on a big chunk of life, and I'm surrounded by people who actually *lived* the first 21 years of their life. 

And I know I'm not the *only* one for which the last two apply for people here, but I feel like these other people at least have some sort of relationship with family to fall back on. My relationship with my parents is non-existent and will continue to be so because I can't forgive them for being so distant to me and my brother for all our lives (especially when my brother has been dealing with depression as well at home and attempted suicide, and my parents never noticed anything). I have no relationship with my mom because there's a huge language barrier, and there's nothing I have in common with my dad. My parents were just there to drive me to school, to sign important documents, and provide the essentials of food &amp; shelter. Outside of that there was literally no interaction. There was nothing for us to talk about as I didn't know them and they really didn't know me. I don't know old my parents are. I don't even know when their birthdays are.

So my career life, romantic life, and family life have been utterly pathetic and non-existent. What else is there? People usually say at least you have friends, right? But I have a hard time saying I genuinely have friends. I'm not actually *close* with anybody in my life. I'm just *there* sometimes. Nobody ever calls me specifically up to hang out or have lunch or anything. And it's senior year now; everybody has their close group of friends and stuff already, and I can't help but feel like the lonely freshman that is still eager to make friends.

And then I look at the bigger picture. There are millions of people out there that have it worse than me (I'm going to a top ranked university after all). People with REAL problems. People fighting diseases like cancer and AIDS (I still have my health...). People suffering in Haiti. People living in fear every day due to terrorists and the like (I still have my freedoms...). My problems are so trivial in comparison, yet here I am unable to stop dwelling on them. It's hard not to feel like a crybaby, you know?

I feel like I've done all the ""right"" steps. I've reached out to people, I've tried meds (Lexapro &amp; Pristiq), I've gone to therapy and even a support group, but I'm still here in this slump. I know if you look at all the statistics and read all the success stories online, odds are I will get better with time if I continue reaching out, taking meds, and going to therapy. But when I consider the days from this day to that arbitrary point in the future, and if every day is this shitty and if every night I think about this...that's when I start to consider if it is worth it. Am I insane for thinking this way?

Thanks a bunch if you clicked on this link and took the time to read my bitching. I know that there are so many people that post here and I know everybody has busy lives, so it means something to me that somebody bothered to take time out of their day and listen to the problems of an anonymous person on the internet."

I'm currently an undergraduate junior and I'd like to get an internship for this summer. I'm a computer science major, and a bunch of tech companies are coming to my school and recruiting in the next few weeks that I would be interested in, so I need to have my act together."
dl3og,3,2010-09-30,Active Top Secret clearance required for an entry level software engineer position. WTF? ,lookingforanentryjob,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dl3og/active_top_secret_clearance_required_for_an_entry/,"I am looking for an entry level software engineering job and have found many from companies that require some type of clearance.

Why do companies require an active top secret clearance for entry level positions? To even get one, you must have worked for a company in the past who has given you one (can't apply for one obviously). I understand it saves money, but to expect newly graduated computer scientists to hold an active one seems a little absurd.

Can anyone explain this? Does it significantly decrease the pool of applicants? Do most who have one obtain it during internships?

dl8vb,7,2010-09-30,Contemplating Joining The US Military. Life Altering Choice.,airfocemanpowpow,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dl8vb/contemplating_joining_the_us_military_life/,"  First let me say that I would have never even considered joining the US Air Force. I am a college graduate. I have not yet sunk my teeth into the job market. I have had some very reputable internships. I graduated with a 3.0 GPA and always loved learning, any type of information that was out there.   
   
  My senior year my college roommate and longtime friend said he was looking into the Air Force, I knew he would not join, he didn't. But I wanted to make sure if he proved me wrong that he would be alright. So I looked into it and frankly I was impressed with what I found and honestly, it has been at the back of my mind for a good year now.  
  
  Now I am thinking of enlisting into the US Air Force, my loved ones are fine with it as long as I am safe.  
  
* I feel it would be a great life experience, might even make it my life long career.  
* I would be able to travel. I would welcome the structure.  
* I would welcome the new friends that I would make due to the bonds we would share.  
* I would welcome the new skills I would gain.   
  
  And within the last 5 years I have felt very patriotic, within reason of course. I happen to have the belief that if you stay where you were born you will never get to be your own person or know what kind of man you are. Not sure if anyone has seen the movie Cinema Paradiso (1988 Italian film) but the boy leaves his hometown, never returns until decades later, to only find out the man he became, that is sort of where I am coming from.  
   
Although having completed college, I feel on one hand I might be wasting what I learned (I studied Documentary Film). Not a big demand for educational filmmakers at the time, or do you get paid a hefty amount to live on, best to be a hobby. I have been working on and off at a IT help desk. Never was my field, but I have always loved computers. Also feel if I do decide to leave what might I be able to get out of it aside from putting “Veteran” on my resume?  
   
**TLDR:** Went to college and gradated, considering enlisting into the US Air Force, not the Officer route. Any suggestions from those who have done this?
