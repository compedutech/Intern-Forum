I am so happy because I was offered an internship for this summer. It is at a pretty big power company. Now, I am a sophomore right now and will(God's grace) be finished with the second course in our circuit analysis sequence. I am getting scared that I dont have the necessary knowledge to be productive on the job. I am scared that I am going to be completely fucked and will be well behind my fellow interns. has anyone felt this way before. Did it work out in the end? Am I worrying for nothing?

62pzi5,2,2017-03-31,UC Berkeley (IEOR) vs Johns Hopkins (Economics) vs Tufts (Economics),Le_Redditor123,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/62pzi5/uc_berkeley_ieor_vs_johns_hopkins_economics_vs/,"Hey there everyone! I was hoping I could get some input before I make my final decision. 

Cost-wise, I can afford both Berkeley (~$35,000) and Johns Hopkins (~$22,500 after scholarship), and am waiting on Tufts for the financial aid package. Without aid, I don't think I will be able to afford Tufts, as total price is somewhere around $65,000 or so.

Assuming money was not an object though, which school would you pick and why?

Personally, I am leaning more toward Hopkins, due to its location on the east coast (far from home), its great economics program, and recommendations from friends I know who go there. Some downsides for me are that I haven't visited campus, so I don't really have a sense for its ""feel"", the fact that it's in Baltimore (which I've heard isn't the greatest city in terms of crime and food diversity), and the weather. 

However, Berkeley's Industrial Engineering and Operations Research program is really top-notch, and I've heard that there are lots of job opportunities for people with that degree (and being near Silicon Valley doesn't hurt either). Additionally, the weather is much better than in Maryland or Boston, and it's still far enough away from my home in Los Angeles that it feels separate. Downsides for Berkeley are the commonly stated issues with course and housing overcrowding and availability. Also, I am not a huge fan of the urban-ness (is that a word?) of its campus as well as its reputation for crime. 

As for Tufts, I love the campus and its proximity to Boston, which is a really great city in my opinion. Also, there's lots of internship opportunities with companies in the area. However, when I visited, it felt a little bit socially dead (although that may have been due to the fact that I was there during the summer). Also, their economics program is not as prestigious as Hopkins's (I know, I know, prestige isn't everything), so I  do have some doubts about possible job placement out of college. The main deterrent for me at this point is really whether I get sufficient financial aid from them or not. If not, then my decision is made for me, haha. 

This got a bit long, but for those of you that made it all the way to the bottom, I'd really like to hear your input. Thanks!"

I'm a 3rd year bachelor student and my work experience involves a 3 month internship at Cisco Systems. I'm looking for Software Engineer positions (preferably in machine learning).

My personal projects include:

1. WeJ: An iOS app that allows a person to host a party, and other users to join that party and add songs to the queue using the hosts' Spotify or Apple Music subscription. 

2. Snake AI: A multiplayer snake AI that was built in Python utilizing double Q networks and experience replay.

3. Ripe: A smart all-in-one POS iOS app for medium sized grocery stores. Uses a neural network running on Metal to recognize food items using the camera.

4. iDerm: An iOS app that calculates the pH of patches. Made to be used in the research of dermal patches, and the app was recognized in the research paper.

Do I need to work on a larger variety of projects? Do I just need more projects? I'm not sure where to go from here."

So if anyone has any advice or any interns who have been in this position please tell me what I can do. 

When I first met him and he introduced himself he looked like he wanted to die. Not like ""oh I'm so unhappy I'm here"" but in a ""if someone handed me a gun right now I would kill myself"" kind of way. He didn't talk much and when he did it was quiet and he sounded almost apologetic for literally everything he said. It didn't really help that he seems/seemed to have old scars on his wrists/forearm. 

He learned the code base really quickly (within a week) and started committing more changes and updates, fixes, documentation, than any other intern I've ever seen and more than most devs at the company.

He still kept his same demeanor..I thought he was having trouble adjusting but after these two months he still talks like that and looks like he's ready to jump off a bridge.

I've also noticed (and this is the more important thing) that he's been (he might have been doing it since he started but I only noticed it about a month ago) he's gone into the bathroom at around 2 and cries, heavily to the point I've never heard anyone sob like this before and he does this every day. Only reason I know about it is because that's generally when I need to use the restroom.

Finally I've noticed he's started wearing long sleeve shirts which might be that he's hurting himself because of the scars I mentioned earlier.


I've tried talking to him a lot, asked him to eat with me, tried to be friends with this kid but he refused to talk at all (or only an apologetic yes/no) about pretty much anything outside of work. I've never had this problem anywhere near as bad with other interns. I've helped a lot of interns who were having major problems adjust but nothing like this. 

I'm not sure what to do with this kid. I could tell my manager and we could have him removed, because we don't want an employee hurting themselves, but I guarantee my manager won't let him go for any reason because of the amount of work he puts out. So what should my goal here be?

I was fortunate enough to attend a pretty good school (name wise) and have a competitive GPA (3.5+) 
I did well in most of my classes, but the projects were always very small scope, and because I'm also a biochemistry major, long story short, I never had a senior project for comp sci. 

I attended an experimental class offered on software engineering. The class was billed as this great software engineering exercise with android &amp; the latest cloud stuff. It ended up teaching me some solid GitHub, but I wish there was more good things to say.

Aside from barely skimming topics related to version control, testing, code review, build tools, docker, etc, we never really did anything of substance. The professor asked if we would be willing to talk with him in detail about the course, so I went to the office hours, and I told him that while I loved the broad overview and the ambitious amount of topics he wanted to cover, but the lab portion could really benefit from some additional depth. Would it be possible to have some additional depth with the tools we were talking about. He basically said the following:

This is a popular and prestigious research institution, and if you want to learn about tools, you should instead attend a trade school. We're expected to cover the big theory behind things here because our students go on to graduate school etc.

I felt so small at that point. I was so excited to really feel like I would have some hands on knowledge, and enough to really have some confidence to build out from the small piece-meal projects, into something grander with scope. None of that happened. I payed attention in every lecture, I followed the labs meticulously, and in the end, I just know some basic buzz words and jargon terms. I feel like HR making a job posting and just rattling off things I don't really understand.

I wish I had gotten an internship, as the entry level market is frighteningly bottle-necked. Oh well, I guess I'll have to use the internet and get working like everyone else.

**What I'm trying to accomplish now, and where I could use some solid advice**

I've got Java, I've been fooling around with HTML (which I ran on apache tomcat), VM VirtualBox, Ubuntu Server w/ postgreSQL, and some web API's.
My IDE is IntelliJ, and I'm trying to use Gradle as a built tool, because I think that will help me frame things out so I know where to put things, and let it manage my dependencies? uhhh but I'm not 100% if that first part is something it does? 

Basically, I've been working on trying to build out from a project that shows good coding practices, and continues to incorporate new skills. I don't have some great plan or thing I'm trying to solve. I just know I need to practice, and I need to bring in new technologies in order to learn them and demonstrate what I've learned. I'm trying to make a project I can push some commits to github every day on, link to on my resume, and be able to demonstrate and speak with confidence about when I talk to interviewers or someone on the street. I know being comfortable sending and retrieving data with a RDMS is great to know.

What I'm struggling with is how to frame out a project, like I thought build tools help you do that, by forcing some conventions on what files go where, and making sure you have the things you need. I'm just lost. Some advice for how to frame out projects so I know what I'm doing and can bring this all together, that would be amazing :) At this point, all I can do is basically write a few independent classes/methods to do small pieces. Gods, I hope someone gets any of this and could point me in the right direction.

62y9x2,1,2017-04-02,MS in CS or Job? Need perspective.,blazing_forehand,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/62y9x2/ms_in_cs_or_job_need_perspective/,"I am a third-year computer engineering student from Mumbai, India. The college I go to is a fairly reputed engineering college, nowhere close to an IIT or BITs, but it is better than a large percentage of 'engineering' colleges in the country. At this time, I need to decide whether I want to apply to the college placement process or go to the US to get my MS. Despite being three years into computer engineering, I am not very confident of my abilities. Most of the stuff that I have done is typical hack job stuff. I have the ability to get things done. For instance, I could get a website up and running, but I would probably struggle with a competitive coding problem. Having said that, I believe I am one of the better coders/developers in my class.

Most of the companies which come to my college for placement, are FinTechs. I am not particularly keen on working for one, but the pay is pretty good. From what I have heard from people who have worked in these companies, you tend to reach a dead end with an entry level position at these companies. Yet, I feel working a year or two will give me some time off to think about what I actually want to do.

As far as MS in CS is concerned, my grades are pretty decent. 9+ CGPA. I believe I can handle the GRE and score above average. Despite that, my overall profile is not all that great. I haven't really participated much in committees, etc. because I am a big time introvert and am a bit lazy, to be honest. All of the in-semester projects that I have done, I have done them quite sincerely. Yet, most of them are quite limited in scope and size. In my 2nd year, I did not apply for any internship because I didn't think I would need it, kind of regret it now. With some effort, I should be able to get Letters of Recommendation, from a couple of professors (including one for a TAship). That would be an uphill task too, since my interaction with everyone in general, is pretty limited. As a kid, I 'did' a lot of computers, or at least there was enough hype (including media) about it. People started believing that I could do a lot more than I knew I could. One of the few good things that came out of that was that I developed some PoCs from the ground up, and presented them at two international conferences. I was 14 then. As of now, I have a couple of options for interning, one is a startup (which is going to be really challenging), the other is a big tech player which would look make my resume look impressive. 

Right now, I am really confused as to what to do. Going to the US for MS in CS means taking up a huge loan, and working hard to pay it off. It does feel like the next natural step though. As far as I know, most of the graduate programs, require students to choose a specialization. I have 0 experience with anything other than good old development, neither is my profile strong enough. The only field I have dabbled enough with is Security, and I know that I wouldn't want to take that up. But getting a Masters is going to provide me with amazing exposure, and of course a better job than I can get now. I am not targeting a Stanford or a CMU, but at least a decent university. Doing a job right away seems like an okayish option, but it somehow feels like I am settling for something less instead of pushing myself.

There are of course other factors including peer pressure, fear of failure, a love-hate relationship with computers, and a love affair with writing, which I haven't been brave enough to pursue. I know I sound really all over the place, but it would really help to get some advice/perspective."

When they asked me to write their reports, I did so with flourish. When they had an *urgent meeting* and had to be someplace else, I worked double, triple-shifts to cover for them.

I figured to rise up in this world, you can never afford to be picky.

Unclog a septic tank? *Count me in.*

Enter a boiler room? *My pleasure.*

Counter-check the sewage with its as-built plan? *Just my kind of Tuesday.*

I did any and all possible jobs that my work required of me. The higher-ups delegated them, and whatever ended up in my table, I accomplished to the best of my ability. All of them. Just to prove myself equal. That whatever they can do, I can, too. But there’s just one thing I’ll never do:

*Enter a crawlspace again.*

___________________________________________________________________________________________


I had moved up in the construction field and was head-hunted by a project commissioning team. Now, to put it simply, whether the project be a power plant, a hospital, or a building – it generally involves three stages: Construction, commissioning, and energizing.

The commissioning team is responsible for counter-checking everything – from the structural integrity of the foundations to the sensory sensitivity of the fire detection alarms. When the commissioning team gives it’s a-ok, that’s the only time when the infrastructure could be energized and actively connected to its utility sources (electricity, gas, water, etc).

That specific project was a high-rise residential building. 8o floors, condominium style. My team was contracted to finish commissioning, and the schedule was pretty tight. For the building administrators, it meant saving time and money, but for us, this meant round-the-clock shifting.

I was called in that day at precisely 1 PM.

A breaker’s been tripping and my technicians couldn’t figure out why. The building’s automated electromechanical system traced the fault to the building’s basement. Could have been a grounded wire or something.

“Send Faiz,” I said, wiping the sweat off my brow. That day had been particularly hot, almost reaching over a hundred degree Fahrenheit.

“His wife’s going on labor right now, Ma’am,” replied the intern employee. I cannot, for the life of me, recall that boy’s name.

“Oh, right,” I remember saying, as I was distracted in recalling who was supposed to be in shift today. “What of Ben? And Kurt?”

“The electricians are way up in the 54th floor Ma’am.”

My temples throbbed at the thought of delaying the project any further. We’re already being pressured as it is.

“Fine,” I sighed. “I’ll check the basement myself. Who else is here? Who’s available?”

“Well, there’s *you* Ma’am,"" the intern said. ""And Asutosh,” he added as an after-thought.

I groaned inwardly as I turned and made my way to the underground basement.

____________________________________________________________________________________________


The Nepalese HVAC specialist sat waiting for me in the desolate basement.

*Of all people,* I thought as I approached the claustrophobic man. He waved good-naturedly in my direction as he saw me nearing.

“Come join me?” I offered jokingly.

He laughed as he said “Only if you want to drag my passed out body in and out of that hole, Ma’am.”

He nodded towards the crude opening in the wall.

“How deep?”

“I tried peeking in, shoved my torchlight and all – beam couldn’t reach anything. Might be a long crawl, Ma’am, I’m sorry.”

I sighed yet again as I steeled myself for what I was about to do.

“Don’t worry. It’s nothing I haven’t done before.”

____________________________________________________________________________________________


The crawlspace was scarcely a foot in height. 

The square-ish opening was just enough to squeeze my tiny frame into. The hot breath of the earthen ground greeted my face as I eased myself into the crawlspace. I could barely lift my stomach a few inches off the ground without having my back scraping the underneath of the floor above. The place smelled funky, like that foul scent old refrigerators produce when left out of power too long.

The rough ground scraped against my elbows and hands as I pressed onwards. I held the torchlight with my teeth and found myself staring into an endless expanse of a narrow field of earth, courtesy of the flooring hanging over my head. I could make out huge pillars every now and then in the dense darkness and pretty much nothing else. 

I was so engrossed in trying to figure out where that faulty ground may be that I jumped and made a noise like a dog being run over when I felt the hand enclose around my right ankle.

“GODDAMIT ASUTOSH!” I screamed as I tenderly massaged the top of my head. The collision with the flooring overhead sent throbbing tremors of pain, I had to grit my teeth as the man crawled to a halt beside me.

*“The next time you do that - ”*

“I’m very sorry, Ma’am,” he said quickly. He swallowed as he stared around at the darkness before us.

*“What are you even doing here?”* I asked, eyeing his pasty face and the beads of sweat on his forehead. “You’re claustrophobic! Go back!”

“No, I can’t leave you alone here, Ma’am,” he said, closing his eyes as he attempted to steady his shallow breathing.

“I can do this on my own, thanks,” I said irritatedly as I pressed on.

I found myself yet again halted as Asutosh placed a hand on my shoulder to stop my progress.

*“What?”*

Wordlessly, he procured a chain and held it out to me. And not just any chain. It was almost 8 feet long, heavily rusted, and is made up of interlocking links almost an inch in diameter. *Yep, that’s one gargantuan chain.*

“What the actual fuck, Asutosh? Are you high right now?”

He was in terrible discomfort, I could see it. I took the chain from him, heavy as it was, and nudged him backwards.

“Nevermind. Go back,” I said, making a mental note to reprimand the man the minute I get back.

He shuddered as he scrunched his eyes close a little tighter. “Can I not persuade you to come back, Ma’am?”

“What is this all of a sudden? Am I needed above ground?” I asked, torn between irritation and concern.

“No Ma’am – it’s just that,” Asutosh hesitated. He took another gulp of breath as he continued, “When you entered earlier ... *something* followed you in.”

____________________________________________________________________________________________


I pressed forwards, flinging the heavy chain out in front of me as I did so. The metal clattered noisily against the uneven ground as its weight carried itself further out.

*The noise scares them off, my family believes this,* Asutosh had said. *Just let its noise ring out every few feet or so. Please, Ma’am.*

I must admit I was scared.

Asutosh wasn’t the man who joked around. He was weird, awkward, maybe,  but he never joked around. But there was a job to be done, and I am not about to let a *something* get in the way of that. But that was easier said than done.

I chucked out the chain again when I reach it, grunting from the effort it required of me. The tiny space was suffocating, I barely had enough room to breath, much less to throw a giant chain around. I have sweated through my shirt – the crawlspace was impossibly hot. And humid. My jaw was starting to feel numb from biting the torchlight aloft, and yet, no end to the crawlspace was in sight.

It was pretty dumb of me not to bring any blueprint of the as-built plan of the basement, I realized. I mean, how could a crawlspace even be so huge? I chanced a peek backwards and had to contain a gasp as I realized I was too far from the crawlspace opening, I couldn’t see it now.

I took slow, deep breaths to try and calm myself.

It was now just me, sandwiched between the flooring and the earth, and the dense darkness in all directions. I could feel my extremities contracting, pulling me into one tight ball, my instincts warning me that to venture out any further would be foolish.

And yet, if I don’t move, would it be any better?

The heat has become soporific. Even the torchlight’s unusually strong beam in the backdrop of the darkness was dizzying. *Am I having a claustrophobic attack?*

*I am claustrophobic? Huh, who knew?*

I crawled on and on. Almost ritualistically, I threw the chain before me, heard the clatter resound in the space and crawled on until I saw the chains again. Chains. Noise. Crawl. Chains. Noise. Crawl.

I routinely stopped to get a sense of where I am, looking up into the floorings, tracing pipes and fittings in my mind.

Chains. Noise. Crawl.

Chains. Noise. Crawl.

My shoulders and legs have become stiff. My neck’s creaking with weird noises. I was so, so thirsty. Could it be possible that it was hotter here than it was outside? The dense darkness made it almost impossible to tell what the time was. I went in around 1 PM, I knew that. But how long have I been here?

Chains. Noise. Crawl.

Chains. Noise. Crawl.

The air had become so thin, I had trouble breathing. It was like I was being exposed atop a boiling kettle. The heat was draining, consuming. I was about to nod off to sleep when the torchlight began flickering.

My body jerked as if it was electrocuted. *No.*

If the torchlight failed –

In that split-second, my body instinctively pulled itself backwards, backwards, backwards to where I came. It did not matter that I couldn’t see it, all I knew was that safety was behind me. The torchlight was flickering more frequently and I craned my neck around every which way possible to see if I was closer to my exit.

I wish I hadn’t.

Wherever the dying beam of my torchlight fell, I saw something.

*It was crawling.*

I was whimpering and shaking and crying all at the same time. All fatigue and pain forgotten, I went crawling backwards as steadily as I can. Wishing, praying, for that merciful square of light in this perpetual dark.

*How could I have been so foolish?*

And then I halted to a stop.

Not because the torchlight finally went out, no. I was plunged in eternal darkness. Sandwiched between the cold flooring and the hot earthen ground. Wishing to be a part of either, because in the space between, the space where I was suspended – I most definitely am not alone.

My right foot came in contact with something. Something liquid and warm. I felt it drip on that naked flesh between my sock and pants. The smell was putrid, like a sewage leaked through the entire space. But I knew I was nowhere near the sewage pipes.

The whimper that escaped my lips turned to a scream.

*“LET ME OUTTA HERE! PLEASE! ANYONE!”*

I dove forwards, into the darkness, crawling, crawling away from whatever it was. My face felt hot and sticky from all the tears and dust and I crawled on, constantly screaming at the top of my voice.

*“LET ME OUTTA HERE! PLEASE! ANYONE!”*

I could feel cuts in my fingers and elbows and knees but I pressed on, towards what, I do not know. Away from what, I’d rather not know either.

*“LET ME OUTTA HERE! PLEASE! ANYONE!”*

I was gasping for breath. I was exhausted. And thirsty. So very thirsty. My head began to spin.

*“LET ME OUTTA HERE! PLEASE! ANYONE!”*

I froze.

Someone was screaming. 

A girl. 

And it wasn’t me. 

*NOOOOOO! NO! NO! ANYONE! HELP! PLEASE! PLEASE, ANYONEEE!""*

I was trembling. Shaking. Someone, something was playing with me. In the darkness. I jumped again as I heard the ringtone.

*My phone! How could I have forgotten it!*

I did not even stop to look at the caller ID.

“Ma’am!” came Asutosh’s frantic voice. “Ma’am! Where are you - ?”

“PULL ME OUTTA HERE ASUTOSH! PULL ME OUT!” I was bawling, tears and snot and saliva streaming down my face. “GET SOMEBODY TO GET ME OUT PLEASE!”

“You’ve been gone six hours - ”

*“Something’s in here, with me, Asutosh! My torchlight’s out, and I’ve been wondering back and forth and - ”* I whimpered towards the speaker, finding myself suddenly whispering. I was so, so scared, I had to talk and talk and talk but what if *it* hears me - ? And yet I’ve been screaming all this time –

“Ma’am do you still have the chains?”

The momentary silence from my end was all it took. “You *have* to find it, Ma’am.”

That order spurred me forwards. I wasn’t lost. I had an objective. I just have to accomplish one more task. I grunted as I pulled myself forwards. This time, a little more sluggishly, with an arm occupied by my phone.

*“Keep talking to me, Asutosh, please, I beg you,”* I whispered.

“Just get to the chains Ma’am,” he said, panting, as if he was running. “I’m on my way now with a few techs, we’re coming to get you.”

That alone renewed my resolve. I kept pressing on forwards, with the limited lighting the screen of my phone can provide. I crawled and crawled, ignoring the cuts in my wrists and knees and the bumps on my head and back.

After what seemed like hours, I reached the end of the gargantuan chain. My bloodied fingers fumbled and mounted themselves on the its rusted surface, I clung to it – it was my life line, my ticket out of this cramped space.

But I wasn’t the first to it.

My heart was beating in my ears. The cold that swept over my body was unnatural. I couldn’t dare breathe as I looked at her.

Her outstretched, pale, grayish hand was clutching the other end of the chain. She was lying on the ground, almost a mirror image of me, as she stared into me with blank, white eyes.

I was paralyzed on the spot. Asutosh was still speaking from the phone on my hand but I could not hear it. All there was was the looming darkness. And the face of the girl in front of me.

And then she began to crawl forwards.

I screamed as I have never screamed before. Every particle, every fiber of my being shriveled in sheer horror as the woman put one hand in front of the other, pulling herself forwards, closing the distance between us. She made no noise. She just crawled. I let go of the chain and instinctively covered my head with my arms.

That was all I knew.

____________________________________________________________________________________________


It took me a month to recover in the hospital. They said I was in a coma for the first week. That day, I was extracted out of that crawlspace after I’ve been noted missing for 6 hours. The extraction took almost two hours. They had to bore a hole through the 1st floor to get to me – my asphyxiation in that enclosed space was their concern and the fastest way to get me out was from above.

I pleaded not to make a big deal out of it. Stress over deadlines, the heat, and an undiagnosed claustrophobia – surely that was all the explanation everyone needed. Not the fact that, as Asutosh has revealed to me later on, according to police records years before, a girl was found dead in the lot where the building stood now. That the girl was mistakenly buried alive after she was raped by construction workers. That she died of asphyxiation as she fought to get out.

No one else needed to know.

The project commissioning went with no further hitch. But I still recall that building to this day, and hope that the girl, whoever she was, finally found her way out.

Since November I have been applying to jobs non-stop in cities I want to live in post-graduation. Currently I am in Tampa, FL and want to move to Seattle, Denver, or SanFran.

I've put out nearly 100 applications, only about 10 of which have responded, with most of those interviews being back in February asking me to apply again in March. 

Well...I went ahead and applied again in March and only one company got back to me. They currently gave me an offer in the low $5x,xxx range with a minor relocation stipend.

The company seems really neat and I'd love to work with them, but that offer is nearly 20% below market.

For context: I have 1 software engineering internship (the company later hired me on part time for nearly 2 years), as well as a technical program management internship at a large video streaming company. So I wouldnt say I'm under qualified or that below market average.

Again, the company is small so maybe thats why the offer is so low. I plan on negotiating to hopefully get to market average, but the thing is I graduate in a month and this is my only current offer. I still put out 2 or 3 applications a day, but I hardly ever even get a response back at all.....

Feeling a bit anxious and unsure, I dont want to accept such a low offer since it might hurt my future career...but at the same thing graduation is coming up....

What do?"

I will be attending a swiss tech university (EPFL) in the fall. My master's degree will be through their computer science department in communication systems, combination of electrical engineering and computer science.

My question is, how do I optimize my time during my master's in order to stay in Switzerland/ the EU after graduation? Also any advice on practical moving items to Lausanne, such as banking/cell phone are welcome.

Background:

1) Previous international experience: I have traveled several times to Europe/Latin America, including a 9 week internship at EPFL

2) Finances: I attended my state flagship with a full ride so I have no student loans. I worked different internships/jobs during the summers/school year and lived decently frugally, leaving me with ~25000 USD. At EPFL I am a reserve candidate (waitlist) for their excellence fellowship which would provide 16000 CHF/year. There is also the research scholars program that, if selected, I would make 1200 CHF/month. I obviously must wait to hear back about either of those.

Living expenses in Lausanne will be about 1500 CHF/month and annual tuition is 1200 CHF. Currently USD and CHF trade 1:1.

3) Language: I have taken through advanced french at my university and used to maintain a network of skyping buddies for practicing the spoken language. It has been over a year though since then so I definitely need to brush up.

4) Citizenship: I am only a US citizen, with my great paternal grandmother being the closest relative not born in the US, so no possibility of obtaining dual citizenship that way.

Thank you for taking the time to read.

TL;DR My question is, how do I optimize my time during my master's in order to stay in Switzerland/ the EU after graduation? Also any advice on practical moving items to Lausanne, such as banking/cell phone are welcome."

Join my team today you’ll not only get *free* sales and business ownership mentoring from yours truly, but you’ll also get a five percent price reduction on all FirmaLife products and discounted access to our monthly Strategic Empowerment seminar in Tampa. What do you say, James? You and me against the world, buddy, like old times! You psyched, or what?!”

I subtly motioned for the waitress to hand me my check, and then said, “Uh, that’s… that’s okay, man. Thanks, though.”

“Oh, *come on,* man. I *know* you. I know you’re an ambitious guy. I know you’re a *smart* guy. I also know you don’t wanna be stuck at the same dead end job forever and you know it, too. When we left college the world was ours for the taking, remember?”

“I guess.” I put a twenty on the table and stood up to leave.
 
“‘You guess?’ We were gonna change the world, the two of us! Well, *this is that opportunity,* James. FirmaLife is *it.* So I’m not taking ‘no’ for an answer, because the truth is I care too much to see you throw away your life.”

“Good seeing you, man.” I was having none of it, so I walked straight out of the cafe, across the boulevard and up to my Camry, only taking a glance back when I’d climbed inside. He was staring at me and shaking his head just a bit, as if to say ‘That’s too bad; you had a lot of potential.’ Whatever. I called my wife. 

“So! Guess who *I* just had lunch with?”

“Jimi Hendrix.”

“Close. *Eddie Bonaducce.*”

“Damn; that was my second guess. And wait, Eddie ‘Vomitucce’ Bonaducce? Did he invite you there to pay us back for the d'oeuvres he puked on at our wedding? Those lemon cookies were deceptively expensive.”

“Nope. Even better.”

“Better than snacks?”

“Better than snacks, if you can believe it. He offered me a job.”

“For real?”

“Yep. He finds me on Facebook yesterday and is all, ‘Hey, bro! Long time no see. Let’s get lunch.’ And I thought, ‘You know? I haven’t seen the guy since the wedding; it’d be nice to catch up.’”

“Rookie mistake.”

“To say the least. So I get to Mulligan’s and there he is, waving me over, and he’s sitting there with all these pie-chart printouts on the table, and a business card, and a book titled *A Better Life,* and a few bottles of some weird vitamin crap called ‘ToxiCleanse Plus.’ By the time I realized I’d been suckered into a ‘business presentation,’ it was too late. I got there at noon and am *just now leaving.*”

“Oh, my God. Please tell me he tried to recruit you for FirmaLife.” 

“Lucky guess.” 

“Hardly. You remember Carol?”

“Yeah, I think so. Lady in Customer Retention, right?”

“Accounting, but close enough. Anyway, she started FirmaLife too - like last week - and already she’s got half her damn department either selling that Toxin Cleansing jungle juice you were talking about, or trying to recruit everyone on the floor to sell it for them.”

“*Et tu,* Simon &amp; Ingram? But I mean, its hardly surprising at this point, is it? Just look at Facebook. Apparently there are *two* suckers born every minute, now, because I’ve lost a third of my friends list to this FrimaLife beast already and I only just heard about it less than a month ago. I swear I’ll never understand how people with working brains keep falling for this pyramid scheme bullshit.”

“They’re not falling for anything, James. They’re making the decision to ‘take control of their life’ and ‘make a fortune from home!’”

“Employers *hate* him! Click here to find out his secret.”

“Haha. Anyway, breaks up. I gotta run. But hey - don’t forget to purchase your sales tutorial DVDs and books for only eighty bucks each, because as you know - there’s no success in sales without ‘the system.’”

“Yeah, yeah. I’ll see you tonight, you sleazeball. Bye.”

---

That night, about an hour before Rachel got home, I went to grab my phone off the charger in the kitchen. There were two missed calls, I saw, and both, perhaps unsurprisingly, were from Eddie. There was an email from him, too. 

It read, “Hey, James! I’m super stoked you’re ready to join me on my FirmaLife adventure! Check out this video from our Analytic Fulfillment Center.”

Apparently my obvious disinterest that afternoon didn’t transmit the message of ‘fuck off’ quite clearly enough after all. I’d have to fix that. At this point, though, I was as amused as I was annoyed. So I clicked ‘play’ on the media player embedded in the message. For about thirty seconds the video was nothing more than some clips of bikini models and a freshly washed BMW, all set to some late-90’s stock rock and a background of glass skyscrapers and luxury swimming pools. Then a well groomed man took center stage, and the music faded a bit. 

“Hey there! I’m Dennis Schultz, C.E.O and founder of FirmaLife Supplements, and it’s my pleasure to welcome *you* aboard as the newest member of our proud family! I’m sure you’re excited to get started, so let’s dive right in. You’ll be selling our award winning ToxiCleanse Plus supplement, made with *real* mountain berries from the Amazonian River basin in northwestern Brazil! These berries have *incredible* organic properties that experts say cleanse your body of chemicals, toxins, G.M.O.’s, pesticides and all the other icky, nasty stuff that clogs up your system and prevents you from living the free, healthy life you deserve. Isn't that right, Kelsey?”

“Right on the money, Dennis! I was a skeptic before I tried ToxiCleanse Plus. But after my Eczema ran for the hills, I never looked back. Now I take it every day!”

“And there you have it. Thanks, Kels! As our newest Junior Marketing Field Representative, you’ll get access to personal mentoring from your upline supervisor, a Vertical Innovation pass to our monthly Strategic Empowerment seminar right here in Tampa, and last but most *certainly* not least, an incredible *5% discount* on all FirmaLife products. That means you can get your first FirmaLife Cross-Platform Marketing Startup Kit for the astounding price of only *$149.99!* 

Epileptic images consumed the screen, filled with cascading dollar bills and price points ripped right from a public access car ad. Then Dennis continued. 

“But the path to *true* financial success with FirmaLife lies not only in the distribution of Premium Products to consumers, but also in your attendance to all our unmissable Strategic Empowerment seminars *and* in your ability to spread the gospel of FirmaLife to your friends, your family, your coworkers, and your neighbors, so they can join you on the path to business ownership, wealth generation, and lifelong health. And remember - If I can afford to live like a king with FirmaLife, then *so can you!* So let’s get out there and change the world, one person at a time, with FirmaLife!”

The video ended after two excruciating minutes, when Dennis walked away towards his mansion with a supermodel locked on his arm. I typed out a response to Eddie: “Hey man! It was good to see you earlier. Just to clear things up, though, I am *not* interested in joining FirmaLife. Thanks.” 

But Eddie didn’t get the hint. Instead, he dialed me up *five more times that day* and left a peppy voicemail every time I rejected the call. He also emailed me twice more, asking in the first for my payment info so he could send me my Startup Kit, and in the second for my schedule for the next week so we could meet up again and in his words, ‘get the ball rolling.’ I was absolutely amazed at how little power the word ‘no’ had in this day and age. But it was worth one more shot, I reasoned, in case he didn’t get the last email. I hit redial a few minutes after the evening’s fourth call. 

“Yo, yo! Its Eddie with FirmaLife. Sorry I can’t get to the phone right now, but leave your name and your digits and I’ll be sure to get back to you as soon as I can. And remember, if Plan ‘A’ doesn’t work, the alphabet has twenty-five more letters! So stay positive, and I’ll see *you* at the top!”

*BEEP*

“Look, Eddie. I know I made myself perfectly clear the first time and even *more* clear the second time. I. Am. Not. Interested. In. FirmaLife. Alright? I don’t want to buy it and I don’t want to sell it. You need to leave me alone about this. Bye.”

Unsurprisingly, though, it didn't work. He called me back within three minutes and I sent it straight to Voicemail. 

“Hey, man! Sorry I missed your ring. Guess we’re playin’ the ol’ phone tag game, huh? Haha. Anyway, yeah, bro! The sooner you send me your credit card digits, the sooner I can shoot you your Startup Kit and you can start makin’ some *real* mulah! Get back at me when you can, bro. Peace.”

I laughed out loud in the middle of my empty living room. Then I blocked his number. *Dick.*

But not even that stopped him. The next day, Eddie emailed me *eleven times* and called me twice, from a new number. I blocked that one, too, but it took him less than two hours to get *another* one still, and the cycle began anew. Day after day, night after night. Call. Voicemail. Email. Flyer. Call. Voicemail. Email. Flyer. I did everything I could to throw him off my tail, but always he managed to find me and at no point did my ranting and raving convince him to head for open waters. Meanwhile, Rachel was coming home every day with fresh updates about her own experience with Carol’s growing army of FirmaLife zealots. 

“Darlene is in on this now, James,” she said on Tuesday. “*Darlene.*”

“Which one is Darlene?”

“My only friend and confidant left. At least she *was.* We get coffee together on Wednesdays, down at the Cafe in the lobby. Usually we talk about the boss or shitty customers or good shows, but lately we’ve been talking about Carol and her FirmaLife zombie bitches. But today? She tried to sell me *this!”* She held up a pamphlet bearing the unmistakable lima green loop logo of FirmaLife. “She flipped on me, James! I said ‘no’ like *ten times,* but she wouldn’t give up! I had to take it just to be nice!”

“Shit. Are you serious?” I took it from her and turned it over in my hand. 

“It was the most uncomfortable moment of my life. This lady was a total skeptic *yesterday* - an ally in the fight against the hordes of Carol - and now she’s one of ‘em.” She sighed. “Whatever. So how goes the fight against Eddie Vomitucce? He still not taking the hint?”

“I don’t think telling him to ‘fuck off’ multiple times qualifies as a *hint,* but whatever it is, no, he ain’t takin’ it. I got three emails at work today from him, asking me to give him a call so we could ‘brainstorm’ and ‘strategize’ about ‘market opportunities’ and ‘networking analytics.’”

“Doesn't the Geneva Convention list 'buzzword abuse' as a war crime? Also, why don't you just block his number?”

“I did. Six different times.”

“How’s he still getting through?”

“He has a new fucking number every day! He’s actually making them faster than I can block ‘em.”

“What the *hell.* This is *not* normal, James. Even the friends we lost to Amway gave up on us after a single ‘no.’”

She was right, too. I didn’t want to admit it at first, but this was no normal multilevel marketing scheme. The next day on the way to work, I counted no fewer than *six* FirmaLife bumper stickers, and two billboards with Dennis Schultz’s douchebag smile plastered all over them. ‘Take your life back!’ said one. ‘Your fortune awaits!” read the other, barely a half mile ahead of the first and just before my exit. And the day after that, the bumper sticker count had climbed to twelve, and on Friday there was a third billboard up that read ‘Partake In The Cleanse,’ and there were *seventeen* stickers. 

Before long, the FirmaLife disease was no longer restricted to my wife or my commute. Over the weekend I watched through half-closed bay window curtains as nine of our neighbors installed FirmaLife yard signs by their mailboxes. And on Monday, I was sitting in my cubicle when I overheard Willie from HR talking to some of the accounting interns about FirmaLife. They were nodding in agreement, too, seemingly having already had their fill of the Amazonian kool-aid. On top of that, four others stopped by my cubicle on the way to Willie’s little meeting to tell me about the benefits of ‘organic supplemental cleansing.’ I nodded as they spoke and tried to politely convey my disinterest, but still they persisted. Things had quickly evolved from annoying to bizarre to unnerving to legitimately scary. I called Rachel around noon to check up on her, but I got her voicemail. 
 
“Hey, its Rachel! Leave your name and number at the beep, and I’ll get back to you.”

*BEEP.*

“Hey, hun. Its started here, too. H.R. and Accounting are in some kind of FirmaLife circlejerk thirty feet from my cubicle. People have been taking about ‘Partaking in the Cleanse’ all day, too, which is exactly the creepy-ass slogan plastered on the latest Dennis Shultz douchebag memorial billboard they threw up over I-95 today. Shit is getting *weird* now. Everyone but me is involved in this bullshit and nobody is acting like themselves anymore. I think I’m gonna head home early; I just wanted to check in and see if you were okay. Call me back when you can. Love you.”

I put the phone in my pocket and threw my jacket on before clocking out and making my way to my boss’s office. 

“Hey, sir. I’m feeling a bit under the weather. Think I might need to head home for the d-”

“James! Great to see you, son. Hey, have you tried the Cleanse yet?” He was holding a bottle of ToxiCleanse. “Its fantastic. I’m feeling *real healthy.*”

“Uh, n-no, sir. Can’t say I have. Anyway, I’ve got a splitting headache, so-”

“You know what they say: ‘Once you join FirmaLife, you’re in it *for a life.*’ *Hahahahaha!* And boy, are they right! I wouldn’t trade this stuff for the whole world, James. Not for the whole world.”

*Fuck this.* I turned around and was about to bolt for the main door when I ran smack into Janice. I apologized profusely, but she didn’t seem to mind. In fact, she seemed absurdly happy to see me. 

“You should join my team!” She said. “We’re the tippy-top of the FirmaLife sales force. Great friends, great money, great health, and great opportunities! What do you say?”

“Not interested, Janice.” I was losing patience with etiquette, so I shouldered past her and walked briskly to the door, trying my best to avoid any and all eye contact with my coworkers. But again I was roadblocked, this time mere inches from the prize. 

“James, ol’ buddy!” Brandon ran out from the break room. “Hey, take a swig of this ToxiCleanse. It sure does make you feel *real healthy!*”

“I will ram that bottle down your goddamn throat, Brandon.” I turned around before he could respond and finally made it out the door, down the stairs, and out into the parking lot. My heart was thundering at this point, but for some reason - and to this day I’m not sure why - I thought it was a good idea to turn around and look at the lobby behind me. 

There they were, on the other side of the glass. Janice. Brandon. Willie. Mike. Erica. Jessica D. and Jessica M. were both there, too, as well as a handful of the interns whose names I had yet to learn. Every last one of them was watching me with menacing scowls, like I was prey who slipped the net by the skin of his teeth. 

I didn’t stick around any longer; I turned around and booked it the rest of the way to my Camry, passing about twenty cars in the lot with FirmaLife bumper stickers slapped onto their backsides. I jumped into my car; slammed the door, and then I peeled out of the lot and took off towards home. 

*This is not normal. This is not normal. This is not normal.* 

I called my wife again and left another message. 

“Hey, Rachel. Holy, shit, babe. I think I figured it out. There’s something in that bullshit ToxiCleanse crap. There has to be. Everyone in my office is just guzzling the stuff and every single goddamn person, like, completely independently of each other - is either trying get me to sell the stuff or drink it. Even my boss was all like ‘James, ol’ boy. Try the ‘Cleanse! You’ll feel *real healthy* when you try the Cleanse.’* So I faked a headache and bolted. Hope you’re doing okay there, hun. Leave early if you can.”

I pulled up to our driveway around fifteen minutes later, got out, and walked up to my front d-

“You don’t got one.”

I stopped and turned to my left. Douglas Boetticher was standing up on his front porch, watching me. 

“I’m sorry, what?”

“A sign. You don’t got one.” He pointed to his front yard. Guess what lima green logo was rammed into his grass on a wooden stick. “Everyone else’s got one. But not you.”

I looked around. He was right; ours was the only lot on North Shepherd Street not fancifully adorned with a FirmaLife yard sign. Doug continued.

“You tried the Cleanse, didn’tcha? You feel real healthy when you *try the Cleanse.*”

“No, Doug. I haven’t tried the Cleanse, yet. Can you believe it? *I haven’t tried the Cleanse.* And guess what? I’m not *going* to try the Cleanse, unless you break my fucking jaw and beer-funnel it into my mouth. SO SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT THE GODDAMN CLEANSE!!”

“You seem stressed, James.” A voice now came from the house on the other side of ours.”You should try the Cleanse.”

“I WILL CLEANSE YOU FROM THIS EARTH, EMILY. SO HELP ME GOD!”

“Try the Cleanse, James.” Mrs. Measeley joined in now, from across the street. “You’ll feel real healthy when you try the Cleanse.”

“Try it, James,” said John and Donna Scheuemann, in unison. “Try the Cleanse.”

I whirled around. Every one of my neighbors, having heard the commotion, had now exited their homes and were slowly closing in on my house.

“Try the Cleanse, James. You’ll feel real healthy when you try the Cleanse.”

“Try it, James.”

“Partake in the Cleanse.”

“Stay the *fuck* back, all of you! I will call the police!”

But they didn’t listen; they just kept right on inching forward. 

“Try the Cleanse, James.”

“Try the Cleanse.” 

“Partake in the Cleanse with us, James.”

“*I’M NOT TRYING THE FUCKING CLEANSE, YOU MANIACS!! I WILL-*”

*Bzzzzz. Bzzzzz.*

I looked at my phone. A text from Rachel.

I will admit, I am a little bit behind the curve in this process in that I am still looking for a summer internship. I applied to a bunch of companies in the fall but didn't get much back. Since then I've participated in a ton of case competitions, have a new internship under my belt, raised my GPA, declared a minor, basically I've got a lot more going for me now than I did then. If I could time travel back to the fall I'm pretty confident that I would be able to get something. 


I have about 49 applications in currently, but unfortunately most of the programs are closing up as we speak. I *do* have two offers for the summer, but they are at pharma companies, and I feel that a bank or financial institution would be a better fit for me.

Are there any opportunities for someone this late in the process? "

There's a GPA minimum that I need to meet first, so it's definitely too early for me to say anything for sure, but I have some basic programming knowledge and am fully prepared to do more than my best. 

One thing that concerns me is the sheer number of students in the CS program. The intro CS class (CS 61a) had 1700 students in Fall 2015, and I'm sure that number will increase another couple hundred this year. In 2015, there were 330 CS degrees at Berkeley, which rose to 422 degress in 2016. Clearly CS's popularity among young adults is growing rapidly. 

My concern - in four years when I graduate, will the job market still be as profitable and full of opportunities as it is now? I love programming, but future salary and job stability is still important to me. With that many CS students graduating each year, will there still be ""enough"" jobs at top tech companies and so for students like me? In addition, while Berkeley has tremendous opportunities in startups, internships, etc., I'm scared that because of the number of students, good positions will be hard to compete for if I'm not the best of the best. Is this something I should be concerned about? Any thoughts about the future of CS with so many new grads each year? Thank you so much.

6319nw,35,2017-04-02,Socializing with the opposite sex,Tway9966,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/6319nw/socializing_with_the_opposite_sex/,"So to preface I go to a large state university with a pretty strong party culture. 

My friends decided to go to a party last night and they asked if I wanted to go. I've known about this party for a while, almost 2 weeks, so at first I said yes. 

Well, the closer the party became, the less I wanted to go. So we're sitting on the bus on the way to this party and I just couldn't bring myself to get off at the stop. Instead, I stayed on and got off at a different stop. I chose to go to my lab and do research instead of going along with my friends. I'm not sure if it was social anxiety or whether I actually didn't want to go. I know that it would've been beneficial to go for the social experience but I was too afraid I would end up standing alone in a corner and drinking alone again or saying something stupid to someone I don't even know and embarrassing myself. I see all these good looking girls all going to this party but I don't have the courage to talk to them let alone go to the same freaking place they are going. I could see the disappointed looks on my friends faces but I couldn't do it. I think my social anxiety has gotten to a point where any interaction with girls, other than work, has become absolutely terrifying to me. I'm just really frustrated that I can't be a normal college kid and go to these parties to have fun. I figured I would type this up now, right after it happened, so I could get advice quicker. However, I guess now work is on my agenda for the next few hours since I wussed out of going.

For some reason, I just find myself unable to talk to girls unless its regarding a project for class. Now I don't really talk to much of anyone but I find it easier to talk to males and adults. I think it is because they don't judge as harshly as I think girls do (I could be wrong). When it comes to anything work related, i.e. internships, jobs, research, I have absolutely no problem talking to anyone. The part I struggle with is taking it beyond work. I'm so socially inept and don't know how to talk to people that when I try to extend the conversation past work, it becomes extremely awkward.

This month marks my 10th month up at university and I can count on one hand how many people I have met and the majority are guys. I've never been in a relationship and everyone always tells me that college is the time to see what type of person you really like. Well, if you can't talk to them and socialize like a normal human being how am I supposed to figure out what type of person I like?

Like seriously, how do I be normal? All I do is work and I never get out to eat people and when I do, I wuss out almost every time. Or if I get to the point where I go to the party, I usually just end up standing in a corner alone drinking away until I'm completely shit-faced and can't stand up. 

My friends had a fun time and they said I should've come but I actually don't have the capability to meet new people and I don't know why.

TL:DR: What are girls and how do you talk to them?"
6320dp,2,2017-04-02,Midlife change of career questions.,MyIndianaLife,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6320dp/midlife_change_of_career_questions/,"Hello folks.  I'm hoping to get some basic guidance when it comes to changing my career and hopefully getting into something CS related.  Currently I hold a run of the mill four year degree in public management.  My current position has become a financial dead end.  While I do OK financially, the so-so pay combined with other aspects of the job have me looking to make a change.

I have four relatives and three good friends, all local, all of whom work in the CS/IT industry.  They not only found jobs during or right after college, many have changed jobs over the years and never had any issues finding work in our area (major metro, US Midwest).  This is a big deal for me as I'd rather stay in this area, while at the same time obtain skills and knowledge that would make finding similar work in another larger metro area easier (even if the pay is lower).  Everyone seems happy with their job.

I qualify for tuition benefits at a local university, which has an excellent CS degree.  This is likely the most cost efficient route for me, but also the longest to obtain any sort of official document that claims I've learned something.  I've also heard of quick turnaround programming schools that provide ""certificates.""  I'm not sure if those will get me what I need and I will have more out-of-pocket costs going that route.  

I have a general understanding of computers as it stands now, but my knowledge of programming is minimal.  Some may ask why CS.  I've always enjoyed computers, but mostly internet related aspects of computers.  In my younger years I would read up on programming and play with it somewhat, with my Amiga 2000, but nothing in-depth.  I really enjoy problem solving and finding solutions and I've always wanted to know more about computer technology and software.  Look for suggestions on my best course of action.  I'm lucky in that in three to four years I might be financially secure enough that I could quit my job if need be.  Either to finish my degree sooner, or possibly take an internship that might lead into something full-time.  I won't need to make much, but I'd definitely like to obtain a skill set that will help me obtain a position that pays in the upper five figures down the road.  I do have some worries about age discrimination, but hopefully that won't be an issue.  Also, basic IT/Help desk type jobs seem to be lower pay, and I'm looking to do something more in-depth within CS.  Thank in advance for any suggestions or tips.

TL;DR: I'm looking for a new career with a goal to stay in my current city.  CS seems strong in my area.  Friends and relatives have done well and have never had a problem with employment here over the last two decades.  I can either go back to a university for a CS degree or choose another path.  Just looking for suggestions."

Really trying to figure out what bachelor I'm going to do after my study and I'd love to get some advice on that subject :D
**Litte about my current sitiation:**
I'm currently in my third year (of four) of a game programming study, 2 months into my one year internship. I'm pretty good at C#, Unity, PHP, JavaScript, Java and game/level/interaction design. Really getting some experience in the industry right now and have the idea that I have enough skills to function great in most small game studios in the Netherlands.
[Maybe my portfolio sketches a better image.](http://davidschep.com/)
**What I'm looking for:**
I'd love to study full time abroad (currently live in the Netherlands), Europe sounds like the best option since this is not that expensive compared to Australia or the USA. Really want to develop myself in low-level (so for instance doing all the rendering myself, not 'low-level' as in less difficult) game development, languages like C++ and C, networking, and machine learning. Also would like to improve on math, graphics programming and you name it.
**Now finally my question**
What kind of study am I looking at? I don't want to do all the same stuff all over for the first 2 years. Should I look into computer science, computer engineering, or game programming? Any advice on universities, countries or studies? 
Thanks in advance for your time, and may you have a great day! :)"

I know that data structures/algorithms are what's mainly asked for in interviews so I'm worried that taking this class while interviewing is a bad idea. 

I've taken data structures which the class description goes as:
	
""Linear and hierarchical data structures, including stacks, queues, lists, trees, priority queues, advanced tree structures, hashing tables, dictionaries and disjoint-set. Abstractions and strategies for efficient implementations will be discussed. Linear and hierarchical algorithms will be studied as well as recursion and various searching and sorting algorithms. Programming concepts include Object Orientation, concurrency and parallel programming. Several in-depth projects in C++ will be required.""

While the Algorithms and Complexity class I won't have completed goes as:

""A rigorous review of asymptotic analysis techniques and algorithms: from design strategy (such as greedy, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming) to problem areas (such as searching, sorting, shortest path, spanning trees, transitive closures, and other graph algorithms, string algorithms) arriving at classical algorithms with supporting data structures for efficient implementation. Throughout, the asymptotic complexity is studied in worst case, best case, and average case for time and/or space, using appropriate analysis techniques (recurrence relations, amortization). Introduction to the basic concepts of computability and NP-complete theory.""

Could it be bad that I don't have this class finished by the time I'm interviewing for jobs? (I'm not applying to Google or anything like that if that changes something.)

I'm 10 weeks away, with little fear of failure since I'm just wrapping up my senior project and taking a GE requirement. My only real excitement stems from paying off my loans and not having to live on such a strict budget for once. Throughout my education I always thought the next quarter would bring me some kind of enjoyment  from projects, or help me find a niche in my major that felt more like a hobby than work but it never came. Even after doing well in my courses and working my way from food service to a paid internship I have yet to find joy in engineering. The most positive feeling I possess is that of a pride at making it through rigorous course work and succeeding in a field that I don't feel any belonging.

632x6x,46,2017-04-02,Informational Post: The Claremont Colleges,virtualpropinquity,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/632x6x/informational_post_the_claremont_colleges/,"Given the request for information about colleges, I thought I’d do one about the 5 undergraduate Claremont Colleges (Claremont McKenna {or CMC}, Harvey Mudd {or Mudd}, Pitzer, Pomona, Scripps). They are commonly referred to the 5C’s. For context, I am a Pomona senior, so these comments should be taken with the perspective of a Pomona student.

The consortium is one of the best parts of attending the Claremont Colleges. It genuinely does give you access to resources that most liberal art colleges would not give you or not as conveniently as the 5C’s do. Pomona is located on the southwest end, but I can reach Pitzer (at the northeast) within 20 minutes by walking or 10 minutes by biking. Other consortia require vans and other inconvenient systems, whereas all the colleges are adjacent to each other.  But it is not perfect, and I want to highlight those instances.

When you register for courses, you see a list of all the 2200 courses offered across the 5 colleges. There’s no hassle or paperwork to take courses at the other colleges. The academic calendars/finals time periods/etc. are all synchronized, so there’s no worry about overlap between different systems. One of the wonderful things is that all these courses are taught in the intimate liberal arts model. Each of the 5C’s are top 35 LACs with intimate, accessible professors and small classes. Most people will take at least one course at the other schools, and many a good amount (6-12), but in general, Mudd and Pomona students take the least number of courses elsewhere. Pomona is the largest and richest of the 5C’s, so one could stay in Pomona and still have more than enough courses to take (32 needed to graduate, 600 offered at Pomona alone). Mudd is academically so rigorous that students see the additional walking time to the other colleges as an economic cost to taking them at HMC. For reference, I have only taken 2 courses at the other 5C’s, and both at Harvey Mudd. Not because I couldn't take more, but because I had such a huge range of great courses at Pomona alone that I didn't feel the need to go take courses elsewhere. 

As streamlined as the academic curriculum is, you won’t have equal access to all the courses. Some courses will give priority to students from the home institution or will explicitly not let any students from the other colleges register (though the latter is rare). At Pomona, one needs to complete 16 courses at the home school, though the rest can be at the other colleges. The other 5C’s have similar restrictions for how much cross-registration you can do.

The social aspect of the 5C’s is fantastic. One of the best perks is that your meal plan includes access to all 7 dining halls. If you wanted to eat at Mudd for all your four years as a Pomona student, you could do that. The food is incredible at the 5C’s. Each school is competing with the others to bring as many students to their own dining hall, so that keeps the quality across the colleges high. Another thing is that you get these meal dollars which can be used at eateries across each college. I’ve never gotten tired of the wide diversity of quality food across the colleges. The social life is hosted by all five schools. When one school throws a party, it is open to students of all the colleges. All the concerts, speaker series, film screenings, festivals, etc. are open to students from all the colleges. There are 250 organizations across the colleges, and most are 5C in nature, like a capella groups, the outdoors club, the Pomona Jazz Band, and the Theater Department at Pomona (yes, even though it says Pomona, those groups have students from all 5C’s). A big thing is that the employer fairs and career opportunities at one school are open to students at all the schools. This gives incentive for employers to come to the 5C’s over other schools, since they can target 5500 undergraduates rather than 2000. This gives you access to a much richer life than you’d get at the other liberal art colleges. Your alumni network is not just your home school, but all the other colleges’ as well. It does feel like the best of both worlds: getting an exclusive, undergraduate focused LAC experience, but with the resources of a larger university. But the thing is, we’re not a big school, even when combined. You’re not going to get the party school atmosphere or the big sports culture here. If you want intense school spirit, the 5C’s won’t give that to you. There are some weeks (especially midterms/final time) when the social scene is all but dead. The culture is more comparable to a small university like Rice or WashU rather than UCLA or USC. 

Opportunities at the colleges include academic programs most LACs don’t have, like engineering courses at Mudd, accounting and finance at CMC, urban studies at Pitzer, and Italian at Scripps. Unique highlights like Mudd’s Clinic Program and CMC’s semester in the Silicon Valley/Washington D.C. are open to all students. Many of our study abroad opportunities are open to students from all the school, such as the Pitzer Program in Nepal.  There is a 5C research program that will enable you to do research at the other colleges, and all professors open their labs and research experiences to students from the other schools. For instance, the only forensic psychologist at the 5C’s is at CMC, and my friend at Pomona who wants to do that post-grad is working with him directly. But there are things closed off to students from the other schools as well. Pomona is the most exclusive of them all. They will not enable off-campus students to take advantage of internship funding, Pomona’s large summer research program, and the funds they have for conferences/travel/etc. Pomona will not let other 5C students go on their off-campus trips like Ski Beach Day or $20 Disneyland Trip. I think it's the same way at other colleges hosting off-campus fun trips only for their students, but the other schools tend to be more receptive about providing experiences for all students. 

Your friend group will primarily come from your home school, and that is where you will be gaining most of your meaningful experiences and relationships. I would say 90% of my 5C friends are from Pomona, but that feels a bit on the high end because I didn't take too many courses elsewhere; it's probably more like 75/25 for other people. Each school culturally attracts a particular type of student, and admissions picks that out in admitting students, so you’ll be closest to people from your school. Some people want a new experience and can do a housing exchange with the other colleges. One thing is that relationship between each of the colleges feels like sibling rivalries. Pomona gets a perception as being the most elitist, whereas Pitzer gets one of not being as serious as the others. Pomona and CMC have a rivalry that you’ll see pop up in not just athletics, but in your interactions with students and faculty. These are all built on stereotypes, but at the end of the day, we’re just one big family and treat each other as such. You’ll see us bickering about which school is better, but if an outsider makes fun of one of our 5C family, we will jump to their defense. What are each of the schools like? I will defer to our [satirical publication](http://www.thegoldenantlers.com/the-top-5-most-popular-posts/), where you can see the stereotypes of each school in the “Breaking News: Insert School Name Application 2013-2014” articles. For instance, Pomona’s is [here](http://www.thegoldenantlers.com/breaking-news-pomona-college-application-2013-2014-leaked-to-the-golden-antlers/). It’s funny and has a kernel of truth, as they all do. If you want a more specific depiction, I would be happy to provide it for you. 

One thing people wonder about is the location: how easy is it to get out to LA? Pomona has the best location within the colleges because it is just 2 blocks north of the train station which will drop you off at Downtown. It is also within walking distance to a bus station which will take you to 2 large malls. Mudd and Pitzer have to trek 25 minutes by walking to get to these places, so it isn’t as convenient. Pomona is also directly adjacent to the Claremont Village, which is a lovely town filled with great restaurants and natural beauty, whereas the other 5C’s are further away. Lastly, Pomona is the home base of the outdoors club of the 5C’s, so their students are more acquainted with the variety of trips being hosted to explore the rich geographic diversity of the area (though the trips are open to all 5C's). On a broader note, getting to some parts of LA is easier than others. The public transportation system is there, but it’s not as robust as some other places. Having a car will make things easier and more convenient, and again, one thing Pomona has is the largest student body, the most parking spaces, and the Zipcar car rental system, which means that you can have a car or find a car buddy quickly here compared to the other schools. There are collaborations between the schools. For instance, one of our social media pages is about all the concerts happening in the LA area, and you’ll see students from all the colleges working together to get to and from there. All in all, your experience will depend on the school, but in general, people do take advantage of their surroundings to a considerable degree. I’ve not had a car and been to so many places in LA- its renowned museums like the Getty and LACMA, to the LA Philharmonic 3 times, to Disney Land/Universal Studios/Wizarding World of HP, to Broadway performances at the Pantages theater, to Taylor Swift and Beyonce concerts, and so much more. Most of these opportunities were paid for by my college. I would say- don’t expect a big city life, no matter where you attend in the 5C's. Claremont is as quiet as it gets in the sprawl of SoCal, and it still takes a good hour to get to LA. Most of your experiences will be shaped not by things in the city but by the social life within the colleges themselves. 

Things aren’t perfect at the 5C’s, but we are so fortunate to have such a cohesive system of colleges and opportunities within our immediate reach, as well as access to an incredible city. I have gotten an unparalleled undergraduate experience at Pomona, but I’ve never been bored by our tiny population of 1650 students because the 5C’s genuinely make it feel so much bigger and lively. I feel incredibly fortunate to be a part of such a great group of colleges, and I’d encourage those who’re deciding between one of us and a larger school to not just take the small population to heart at what is possible to do here. 

On a final note, for those considering Mudd, the 5C Newspaper just released an [internal document](http://tsl.news/news/6611/) about student concerns with the workload. I strongly encourage you to read the report, as well as the actions the school is proposing to make the atmosphere better. 

I can talk about specific experiences at Pomona if people are interested, but this has already got so large that I’ll stop here for now. Happy to answer your questions about the colleges if you have any- I know a good deal even about the ones I don't attend. "

6339ds,91,2017-04-02,UCLA Pros and Cons,PoorLatvianFarmer,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6339ds/ucla_pros_and_cons/,"Hey y'all, I've seen a bunch of people posting the pros and cons of universities that they go to and I haven't seen one for UCLA yet, so I'll go ahead and give my input. I'm a first-year in-state Econ student.

General Pros:

1. Weather can't be stated enough

2. The dorm food is amazing. I know you might be thinking that on-campus food shouldn't sway your decision, and maybe you're right, but having access to the #1 on-campus food in the country is more than a small perk.

3. Campus and the surrounding area is clean and safe.

4. The campus is beautiful.

5. Academics are great. After all, we're a top 5 public school in America and ranked as highly as #8 out of all universities (public and private) in the world.

6. Basketball games are some of the most fun I've had in my life.

7. The people, though often competitive, seem to be nice and genuine for the most part.

8. The name of UCLA carries weight in the area. Although Berkeley in general might be slightly more prestigious, the difference is marginal and I'd even say that UCLA's name has more impact in LA.

9. There's always something to do whether or not you're down to drink.

10. The vast majority of students love it here.

11. Whatever you want to do, there's a 99% chance there's an opportunity to do it. The campus is enormous so there are resources for pretty much everything.

12. Despite the sheer size of the campus, it's pretty easy to make friends.

13. We have a [booming meme page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/163576114113950/?ref=bookmarks). Again, please don't let memes impact where you choose to go to college, but the group does give a pretty good look into UCLA's culture.

General Cons:

1. You have to walk to get everywhere. I have classes over a mile away from my dorm and there are hills and stairs.

2. It's a pain in the ass to own a car (and close to impossible if you're a freshman) and the public transportation is mediocre at best. Uber rides add up.

3. Dorms are nice but pretty small and expensive.

4. Classes are enormous until you get deep into your field of study. TAs can be pretty helpful but it's not the same as getting to know your professor, which you have to put in a lot of effort to do.

5. Lots of stuff especially in competitive majors is graded on a curve (typically 25% A, 35% B, 25% C, 15% D or F) which can hurt because most people who go here are smart.

6. OOS and international students get boned by tuition.

7. People tend to dislike the quarter system. I like it, but it does suck in some ways.

Econ/Business Pros:

1. There are many on-campus organizations (business fraternities, career-specific groups) that are essentially guarantees to get a job in whatever field you want to go into.

2. The finance community is burgeoning among students and there is plenty of access to UCLA alumni doing what you want to do in the future.

3. The Econ professors are (mostly*) pretty good.

4. We are a semi-target for some investment banks and a decent number go into top consulting firms. Even those who come up short in recruiting for jobs in those fields still get great jobs in stuff like corporate finance.

5. Internships are possible as soon as your freshman year.

6. LA has a lot of opportunities that UCLA has the most control over (USC has a solid presence, too, but we have more people).

Econ/Business Cons:

1. There's no business school.

2. It's tough to find econ classes that are relevant to your career goals. It's mostly theoretical stuff that gets annoying.

3. ""Business Economics"" is *literally* just Economics with some extra accounting classes and doesn't really resemble a business school.

4. A lot of opportunities in Econ are only available for those who know the right students. These people are mostly pretty accessible, but sometimes it's tough to know who the right people to talk to are.

5. The premier business organizations on campus are pretty exclusive. The business frats like DSP and AKPsi get over 100 people to come out for rush and have acceptance rates around 15-20%. Bruin Asset Management (the premier investment banking society that can relative easily get you a job at a bulge bracket) is &lt;10%. Bruin Consulting is similar. There are definitely things you can do yourself to increase your odds, but still, the structure of the whole thing is pretty competitive. This it to be expected at a place like UCLA that isn't a major target, but still, it's worth noting.

My personal experience - My final decision was between UCLA and Berkeley and I'm reminded everyday why I'm happy that I chose to go to school here. While applying, I really wanted to get out of LA, but I realized how expensive OOS was and how much happier I'd be at UCLA than Berkeley. That said, I totally understand that people pick Berkeley and are happy they did, too.

Advice - For those of you deciding between UCLA and Berkeley, don't let prestige sway you one way or the other. The difference is small enough that you should go where you feel you'll fit better. For those OOS/international students who are weighing the cost of UCLA, you really have to take it on a case-by-case basis. There are times where it's not worth it and times where it is. It really depends on your scenario and other options. For those who are in-state and desperately want to leave, realize that the campus is crazy diverse and you're gonna sometimes feel like you're going to college out-of-state just because of who you're around. For those just choosing between UCLA and another campus or two, I hope my post gave you some insight. Feel free to ask any more questions in the comments or PM me if you have anything personal!"

I was also accepted to Santa Clara University, but I'm not considering it seriously as they did not give me any aid. Here are my thoughts so far on where to go.

USF - yearly $39k. Good location for CS and in general, have heard a lot of good things about Jesuit schools. Don't know too much about their computer science program or how easy it is to get experience/internships. Additionally I have little/no knowledge of school culture or social life.

UOP - yearly $20k. Not the greatest location, but it will end up being cheap. I have heard that there are good opportunities to intern and that the co-op program is really great. Apparently the CS program/classes are small, which appeals to me. A smaller school than USF which is also appealing to me.

UCSD - yearly $30k. I was accepted as undeclared and I don't know how difficult it will be to transfer into CS. Also UCSD is way bigger than the other schools, and I'm not sure I want such a big school. Additionally, from what I have heard, the social life is somewhat lacking. Being accepted undeclared is my biggest concern though definitely.


As you can see I don't have a ton of information about the programs at these schools. I appreciate any advice or guidance particularly from current students at these schools. Thanks for taking the time to read through this post."

633yhp,95,2017-04-02,Princeton: Pros and Cons,TedCruzSays,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/633yhp/princeton_pros_and_cons/,"Someone requested a cons list for Princeton in another thread, so here’s my analysis of my time here (current sophomore). Princeton was my top choice in HS, and I have honestly been somewhat disappointed by my experience here. 

Pros: 

-	Flexibility of major: you’re not admitted just to a particular school so it’s very easy to switch from engineering (BSE) to non-engineering (AB) or vice versa during your freshman year (you can switch after but it starts becoming hard to fulfill all the prereqs/requirements)
-	Proximity to NYC: ~1-1.5 hr train ride to NYC, you probably wont have time to go a ton on weekends but it’s very helpful for recruiting for companies (particularly finance companies which are generally headquartered in NYC) for when you have in person interviews, etc because you’re losing a lot less time in travel than someone coming from the further school (eg. Harvard, Dartmouth, Duke)
-	Recruiting: Top companies (eg. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, McKinsey, Bain, BCG) have Princeton as a target recruiting school, these companies basically don’t recruit state or other less highly ranked schools. Note: this isn’t really unique to Princeton and you’ll get this benefit at HPYS, etc (and also NYU for a lot of the financial firms because you’re right in the city)
-	Quality of peers: you’ll meet some incredibly smart people who will shape the way  you think, probably not unique from other similar caliber schools though
-	Professors: a ton of great (and not great but that’s for later) professors who are at the top of their field (eg. Alan Blinder in econ)
-	On campus speakers: Sonia Sotomayor spoke here this weekend, Rick Santorum is coming next week; top quality campuses draw top quality speakers both alumni and not
-	Political diversity: more of a conservative presence than many comparable peer institutions, allows for more robust political discourse (note: still predominantly liberal campus)
-	Zee group system: You are grouped into a group of ~20 other freshmen who live in your hall area and get a junior or senior Residential College Adviser who hosts weekly social events for your “zee (advisee) group.” Some of these groups become close and you can probably make at least a couple friends through this. The RCAs are generally great people who genuinely care about your wellbeing and are great sources just to talk to or if you’re having problems. 
-	Opportunities to go abroad: There are a lot of study abroad opportunities (eg. Princeton in Bejing, International Internship Program, study abroad) where you can travel at Princeton’s expense. I haven’t done this but have heard great things. 
-	Woody Woo program: really cool and well respected international relations major that’s pretty unique to Princeton


Cons: 

-	Grade deflation: though the policy isn’t still on the books, professors are very slow to change and thus grading curves are super rough in intro classes; remember – everyone in your class was also admitted to Princeton, you’re up against a tough group. (eg. ~30% of students report feeling extremely academically overwhelmed vs. 20% at Harvard, take this as you may)
o	Thus, if you want to go to law/med school it may be better to go to a less highly ranked school where you can get a 4.0 and then get into a top law school (though you should be really set on this path before making it a deciding factor) – people still do get into top places from Princeton but it’s very hard to know how you will stack up here before coming here. You aren’t cut a lot of slack in your GPA for going to Princeton in this process. Also extremely high rigor; you will spend most of your time on class work, high work levels, very few ""easy A"" classes. 
-	Social structure: a lot of friends you make here are through activities (seems like more so than other schools). Most of the close-knit activities are try out based and they’re fairly competitive to make; some people come in and don’t make any activities they did in high school and feel isolated and have trouble finding friends. 
-	Draconian discipline policy: basically any academic offense you make is punished by a 1 year suspension. The standard for proving guilt is a preponderance of evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt. 50+ people are suspended each year for offenses, many from the CS department. This suspension is noted on your transcript.
-	Professors: there are also some shit professors that you cant understand and don’t really care about you, again, probably an issue at every university 
-	Athlete/non-athlete divide: athletes are generally isolated from the rest of campus and are generally perceived as being of higher social status than regular students because most of the teams feed into the more “prestigious” eating clubs. High partying on sports teams. The team becomes basically your core friend group because there isn’t a lot of tine to join other activities, so if you ever drop your sport you’re rebuilding your entire friend network. Unclear whether these problems are unique to Princeton. 
-	Unhelpful support staff: Residential colleges have “Directors of Studies” and “Directors of Student Life” to help you with academic and personal problems as necessary. Many of these people only do lip service to helping you and really don’t want to go out of their way unless you’re a super extreme case, i.e they only pay attention to the extreme cases of their case load. They are basically useless for things like major selection, roommate conflict resolution, etc. You basically have to rely on your peers or parents for advice on stuff. Unclear whether this problem is unique to Princeton. 
-	Res College System: The system isn’t inherently bad, but the university bills it to prospective students as something it isn’t. Our res colleges are much less close-knit than Yale’s and are basically just dorms that host some social events. You’ll meet a lot of people in your res college but it’s a stretch to say there’s a strong sense of community. 
-	Lack of professional programs: No business, finance, accounting, etc majors. Exclusively liberal arts/engineering. Look at the majors before you decide to come.  
-	Pressure for involvement: You will feel like everyone around you is in 10000 activities and you have to be as well to keep up; can lead to a lot of over-commitment and time pressure, lack of sleep, etc
-	Dining halls: pretty meh food, worse than some colleges, better than some others
-	No AC in some dorms. You deal with it but it sucks for a few weeks per year
-	Roommates: can’t pick them freshman year. Means you can get stuck with people you don’t like but most people have a generally positive experience. On the flip side, you can also become friends with them. 
-	Pretension/wealth: Most students are pretty normal, but I also was in lecture with a guy wearing $1000 loafers casually last week. Lots of expensive coats like Monclers, Canada Goose. Some very wealthy students basically only hang out with other very wealthy students, but this isn’t that pervasive and easy to avoid. 

Mixed bag: 

-	Greek life: there’s a freshman rush ban so you can’t join a frat/srat until soph fall. This means getting into these groups is less dependent on your appearance, etc but also means you basically need to know people in the orgs to get in. Greek life doesn’t do a ton and isn’t a huge presence, many are basically just pregame/party groups that feed into certain eating clubs.
-	Eating Clubs: There are 5 “bicker” and 6 “sign in” eating clubs. You may join one starting soph spring. “Bicker” is basically like rush and is slightly different for each club. They accept between 40% and 80% of people who bicker depending on the club. Students who don’t get into one “hosed” often feel really bad and it can be difficult for them to refind their niche soph year. You eat all your meals in the eating clubs if you’re a member and can hang out in their club house, go to all the parties, etc. NOTE: only officers live in the houses. All class years may go to parties at the clubs, the sign in clubs just require showing your school ID, the bicker clubs require a member to give you a pass or put you on their guest list (or both) and this leads to weird and aggressive networking to for these passes/list spots. I.e Eating club parties fill the void left by the fact our frats/srats dont have huge houses/parties. IMO girls are safer at the eating club parties than like a frat party because the clubs are essentially half male/half female so you dont end up with the same gender imbalances sometimes seen at frat/srat parties at other schools. Some people judge people’s social status based on the clubs they party at, but many also don’t care. There’s also a bit of “prestige whoring” in which people try to befriend people at the more highly regarded bicker clubs to get passes and meet enough members to get into one their soph spring. Also, the bicker process can lead to social fracturing if some friends do/don’t get into a club because it is harder to eat meals together (a main form of socializing at Princeton) or people just want to join different clubs. 
-	Party/alcohol culture: There is definitely more partying and alcohol use at Princeton than I expected. Very easy access to alcohol at the sign in eating clubs where you just show your ID on party nights and can get in and get free beer. Also a ton of “pregames” thrown with hard alcohol that you can attend. These are huge methods of socializing and can be really important for meeting people freshman year (though you can still make friends through activities, etc if you don’t go to these pregames/parties). The eating clubs are open to partying Thurs/Fri/Sat nights. No real bar culture or off campus clubs to party in. Alcohol use is pervasive and essentially assumed (some people don’t drink but they are massively in the minority).
-	“Nerd” culture: Everyone at Princeton of course is sort of nerdy because they got in, but we don’t have the pervasive weird/nerd culture that you see at schools like MIT/UChicago/Carnegie Mellon. People here are generally more “normal,” which is a pro for me but some people would definitely not like. You can still find people like this on campus but it’s much harder than at one of the aforementioned schools. 
-	Town: In a very wealthy, quiet, safe town. Excellent for feeling safe on campus, not excellent for doing things near campus. Stores within walking distance are somewhat to very expensive. Kind of quiet/sleepy feel. Women’s haircuts within walking distance of campus are $50+ for even a basic cut so you basically have to go far away (men have better/cheaper barber shops available). 
-	NJ: if you get out of the immediate surroundings of campus, things get very New Jersey. Again, take this as you may. Route 1 makes it hard to walk/bike places more than a couple miles from campus because you basically can’t cross it. #JerseyBarricades 

EDIT: If you're an admitted student you can also use [this site](https://realtalk-princeton.tumblr.com/) to get answers about campus life (or comment here and I'll answer or both) NOTE: don't use it if you have admission ques/financial aid ques, etc that's really NOT what it's for. Also the contributors are kind of self selecting in that they all seem really happy with their Princeton experience so take what you read there with a grain of salt. "

634fv5,5,2017-04-02,Is it worth it to go back to school if I already have a job in the field?,SpiritOfLocalPride,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/634fv5/is_it_worth_it_to_go_back_to_school_if_i_already/,"This past summer at the end of my sophomore year I decided to take a break from school as I wasn't in a very good place mentally and wasn't sure what I actually wanted to do. At the end of the summer, I started an internship doing mostly QA and some android development, and was offered a full time position after a few months that would start at the 6 month mark. The offer has me starting at 50k, with a 10k increase after 6 months, and another 10k increase at the 1 year mark, putting me at 60k in august and 70k next march, providing things go well and my employer isn't outright lying to me. I accepted the offer since I had never really been a fan of school (self teaching has generally gone better for me), and I feel like I've put myself 2 years ahead of where I would have been had a went back to school.

The issue is that over the past few months, I've really started to gain a new love for comp sci that I never had before. I currently have sufficient knowledge to develop fairly simplistic android applications, hence the job offer, and I always thought that just being able to get a job was all I wanted or cared about, but now, all of a sudden, compiler design and more complicated algorithms and computer graphics and all of these things have become so fascinating to me. I feel a new inspiration and passion that I never felt before when I was at school. Now I truly want ""higher education"", which is why I'm considering going back.

My concern is just that it appears to make almost no financial sense. Instead of making nearly 100k and gaining experience over the next 2 years, I would be spending 10s of thousands of dollars to finish my degree. Would having the degree really give me so much of an edge in terms of my employment options and salary that this would balance out? 

Another thing I need to take into consideration is that I'm currently living at home, so I have no expenses whatsoever. I have been saving nearly every cent that I earn, and plan to continue to do so if I continue working - however, the older I get, the less of an option staying at home will be. I can't say for sure that this would be an option for me 2 years from now if I were to go back to school. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. "
634wvt,1,2017-04-03,Need advice about my future life choices now for post college.,gjrut,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/634wvt/need_advice_about_my_future_life_choices_now_for/,"In the interest of keeping this short I will stick to simple facts as much as possible.

25m, living at home doing college online. $0.00 student debt.
I live in the middle of nowhere and the local culture is not to my liking and I crave more social contact of like minded people. ie. I want to move on asap. 


I am very independent and I think I can do fine on my own but not very street smart.


I am thinking of perhaps changing my major, I have now a limited time to do that. bear with me...


My 'plan' is after finishing my BA in computer science, to then move to an ""area of more opportunity"" and start off on my own.


My concern is that CS is a field of constant learning and I see doubt in my future as to whether I can get much more than an internship after graduating. Or if I can do much with my degree at all without further study. 


Like I said before I live in the middle of nowhere and after 15 years it is feeling more and more like a box, and study is mentally hard when you feel like your in a hole.


Now that my final year is approaching I am getting more nervous as to weather or not I can handle CS. If I put my nose to the grindstone and kill myself with work I think I can do it. But I wonder yet.


I have a small inferiority complex and the idea of coming into the teck world as not the smartest cookie, and working with 19-20 year old wiz kids makes my ego hurt. But that is something I have to work on yet.


Should I think of moving sooner to give myself a mental restart.
Or slow down my study and get a some on-hand experience or a internship on the side. Can I expect to get anywhere out of the gate as a CS grad with only light office work as an other related skill?

635cbx,4,2017-04-03,Computer Science @ UMD(Doubt),Kraelern,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/635cbx/computer_science_umddoubt/,"Hey, So I'll be joining UMD this fall and had a few doubts regarding the Copmuter science program. Are there any CS majors that could answer my questions? Anyways, here it goes.

1. Which classes do people generally take in their freshman year for CS(what exactly is the curriculum)?

2. How hard would you say computer science at UMD is on a scale of 1 to 10 (I know this is a really subjective question but just wanted to know how hard YOU would say it is)
3. Does anybody know if there is an average graduating GPA? If so then what is it?
4. How competitive is the program?(Does it have more than a few slackers or is almost everybody insanely good)
5. Would you say that as a whole the program is stressful? And also did you get any time to relax and take part in extracurricular activities and clubs and stuff?
6. Not related to CS but is the area honestly as bad as people say it is? Or is just exaggerated?
7. What are the internships and work on campus opportunities like and are they easily available?
8. Most importantly, would you say you've enjoyed your CS experience so far and further your experience at UMD?

I know some of the questions may come across as vague or downright dumb. But any answers would be a big help so please indulge me!!!"

I am CS student currently going for masters. I've also been intern for last 10 months doing web development.  

Considering I'd want to go looking for new job in couple of months and would prefer to do some devops together with development, what are my options to get some practical experience during next couple of months that could help me get that job? I know some basics but not nearly enough. I am decent with linux and it's internals and have some basic experience with docker but that's it.

I've seen that Linux Academy has some courses but I am not sure that can help me with practical experience.

I have no real IT experience so I started studying for the A+, along the way sending out a Help Desk application here and there just in case someone was willing to take a shot on me before that point. 

I ended up getting a call as a reply to one of these applications. The long and short of the phone call was pretty much I'm extremely underqualified (which I knew) but they liked my overall background and we had some networking items in common so they figured what the hell lets call him just in case. We ended up clicking extremely well during the phone call and they ended up saying they couldn't bring me on to the full time role but they would be willing to create an internship role that would last 90 days then they would make the full time decision.

The company is a managed IT solutions firm in my area. All in all it would be an incredible opportunity for me to learn and I'm extremely confident in my ability to perform well and go full time at the end of the time frame. And worst case scenario I now at least have some experience on my resume. I'll have the first half of my A+ by the interview, but still studying for the second. Besides the standard review of the company website, how else can I prepare for this interview? I want to give myself the best shot possible"

However, as a student who has seen some pretty dishonest/cheating/lying on some stage of the interview process (whether it be the actual interview or lying on your resume), I'd like to open this topic up for discussion.

I wanted to make this thread after I found out about a peer who was offered an internship at a big Seattle company. As you may know, the interview process for this company is quite impersonal and you could probably get away with a lot without getting caught. This person was smart enough to get past the initial round of debugging + logic. On the second round coding questions he told me he just looked up the solutions for both problems (as they are common questions) and passed all test cases in less than half the time limit.

The worst part is the phone interview. He had one of his close friends sit near him during the interview and search solutions during the interview. You're probably like yeah right, that's not possible without the interviewer hearing the other person typing. Well, a few days later he was offered an internship. This kind of sucks because there were people who worked harder and studied more than him who were not offered an internship. Now don't get me wrong, this guy will probably do just fine at the internship - he's not dumb. He just didn't want to risk anything and make sure he secured an offer.

For more in-depth interviews, it's pretty difficult to do this as there are on-site interviews you can't really cheat on. But for cases like this, I can't help but wonder how many people engage in dishonest, cheating, or deceitful practices to get what they want.

I want to ask - what sort of things have you seen? For those candidates that you're suspicious about, when they come to the actual workplace, how do they perform? As actual work isn't really LeetCode-style questions how often do these ""deceitful"" people do well in the work place?

* I like the idea of software and programming, and so do a lot of electrical engineers which end up becoming software developers/engineers anyways.

* I'm generally good with math and science courses.

* I'm interested in working with embedded systems and my favorite programming languages are C and C++, and also Python on the side.

* Electrical engineers can become software developers, but can computer science majors become electrical engineers? No.

* According to a lot of previous posts on this sub and other subs, the consensus is that it's better to major in computer or electrical engineering because those students will be able to understand hardware at a deeper level than computer science majors, and computer science majors won't get into a deep level of hardware. Electrical and computer engineers know hardware and software, while computer science majors usually know just software.

* Is there anything computer science majors can do that electrical engineers can't? Besides academia.

* Assuming I stay in computer science, what do I do if I want to work as an electrical engineer or in embedded systems, do I go back for a second bachelors? Am I screwed if I choose a bachelors in computer science?"

Please help!,PRE_NERF_MYTHOCLAST,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/638upa/accepted_an_internship_offerbut_now_getting/,"So I am currently a junior CS student who landed a summer internship around 3 weeks ago. It is with a small software company that does a lot of web development. I initially accepted their offer as I had no other offers let alone interviews on the table. I should note that it is not a terrible offer, I know I will definitely be learning new ideas and techniques in development but compared to my second offer it does pay lower and I don't get as much teamwork experience or methodology experience (such as Agile). 

A few days later however I got an interview offer with another very large telecom company and after 2 weeks got an offer as well that not only pays better, and is with a much larger company, but will grant me exposure to subject areas such as NoSQL DB's and Agile, areas I have little exposure in. 

My main question is how would I handle rescinding an offer I already accepted? Can I even do that? Also will this make me look very bad if I do and possibly ""marked,"" among other companies. I should note that I didn't hear about this position through a recruiter but rather through campus referrals. I should note I didn't sign any contract aside from the application to apply. I should also note that this is the Atlanta area. Any help is appreciated, thanks!"

I've been programming for a year, basically full time learning/studying the last 9 months. I know Python/Django, SQL, Java, I've used C++, PHP, Bash and JavaScript/html/css. I'm an AWS Certified Developer, Cisco Certified Network Associate, I know Linux pretty well (studying for the RHCSA). One of my main projects is a wireless relay that connects to HVAC wires and is controlled by a Raspberry pi using the MQTT (IoT) protocol. It records current temperatures inside and out, current set temperature, current action and the current setting to a PostgreSQL database. Then this information can be used in an ""Auto"" mode which is a support vector machine that uses the past usage to determine if it should currently be running the AC or Heat. I built a website with Django to interface with it, set up HTTPS, authentication and a way to display live data/controls. I've studied all the common data structures and algorithms (currently going through coding them out because I've run out of things to code). Anyways, after all of this and having a networking background and applying to at least 300 jobs with a professional resume I have not landed a single interview. I'm to the point where I get excitement from a no because at least then I know my resume is getting somewhere besides /dev/null. 

I know I'm really light on experience and this is a super competitive market. I would literally pay to work somewhere just to get experience. Internships all require that you're a current student (should I enroll in some classes at a CC and try this?). I've been going to Meetups, reaching out to people on LinkedIn. Nothing helps. About a month ago I made a resume for help desk positions. I have some experience with VOIP, configuring/troubleshooting networking equipment, obviously basic computer skills. I've applied to 30+ entry level help desk positions and have only heard no. Today a SysAdmin position requesting automation experience and AWS experience popped up, I have automation experience and am AWS certified. I applied, got a call 5 min later from the recruiter and was turned down because I didn't have experience resetting windows passwords. I'm not even joking. I tried to explain how simple that was, they didn't care. I had another recruiter with a position at a law firm to basically set up projectors for power-point turn me down. 

So I'm sitting in the tech capital of the world, with what I know are limited skills, but still some IT skills nonetheless. And I am literally about to apply to WalMart to be a cashier (not that there's anything wrong with that). I feel like there has to be something wrong with me.

Does anyone have any advice as to how I can get my foot in the door, anywhere, doing anything IT related? Ideally programming, but anything at this point. Money isn't an issue, I'd gladly take a programming position for minimum wage just to do what I enjoy (or at least to get some experiencing doing it). I've been doing meetups, side projects, linkdin, github and have a professional resume.

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm about to give up."

I need some advice right now because I'm not having ANY luck with getting an internship. One of the reasons I decided not to graduate in May (this semester) and take part-time coursework is because I planned to be interning somewhere in the summer!

I'm a minority (woman), I have years of research experience at a lab, and the only thing standing between me and an internship at my dream company is my GPA (2.9). I've applied everywhere I can and am primarily using websites such as Indeed and EngineerJobs.com and even LinkedIn by reaching out to familiar faces working at companies I want to be working at. And I haven't heard back from anyone. I've had 1 interview with a pretty big company that I was excited about but it didn't go well so I didn't get the job.

Right now as a LAST resort I'm thinking of just going to Google Maps, typing in Engineering firms, and emailing their manager saying I'm interested in learning more about their company and being an UNPAID intern for them, if they'll have me. 

Has anyone had this much trouble as a senior trying to find an internship? I have experience, I know there is demand... is my GPA the only thing standing in the way? On the applications I fill out, they don't ask for it so I don't understand how they know my GPA.

Any advice?"

63a85j,5,2017-04-03,Graduating with very few prospects and less than stellar GPA,fixmeplz,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/63a85j/graduating_with_very_few_prospects_and_less_than/,"This might be computer science specific but I think there are some general career advice that I could use. Basically, I'm a senior in CS and I'm going to graduate this semester but as it stands, I'm struggling mightily with looking for jobs/opportunities. I want to go into data science/machine learning without much industry specific preference. Several problems though:

* Low GPA. I'm graduating with 2.8 cumulative most likely unless I do really well this semester. This disqualifies me from a lot of listings.
* Lack of internships. I did one my sophomore year as a QA intern. I then had to work tech support to support myself for a few years before moving to my current role as a Udacity project reviewer.
* Lack of references. For whatever reason I never really developed a relationship with my professors and didn't like a lot of them. I can't think of a single one of them who I'd want to approach about references or recommendations.
I was considering trying to get into Grad school and use the year to shore up on skills and refocus myself academically with a clean slate but I'm running into similar obstacles with grad school applications which want 3.0 minimum and 3 letters of recommendation.

I'm guessing I really need to lower my sights but I'm super discouraged and have no one to blame but myself. I've been working really hard this semester and will probably get a ~3.8 GPA but that's not going to make up for 4.5 years of wasted undergrad. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Am I just fucked?"

The problem is that they said it only pays $11 an hour, and I would only work 3 days a week. That is minimum wage in my state and I'm unsure about this. I'm almost done with college and I feel I should get more than they are paying teenagers working in their retail stores. People I have asked give me varied responses: I don't have experience so I should take it, or I should try and get a better job or negotiate a higher wage?

My Career Services at my university said I should try and politely bring up a higher wage (they said $20/hour but that seems a little high). I've never had a non-minimum wage job and would really like that to change this summer.

Any thoughts or opinions on this? It would be very helpful to me."
63ak1m,16,2017-04-03,Pros &amp; Cons: The University of Florida,DwyaneWade305,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/63ak1m/pros_cons_the_university_of_florida/,"So I'll provide some background info on myself. I am a low-income freshman that is in engineering. If you grow up in Florida then you know UF is ""the"" school to be at for your average Floridian. I just want to say that while it is a very good school, you can still have a good experience at most of the other Florida public schools.

**Pros**:
1) RESEARCH. It is comically easy to get involved in research even as a freshman here. I know a girl who asked a professor for research before class started and was setup with a position that pays 10$ an hour (not a lot of course but it's pretty solid for a freshman with no experience). I personally researched a bunch of professors in my field and just asked the one who's research I was interested the most and am now working with said professor.

2) Friendly student body was something I was pleasantly surprised with at UF. The cut-throat environment is non-existent which is weird for a state flagship since it consist of the best students in the state. There are usually a group of students studying for exams (Besides Pre-med y'all are crazy).

3) Job Opportunities. UF attracts major companies during it's job fairs. Many of whom get all there Florida recruits exclusively from UF.  You can expect a ton of emails about potential jobs and our career resource center is stellar in prepping you for internships.

4) Professors. I haven't had a terrible professor yet and most of them are very approachable. As you can tell by the research part of my post, a lot of them love when students come to talk to them about their research and are always helpful.

5) Gym. UF has 2 gyms one being really huge and the other being sufficient. They also have nice intramural leagues.


**Pros/Cons** depending on you

1) Partying is big. UF is a big state school, so of course partying is a huge part of campus life. If thats not you then don't worry it's really easy to avoid. Just make sure you don't get a dorm near Buckman drive.

2) Greek life. It's pretty big and they dominate student government to a T. If it's not for you then it won't effect you but they usually throw really awesome parties.

3) Grading. I think UF grades pretty fairly. The average GPA for an engineering major is a 3.2 which I think is about right. A 3.2 also gets you on the Deans list for engineering. Other majors are pretty harsh (3.75 for students in the business schools for example).


**Cons**

1) Location. Yea it's Gainesville and there's not much to do per se but Gainesville is close to a couple of Springs which are only a 30 minute or so drive and Orlando is pretty close by so it's not like you're trapped. Also Game days are really fun so IMO it makes up for a lack of places to go.

2) Dining Hall food sucks. I guess this is a given at almost every college

3) Some departments are really bad. You really have to do your research to make sure it's not your major. I've heard terrible things about CS professors here.

Im going to get back to studying Calc but LMK if you have any questions in the comments and I'll see if I can address them."

Many of them met recruiters from hackathons or had family connections. I've been trying to talk to recruiters and such at hackathons, but nothing has worked out. Applying to jobs through job websites often require a degree or an enrollment in a degree. Or many years of professional development (Yes, I am looking at junior and internship positions). I have a number of side projects and a previous mediocre internship that was set up by my school. I also have a few academic awards, though I doubt they're any use in this issue. I feel totally at lost on this topic! 

Any tips or advice is appreciated. I have a little time left if I want to squeeze in a summer internship. "

So the kid I talked about in the last post was hired as a personal favor from the CEO's friend. He needed an internship to graduate. So he told me a lot of information that's disturbing to say the least. 

I was told the plan was to keep him for the semester so that he could graduate and then let him go but they decided (despite the problems, he's apparently tried to kill himself before and the CEO knew that and didn't give a shit) to keep him on because of the amount of work he does and from what I gathered (they didn't spell it out) that I think he's working for free. And we plan on bringing him on afterwards and keep him working where his pretty much for eternity because he's efficient  and cheap (I'm assuming minimum wage when he graduates) because he doesn't really understand how money works  (his father handles it) so they're just going to use him because he likes coding until he becomes to much of a liability. His father is even okay with this from what I gathered. 


After being told all this backround information I was told very pointedly (not in these exact words) ""You say shit to HR and we're going to have a problem"".

First of all I'm going to quit. This is fucking disgusting so I'm sending in applications to a lot of places. 

Second of all who do I report this to?

Third, should I report this? It seems the only thing thats keeping the kid alive is working this job because he's at least doing *something*. So maybe it would just be better to let the kid keep doing what he's doing until ..I mean I guess permanently. 

What do I do here?

**See Tl; dr if this is too much detail for you**



**About me**
23. Female. Top 7% of my undergraduate class at a top California research university. My GPA is almost at a 3.8 and this is my last quarter before I graduate and I have confidence I will get it up to a full 3.8. My major is sociology and my minor is East Asian Studies.


**Program going into**
Higher education administration and policy programs, MA only. I see myself working in a community college, ideally with international students or in student affairs.


**Relevant experience**
I have a good amount for my age.

* Girl Scout leader
* Honors research which I am almost done with which is about a university issue and relates to what I would do an MA project on
* Volunteer fundraising for a nonprofit
* Student teaching
* Internship at a nonprofit on Stanford's campus&amp;affiliated with Stanford
* Social work type summer camp with youth with cognitive disabilities
* Tons of advocacy and student government from community college, way too much to list.
* Tons of LGBTQ and women's issues work, way too much to list.
* Won an undergraduate fellowship for my honors research
* Will present at conferences for my research
* Won a handful of undergraduate scholarships 
* Serving in Americorps next year as a literacy interventionist for a nonprofit that aims to close the achievement gap in schools 

**GRE**
I took a practice verbal and got a 165. I will need to study for math, haven't taken geometry since I was sixteen. But I have summer to think about that. Not worrying me right now.

**Schools Applying to**
UT Austin, UW, Stanford's POLS program, Sacramento State, maybe Lewis and Clark. All of the programs vary slightly.


**Letter writer options**
All are professors. All tenured. All have publications.

**Person one:** I definitely want to ask him... he is tenured faculty from my community college. He knows me extremely well and has written letters for me before and nominated me for a departmental award which I won. I took 4 classes with him and did great in all of them. This person inspired me to choose my major and really is just great. Since I spent 3 years at community college, I don't think it's wrong to ask someone from my CC. Especially since I have interest in working at a CC.

**Person two:** Also definitely want to ask this person. Tenured senate faculty at my university. I took a senior seminar with him as a junior and did well. It involved a mini research project so I went to office hours a lot. He is one of my thesis advisors as well.



Here is where I get unsure.


**Person three:** Senate faculty. I took three classes with him and did well in great. Went to office hours a ton. He is super nice to me and remembered my name. Allowed me to add his class late this quarter (I had a good reason) because he knew I would be on top of my shit. He is really nice. However, unlike the rest, I have never done any projects or research with him.


**Person four:** Senate faculty, tons of publications. I took a class with him last year and did fine, but there wasn't much participation so I don't think he knew me that well at that time. So here is the thing, this person is my primary research advisor. The thing is he is not used to advising undergraduates. He pushes me extremely hard. He speaks very harshly when he is critical. One time I was spending too much time on the survey portion of my research and he felt I was falling behind on the paper, and he scolded me really really harshly. I just had no clue. My project is enormous and I am not used to this type of work. I went home and cried because I felt so overwhelmed. Ever since that happened, I feel unsure if he will write me a fantastic letter. I have since recovered and seen him and it went better. He is East Asian; maybe that is why he is so hard on me, because you know there is some truth behind East Asian culture valuing academic achievement more. My other advisor (person two) is just super proud of all my work and progress, this guy (person four) is just tough. He is tough. 



I am extremely grateful for his time and I am really learning a ton. He is very dedicated to my work. He is just really really tough.


**Tl;dr So is it better to ask for a letter from a total hardass who knows me from doing research but is harsh and sets really high standards for me, or from a professor who is extremely nice to me and I have taken three classes with (and done well in all of them and gone to office hours and whatnot)? Keep in mind this is not PhD, it's coursework MA programs that usually have a project component**

How can I go about figuring out who will write a stronger letter between now and when I graduate in 11 weeks?

63c09k,675,2017-04-04,Your Ticket Will Self-Destruct In 5... 4... 3... (and take your test environment with it),molotok_c_518,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/63c09k/your_ticket_will_selfdestruct_in_5_4_3_and_take/,"**Setting**: After ~~way too long~~ several years of not knowing what I wanted to do with my life, a coworker at the crappy convenience store where I worked got me into computers... which led to my first PC certification... which then led me to going back to college for my associates'... which led me to an internship with a world-wide, web-based, IT-centric software suite (which I shall call $ITSoft) developer in their QA department. I got the job because, when asked how I would test a vending machine, I rambled on for 5 full minutes running from amount inserted, to whether the money was inserted, to whether it was American currency, to whether someone had tampered with the machine... I really couldn't shut up until the interviewer said, ""Okay, we get it, you start Monday.""

I was good at it. I took the approach that users are insane, so I dug into things that no one else would try. As a result, I found bugs no one had known were there: timesheet approvals that allowed an employee to enter time after he had submitted his time, but locked his supervisor out of his own timesheet; project phases that became ""orphaned"" when an intermediate phase was removed; time-zone formatting that would make a ticket disappear until the next day... the developers were starting to hate me.

My favorite, though, was when we were specifically asked by a client to allow HTML and Javascript in ticket comments. See, he needed to see specific errors in the code, so he wanted his clients to post code snippets.

That led to myself and my two QA intern colleagues to putting code everywhere in $ITSoft... only, they weren't programmers.

I am.

After some quick Google-fu, I conjured up a nasty little snippet that would put a button in the midst of anything entered as text: notes, tickets, project notes... I had them **everywhere**.

What's worse, they could run a tricky little Javascript bit that, when the button (labelled ""CLICK HERE"") was clicked, a small countdown would run, then the entire window would close... not just what you were looking at, but your whole browser. Which meant you needed to log back into $ITSoft from scratch.

One of my coworkers asked if I could get it to run without the button. ""Sure,"" I said, and made it so when you opened a place where it had been entered, that ticket/note/etc. would disappear.

Each of these bugs was duly noted, and a ticket submitted.

The trouble was, $ITSoft was using its own suite to submit tickets against its own software.

And I put the code for my ""close window"" in the ticket's notes section.

And the bugs were already *in the production code*.

A week after I submitted the tickets, I got an IM from the QA lead:

&gt;QAL: Hey, *molotok*, you're doing a fantastic job, but you need to resubmit tickets *series of numbers*.

&gt;Me: Did I format them improperly?

&gt;QAL: In a way... see, no one can open them, so no one knows what they are.

&gt;Me: No one ca... oh... oh, *expletive*, I didn't even think about that! I'll redo them without any... er... surprises.

&gt;QAL: Cool. Maybe just the button... no window closing.

(He had a sense of mischief. Very fun to work for.)

&gt;Me: Okay.

About 2 weeks later, they got the textbox terrorism sorted out, and all of the code I had planted everywhere actually became visible again. I was kind of sad, but it was fun while it lasted.

""Coincidentally,"" the QA manager (different guy) decided that they needed to blow up the test environment and start all over from scratch shortly afterwards. Something about the database entries was making the whole thing unstable... imagine that.

Sadly, I wasn't picked up permanently by $ITSoft, as they didn't have any open positions when my internship expired. It was great place to work, I had an absolute blast, and I leaned that you can be **too** good at your job."

I got waitlisted at Santa Cruz, and I didn't apply to Riverside.

I also got waitlisted at SDSU, so I'm not sure of the status of that. 

Right now, I have CSU San Marcos and UC Merced as my only acceptances, but I feel like if these remain my only options I would go to community college and try to transfer instead.However, I am worried that I might not do well enough in community college to transfer to a good school.

So, I currently have the following questions:

1. How is computer science at UCSC/SDSU? I heard mixed reviews as far as undergrad goes, and I know that UC's are more theory-based in comparison to SDSU. Would it be worth going to either of those schools if I wish to stay in California?

2. Pros/Cons of SDSU/ UCSC /CC?

3. What would I have to do in order to transfer from community college if I would like to transfer to UCLA, UCSD, UCB, or a private school? Is it only GPA based, or will I have to have internships and EC's (like in high school)

4. Will transferring from community college leave me unprepared for the rigor of UC's? I worry about not being able to keep up, especially in such a competitive major. Right now, I go to a fairly competitive school, and already I have some trouble keeping up, so I'm extremely worried about this.

I've been lurking in this reddit for a while now and this community seems very helpful and kind, so I thought I would try asking here. Thank you so much!"

Maybe I just need to rant, but lately I've been extremely critical of myself and I cant bring myself to open up to my real life friends. 

Let me take a step back and just explain who I was, not who I am right now. 

4 years ago, after graduating high school, I was just a normal college freshman with a serving job trying to find something i was interested in. At that time I believed it was computer science and I decided to give ""information technology"" a try. 

Luckily, midway into the year, I landed a great internship at a well known accounting firm that I won't disclose as a junior auditor and long story short ... i hated it. I couldnt see myself in that field and be content. So I ended up cutting the internship short and dropped out of my remaining classes because.. it just wasn't what I wanted to do. 

Growing up with asian parents, I couldn't bare to tell them I dropped out. So my next goal was to find another job. 

That job was where I really found myself. And it was an inside sales job. Truthfully, Initally I had no confidence in myself, I was that new guy who would mingle with top agents on the floor and I would ask them ""how they do it, like how do you close a sale"". Because at that time, I just wanted to make money. I felt like I failed and i needed to redeem myself, and prove to myself that I wasn't worthless .. as depressing as that might sound. 

That training month i set 18 demos with 7 of them closing within that month. And just like that, I found out I had a knack for phone sales.. And funny enough, my training manager told me that the training leads were ""burned out leads"" or people who've been called repeatedly for years. Also known as ""D+ prospects"".

After that month ended I was 1st in the office for sales, but 2nd nationally and I never felt more happier in my life. It felt like I've found something for me. Something I could improve on and call my craft. I was hooked. My first commission check ended up being roughly around $5000 and it felt like I struck gold.

Naturally I landed in the top sales team on the floor rather then joining my friends at the ""accelerator bay"" or simply put the new hire team. Ironically thats when I found myself too complacent and completely chocked. I was scared that I was going to get fired. I called relentlessly 300+ calls monday through saturday and eventually. I found a client.

She was a elderly massage therapist who expressed that, if our producted failed, her business would fail. 

That was the hardest call I had ever taken. And the only time I cried after a phone call. One part of me is relieved that I still have a job, but another part couldn't forgive myself for what I did.

I tried to shrug it off, ""it was either her or me"" i told myself, but as days passed it was hard for me to look in the mirror. I was angry at myself that I couldn't truly help her. But sold her a product that was her last chance.

After that week I wanted a career in sales, not a job and found a private wealth management firm barging in with my sales performance records to get a chance with an interview.

And after 5 interviews I landed an associate finacial advisor career with a condition. I would open accounts for my senior advisor and he would get the firm to sponsor my securities licenses (series 7, 63) I eventually got licensed after months and months of practice exams and studying. 

Out of the 10 associates, only 5 of us passed the licsening exams. 

Once we all took our exams we had to go through what was called ""the pit"" and were required to bring in $60,000 assets under management within one quarter.

And I was the only one left. Everyone else got let go. That year ended up being my most lucrative year, but i was always on edge. I thought that, If I got fired, it was the end for me. I didn't have a college degree so I couldn't just find another job. Although it was full commission, it was the best I could get. 

I started working 2 hours earlier, and leaving 2 hours later then everyone. Working 7-9 when everyone was working a 9-5. I would throw in 3 out of 4 saturdays too. I would find myself sleeping in my office more then my actual house.

I was a workaholic. And my senior advisor told me as a friend, I needed to work in a environment that wasnt full commission. For my own sake and health. He recommended me to an investment company and I would help clients with existing accounts.

But then I got greedy. Although I had my licenses, I was underpaid due to not having a degree, and ultimately I left due too that.

 I told myself I would go back to school and get a B.A at finance to take a stab at goldman sachs not for the money, but to prove to myself that I wasnt just a ""pretend advisor"" or someone who was just good at talking about the market. I want to create the markets.

But right now, my self esteem is at an all time low, and I don't know if I can follow through.

It feels as if I failed. i went from making 5 -7 grand in commission checks to barely making 300 a week. I feel pretty worthless now, regrets won't stop and I just think and think, I've lost 15 pounds in a month, and ive been forcing myself just to get a meal in for the day.

Who i am right now, feels like a shadow to my former self. I feel like I failed. And honestly I don't know if im depressed or not, or rather, I don't want to accept that I might be depressed..

Unlike before, I have a blueprint of what I want my path to be, but right now I feel like I lost my ambition that I had in the past. And deep down I don't know if the current me can actually do it.

I don't see myself taking my own life, but at this moment, my life seems regretful. Im just restless and ""what ifs"" are just clouding my head. It sucks and I dont know how to stop myself from thinking about the ""what ifs""."

Our cubicles were arranged down what used to be a hallway, and my cubicle was 2 rows down from the other 3 helpdesk employees (with two network guys between us), so this required me to speak very loudly or almost yell to communicate with them.

They had asked me to call the tech support line for the manufacturer of the toughbooks we had just received to place in some police cruisers and work with them on troubleshooting an issue we were encountering. I was still fairly new to everything, and I didn't actually know the external number for our offices. 

The phone call:

**Me:** ""This is blah blah with such and such government, we're having this issue.""

**Support guy:** ""Okay. What is the contact phone number?""

**Me:** ........... ""Hold on.""

**Me *yelling down our row of cubicles, easily heard by the tech support guy on the other end*:** ""HEY, what's the number to our offices?""

I have been in software engineering for 3-4 years. 2 intern experiences with Google and some startups. Apart from that, I have been working for PayPal for ~1 year.

I have been doing a lot of thinking. I find working for other people stressing and non-satisfying. I want to work on different techs all the time, always feel like roping in cool tools. This is only possible if I develop my own SAAS because at job, things are always ""legacy"" and ""change"" is always resisted. Apart from that, I have been living away from my home for 7 years now. I have facing some health issues lately and want to work out of my home, setup a cool lab. 

I don't have business ideas right now, for starters I only want to make living and then turn things into passive income.

Any pros/cons/motivation/experiences would be appreciated.

Thanks !"

Thinking about picking up one or two professional certs when I finish up in my current job (for example, I've got a bunch of Udemy training materials for Java so I've been thinking I could try for the Oracle Java SE associate cert afterwards).

Are there any other such certifications you'd particularly recommend, and if so, why? 

I'd be doing this as a precursor to going into a Masters with the idea they might help me get an internship thereafter.

Thanks in advance!"

I'll start with why it's an absolute. I am junior IS Security major in a program where an internship is a *requirement* to graduate, which means I need one this summer if I want to graduate on time. I'm lucky to have amazing parents that will pay for my 4 years at school, but after 4 years it's on me so I'd really like to graduate on time. I go to a pretty large state school with a decent CS/IS program, it's not the greatest, but certainly not the worst.

I have been applying and interviewing like crazy for the past school year, with little luck. I have had about 50-60 phone interviews, followed by about 12 or so on-site interviews which makes me think that my resume is not the issue. I did get offered a position, but it is only part time and not long enough to satisfy the requirement. My GPA is very average which I am not proud of, but I still have gotten a lot of interviews after companies have already known my GPA which also leads me to believe that my GPA is not the issue.

With all that being said, I have a phone interview coming up on Monday. I have already done a video submission for them, and now am onto the phone interview which means I made it through the first step. Unfortunately, I think that this position is just about my last shot at getting an internship for the summer and fulfilling my requirement to graduate. It is also in my dream city that I would absolutely love to work in, so I really want it.

What can I do during this phone follow up to make myself stand out? I have done so many before so I am not nervous, and I really don't know what I am doing wrong to not get any offers. Is there anything I can say or mention that will help me get this position/next interview? Any general advice on what I'm doing wrong or tips for acing these next interviews?

Thanks all.


TL;DR: Need an internship to graduate, can't make it through final steps to get offer."

I get that it's really dependent on the company if they are going to give me time off as an intern, but should I just tell the truth that I'm going to a career fair?

Only 8 students get in and I have never wanted anything more in my life. I've been studying data science fundamentals through bigdatauniversity and dataquest. 

The VP of Technology at my university is generously offering to be a reference and now I have two other references but I can only use one:
1. My CS Java professor for the past year
2. My past manager for 4 years

My CS professor has known me for a year and have built rapport with each other. He hosts meetups and I have been able to bring people to his events and he has also helped my college club with our events. He has seen me code from zero to now so he understands my work as a student. I haven't gotten less than an A in any of his assignments or classes.

My manager has known me for 4 years and knows my work ethic. The reason I am considering him is because he also knows my ambitions and that I want to be a data scientist. He has supported me through my crazy school schedules and when I quit his company, he did not want me to go. In fact, I am now in conversations to go back to my old position under his management as a part-timer. He let me know he will give me any schedule I need, even if I need to leave for an internship.

I am not sure who I should include as a reference or if I should sneak all three of them into my resume even though in the form I am only asked for two.

I've previously interned there last year in my junior year of college, the interview went well and got hired on the spot and everything. That was only up until summer though, so here I am trying to apply to intern again for this summer.

I had the interview 4 weeks ago as they called me back as soon as I said I was interested and everything went really well, even got recommendations from the superintendent that I worked with last time. The interviewer said to email or call him back in 2 weeks to check the status and so I did, but I still have not gotten a response back. Another week later I called once and left a voicemail since he didn't answer and I still didn't get a call back from that either.

What should I do? I really want a summer internship again but I'm not sure if I should try to apply somewhere else if I haven't heard back yet. I have read online that if they do not respond then I should just move on, but then again they didn't officially reject me at the same time. I can't think of any reason why he would say no, as it felt like he was really interested in getting me on board. 

Should I try to email the HR person (he is not the person that interviewed me) about the status instead of the interviewer since he never failed to reply to my emails? What would I say? I feel like this would be my final attempt. 

Should I just patiently wait and apply to other internships at the same time?

I'm frustrated and I don't know if the interviewer did not see my email/call, or maybe they found an intern already. I need to know ASAP if I landed the internship or not so that I can apply for more if needed.



TL;DR:
Trying to intern a 2nd time at same company, interview went great got told to reach out to them in 2 weeks, I did and no response yet. Frustrated. Bother them again or move on, and why?

Right now, I'm trying to decide what language to 'specialize' in. I'll be moving to the bay area in two or three months (not just to build a career in CS) and I'd like to eventually become a (big) data engineer. I should add that I haven't done an internship yet.


From what I gather, Java is much more widely used in the field than Scala, so there will be more entry level jobs that would prefer it. But, very few people are proficient in Scala, leading to maybe a better supply/demand ratio for Scala jobs. My last thought is that companies may not be expecting fresh grads to know Scala, so their entry level positions might all involve using Java. 

Any thoughts on what would be the more strategic route to go down, to better ensure finding a decent paying job in the bay area? Is there a route I haven't thought of yet? Thanks for all of your advice!"

63lxul,2,2017-04-05,Internship while studying,redzin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/63lxul/internship_while_studying/,"I have an opportunity to apply for an internship at a very attractive company in my area. They just started a project to develop a machine learning platform to handle large datasets, and the project leader is a top industry veteran with leading positions at several top companies to his resumé (including two of the ""Big 4""). Machine learning is my primary interest, and they are actively searching for interns (for this project and others). Joining this project seems like a golden opportunity - not many companies have data on the scale that this company does without already having a machine learning platform (at least not in my geographical area).

However, the internship is listed as 25-37 hours a week for up to 5 months. The issue is that I am a full-time student (in grad-school). I can tune down my study activities somewhat, but I am still worried about getting stressed or quite simply getting overworked and be unable to keep up with both.

So my question is, does anyone have experience doing internships while studying? Would you recommed it? What is the workload really like, and is it feasible to do it while studying without getting stressed out?"

Should you try?",SuperSaiyanSandwich,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/63lyre/im_really_bad_at_programming_but_my_boss/,"I've been professionally programming for 3 years now at 3 different jobs(1 internship and 2 full time) and I've felt terrible at it the entire time. I've never felt drawn to programming or excited by it. In college I was a failed Computer Engineering student who knew how to make functional code and swtiched to CS as a cop out(I got very good CS grades but all of the grading was simple pass/fail functionality tests). 

I can make practically any functional component thrown at me, but it's always in really poor design(bad OOP, inefficient methods, etc). My internship focused on Java and Javascript, my first job on Python and C++, and now my second job on Android and React.js. I have no problem picking up new languages but without the ""love"" for programming I never spend my free time(or even all of my work time) learning the proper way to do things. This leads to horribly inefficient code that I dread working on. 

(An example, I recently had to make an offline mode for an android app that required server calls at every step. Instead of making things serializable, I simply manually converted the state into and out of JSON. It's very hacky and bad.)

I keep waiting for someone to call me out and just fire me already, but it never happens. Instead about every year to year and a half I can't take it anymore and switch jobs hoping this will be the fresh start I need. I desperately miss being good at my job(construction, pizza delivery, python tutor for intro classes) as they were all easy as shit and just required me to show up and work hard. I constantly think about quitting to become a high school teacher or cop but the pay cut would be so severe I'd potentially lose my house. 

I realize this has essentially been a gigantic rant and less of question, so to get to the point, is this just typical impostor syndrome or am I simply not passionate enouogh about programming to make this a career? Would it help if I tried to find a specific niche in programming and stuck to it(web dev, industry java, etc)?"

1. How hard would you say IST at Penn State is on a scale of 1 to 10

2. Does anybody know if there is an average graduating GPA for IST? If so, what is it? (estimate is fine) 

3. How competitive is the program?(Does it have more than a few slackers or is almost everybody insanely good)
 
4. Would you say that as a whole the program is stressful? And also did you get any time to relax and take part in extracurricular activities and clubs and stuff? 

5. What are the internships and work on campus opportunities like and are they easily available? 

6. Most importantly, would you say you've enjoyed your IST experience so far and further your experience at Penn State?"

However, others don't agree with that. they told it would only get me a help desk job. Some told me to get my NETWORK+ and Security+. So, as you can see, I have so many suggestions, opinions and I am still feel lost. I would like to avoid help desk positions because of the pay. I cannot imagine quitting my $17/hr job, free insurance, dental etc, for a help desk that's going to pay me $12, $13/hr (probably with no benefits). Someone told me that my degree==to experience. Is this true? So,
1. How can I get an entry level IT job that at least is going to pay me 20/hr. and what are these jobs(titles)?
2. Should I skip A+? meaning skipping the test not the material.
3. Can anyone ,who was in same position I am right now, can share your experience getting a well paying job and how you did it?

In November, I was pulled over for an expired tag and given a citation for not being able to pull up my insurance (I actually have never not had insurance, I just couldn't find it right then). I am a student and happened to be working and going to school in locations both on the bus line, so I chose to do that in the meantime because my car was acting up. I could not attend my court date in December as my university was in winter break (with my parents out of state) and after calling, the person from the court told me I needed to come in before a date in the end of January.

My car eventually gave up on me and wouldn't start in December (the next month) and I purchased a new one early January. At the DMV, I was told I would have to pay some fines (which I legitimately believed were the fines from the ticket/tag) and I did before registering my new vehicle. I know this was silly, but I've never gotten a ticket or even been pulled over before so I thought I was done with that.

Fast forward to last night, I found my citation and decided to look it up. I discovered that I still have a fine for no insurance and a class C misdemeanor for failure to appear given late January. I frantically called the court this morning and gave them a tdlr, the lady on the other line seemed to be unphased and told me it could all be fixed and to come in this Friday morning with proof of insurance. 

Do I need a lawyer? Will I be able to explain myself (no, not give excuses) and get it expunged before a background check in August for an internship that I was accepted to? I'm willing to pay everything on Friday; I just don't know what to say other than what I've posted here. I also have proof of insurance for my previous and present car that I will be bringing. 

Thank you for reading this far.

UPDATE: I'm sorry for not replying but I did read all the comments. I was put in touch with a traffic lawyer that one of my professors knows personally. After describing my situation over the phone, he told me he didn't think his help was necessary as they will most likely remove the warrant and just have me pay a fine after verifying my insurance. 

I discussed the phone call with my parents (who would have had to help me with his fees) and they really wanted me to do as the court clerk told me. I was extremely anxious and nervous about it, but this morning I went in to the court house/police station. 

First, they directed me to the police station desk where they pulled the information about my citation. When he first saw me, the police officer said something about how he thought I was here to pick someone up (I guess because I'm young woman?) but on the way back to the courthouse explained that he had pulled my FTA and warrant (I'm guessing this won't show on my record?) and that as long as I had my proof of insurance that I most likely would not even have to appear in front of the judge.

With the officer, the clerk checked my insurance and approved that it was valid at the time I was pulled over and I was sent back to the police station to pay a $70 fine. The next part was confusing but after asking him about it, the police officer explained that if I wanted to seal my record I could come back in 45 days, fill out a form and pay a fee to do so. 

So I guess I no longer have the misdemeanor? I'm going to check back in a week for clarification on this, as I either need to tell the company I'm going to have a background check in August for my internship or get it sealed. 

Anyway, thanks for the advice!"

I was accepted to 7 schools, but the two I am giving serious consideration are UAlabama and Carnegie Mellon. I was pretty set on going to CMU until earlier today, I even told my friends that I was almost certainly going there. I was preparing to put my deposit down in a few days. However, I did like UAlabama when I visited, and the financial aid they offered me was appealing, but it lacked something. I was accepted into a program called the International German Student Exchange Program, which is a selective program that would allow me to learn German and to then intern at a German automobile manufacturer, in Germany, for a semester. As a computer science major, this means I would probably get to learn about self-driving cars and such, and it sounds really cool to me. The letter I received after being accepted says that after going through this program, I would be more competent with automotive engineering than Stanford or MIT graduates. I doubt whether that's 100% true, especially given that I'm a CS major, but it gives you some idea of what kind of experience I would get out of this program.

CMU, on the other hand, offered me just enough financial aid that my parents could afford to pay it for the next 4 years. It has been my top choice for a while now, and I think there are a lot of opportunities that would be available to me at CMU that I just couldn't find in Alabama. I should mention that I applied as a Math major at CMU, because frankly I knew I wouldn't be accepted to the School of Computer Science. There is a specialization within the math department that would allow me to take most of the classes required for a minor in CS, though, and the math department still sends a lot of people to top tech companies. CS and Math are equally interesting subjects to me, so that aspect of things doesn't bother me. 

I feel kind of like I'm rambling here, so I'll just get to the point. I like both programs a lot, but for different reasons. CMU would be better, I think, for my job prospects upon graduation, and I like the school itself a little bit more than I did UAlabama. I think I would fit in better there as well, and that I would probably enjoy the rigor of the classes. It is also closer to home, and many of my friends and even one of my siblings would be attending colleges nearby. Alabama is *significantly* cheaper, to the point that attending UAlabama for 4 years would cost less than going to CMU for one year. I did like the campus at UAlabama, just not as much as CMU. The IGSE Program is also appealing to me. I like to travel, and I think I would have more opportunities to do that at Alabama, where I would be in Germany for a semester and possibly study abroad on other occasions. I can go into more depth about anything I've said if it would help. Thanks in advance for any advice, I appreciate it a lot :)"

I require 3 internships. 

I've kept looking for one (I can't drive so the places I've been allowed to apply to is limited) but have been unsuccessful and the person they assigned to assist me has no idea what's going on because she's not tech so she has no idea what she's looking for but she's been trying.

So I have a meeting with her, the co-op director of the school, another guy whose basically a case manager from Social Security, and my dad. From what my dad said (he set up the meeting) they're trying to transfer me from computer science and engineering (which I only have like 2 semesters level not including the internships) to Computer Science (no internships required but an extra 2 years at least and I've been here much longer than I should already cause I had to go to community college that didn't transfer first because money) because they don't think I can find an internship. 

Does anyone have any ideas on what I should do here? My GPA is shit but I have enough personal projects I feel like I could theoretically find an internship. 

The only interview I had was for a manufacturing company that wanted me to report on up time/downtime/other stuff on machines and employees, store it in a DB, and display it in some simple way they could bring up in any meetings. (and I was ready to accept it and I thought I had the job) but they told the person working with me ""no"".

My University Co-op program doesn't start for me until the end of my junior year, so I'm not sure what to do this summer. Last summer I worked in the IT department at my University as a summer job but I feel I should get some experience more closely-related to my degree this summer.

Today was my Spring Career Fair and it didn't seem to go as expected. There weren't many companies hiring related to my degree, and those that did were offering internships that applied mainly to 3rd years (meaning most of the internships offered were for RF Engineering, programming, signals, amplifiers, automotive, and other stuff I haven't taken courses for yet), so I'm kinda unsure what to do at this point. 

Any advice?

Two years have passed and looking back I made a ton of mistakes and now thinking that I'm getting older the stress is starting to eat at me and I don't know what to do. I'm a 25/M.

In the past 2 years, I was able to get only 1 interview at a boutique investment bank and was rejected because I didn't have ""investment banking experience"". I was an idiot in university and didn't look into doing internships and such and my program required me to attend school during the summer so I wouldn't have been able to do one anyway. I studied as much as I could about investment banking and I do my own valuations that I use to apply to interviews with but I never get any response. Now I'm working a pretty good paying job, but I hate it, it's not what I want to do and I feel trapped. 

About a year and a half ago I stupidly got married to a girl I dated only for 6 months. The day I planned to break up with her I was fired from a job and I didn't know what to do. She convinced me to get married to her and I've regretted it ever since. 

Due to the stress or just life in general, I've just been sitting around after I get home from work. She wants us to make love but I completely lost my interest in sex; I just want to get my situation figured out. Now she's starting to talk about children; something I really don't want to do. We had a discussion about it and she threatened to divorce me and get me to pay alimony to her though she makes way more money than me. She forced me to commit fraud for her and I'm scared something will happen if I try and push for a divorce.

I'm scared. I feel trapped, and I just want to run away but I'm scared that I won't be able to find a job as good as the one I currently have. "

What are my possible next steps if I want to stay in Europe (or relocate to USA)?

I have been a fairly good student back in Russia, with almost all the highest grades through my Bachelor's studies (in CS). During my first year of Master's studies, I have had a part-time software developer job in computer vision R&amp;D company, which is quite rare for non-capital Russian city, as the tech jobs for students are scarce.
But my dream was to relocate to Europe or USA, where the tech industry seems to be blooming. So I decided to take part in a double-degree program with a Finnish university, and use this year to familiarize myself with the European job market. During that year, I also had an Outreachy internship (kind of GSoC-like program - you get paid for contributing to open-source).

But now I am in about 2 months from graduation date and have to decide what should I do next if I am to pursue my dream of seeing the world. Most of the new grad jobs I see at job boards are for USA or UK and require the right to work there. Many of them also require web-development skills, which I don't have (but I can learn, of course).

I do understand that this is quite a lot of trouble for a company to hire a foreigner, and for the new grad they won't probably do that. So I assume my options are as follows:
1) Try to get into one of Big-4 - I suppose it will be easier for them to help with relocation.
2) Get a low-profile job (like QA/testing job) in Finland, work towards Blue Card or citizenship and then try to relocate.
3) Get back to Russia and try to gain more work experience before attempting to relocate.

Anyone there has a similar experience and/or can offer an advice? How do recruiters view people from outside of EU/US? Which countries have a more welcoming policy on that? How usual is it to get help with relocation/visa sponsorship for not very experienced candidates?"

He wants me to decide by Friday. He didn't do any salary offers, just the position but I expect the salary to be between $35k and $40k. In the other hand I accepted an offer 3 weeks ago for an internship at Honeywell with a really and I quote ""high possibility"" of staying as a full time employee. 

As an intern right now I'm getting paid $10 per hour, Honeywell will pay me $17 per hour. So in terms of salary as an intern or regular employee I will go with Honeywell. I live 10 minutes away from Honeywell and 1 hour and 20 minutes away from where I'm doing the internship right now. To be honest I don't love the workplace in the place I'm working right now but I can't compare since I don't have own experience working at Honeywell. 

I'll love to go to Honeywell and do my best to get a job there but if I don't get it I will end with nothing. 

Should I take the offer as a full time Developer or Should I take the risk and go to Honeywell to do another internship? 

I will be graduating next semester."

I had worked at the full time job for a year and a half, but was doing poorly and was going to be put on a PIP. At the same time, my direct boss was borderline harassing me (making sexual comments all the time, one time about me specifically). I reported him to HR when I gave my two weeks notice. My manager supported me (or so he says), and I was allowed to finish my two weeks.

I regret reporting him because it wasn't horrible harassment or anything, and now I'm worried I'm ineligible for rehire. Which means if someone in my state (Massachusetts) asks that question and my former company says no, I'm done. I tell employers I left for personal reasons, which I guess is true. Is this a white lie? Should I continue to do this? I'm worried I'm ineligible for rehire due to my poor performance and due to reporting my boss.

What should I do in this situation? Should I contact the HR department of my old company and ask them if they give out this information when they get reference checks? I asked my old manager for a reference (he told me when I left he would give me a reference), and he said the following:

""Unfortunately, the company has made it a policy that managers cannot give personal recommendations.  They want all such reference checks to be handled through HR.""

I admittedly fucked up this job badly. I don't deserve a good reference. My boss was not professional, and had done things like ask me for drugs and made comments about people wanting to check me out. He also protected me when I fell asleep at work due to risperdal I was taking that left me exhausted. And a few times when I was loopy because I took too many ativans when I was anxious. So I was a bitch, and I regret that. He was an idiot and did bad things, but also did good things. So I'm conflicted about the whole situation.

Should I leave this job off my resume? That would make it seem like I haven't worked since May of 2015, which seems awful to me. But I'm paranoid of what happens if this job comes up on my background check."

I've gotten A+'s in the programming courses and they  seem relatively easy and entertaining to me. I'm currently looking for a summer job related to CS. I know that most places won't hire people who've been in a CS program for only 8 months as paid employees so in the worst case I'll just work for a minimum wage in a retail store during the summer.

So:

I submitted my resume on an ad saying ""looking for applicants for a competitive internship"". Someone replied to my application and we set a time for a phone interview. On the phone he asked me a lot of questions, some related to programming but most related to what I had on my resume. He said it was going to a be competitive internship and not apt for everyone, but that I was going to learn a lot about software development and this experience would look really good on my resume and help getting an actual job in the field. At the end he said I was a strong candidate and I could continue forward to their ""trial"" period. I think I would be apt for it as the questions seemed easy, it was all concepts I already know. Today I got a follow up e-mail and the title would be ""Mobile Developer trainee"". It's unpaid and I would have to be there minimum 3 days a week.

The other option would be getting some basic ""Help Desk"" or ""Junior IT technician"" job. This would probably pay between $13-$18 which is decent (and I need the money) but I don't think it would look as good on my resume as a dev internship. I've had a fair amount of experience as ""help desk"" in my family, friends of my family, etc. I can fix most/all of the software and hardware issues that appear on their personal computers with ease but I don't know how challenging it would be to actually work as a help desk in an office environment, getting dozens of problems per day.

What would be the best option for me? Also I'm not sure if my resume is even good enough to get an actual job. I've applied to at least 10 places but so far the only reply I've gotten has been the unpaid internship one."

Here is where I stand right now...


Berkeley:


**PROS**


* Great location, I was raised in Silicon Valley, and I am heavily interested in entrepreneurship; I would love to make it back to Silicon Valley for my future career, but I might enjoy the East Coast better, so who knows...

* UCB EECS education is top-of-the-line, reputation is great 

* Many friends go to Cal

* Lots of fun things to do, would feel comfortable with the people here


**CONS**


* Apparently, there is a grade-centric/cutthroat culture surrounding the school; its meme page on Facebook is kind of depressing as well haha

* Visited, didn't like the campus
 
* Public school, so I would constantly be fighting for resources. (I definitely don't need people to hold my hand, as my high school is pretty darn competitive, but I don't want to miss out on opportunities just cuz I was minutes late signing up for something.)

* I didn't have the greatest time during high school, and Cal contains plenty of reminders of my high school life (a few people, atmosphere, etc.)


Cornell:


**PROS**


* More convenient access to university's resources and professors (as opposed to fighting for them)

* More freedom to explore majors

* Would definitely meet lots of new people, build a network of friends on East Coast

* CS program is also top-of-the-line (the slight difference in ranking between Cal computer science vs Cornell computer science doesn't matter to me)

* Beautiful campus 

* Ivy name

* Amazing entrepreneurship program, lots of funding goes here

* Farther away from home (but without the Silicon Valley benefits)


**CONS**


* My biggest one would have to be location. Ithaca is pretty isolated, and I feel like I would be missing out on Silicon Valley's startup scene. 

* My second biggest is the grade deflation, although accounts of grade deflation are varied. Anyone know about deflation in the College of Engineering and the CS major, specifically? Although starting a company is my dream, I feel like having a mediocre GPA would harm my chances at a great graduate school and internships, which would help me gain knowledge and experience. I don't necessarily NEED to create a startup in college, but I also don't want to be studying 24/7. (To this point, I also realize that most people don't create companies for the sake of creating companies. I'm passionate about CS and helping others, and want to make a difference. If you believe my perspective is flawed and I'm looking for the wrong things in my college experience, feel free to correct me.)

* Apparently, the culture here is also pretty competitive due to the bell-curve grading. Can anyone comment on the severity of it or if it's just plain false? 

* Cold weather, but I feel like I can handle this.

* Much more expensive, but cost isn't that big of a factor

Through college my father encouraged me to make my college experience about my grades(at the great ire of my mother, who thought he babied me as his only daughter), and encouraged me to put work on the back burner. 
So, I didn't work, I focused on my grades, and studied really hard.
Instead, I did household chores, and occasionally babysat if I wanted money to do something. 

My dad made it very clear he wanted me to get good grades, that he'd support me in this endeavor by making sure I didn't have to bust my ass at a job, go to school, and worry about bills like he had to as a colleg kid. Hes 100% sure this is why he never finished his degree.
There's also added incentive because my community college is in close contact with a prestigious local university, and I have the option to transfer after getting my associate's degree where I'd come in as a junior and work to get my bachelors degree.

My cumulative GPA is reasonably high, 3.3+(I floundered on some math courses, and learned the golden ""it's not the class, it's the professor"" rule very harshly), but I have zero work experience except for one job where I stayed a year and was fired due to a customer complaint(which, was a lie. I didn't do what the customer said I did, and they fired me anyways.), so I can't even use that place as a reference.

I want to become independent(obviously, that's my goal), and want to find a job with my associates so that I can avoid as much crushing debt as I possibly can (I currently have somewhere in the ballpark of 12,000-18,000 dollars in student loan debt(4 years of community college, I switched my major 3 times, and am aware that this number is SMALL compared to some others out there.), and know that my student loan debt could easily double or triple by continuing on to a 4-year university. 

I'm hesitant to continue to stay at home during the time I get my bachelor's because of some things that are happening in the home that are not okay (severe physical, mental, and emotional abuse to myself personally.), but I need a job to move out.

Everywhere I apply, from fast food joints to retail, have asked me about my lack of work experience, or ignored me completely.
I'm 26, and have only worked at one job.

I'm only recently figuring out how much I've epically fucked up because I talk to my classmates and some already working in the industry, are getting internships, and offers to stay after graduation, and I am desperate to fix my mistakes if I ever hope to find a job in my field of study(engineering).

I'm not looking for sympathy, I'm just trying to figure how I can work around the lack of experience thing without outright lying.

Or, even, some things I can say when asked about the gaps in my resume.

I have no kids, and I have not volunteered(except in highschool, it was required to graduate), I have no substance abuse issues, have never been to rehab.

I just had a really caring father who knew what it was like to try to work full time and go to school fulltime, and how being shoved into college can be have disastrous results both mentally and financially.

I enjoyed finding out that Math degrees at a bachelor's level don't have the greatest prospects, so I decided to adult up and get an actual professional career. However, not much seems to have changed. I have little practical experience (8 month internship with the statistical agency of the government in Canada) and am incredibly awful at programming interviews. Two of the interviews I had were fairly simple, but I failed because I didn't even know about string immutability. I also have very little in the way of projects. I'm not particularly smart, and mostly rely on hard work. I've never struggled with the stuff I've worked with in school or work apart from the algorithmic trivia questions which seem to give me fits...

The only projects I've done involved a few simple GUI based applications in Java using Spring (tic-tac-toe game and a basic calculator) and some web stuff like HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, etc (nothing in demand like AngularJS, NodeJS, ASP.net etc). I also have a few school projects, but I only worked on sections of those for assignments (some code was provided to us). I, somehow managed to get an internship with the government as the questions asked were primarily knowledge-based questions after failing the aforementioned interviews.

I have accepted that I will not be able to get into one of the highly sought after tech giants, and it's not something I lose sleep over. Despite my best efforts by working through books on programming and frequenting websites like leetcode, i just don't feel cut out of for these types of interviews. However, reading job ads online on indeed just makes me sad. Many positions require at least 2 years of experience for new developers and reading reviews regarding some of these companies on glassdoor is even more disheartening. I understand that reviews on these websites tend to attract people who have had bad experiences, but seeing a lot of these does seem to imply more than a few disgruntled past employees.

Based on that, it seems to me that, unless you get in with one of these sought after companies (i.e. Google, MSFT, FB, etc), you're just wasting your time. I don't expect to make over $70k starting out. I just want a stable job, with reasonable working hours with understandable overtime when needed, that pays the bills and allows me to focus on my true passion; learning. I'm not really interested in pursuing further education of an academic nature like a PhD given the politics involved and the difficulty associated with getting a tenured position.

Currently, I'm in my final year, but with only 1 internship under my belt. I'm planning to get another one and am still hopeful, unsure why, that with past experience, a good GPA, and a few senior level courses, I can snag a position that doesn't require me to be an algorithmic wiz. However, on the other I feel I'm just running away from the realization that I'm just doing this to run away (I had to throw a recursive joke because I had to throw a recursive joke) from the inevitable grind of finding a full-time job and the feeling that the longer you're unemployed, the more difficult it is to actually find a job, so even if I can't find anything, recruiters can't screw me over for being unemployed. Sorry for that run-on sentence...

The government's full-time hiring processes are hit or miss to say the least, and do involve some degree of brown nosing from what I have gathered hearing people talk at work. Getting an internship with them is much easier, and I'm not the most sociable guy in the world, so that's also a strike against me. Apart from my supervisor who seems impressed by more hard work, I made no connections with anyone in the workplace and the best he can offer is a reference, which although nice to have, does little to promise future employment.

If anyone actually, read this far...should I even stay in this field or get the hell out? I don't even know what else I could do at this point..."

My thinking is that it's best to complete the program ASAP since:

1. If lack of an internship prevents getting a job, worst case I'll just get an internship after graduation. Given the earlier graduation, I would imagine interning now or later wouldn't have a huge impact on my career? Or has there been some NPV analysis on all future income and that internships are the way to go in this particular situation?

2. There IS a possibility of getting a decent job after graduation without internship.

3. Many have stressed the value of good side projects, and if they are somewhat equivalent to internships, I'd much prefer that. Mainly because time spent on commute etc is actually a big cost. 

4. I live in Orange County where I hear it's pretty rough for getting internships.

I've never been formally diagnosed with depression but have been seeing counselors and taking SSRIs per nurse's orders for about two or three years now (first Citalopram and for the last six months or so, Sertraline 100 mg at HS). 

I'm a little over a month from graduating with a BA in Psych and a BA in German, but lately I just feel hopelessly lost. I haven't been sleeping or eating well for a week roughly - not being able to sleep till dawn and then staying in bed all day. Lately I'll eat maybe once in a day if I can manage it.  I have let my schoolwork slip by me and have not been going to class because I've felt guilty about not doing my work and/or struggling in classes, which is a vicious and self repeating cycle.  

I've just been wanting to disappear lately. Not die by any means, but just... not exist, though I have had some intrusive thoughts of suicide. I briefly flirted with self-harm a few times a couple years ago and have had urges to try that again, too. 

Mainly I'm just terrified of failing two of my classes. I have a D in each which is passing, but I'm still terrified of failing one or both and not graduating like I'm hopefully doing next month. My whole family will be here, and I don't know if I could handle the shame. 

I don't really know where to go from here - I feel at this point that my professors would just think that I was making excuses, or try to get the authorities involved, and I definitely don't want that, either. 

Also stressed financially since I'm supposed to be moving into a new place next month and I have nowhere near the amount for the security deposit or first month of rent because of unforeseen expenses with my vehicle. 

Finally, I feel guilty for feeling this way when I've had a good life besides bullying experiences from K-9th and bad relationships, though my current gf is a saint (though she's away on an internship).  I feel like I should be happy or excited since I'm so close to the finish line, but I'm just... not.  


Now I'm just rambling.

Two Questions,rhylte,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/63tgyq/no_summer_internship_two_questions/,"So I'm a Junior CS (and Physics) major at a university in Washington state. I spent my Sophomore summer doing Physics research, and was hoping to open my Junior summer doing a some sort of Software Engineering internship. Admittedly, I started looking into my options pretty late (January), and I applied to a whole slew. I was invited to do the coding portions for a couple of places, and I even got 2 interviews at one of them, but neither offered me an internship. I never really heard back from any of the other places I applied.

That experience was pretty demoralizing, and it kind of seems like most places will have their positions filled. 

My first question is:
Should I just give up on finding a software engineering internship this summer, and take my on campus job to pay the bills? 

My second question is more of a general worry. I spent last summer doing something related to my Physics major, but I'm definitely leaning more towards using the CS part of my degree than the Physics when I graduate. So since I might not get an internship this summer:

How much of a disadvantage am I at when it comes to employment when I graduate?

I won't have much on my resume when I graduate, and I was really hoping to use the summer internship to beef it up. Will I still be hirable, and where should I be looking?

**tl;dr  I failed to secure a summer internship, and I'm freaking out about what it means for my future. What should I do?** "

I keep hearing about (here and from classmates) about all the internships people are getting and how important they are and it's starting to stress me out a bit. I would LOVE to be able to do an internship, but I don't really see it being feasible with my schedule. Even if I had the time, I feel I would be hard pressed to find a company willing to accomodate an intern with such a shitty schedule.

I am currently working on and have a couple side projects already to show that I CAN actually program as well.

I'm planning a move to NYC and I want to work on Android dev, though I'm open to any sort of object oriented programming. I'm looking to move as close to September as possible to avoid lease complications with my current apartment. I'm in central CT so it's not hard to go the city on any given day for an interview. 

I'm wondering how I should go about applying to companies. I have some big companies in mind that I want to apply to, I feel like they're long shots, but it doesn't hurt to try. I also have some other, smaller companies that I think would be awesome to work for. These are kind of in the ""sweet spot"" of places that I think might work out if I really have my shit together. Then there's everything else, I'm going to start talking to some recruiters so I guess the stuff they bring my way would fall into this category. 

With that being said, I have next to no real interview experience right now. I've been working in insurance IT as a SQL dev for 3 years, I got this position from an internship. I did do one interview a couple years ago with Cognizant, that went fine and I got an offer. I also interviewed with Google about a year ago, but didn't make it past the phone interview. 

I'm not the kind of person that is going to pour over Cracking the Coding Interview for 5 hours a night. I know it's not exactly a popular opinion in this sub, but I think it's ridiculous for companies to expect candidates to memorize these arbitrary algorithms. I'm hoping for interviews that focus on culture fit and actual coding ability. I've seen some companies that are now doing paired programming sessions or take home assignments for interviews. I think that's pretty cool. I'm mainly going to entry level positions since I'm fairly new to Android, so I hope that's reasonable to expect. 

So my main question is how do I decide the order to apply to these companies? Should I try to get some interview experience under my belt by applying to companies I know I don't want to work for before applying to those that I do? If I get an offer early on from a company that might not be so high on my list what's the best thing to do if I know there are other companies I still want to try to interview at? 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks! "

I am a first-year computer science student at Colorado State University (CSU), who is thriving and loving the major. CSU has offered me so much in terms of personal experience. I've taken part in a mock interview with Google, many career fares, along with my involvement in 2, two-hundred level credits of Independent Study (IS) added to my 30 credit load. My IS has been oriented towards server architecture, Github skills along with Unix and Linux history/fundamentals. My department advisor will serve as a reference for my future endeavors. I like to think I possess a hacking-like mindset, which makes me think that I should purse the security and encryption side of CS. I am planning on mastering Java, applying my HTML and CSS skills to create an online portfolio, along with learning C and Assembly machine languages. My current GPA is 2.73, I have no criminal record.

***Dilemma:***

Out-of-state tuition has become too much for my single mother, and I will have to move back to Austin Texas where I was born and raised. I considered emancipating myself in attempts to gain residency in Colorado, but that seems to me like too much of a leap of faith. I have at job at Amy's Ice Creams, and I will be attending Austin Community College (ACC) for my second undergraduate year. I hope that a year of success at community college can increase my GPA to boost my chances of transferring to UT or another Texas university for my upperclassman years. Although ACC is an accredited school and an affordable option, they do not offer CS classes comparable to what I would be taking if I were to stay at CSU; except for the Calculus and Discrete math classes I'll be taking.

***Solution:***

How can I best ready myself for a future in CS? What ideas do I need to have in my head to ensure personal success? Beside the Intro to Java Liang textbook I already own, what books should I purchase to help orient myself in the security and machine language direction? Are online certifications a good option? What security/encryption classes should I think about taking? Internships seem to be the best route for obtaining tuition reimbursement, how can I make myself the best possible candidate for internship opportunities? If anyone has experience or advise for the security/encryption sector of CS, that would be very much appreciated. What have I not thought of yet? 

 I know there is opportunity out there for me in CS because I am a motivated and dedicated individual. Thank you for time and consideration, any advise is appreciated."

I'm finishing up my second year as an undergrad CS major/Finance minor. By the end of this year I'll have taken courses in web app development, data science, computer architecture, data structure/algorithms, math for CS etc. so I had a decent enough academic background to be successful in a software development/engineering internship role. My GPA is less than stellar due to a mediocre academic performance my freshman year (including a withdrawal from a math class), but now that I am taking mostly project-based electives, my grades are on an upward trend. 

My strategy has been to mostly target smaller companies since my GPA is low as they are the most likely to overlook this. After applying online to a few places over the past few months, I have gotten three responses total. One from a large financial services company, one from a very small startup, and the last from a local data consulting firm. All were for software development/engineering roles. I had phone/skype interviews at the first two and then they just stopped responding (?). For the data consulting firm, however, I had one in-person interview and got the offer today.

I was interviewed by the founder who did both his undergrad and MBA (top 10 program) at my school. He's a very sharp guy and his firm is clearly is doing well. The data consulting firm works with other companies under a larger group and has external contracts with other companies, mostly startups. From what we discussed in our interview, the work at the company fits my skillset well. The work environment seems fast-paced and young (very much a startup vibe). I was also interviewed by another employee/intern during the in-person interview and he spoke very positively about both the founder and the work. The employee/intern graduated from my school early and was the president of a large business related club. He is working there until his full-time job at an IB started in the summer. 

The owner seems very fond of hiring interns (rather than actual employees?). I'm not sure how many people there are full time, but it's a very small firm. The owner handles both the business operations and the coding (has a strong CS background), so I would learn a lot and be mentored by the founder.

The compensation structure is the only thing that has me concerned. Basically, it's an unpaid internship with an incentive bonus at the end based on me reaching performance targets that we determine in the first week. The other intern was being paid in the same way, so I assume this is what he does for every intern. Has anyone done an internship like this? 

Honestly, I would rather work for an hourly wage since I would need to rent a place etc. , but he was very up-front about how I would be paid. This is the only offer that I have at this point and the summer is about to begin. I'm also doing this the summer after my sophomore year, so it would likely be good experience to put on my resume and I would have a solid reference at the end for next summer. Should I accept or look for somewhere with a more traditional compensation structure? Advice would be greatly appreciated.

One of my projects is optimizing the ability of our rotor stem to handle torque. A cam and gear is mated to the rotor stem.

Ideally, my selection would balance both the parts ability to handle a higher torque,and reduce slip. Do you have any suggestions? I am thinking of a gear type design with male splines which would fit in the cam and gear by corresponding female splines. I couldn't find a specific shape that is considered the most optimal online, but I thought this might work.

Another issue I am having is calculating the torque. I have been using Roark's handbook, specifically the table containing formulas for torsional deformation and stress. While this contains a good variety of shapes, it does not have a gear design. Also, if I choose to do a very irregular shape that doesn't have these types of formulas worked out, what is the best way to go about calculating the maximum amount of torque it can handle?

One of my projects was to upgrade anyone still on Office ~~2010~~ 2007 or ~~2013~~ 2010 to Office ~~2016~~ 2013. 

We had a couple of users that tried to investigate things themselves, and they were always completely wrong. One of my co-workers received a call:

**User:** ""Hi. We're having issues with the office installation on this computer.""

**Coworker:** ""Okay, what's going on with it?""

**User:** ""It looks like your intern installed Office 2015 instead of ~~2016~~ 2013.""

**Coworker:** ""........ I don't think so.""

**User:** ""Yes, he did. We checked. There's a folder titled Office15 on this computer.""

**Coworker:** ""well that doesn't mean that it's Office 2015. That folder is probably on every computer that had ~~2016~~ 2013 installed.""

**User:** ""No, we checked. This other computer doesn't have that folder. Your intern messed up the install.""

**Coworker:** ""How about I remote into that computer and check?""

*They gave a lot of issues with him trying to remote in, and it took a few minutes for them to stop trying to convince him that they were right and that he didn't need to check*

**Coworker:** ""Right here. I have both computers pulled up, BOTH of them have that folder on them. They both have the correct Office ~~2016~~ 2013 installation on them.""

*The user just backpedals at this point and gives up*

Like many other things, this became a running joke. There was an attempted project drawn out on one of our whiteboards that the network staff and directors were planning. They had left it up for a while, so I decided to add in a plan for the intern (myself) to install office 2015 on some random device that I drew an arrow to. That plan remained on the whiteboard for months. 

**EDIT:** I was wrong, I was actually upgrading users from Office 2007 and 2010 up to 2013. Keep in mind, this was over a year ago and I made the mistake of thinking it was an Office 2016 upgrade since my current workplace has 2016 deployed."

I'm graduating from a state school with a BS in Computer Science and only one internship (I know that's bad, but I applied to them yearly and didn't get any responses, until I got one through a final-semester class where the professor sets you up with one). Programming job postings nearby are scarce. I was surprised to get an email back from a position in Albany recently that would've been a paid summer internship ($15/hr). 

We had a phone interview and I was accepted, but later my parents were practically having a heart attack at the thought of me driving on the interstate 2 hours there and back every day (haven't gotten a full license yet but I easily could before this job's star date) and insisted I'm ""worth more than $15/hour"" and that it wouldn't be worth it in either gas or what it would cost to use public transportation to get up there (which was surprisingly very much, I wish we had a good public transit system).

I still live with them and don't have exactly enough savings yet to be able to start living on my own in Albany, with a deposit and bills and everything, especially on $15/hr (Albany has high rent), but I still feel like I really should've just found a way to make it work and that I'm now going to end up with an ever-widening gap in my resume after graduating that's just going to make it even less likely I'll be accepted anywhere in the future, with my only 'professional' experience being one single-semester internship (and years of volunteering at conventions if you can count that), and the rest being various personal projects of my own (like a chip-8 emulator and a 6502 IDE) and some with others like working on a group of people online for an MMORPG since high school and a similarly-scaled one for the last few years concurrently. 

Is there any possibility that it was only the case I didn't hear back from anywhere I applied to (even through my school's jobs/internships board) just because I hadn't graduated yet, or do you think rejecting this position in Albany was a big mistake? 

Also, would I have more luck in the forhire subreddit etc. after graduating now that I have that final-semester internship?

Budget presents a slight but not daunting concern (e.g. my parents can still afford Berkeley, and we only received $1000 from them in aid without Regents). 

However, my parents are pushing for UCD primarily because I received Regents/Honors and I KNOW IT'S A HUGE BLESSING, and I'm really grateful, I just don't feel like I'd be happy at Davis and that's a huge factor in me for picking a college. I don't know how to articulate my argument for Berkeley in the face of Davis offering me more money, though ://

I'm a 2nd year CS major at a public university and as a career I would really like to work as a data scientist. The reason I became interested in data science is because I am a huge baseball fan, and along with this I have a very strong liking for numbers. I was told that I should either pursue computer science, statistics, or mathematics as a major and potentially minor in another so I was also planning on obtaining a stats minor.

Throughout my first 2 years, I have not truly enjoyed the aspect of coding. I was close to changing last fall but I took a discrete structures course that sparked my interest in the subject once again. I really enjoy the logic behind data structures and algorithms but when it comes to coding I see every bit of it as a chore. Recently I had to drop a core course for CS and I really have not felt much remorse over doing so.

After doing a bit of research, I have begun to consider making computer science a minor (would only need 2 more classes for it) and pursuing statistics as a major. I would only be set back about 10 credit hours because of classes overlapping, and by keeping CS as a minor there would have been only 4 courses that would have gone to waste, and one of them being a database class that I likely would have taken anyways. Yet I have multiple concerns over doing this. For one, it seems like I would have to obtain a masters in stats if I want to seem as marketable as someone with a CS major. Is this true? I also have only taken one stats course in my life, and even though I feel as though it's a match for me I don't want to jump the gun but I am planning on taking 2 or 3 stats classes over the summer to solidify my interest.

Some more questions: are there many internship opportunities for a statistics major? For those who have majored in stats and had an internship, what year did you get it and what was it like? Also, would it be tougher for me to find a data science job as a stats major and not a CS major?

Thank you for reading this! "

63yui7,2,2017-04-07,Need help deciding between two internships for the summer ! !,Jmwoz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/63yui7/need_help_deciding_between_two_internships_for/,"So, here's the deal, I currently have two offers on the table for this summer.  One is with a company in Chicago, which is a city I've never been to, and the other is in Detroit, my hometown.  I was only expecting to get an offer from the place in Detroit, but I got the other offer from Chicago and it completely threw me off-guard and now I have to have a decision in by this Saturday. 

A little bit about myself before I go on:  I'm currently a Sophomore at U of M majoring in Computer Science.  I never touched a line of code before second semester of my Freshman year so I'm relatively new to the industry and don't have a very clear path in mind of what I want to do.  

I suppose I'll mak sort of a Pro / Con list for each place starting with the one in Detroit.

In Detroit, I currently have an offer from a place called Urban Science for $17 / hour.  I would work 40/hrs a week from May 1st until August 25th.  I've been to their office when I interviewed and it's really cool.  It was renovated just last month, has a game room with Xbox, GameCube WiiU (ect.), a great view of the Detroit River from the 19th floor of the renaissance center, employs a younger crowd (20-30), and is only 15 minutes from where I live.  In addition to that, one of my good friends who has been my partner through many of my cs classes in college is also going to be working there.  I suppose more important than that is what I would be doing there.  So, from what I've gathered, Urban Science is a consulting/software company that collects data and provides services for many of the major players in the automotive industry.  They told me I'll mainly be learning SQL and working with the Microsoft Stack.  It seems to be your more generic / corporate workspace, but at the same time a pretty stable, safe option that's familiar and close to home.

Now in Chicago I currently have an offer from a place called Fulcrum gt for $1900 every two weeks (about $22 an hour for a 40 hour week) with housing included as a bonus.  I would work from May 22 until August 18th.  This place in in a [great location](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fulcrum+Global+Technologies/@41.8868683,-87.6269154,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x880e2cafbd0e84a9:0x585f14dbdbab1abb!8m2!3d41.8864128!4d-87.6267626!6m1!1e1) and I think would be an awesome overall experience.  I also know two people who will be interning there this summer, one I know though a cs club here on campus and the other who I've known since the 3rd grade and is a good friend of mine.  What does Fulcrum gt do?  Well, I first heard of them through a hackathon earlier this year (HackIllinois).  I don't know a whole lot about them but from what I can gather they are a consulting / software company that provides services for some big players in the law space.  Now this Internship is a little different as it was presented as a ""start up camp"" where I would be placed in a small team, brainstorm an idea, get it approved, and spend the whole time hacking it together until it would best case become an actual product.  It's definitely going to have more of a ""fast paced"" start-up vibe to it, but at the same time be riskier but potentially be more rewarding.  

So do you guys have any thoughts on what I should do?  Part of me wants to stay home with my family in Detroit but another part of me wants to take the risk and go experience Chicago for all that it has to offer.  Part of the reason I decided to post this here was to hopefully get some insight from people who may have some prior experience making a decision like this or working at a place similar to the ones described above.  If you have any input I would really appreciate it."

For my internship the Big boss asked me to determine the accuracy of the ""Concentrated Source Method"".
This  ""Method II.2"" described in the HMRI manual (comparable to ISO-Norms) which is used to determine the immission relevant source power in a certain direction from (a) sound source(s) during a well defined business situation.

They distinguish two situations I don't fully understand.
- Measurepoint on a whole sphere
High round sources positioned on an imaginary plane of measurement in the form of a whole sphere where its center alignes with the source center.
1,5 d &lt; R , 0,5 h_b
where h_b = hight of the source above the ground.

- Measurepoint on a halve sphere
If a concentrated source is located near a horizontal surface, the plane of measurement is chosen as a half sphere around the source. The center of the half sphere alignes with the projectile of the source center on the horizontal surface. examples are. paved and grassy grounds and rooftops etc. 
R &gt; 1,5d

The difference is still a bit vague to me, it was once explained but i kind of forgot. I do know that it kind of felt counter intuitive at the time.

Anyhow.
The purpose is to calculate the sourcepower L_wr
from the measurements we can get a average soundpressurelevel L_Aeq,T

condition. R &lt; 20m:
Whole sphere: L_wr = L_Aeq,T + 10 log (4pi R^2)
Half sphere: L_wr = L_Aeq,T + 10 log ( 4pi R^2 - 2)

condition R &gt; 20m
L_wr = L_Aeq,T + 10 log (4pi R^2 + a_air R)
L_wr = L_Aeq,T - L_fiction.
a_air = airabsorptioncoeff.

MAIN QUESTION:
Can somebody help me figure out how to determine the margin of error of the sourcepower.
How do i determine the margin of error in each individual factor
How to reduce the error as good as possible?

ANY INFORMATION WILL HELP

Thanks Reddit, I love how enineers from all over the world are willing to help eachother so we can all innovate together!

(in exchange, commuting would also take up an hour or two) My stipend is 24k a year and my tuition covered, so the 24k really just goes towards my living expenses.

Does anyone suggest paying up to 1800 for housing with a 24k stipend? Assuming that I use 200-300 on food by cooking most meals. Or should I spend closer to 1300-1600?

I'm doing everything I can to better myself. I'm busy Monday - Friday. I don't have time for myself or anything I want to do, so Saturday and Sunday come along and I need that time to catch up on school work / design work. Not to mention do some things I want to do and relax a little bit before Monday comes and it starts all over again. 

My problem is my retail job. It's my steady source of income. I work less than 20 hours right now. I can't remember exactly how much. But I make 11 dollars an hour, and my paychecks come in at about 90-100 a week. I have a 200 dollar car payment once a month, a cat and three dogs. My retail job is at a pet store. (We don't sell pets. Just supplies) and we're owned by a vet. It has a huge perk of discounts. Not so much on the food, but the vet side of it. One of my dogs had a bunch of teeth removed and it should have been 2k - 3k and ended up coming in at about 350 because they took a bunch of charges off since I'm an employee. One of the doctors didn't charge me for some things to keep the cost low. With three dogs and a cat that's huge. 

I've been working here for almost six years. I used to not be able to say no so whenever someone called out I would come in no matter how mad I was. Took me five years to grow a backbone. Now when someone calls out I'm too busy to help. There's a girl who works here. Recently started who calls out constantly, even when she isn't sick. She has another job and when she doesn't feel like it she doesn't come in. She's unreliable. She shows up very late every shift. She won't listen to any changes. Meanwhile I've been a good employee for five years. I do what I'm supposed to, I would always pick up shifts and cover hours on top of my own. I'm not the greatest employee in the world, but I know I'm good, trustworthy, and reliable. While one of the girls here, her husband was dying of cancer another employee and I were here around the clock, pretty much carrying the store that was open 7 days a week and for about 12 hours during the day. We did it all together. 

Everyone has been a little less pleased with me since I started all this other stuff and haven't been able to help out, but it was okay. Rewind to a couple weeks ago, another part time girl quit out of the blue and we needed someone to cover her hours until we hired someone new. It was Wednesday and I was working for my internship from home. My phone rang and I get a text saying so and so quit we need you in Saturday for these hours. I said I couldn't work it, because I have a big paper to write and projects to catch up on. I get a text back we all have to pull together and do it. Meanwhile other people were not asked to cover. And I wasn't asked I was told.  I was busy I couldn't do it. Then I get it thrown back in my face that I don't work weekends and I need to do it. Well just because they need it doesn't mean that I don't have other things I have to do. I talked to my boss on the phone after that and basically told me everyone works a weekend day (not true) and maybe we need to revisit that rule since some people aren't. And I told him to take me off a week day if he wanted me on a weekend day. Essentially I'm stressed enough with everything I have to do and I don't think I can take on more so the other employee stepped up to the plate. She's only stepped up one other time. 

It's like everyone has forgotten how much I've done for the past 5 years. My manager is giving everyone else other than me preference of their schedules for summer and I get to be at the bottom of the pile because of this. He doesn't seem friendly towards me anymore, and sometimes when I talk to him he just doesn't answer. 

My question is that when my internship ends and I need to pickup more hours over the summer it doesn't seem like I will get anything here. Should I be looking at another part time job and leave behind the discount? Or should I just keep trudging along until I find a career and graduate which won't be for another year. Should I keep a day or two for the discount and find another job to supplement? I don't know I'm very lost and this job over the last couple years has been getting more and more difficult. Everyone treats this is like a career. And it's just a part time retail job. Maybe I'm overreacting I just don't know. "

The constant coding during your free time, working on side projects, doing leetcode, etc. In college and after college. Is this all going to worth it? Am I going to be able to enjoy life again sometime preferably before retirement? 



Hi All,

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I'd appreciate any input from those more experienced in life. 

I'm a junior CS student at a state university with a 3.96 GPA. I'll be graduating in May 2018, have been doing part time .NET software development for a small local company for the past year, and have an internship this summer at a company that doesn't have a name that means anything in the tech field but nevertheless will be gaining data analysis skills with Python, R, and Hadoop. 

I consistently manage to keep my week busy with work, school, gym, and errands up until every Sunday usually where I reach a point where I've studied all I can study and have nothing to do besides wait to start everything all over again on Monday. It's during these times when I become incredibly anxious and either waste my time working on side projects that I end up putting on GitHub then taking down later because they're shit, reading but feeling lost with CTCI, or trying my best to solve leetcode problems but ending up just memorizing solutions. 

I give myself two hours of free time to eat and watch TV at the end of every day (I do intermittent fasting) and I feel like I deserve that time, but aside from that I always feel guilty for having free time and spend it trying to find ways to be productive. 

I haven't truly enjoyed life ever since starting college and finding out I wanted to pursue CS (I hadn't ever programmed before). I haven't played video games since high school, lost most of my social connections, lost all of my other hobbies like reading, and become solely focused on being in the best possible situation I can be after graduation. I don't know why I do it, I'm not competitive with others, just myself. I'm worried that I won't be good enough and that if I spend any time not being productive then I'll regret it later. 

But then I get even more depressed when I read about people coding in their free time even after college. I don't truly enjoy coding. I don't mind it, and I can do it for a career but I'm not passionate about it or anything. I feel like a fool because I'm terrible at leetcode and probably won't be able to land a job at the Big 4, but I don't even know why I want a job at the Big 4 if I'm going to have to code in my free time. I don't know why I even want to live if I'm going to have to always be coding, always be learning, and always be feeling behind.

I guess my questions are the following:
Does it ever stop? I was looking forward to making new friends, pursuing love, playing video games, and finding my hobbies again after college. 
Do college students have free time? Is it okay to have free time? I don't even feel like a normal person anymore. I read about others who are constantly working and studying and then feel guilty for not working or studying more.

I know what I really need is a doctor, medication, therapist, etc but I could really use some advice from you all because I know you can relate since we're all in the same field.

I've had an internship developing backend cloud infrastructure in Python with various technologies, as well as 6-8 months of part-time experience for a high performance cluster computing project backed by a prominent academic institution. Distributed systems are what get me going, you could say.

I mentioned I had been targeting these fields to a professor I'm close with, and he suggested looking for more general entry-level positions.

It seems like there should be plenty of opportunities in cloud infrastructure, but I've obviously failed to find them. I can code all day in Python and love to use it for most of my projects, but Java and Javascript web frameworks seem far more in demand, and my experience there is minimal. Maybe I'm just not looking in the right places?

I really don't know where to focus my efforts. On one hand, I can keep trying to target companies doing things with technologies I've got experience in and get excited about, but may not be hiring entry level candidates for.

On the other, I could cast the net wide and loose and hope someone bites, potentially abandoning what little momentum I've got at this point in the area I'm interested in (beggers can't be choosers, after all)? At least numbers may be in my favor here?

I know I lack perspective, so any advise would be appreciated, because I'm extremely conflicted and nervous at this point. I feel like everything I've done up to this point is about to be squandered.

In January 2015 I left a marriage from an extremely violent woman (put me through 2 surgeries), and moved back with my dad. In May of 2015 I got into college, and the same week I started classes my father passed (only parent, and only close connection left in my life). I got off to a good start in college, but then I noticed I was slipping and the weight of my past was catching up to me.

I started attending counseling by August 2015 ranging from grief groups to individual trauma recovery (which I still attend weekly to this day). Each semester from then on I slowly started dropping classes down from full time. I'm doing a software engineering degree, and my tuition and housing is paid for, but I'm currently only taking 1 class, and I can't motivate myself to do more because I'm depressed all the time and feel worthless. 

I felt lonely and started dating heavily and still do to this day. I've talked to hundreds of women in the last 2 years, and had 2 serious relationships. The last serious relationship left me emotionally crippled a month ago, and she still uses me for sex at her convenience. I was so motivated while I was with her and happy, she included me with her family and friends and we traveled and did everything together and then she completely changed once she realized how ""clingy"" I was.

I'm still so focused on finding someone mutually interested, but I'm so sick of being ghosted, lied to, used for attention then discarded, used for financial support then discarded, used for sex... I have no problem with confidence and picking up a woman, but honestly every single one I've put effort into when there was chemistry it ends up going to shit. After each girl I talk to I usually end up losing a bit more hope in myself and future. I'm not a big person, but I now take twice the normal dosage of ambien just to barely get 3-5 hours of sleep a night.

I have worked at various jobs, all of which I was not happy with the pay and really the quality and end up quitting. I recently applied at dozens of jobs, and got an interview. They ended up swapping the internship job on me once I got there, and I reluctantly accepted the job just to stay busy and try go get my mind off the girl I fell in love with. I'm now working a night shift supervisor position for UPS at 15.55$ an hour and honestly I don't see myself there for more than another month before I quit. Today I applied at dozens of more jobs.

I have only had 1 consistent and close friend over the last 2 years and she is married with 2 kids, and lives 2 hours away and honestly I feel guilty anytime I talk because I'm just talking about how fucked up the women are that I keep running into. I have the opportunity to go to college for free and get paid for housing. I have benefits that people would kill for. I'm in the best place I've ever been financially in my life, but I've never felt so low and worthless.

I wish I had my father in my life still and I could ask him for advice or just hear his voice again. I wish I had a family, friends, or a girlfriend that would be there for me 110% as I would be for them. I need someone to guide me and push me to get me excited about the future and make them proud. I'm running on fumes and each effort I make in a relationship just sinks me that much lower, but I'm addicted and I don't want to be alone. I am inflicted with so much emotional pain and my thoughts race making it hard to sleep or stay asleep even medicated. I could do so well, but I can't get out of this pit I've been stuck in for so many years, and I keep wishing I could go back and prevent things or change them for the better."

About 6 months ago I moved to a new job at a government organization. The job is kinda like a mixture of help desk and desktop support.(I provide help to users and fix problems, but also work on projects such as deploying new software/hardware)

The position requires essentially no programming. The closest I've came to programming so far has been a few very simple batch scripts I wrote.

However, the job requires lots of documentation and written communication on projects. So while I don't gain experience programming, I do gain experience with working on projects, documenting progress, etc. 

I really like this job, everyone I work with is so nice, so I really want to stay at it until I graduate. However, will I be shooting myself in the foot if I don't get a real programming internship?

The problem is I still hate the environment there, it's just incredibly draining &amp; the mindset makes me feel like I'm going nowhere and I still end up crying often. I screwed up a relationship, and did mediocrely in both work and school, as I was so stressed out &amp; overwhelmed with everything.

I haven't done any volunteer experience or did any extracurricular activities outside of school, which I am obviously regretting now.

In addition, I truly do want to do some volunteer work.

I've also been applying to internships, but I don't know how to sell myself if I don't have relevant experience. I guess that also applies to the office jobs too though. I have visited my career counselor a few times already &amp; have gone over my resume &amp; cover letters, but I don't feel like that's enough.

Ok, seriously. Hear me out. Graduated last year. Not CS degree but related--MIS (no regrets). Stellar GPA but I've already accepted no one gives a fuck and it meant fuckall. Long story short, I had no internships under my belt at all. Post grad I managed to find an incredibly fucking shitty (and I mean shittier than shit itself) contract job that basically lied to me about the responsibilities and paid me half a peanut. I left shortly after with shitall to put on my resume. I try to spin it very positively but basically I'm back to square 0 with 2 months experience (fuken LOL!!!).

Now.... begin the job hunt. The choices so far have been crap on a stick. I cancelled an in person interview at one company because I found out they use VB.NET. Finally got another in person interview, ""fullstack webdev"" they say but nahh... just tons of maintaining old code, T-SQL bullshit and reporting services. They're understaffed (== long hours), it's not even a tech company, and the dev team consists of literally 3 guys who could be my dads and have been with the company for more than a decade. I think they're desperate because no one else wants the position. Am I wrong? Tell me I'm wrong and not digging my own grave with this job. 

My self-taught skills are much more ""modern"" and I think this will really set me back. Pretty depressed at the moment.

What are my options at this point though? I have no car, still live with my parents, live in a kinda bad tech area, and am tired of personal projects just to show employers that yes, I can code. They can only get me so far without ""official"" experience.

I am graduating with my BS in CS this month from a decent University. Glass Door says that the national average for Jr Dev salaries is 60k, and 64k in my state. My buddy from school got a job paying 60K the semester he was graduating (after an internship), which is about what I have been seeking pay wise (I consider myself at his skill level). I have worked for the last 8 months as a web applications developer (MySQL, Bootstrap, ColdFusion, Jquery) but with a crummy title (Reporting Analyst). And finally, I recently got two job offers for 45K and 50K. After leveraging them I was able to negotiate them both up to about 55K, and I took the one with better benefits.

So my question is this: should I have waited until I graduated? Would I have gotten better offers with a degree in hand? Even though I graduate this month?

Also, can I trust those glass door figures? I know they include people with more experience, but I figured 60K was reasonable given my state's higher average, but after lots of applications and interviews, I just couldn't seem to get that kind of interest.

Last, have I shot myself in the foot for taking a low starting salary that future salaries might be based on? I am just feeling a little less satisfied than I had hoped, even though I am happy about the job. I just want to feel like I am fairly compensated relative to the industry.

Please give me a reality check. Thanks."

I was hoping for a summer one, but I took this one and went to school part time.

It turns out that I need to actually take a summer class or I would push back my graduation. It's complicated because I have no idea if I will be retained for the summer or not.

For the most part I like the internship. The work is kinda tedious and boring, but not too hard. Why do I not know if I will be retained for the summer? I have gotten zero feedback from anyone about anything. I have no clue whether I am doing a good job or a bad job. I try to do a good job. What makes it even harder to tell is that the other intern looked openly lackadaisical most of the time, spending more time on his phone then working, and he basically got moved into a bigger, more important role. Meanwhile, I would work my butt off and I never had anything said to me, really. The difference between me and him, though, is he is graduated and I am not. 

I guess I wouldn't mind walking away from the internship. There are some things I don't like about the place. There are many tribal rules, and people are not very good at explaining things. You more or less have to learn on your own. Also, the guy I am an intern for is not really there for me on anything. What I mean is that if I have an issue with something, and I email him, he rarely responds. Even any other question, he rarely responds, and I am left hanging. I'm the type of person who likes things resolved, and when he says he will take a look at something, when I have to actually go to his office and talk to him, he never gets back to me. I never know if the problem is fixed or not. 

Also, sometimes the company pushes me into working extra hours. For example, when I started, they asked if O wanted to work 60 hours. Uhm, no I take classes at night, and they know that. The one week, they pretty much made me work 60 hours when I had an 2 exams that week. I gave them what I could work, but they kind of just scrapped it. When I interviewed, they told me 35-40 hours a week, not 60. 

How do I approach this situation? I have to take this summer class. Do I just ask if I am staying over the summer or not? Is it bad if I don't? I tried to do my best. "

 I want to become a software developer/engineer as soon as possible and I feel as if college is just taking too long. The best part of college so far (besides making friends) was that I was offered an interview for an internships with a very large company, nonetheless that did not happen(Bombed the interview/ did great on technical questions, had a hard time with behavioral. ). Besides that I have been teaching myself to code/programming in my free time, but because i work part-time, am a studnet full time, and have a lot of boring homework I have almost no time to learn on my own anymore.  

Solution? 
There's a programming boot camp offered by another college ,but it is quite pricey, I really want to join it and quit college. Nonetheless, doing that would mean giving up the scholarships and not getting the degree which I would be the first on in my family to get. 
so I am asking for advice on whether i should:
- stick to it, be a man, and get the degree? 
-quit, be a man, and try the boot camp? 
- other?

Are there any recommend guides/tutorials that would get me decently up to speed over a weekend?  Seems like they are calling for installing/configuring knowledge, when related to WordPress specifically.

What to expect?",crystalcitygymleader,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/648ezd/give_it_to_me_raw_career_switcher_at_30/,"I decided to make a career change from the restaurant industry into something computer/tech related. During my time, I reached vice leadership positions, namely Executive Sous Chef and Assistant General Manager. It took a long time to wholly accept that restaurant work was no longer for me, especially since it was my choice and I went to school for it. I worked very closely with my superiors (Executive Chefs, General Mangers, Directors, Owners) and ultimately, I did not envy their circumstances. 
 
 
 
So why the computer/tech industry? First, a disclaimer: *I understand a lot of these issues could manifest in any field, please keep in mind I am speaking relative to the industry I came from, which I think makes for fair conclusions below. However, if you feel that I have the wrong impression, let me know!*

(1) I want to do something that meshes better with my personality/traits. Obviously, growing up with computers doesn't guarantee a thing, but I think you guys understand when I say I'm more comfortable at the keyboard than I would be, for example, standing in front of a classroom. Insert nigh worthless anecdotes of being the tech guy/handy with a computer, etc.

(2) Interacting with many different people, especially strangers, on a daily basis drains me more than it should. I can put on the act, but I would rather run a marathon than engage in social situations for double the amount of time. I also despise wearing a hat, ha!

(3) I found it difficult to drive the workforce. As most of you are aware, restaurant workers are not highly compensated. In fact, depending on the operation, they can be the least compensated according to local law. This created a lot of turmoil for me, because I was constantly having to make judgments that I perceived to encroach even further into their quality of life. Thing is, I didn't have a problem with it when I was in their position... but I find it difficult to hold everyone to the same standard, especially when you get to know them and come upon some truly dismal situations. I understand; and a lot of A type personalities will rationalize that this is because restaurant work requires no education, and/or could be the employee's own problem for not figuring their way out or what have you, but I just couldn't detach myself like that. Regrettably, I couldn't think of a way to truly solve the problem within my means, so I left the situation. TLDR: It would be nice to not need to manage people as much.
 
 
 
So, I was wondering if you guys could help me narrow my focus and save me some hard lessons by sharing your own experiences! I think one of my hardest lessons when it came to the restaurant industry was realizing that my degree was not even necessary. You can easily enter the workforce without any experience or education. Good times? Yes. Money poorly spent? I'd say.

First off, I say computer/tech, but I'm not really sure what to focus on... My instinct says I don't want to program, because I had some exposure in high school and it didn't particularly inspire me. It would be cool to work with security, hardware, intelligence, but these are just things that admittedly sound cool and I have no idea what a day in the life is like. I get the feeling that some branches are easier to get into without a bachelor's degree (IT, web development, networking?), while some are almost completely off limits without at least master's degree (engineering, programming?). 

What could I expect with the following choices?

(A) No further education initially, just getting lucky with networking (socially) and landing some low paying/unpaid internship somewhere. Then learning on the job, certifying as necessary, taking courses/going to school in order to ascend.

(B) Community college, some sort of 1-2 year program. Landing some entry level job. Then learning on the job, certifying as necessary, taking courses/going to school in order to ascend.

I didn't put down anything else, because at this point I don't think I have it in me to commit to another 4-6 years of institutionalized education, at least not without getting my foot in the door first. I do have a bachelor's degree in psychology already, in case that could affect my decisions. 

Thanks for your time!

&amp;nbsp;

Bach flips through a series of pages in a large medical textbook.  His eyes wearily scan the words and drift between the paragraphs.  It grows harder and harder to focus on the text and actually read the material.  After a few minutes, he closes the book, tosses it to the side on the bed, and shuts his eyes as lets his head sink into the pillow.  He rubs his eyes and blinks a number of times until his vision clears back up.  He throws himself up to a seat on the bed and spins to place his feet on the floor.  Pulling his back into a stretch, he yawns, stands up, and plods to the door.  Bach looks out the window to see the rain still coming down and opens the door to the hallway.

Bach walks into the large living room and notices Aristespha sitting on the couch, staring a hole through paperwork on the coffee table.  Bach slides over next to the arm of the couch and concentrates his gaze upon the piles of paper with an electronic tablet or two shuffled in between.  Aristespha shakes her head side to side in an attempt to wake up and sits up straighter.  She rubs her long ears and catches sight of Bach out the corner of her eye.  “Oh!  Sorry.  I’m trying to finish up some paperwork.  I should be done in an hour or... so...  Then, we can work on your training and my materials research...”

Bach surveys the scene.  Stacks of paperwork liter the area into roughly organized piles.  There’s a few boxes of receipts and invoices that sit on the floor around the coffee table.   Bach points to a seat cushion on the couch.  “You want help?  After working through that last book, this seems like a nice change of pace.  Feels like I could be somewhat constructive here.”

Aristespha perks a brow and eyes Bach curiously, as she scoots over on the couch.  “Which book?”

Bach carefully slides a pile of papers over and sighs with frustration.  “Greyhawk’s Guide to Magical-Biological Interactions.”

Aristespha cringes and nods in commiseration.  “That’s a rough one to get through.  I burned up one coffee maker keeping myself awake when reading studying it.  But, it does contain the best information I’ve found on that topic.”

Bach shrugs and leans his head over to idly read some random piece of paper.  “Yah, but it’s actually nice to get the official terms for stuff.  Calling everything That Thing was getting old quick.”

Aristespha chuckles to herself, stops as she remembers something, and fishes out a packet of papers from a stack next to her.  “Speaking of official terms, if you could fill out how and where you want your pay, please.”

Bach takes the packet she offers him and flips through it with a bit of confusion.  “Oh.  Um.  Okay.  So, how does this all work out?”

Aristespha smirks with pride, pulls out a tablet from between a pile of papers, and taps commands on the screen.  “That’s right.  I forgot, you never did your internship year.  Well, thankfully, I created a few diagrams a year or so ago when we got together to formalize the financial process.”

She slides the tablet between Bach’s hands, swipes through some diagrams, and selects one to expand to full size.  “Depending on the mission, quest, or contract, the payout goes into our group’s company account with the guild.  We deduct any related expenses, then the money gets distributed evenly to everyone’s individual guild accounts, up to a quota we all agree upon once every few months.  Any excess gets put into another company account that is for shared party expenses, up to a quota.  Anything above this quota at the end of the month, is divided out as a bonus to everyone.”

Bach analyzes the diagrams, zooms in on sections, and watches the various animations of the process on the tablet.  He eventually nods in agreement and hands the tablet back.  “Makes sense to me and seems pretty fair.  Sounds like it avoids a lot of that money drama.”

Aristespha takes a deep breath and exhales with relief from past memories.  “Yes, it does.  Money issues break apart a lot of adventuring groups.  Just ask Dretphi or Cideeda, they’ve got a few stories.”

Bach lifts up a section of paperwork before him and puzzles at Aristespha.  “I hope this is just a backlog of paperwork, because this is might actually be scarier than facing those cyber-zombies.”

Aristespha laughs, passes Bach a pen, and takes one for herself from behind her ear.  “Yes.  Chasing and confronting Noxian put A LOT in the back log.  It’s normally only a few dozen pages of legal documents that amount to a few signatures.  I’ve got most the accounting handled by software applications.  Most of time, the only time consuming part comes from matching receipts and invoices to account transactions.  But, I’ve got logging software on a tablet to help that process.” 

Bach stares at the mass of paper, readies his pen, and pulls a wary grin.  “So, where do you need me to start?”

Aristespha taps the packet with her pen and finds a tablet for Bach to use.  “First, fill out your payment information.  You can use the guild account system if you don’t have a bank account, but they’re not too terribly fancy.  Then, you can use this tablet to catalog receipts and invoices.  It has the better camera for that.”

Bach shifts his attention to the packet and reads a few lines before a thought crosses his mind.  “Hey, just curious.  How much is the monthly individual quota?”

Aristespha leans next to Bach, traces a finger down the page of the packet, and stops next to a numeric amount.  Bach follows the trail of text down to the spot.  His eyes widen, jaw drifts down, and head slowly tilts.  Aristespha grins with satisfaction and returns to her stack of papers.  “Why do you think anyone considers this line of work?  The actual pay can vary.  We’ve had some slow months and you are starting at the end of a month.  But, Sebastian wanted you to have his share for this month.  As a...  How did he put it?  An apology for abducting you and flipping the fucking table of your life.”

Bach blinks, makes a few attempts to form a response, and eventually shrugs with appeasement.  “Ya know.  I’ve now come to full acceptance of that incident and look forward to our future business ventures.”

Aristespha rolls her eyes with smile and circles her finger over a box of receipts at next to her foot.  “Let’s see how you feel after sorting through this box.”

&amp;nbsp;

Bach captures a picture of the last receipt from the box and enters a series of commands into the tablet to associate the receipt with a transaction.  “By the gods, you guys have must have single-handedly kept Pancake Shed in business for the last few years.”

Aristespha twists her mouth and quirks a brow at Bach.  “You find another restaurant that widespread, near every major highway, open all hours, and that takes you as you come with no questions.”

Bach puts a check mark on the last receipt and stuffs it under a rubber band with other receipts.  “Fair enough.  The one in High Alton served as the perfect place to recover from the crazy misadventures I had to rescue Sebastian from.  Their hash brown are really good, too.”

Aristespha places her pen, tablet, and papers down on the coffee tablet and sinks back into the couch.  “Indeed they are.  And Pancake Shed is very accommodating to adventures.  There’s one in Perimeter that lets you order your captive’s food off the children’s menu.  That way bounty hunters can save money on food.”

Bach lifts his upper body away from the tablet and slowly pivots his head to Aristespha.  “That’s...  Interesting.”

Aristespha sways forward to put herself on her feet and stands up.  “A lot of fugitives try to hide out in the Perimeter Weird Zone.  Most are very thankful when a bounty hunter finds them so they can get escorted out.”

She steps around the coffee table, brushes her faded T-shirt off, and guides a number of stray silvery blue hairs over her ears.  “I’m going to make some tea.  Do you want any?”

Bach tidies up his immediate area and carefully pulls himself up to avoid upsetting any nearby piles of paper.  “Uh, sure.  Are we done with this for now?”

Aristespha rotates a carousel of single-serving drink packets on the kitchen counter, plucks two of them from their spots, and loads one into the counter top brewing machine.  “Yes.  It’s not going anywhere, so I’m not too terribly worried.  Thank you for helping to make some progress on that mess.”

Bach settles into a chair at the dining table and looks around aimlessly.  A question finds a place in his mind and he quizzically looks at Aristespha.  “So, you’ve been in a weird zone?  You mentioned Perimeter and the Perimeter Weird Zone.”

Aristespha fits a mug underneath the brewing machine and presses a button.  While the machine hums and water flows inside of it, she ponders a moment.  “Yes.  I’ve been in a few.  They were some of the spots I visited during my research into spirits, sprites, and other such entities.”

This piques Bach interest.  He keeps his attention to Aristespha and watches her reactions.  “So, what do you know of magic in that realm of study?”

She pulls out the spent packet, pitches it into the garbage can, and sets that mug off to the side.  With a quick series of motions, she loads the next packet, hits the button, and slides another mug underneath the machine.  This noticeably distracts Bach and Aristespha smirks smugly.  “Studying at The Grand Library, you learn how run these things as fast as possible.  But, as for spirit magic...  I focused on sensory, communication, and projection types of magic.  Honestly, that’s all I was really interested in.  I know the theory behind the rest of the spirit family of magic.”

Aristespha eyes the mug as it fills and waits for the last drop to hit before taking both mugs in hand to the dining table.  She places a mug in front of Bach and takes a seat across from him.  “I just don’t care for how those spirit mages perform most of their magic.”

Bach puts his fingers through the handle of the mug and lifts it up to his nose for a sniff.  He feels the heat off the brew and lowers it back down on the table.  “What about it don’t you like?”

Aristespha sighs and draws a tight slight frown on her face.  “Most spirit mages are absolute ASSHOLES to all those entities.”

Bach snaps to attention and focuses on Aristespha.  “Really?!”

She nods, lifts her mug to her mouth, and sips a bit of tea before lowering it back down.  “I could go on for hours about it.  They coerce, con, and manipulate spirits to do their bidding in exchange for some magical energy.  Now, the smarter spirit types will negotiate up front, but the simpler ones are lucky to get anything after getting controlled by spells.  Thankfully, there’s a growing movement towards spirit magic that is far friendlier.  I actually spent a week with the teacher that sparked it.”

Bach sits down in his chair and ponders with bewilderment toiling on his face.  “Wow.  That’s.  Surprising.  I’ve met a few spirit mages, but I didn’t realize that what they were doing.  Never had any of the same classes with them after the first year.”

Aristespha shakes her head and stares down at her cup of tea.  She smiles kindly.  “I really didn’t want anything to do with spirit magic after learning that, but meeting that teacher changed my mind.  His name is Harold Marcus.  A simple, older looking man on the outside that holds the favors of thousands of spirits, sprites, daemons, and ghosts.  He keeps to a forest out in the wilds of some unclaimed territory.”

She lifts the mug to her lips, drinks a moderate sum, and stares off distantly.  “That is the most beautiful forest I’ve ever been in.  The density of spirits inhabiting that area is a magnitude of order greater than anywhere else.  It actually affects the biology of the flora and fauna out there.  As for Harold, he is very laid back and kind man.  I learned much from him.  But, he always summed up his lessons to two things.”

Bach breaks from listening and remembers to actually drink some of his tea.  “What were those?”

Aristespha snorts with a humoring grin and looks at Bach.  “Ask nicely and be reasonable.”

Bach guides the thoughts in his head with his eyes and eventually shrugs.  “I guess that makes sense.  Seems to work for him.”

Aristespha takes a deep breath in and tenses her voice.  “It does.  His resident Elder Geist told me that’s why it lives there.”

Bach eyes slam wide open and his jaw hits the table.  He barely maintains enough cognizance to gently place his mug on the table and keep the tea from dribbling out of his mouth.  “Uh.  Eh.  Hu-  What?!  You mean the five meter tall, creature formed of pure elder energy, that has been been around since after the first cataclysm?”

Aristespha takes a long sip of her tea and meets the shocked gaze of Bach.  After she finishes, she places the mug back down on the table, and cracks a nervous little smile as she remembers.  “Yes.  It was my last day there.  I was talking to Harold.  It came over.  Sat down next to me.  Apologized for not meeting with me sooner, as it took it a while for it to go through its memories.  It translated some audio transcripts I had played for Harold.  And then, it showed me the location, on my tablet’s map, of an ancient ruin that housed a library and created a passcard for me to use to get in.  It wished me well, said it would see me again in the future, and left.”

Bach gawks in awe at Aristespha as she exhales in an attempt to calm herself.  He finally blinks and recovers enough to form words again.  “What did Harold do?”

She playfully sneers as she curls an upper lip.  “Oh, just absolutely fucking fail at holding back his laughter as I was scared for my very existence.”

&amp;nbsp;

The morning sun lights the rural area.  The two lane road running through the country side dries in the growing heat of the sun.  Patches of the land still pool with water from the two days of rain before, but most the excess finds its way to the drainage ways and the nearby stream.  The garage door on the ranch style house is open.  Sounds of mechanical work echo from inside out into the vicinity.  Bach tightens a frame bolt with a wrench and removes the wrench after the last twist on the bolt.  He stands back to look at his side-car motorcycle.  Now the motorcycle shines with the dirt of Bach’s escape attempt wiped away.  No dents remain with the repairs from early this morning.  The motorcycle looks better than when Bach originally bought it.

“Sweet machine you got there, bro.”

Bach turns around to see Sebastian hovering through the door leading inside the house.  “Oh, yah.  Cleaned it up and checked everything.  Should be good for a ride, man.”

Sebastian flies over the vehicle and appreciates it from different angles.  “A lot nicer to look at when you aren’t riding the handle bars.”

Bach gives single laugh and shakes his head at Sebastian.  “Well, it’s not like I gave you that long to take it in.”

Sebastian eyes his brother with smug smirk and rolls his eyes.  His ethereal form lightens and his expression softens.  “Hey.  Thanks for saving everyone.  It’s been rough getting used to just being an over-glorified cheerleader slash doomsayer, and mostly feeling useless.  It could have gone really bad down there, but you delivered us the leverage we needed to make the best happen.”

Bach rubs the back of his neck and sheepishly shifts his shoulders up and down.  “Man.  I couldn’t just let that happen to anyone and not do something.  But, I’ve got to be honest...”

He turns his head to Sebastian gritting his teeth and complete lack of confidence.  “I was totally pulling that shit completely out of my ass!  I knew the theory.  I’d imagined a few designs in the past.  But...  That was the first time I’ve ever implemented an EMP bomb of all things!  That was ridiculously complicated piece of machinery, I just-”

Bach drags his hands through his hair and walks towards the garage door with worry in each footstep.  “Holy shit!  I mean it’s great that it worked and we got out, but-  Dammit!  It could have gone so wrong!  If the blast wasn’t enough, if they were fully insulated, or even if they just took cover in broom closet-  I just-  Well-  I-   FUCK!!  Two weeks ago I was just happy enough to get out of bed and read a decent story on an Aethernet forum!”

Bach holds his half-open hands shakily out in front of him and his eyes shift between the bullet points of his rant.  “Somehow in less than two weeks, I gone from living in an over-glorified shack seen as a failure of a mage to somehow resuming our dream of adventuring together!  I’m all for getting my life back on track, but it feels like I’ve been strapped to the front of a runaway train!  I try to keep focus on the many positives.  But, I can’t shake these feelings I’m setting everyone up for disappointment... And...  And...”

He lets his arms go limp and flop to his sides as he tries to find a moment serenity in the peaceful day outside.  Sebastian looks to the floor with each step to Bach, shaking his head with a knowing smile.  He circles around in front of Bach and waits until his brother realizes he’s there.  “Good.  You’ve gotten to the freak out and awareness stage.  I was getting worried.”

Bach refocuses his eyes on Sebastian with a dumbfounded expression.  “W-what?  This is... Normal?”

Sebastian doubles over laughing with an ethereal echo and holds a hand up to Bach.  “Oh, gods yes!  It happens to any sane adventurer!  In fact, most of the veterans get worried when they think someone isn’t freaking out or worried or not aware of how fucked-up their profession is!”

Bach blinks as his gaze drifts around the area.  He follows his gaze and walks around the driveway in thought.  Sebastian keeps a close hover by Bach.  Eventually, Bach halts in place and shifts his view of the world to Sebastian.  “So you went through this, too?”

Sebastian nods with a ghostly snort.  “Yes.  Yes, I did.  I tried to hide it from the group I interned with because I was trying to impress them.  We were camping out in these woods up in the Southern Crags near High Alton clearing out this invasive species of dire rat.  I volunteered for firewood gathering duty right off the bat and did it for a week.  I didn’t realize it, but they were totally expecting me to freak out after the first few days of fighting these things.  Totally nasty, angry things.  The ranger finally tracked me when I left the camp for firewood and figured out why I was so willing to do firewood duty.”

Bach quirks a brow and darts his eyes side to side before settling back on Sebastian.  “Which was?”

Sebastian throws his hands up to the sides and exaggerates a comical shrug.  “Oh you know.  Cursing the job, party members, school, the world, and so on...   All the while chopping at trees like an ax murderer with blue balls.”

He pauses his story for a moment as his mind stumbles upon a random tidbit.  “By the way, I so need to show you how to throw an ax if you don’t already know.  Learned the basics from that ranger, after she enjoyed watching me rant and rave.”

Bach narrows his eyes at Sebastian, figuratively staring right through him...  And literally to an extent.  Sebastian matches Bach’s scrutiny and places his hands on his sides.  “What?  Why are you-”  His eyes search his mind and he relaxes his posture.  His eyes widen and a goofy, unapologetic grin sneaks onto his face.  A few attempts at words fall out his mouth and he put his hands behind his head.  “Well, you know.  She made a really good point about not letting such youthful energy go to waste.”

Bach lifts his head up to the skies, rolls his eyes hard, and settles his face into the palm of his hand.  He slowly slides his hand down off his face and just shakes his head at Sebastian.  “I shouldn’t be surprised.  Especially, after all those times I had rescue you.”

Sebastian smirks and jokingly shakes a finger at Bach.  “Hey!  I’m trying to pay you back for all those times.  You feeling any better?”

Bach lifts his shoulders and chest up with a breath of air in and relaxes them back down with an exhale.  “A bit.  If I am going insane, at least I’m on schedule which somehow makes it normal.  Right?”

Sebastian floats directly next and presents an honest and genuine smile and tone.  “Listen.  We do good work for good reasons to achieve good things.  But, that doesn’t change the fact that what we are doing ranges from being a bit fucked up to really fucked up.”

He stares directly into Bach’s eyes.  “It’s normal to feel this is insane.  It’s insane to feel this is normal.”

Bach and Sebastian stare at each other for a minute.  Sebastian waits as Bach’s mind processes everything.  Bach’s mouth moves and forms words as determination hints unto his face.  “Yah, it’s insane and fucked up when you break it down.  But... Everyone got out safe and we kept those cybernetic monsters from getting loose.”

Sebastian nods with pride and steps back with satisfaction.  “And that’s what you have to focus on.  It’s a hard balance between striving for the best outcome and keeping aware of what it is you actually do.  But, that’s a balance you want to maintain.  I’ve seen what happens when it goes too far one way or another.”

Bach scans around the front yard area and sighs.  He takes in the nice sunny day and gazes off across the road into the large open field.  Sebastian traces his eyes and stares off into the same distance.  “Too nice of a day for any more heavy shit, bro.”

Bach simply nods.  “Yah.  I’m feeling okay for now, bro.  Thanks for the talk.  By the way, what’s everyone else up to?”

Sebastian tilts his head to the side and flips through recent memory.  “I think Sotalia and Aristespha were analyzing the magical material stuff you made yesterday.”

Bach twists his mouth into an unamused frown.  “Not going in there for awhile.  Already feel like enough of a lab rat for them.”

Sebastian directs a thumb towards the side of the house with a scheming glint to his eyes.  “Dretphi and Cideeda are sorting through all the random melee weapons we’ve picked up-”

Bach swiftly moves towards the side of house with an arm out ahead to signal Sebastian.  “Sold!  Sounds like fun to me!”

&amp;nbsp;

Aristespha slides a box of paper with her foot out of the way of the recliner and off to a corner of the room.  She swiftly glides into the recliner, pulls the handle for the foot rest, and spreads a blanket over her.  “We’ve got about five minutes or so.  Last week’s rerun is finishing up.”

Dretphi switches out the bowl under the spout of the hot air popcorn popper with another and hands Bach the popcorn filled bowl.  He carefully escorts the two in his hands over to the coffee table.  Sebastian flies through the sliding glass door and drifts to Aristespha’s side.  She wraps herself tighter in the blanket and gives a curious gaze to Sebastian.  “Where have you been, Sebastian?”

Sebastian points a thumb out the sliding glass door and pulls his mouth to the side with intrigue.  “I saw some lights coming from a house on the big plot diagonal to us.  First time I’ve ever seen activity over there.”

Aristespha settles deeper into the cushions of the recliner and suggests to Sebastian, “Probably the property management company getting it ready for some new renters.”

Sebastian hovers closer to Aristespha and directs his attention towards the television.  “That makes sense.  I couldn’t get close enough to make out anything.  But apart from that, not much else is happening in the neighborhood.”

Bach lowers a bowl of popcorn near to Aristespha.  She happily lifts her hands underneath the blanket and Bach places the bowl right in the middle of where she indicates.  Bach drops off the other bowl on the coffee table.  Aristespha checks to see if anyone is paying attention to her.  She smiles mischievously, makes routine hand gestures underneath the blanket, and murmurs incantations.  Violet briefly flickers in her eyes and a small quantity of popcorn drifts from the bowl into her mouth.  As she crunches down on the popcorn, she catches the mock judgmental glare of Sebastian.  “Whut?”

Sebastian shakes his head as he sways it away back to face the television.  Aristespha rolls her eyes and another small grouping of popcorn leaves the bowl.  “Oh please.  You’d do it, too.”

Bach moves next to Dretphi and she immediately switches out another bowl under the popcorn popper.  She gives the freshly full bowl to Bach to hold.  Cideeda walks through the hallway archway and leaps onto the couch spot next to an arm and the bowl of popcorn on the coffee table.  The last of the popcorn flies out of the popper.  Both Dretphi and Bach carry a bowl each from the kitchen into the living room.  Dretphi shuffles between the coffee table and couch into the middle spot of the couch.   Bach lines up to get between the coffee table and couch.

“Hey Bach!”

Bach freezes, stands up right, and pivots in place towards the hallway archway.  He sees nothing around there, but briefly feels fast movement directly behind him.  Immediately following, he hears sounds of someone scrambling over a couch arm into the last seat on the couch.  Bach turns back around.  Sotalia slowly stretches her legs onto her part of the coffee table, settles into the cushions, puts her arms behind her head, and grins with smug self-satisfaction.  “Too bad.  I guess you’ll just have to get your own seat.”

Bach narrows his eyes at Sotalia.  Everyone else quietly watches the situation unfold.  Sotalia maintains  her smug attitude as she gently twists into the cushions more, with a suggestive smile.  Bach stares at her for a few moments, then a smirk forms.  The smirk soon morphs into a growing grin and he focuses his gaze at Sotalia.  “Well...  I guess I will.”

Bach moves the bowl of popcorn into another hand and he raises the free hand up.  A blue glow illuminates his eyes.  Sotalia’s smug attitude falls flat as her eyes widen and her body tenses.  Everyone else holds their collective breaths.  Bach’s hand flips over and drops down to stop just above the height of the couch.  A framework of magical energy flows out from Bach’s hand and reaches down to the floor.  Within seconds, the framework fills in to reveal a structure.  The structure arranges itself and shifts as parts materialize into existence.  In under a minute, a stabilized energy deck chair solidifies completely with translucent cushioning material in all the right places.  Without saying another word, Bach lays into the chair, magically adjusts it, and takes a handful of popcorn.  

Sotalia gawks at the new chair.  Dretphi suppresses and hides with a hand a laugh.  Cideeda gives a quick thumbs up to Bach.  Both Sebastian and Aristespha nod with approval.  The television blares out the iconic intro music for the Next Adventurers of Nexus.

&amp;nbsp;

“With that recap out of the way ladies and gentlemen, let’s see what our adventurers were up!”

The screen cuts to a shot of Chad Bosch.  He sits by himself in a room for individual interviews that’s decorated with simple chair, background, and some lighting.  “We decided to pursue a contract to investigate an old military facility where there may have been some recent activity.  As the leader, I believe it would be the perfect mission to test team cohesion.  But first, we needed to get supplies and equipment.”

Clips and segments showcase the adventurers shopping.  A video journal segment shows Deedri uncomfortably sitting the individual interview room.  “Well, I’ve only done small medical supplies orders for myself.  I never had to get everything for a whole team!  It took a lot longer than I expected.  But, the people at the pharmacy were really nice and understanding!  Unfortunately...  There was this one Evuukian woman.  She didn’t seem happy.  I overheard her grumbling and-”

A piece of paper finds its way into Deedri’s hands and she looks at it with confusion.  “What is this?”

From off camera a woman’s voice speaks, “That’s a translation of what that woman said.”

Deedri’s eyes follow each sentence.  Each line distresses her a little more, until she covers her open mouth in shock.  Finally, she grabs hold of the bell on the collar around her neck, causing a muffled ring.  “She wanted to put my bell WHERE?!”

Everyone in the living room drifts their eyes to Aristespha as she crosses her arms.  She returns an unamused and unapologetic glance.  “I’m not sorry.”

Another clip shows Trakenthin trying for Dretphi’s attention and ultimately getting denied by the group arriving.  Trakenthin watches from the distance carefully and notices Dretphi giving a warm smile to Bach.  Trakenthin focuses a sneering glare right at the back of Bach’s head.  The chair Bach sits in somehow grows a bit uncomfortable witnessing Trakenthin crack his knuckles.

The next clip shows Tassilda posing for the camera and presenting her choice goods...  and books.  Through the narrow gaps between the tops of books and shelves, Sotalia, Bach, and Cideeda occasionally show up in frame of the shot.  A few more shopping segments play out before a cut to the adventurers meeting together and planning for the mission.  The show fades to the next day, with an outside shot of the Amaranth Dining House.  A swipe cut inside, Chad walks and talks to the camera.  He takes time to greet the soldiers and then focus turns towards Aristespha, Bach, Cideeda, Dretphi, and Sotalia sitting at their table.  The video playback hangs on the group to almost a dramatic freeze frame, with different angles of the group and quick shots of each member.  Unease flows through the living room.

Chad’s voice cuts mid way into the scene with a hard cut over to Chad in the individual interview room.  “This group.  I got a strange feeling about this group.  There was something about them I couldn’t quite put my finger on.”

Tassilda’s voice interrupts an individual shot of Sotalia.  “I’ve had to deal with her kind before...”

Sotalia sneers and narrows her eyes at the screen.  “MY kind?  That BITCH.”

The screen shows Tassilda in the interview room, lounging with a suggestive pose.  She takes in a deep breath and exaggerates her chest movement with a sultry smile.  “She’s of the ilk that try, often in vain, to tap into the magic potential of their ancestry.  But, unfortunately for them...  And especially for her...  Their distance from their Emin ancestors is often too far to produce any productive results.”

Sotalia’s eye twitches in confined anger and both Bach and Aristespha carefully watch for signs of it developing into something further.  The show cuts to a clip of Aristespha before switching to Mordoran.  He calmly sits in the interview chair, arms stretching behind his head and a smug idle smirk on his face.  “I don’t know everyone’s problem is.  I thought the Evuukian was pretty hot.  Certainly didn’t mind watching her walk away when they left the restaurant.  I wonder if she’s spoken for.”

Sebastian’s normal calm blue-white ghostly form grows hints of small flame-like distortions around the edges.  A clip plays back Cideeda awkwardly waving to Deedri.  Cideeda cringes and sinks into the couch.  “Dammit, they used that clip.”

Deedri sits in the interview chair and excitedly shakes.  “There was another Fvalian!  She seems really nice and even waved at me!  I hope I get a chance to talk to her in the future!”

Cideeda views the screen in abject horror at the very concept of interacting with that creature.  She slowly shakes her head and dramatically mouths the word, “No.”

A video clip with Dretphi comes up on the screen.  After a few moments, it cuts to Trakenthin.  He silently stares stoically to some point off camera.  The camera shifts and zooms on Trakenthin as gives a dismissive snort, then the show cuts to another segment.  Dretphi groans to herself, places her face into her palm, and breathes a hard sigh.

The show highlights some footage of Bach at the restaurant.  Instead of a single member reaction, each member chimes in a fast series of bits.  Chad holds his nose high and vents out his arrogance.  “Well, I guess it’s nice they’re helping out a drop out get back on the right path.”

Tassilda quirks brow and rolls her eyes.  “I guess they thought they needed a token human.”

Deedri searches overhead in her mind while tapping a finger on her lips.  She then shrugs.  “I guess he seems okay.  What does he do?”

Mordoran’s attention lies elsewhere.  A female voice coughs a few times and Mordoran snaps his head back to the camera.  He squints his eyes at something off camera.  “Huh?  Oh.  Um?  Whatever.”

Finally, Trakenthin crosses his arms, narrows his eyes with splinters of anger, gusts in air through his nose with a rattle, and spits a wad of phlegm onto the floor.  Bach’s jaw rests on the floor.  He sits leaning forward, face in shock, and his arms to the sides.  “THE FUCK WAS THAT?!”

“Looks like our Adventurers may have some friendly competition... or not!  Who are these people?  Why are they here?  And more importantly...  What did they do NEXT!?  All will be answered after we return from break!”

The music drops into a dramatic tone and the video clips fade in.  Chad sits in the interview chair with disgust and resentment.  “We hit a snag.  That’s to be expected with any adventure.  We were regrouping and getting ready to make the rescue and be heroes.  Then...  They showed up.  Strangely, right at THE perfect time.”

The show transitions to another clip with Tassilda.  She crosses her arms and pouts defiantly.  “They kept us away.  We never got a chance to go back in there.  How DARE they take that away from us!”

There’s a final clip before the commercials of the adventurers gathered around a table complaining back and forth, and getting upset and yelling at each other.

Sotalia shoots up from the couch, steps out behind the coffee table, and marches over to the kitchen.  She opens the cabinet above to reveal a variety of different glassware.  She opens some doors below the counter top and retrieves multiple bottles of alcoholic beverages.  She straightens up and wryly smirks to everyone in the living room.  “So.  Raise your hand, if you want a drink.”

Hands go up for everyone, including Sebastian.  This garners the attention of everyone else and he shrugs.  “I know.  But, I can still want one.”

Aristespha breaks off her glance with Sebastian and turns her head towards the kitchen bar.  As she changes her view, she notices a new alert on one of her tablets.  She grabs hold of the tablet, props it up on her lap, and taps in a password.  Flipping through the notification and alerts, a message from the local guild offices draws her attention.  She opens the message and reads the first few lines.  Her head pulls back in confusion and then she immediately leans close to the screen to carefully read each word.  Sotalia gets out some glasses and surveys the resources she has available.  “Okay, I mix a few good one with these.  What do you want, Aristespha?”

Aristespha continues to run her eyes over the words on the message.  The perplexed expression on her face and lack of awareness quickly captures the attention of everybody else.  She stops and returns to reality as everyone stares curiously at her.  “We just got a message from the local guild office.  Someone just direct bid an existing contract to us.”

&amp;nbsp;

Cideeda jams a claw into the soft plastic power button of the television remote when another segment of Deedri gushing over seeing another Fvalian leading a group.  She tosses the remote onto the couch, turns to walk to the dining table and shudders in uncomfortable disgust.  “Creepy.”

Aristespha picks up the whiskey glass of dark amber liquor and calmly sips a bit.  She directs her voice towards Bach, sitting across at the table.  “It’s not unusual for different patrons to all bid on the same contract.  In fact, that sometimes helps a common problem get the best group to solve it.”

Sotalia sits back, stirs the mixed drink contents of her glass, and gestures a hand out.  “Say a town has a bandit problem.  At first, the one merchant that ran into them might set an initial price.  Then later as the bandits harass the town, other people with some money will put forth more into the overall pot.  Eventually, it gets good enough that a decent team takes it gets it done right, rather than a desperate group attempting it and fouling it up.”

Aristespha nods, holds a finger up, and slowly points down at the tablet in front of her.  “But, what can also happen is that a patron can put in a bid with stipulations.  Usually, it’s for contract conditions on bounty hunting with the payout difference between the target being dead or alive.  It also can be for limiting groups with specific skills sets or conduct conditions.  Bids to a specific group is uncommon.”

Cideeda settles into her seat, claws the cap off of her bottle of beer, and shakes her head in bewilderment.  “A specific group with an unpublished ID number is...  RARE.”

Sebastian’s ethereal self drifts next to Aristespha, his eyes tracing text on the tablet.  He takes a moment to appreciate the aroma from Aristespha’s whiskey glass and then returns his focus to Bach.  “Most our families know our team’s ID number.  And, we’ve gotten direct work by references and even contracts forwarded our way.  Some really good ones, too.”

Sebastian directs Bach’s attention to Dretphi.  She nods as she holds her large bottle of cider with both hands.  “My birth father maintains Grath military connections.  There were contracts we were allowed.  Those contracts were hidden from the public.”

Aristespha tilts another small amount of her drink into her mouth, exhales, and narrows her eyes at the tablet screen.  “But...  A direct bid to an unpublished ID number for a two month old contract that only paid pittance to what they were offering before.   From a patron, undisclosed, with an ID number I don’t recognize.”

The group around the table ponder into their own thoughts about the situation at hand.  Bach abruptly lifts his head up and twists his upper body to look at the television.  “And, we got sent the job right after we were on national TV.  I bet someone recognized you guys.”

Dretphi puzzles at Aristespha and drops her eyes at the tablet.  “What IS the job?”

Aristespha shrugs and shakes her head baffled.  “Ah.  It’s to investigate some odd disturbances in a forest reserve an hour’s travel from here.  No major threats or problems listed.  It just some strange activity has been scaring people away when they travel, camp, or visit the area.  I really wish there was more to say.  The local park service put a really low bid initially, and now it’s a very high sum.”

Aristespha gently guides the tablet to the middle of the table.  The payout number displays prominently on the screen.  Everyone else leans in together and their faces express different degrees of interest and surprise.  Aristespha sits back in her seat and waits for everyone to process the amount.  “So, should we investigate?  I’m personally intrigued.”

Sotalia drinks a bit from her glass and shrugs with amusement.  “Sure!  If they want to pay us that much to wander around a damn forest, that’s fine with me.”

Cideeda quirks a brow and gently scratches her chin.  “It’s weird how we got this.  But, it’s not the first time.  There’s more to this, but for that amount I’m willing to take a look.”

Dretphi nods with agreement.  Bach watches everyone’s reaction and slowly nods, too.  “I’ve got no objections.  If it’s not another cyber-zombie den, I can work with it.”  

Sebastian grins proudly and claps his hands together.  “Sounds good.  If tomorrow is good, let’s do it.  So, let’s find something else to watch on the TV and get a good night’s rest.”"

I'm out of my depth and I need a back up plan.,PM_ME_YOUR_MESSAGES_,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/648hjs/hi_rsysadmin_im_out_of_my_depth_and_i_need_a_back/,"Hi all. To put into perspective I'm in my early 20's, recently graduated. I interned with a company and got offered a sysadmin position after about 6 months. I like doing my job a lot, and every day I feel like I learn a TON of stuff, which is cool. However, I know I'm totally unqualified for this job and the moment that the ranks start filling back up I'm probably on the chopping block. I get paid a lot for my location (45k, midwest) so I'm under the belief that when they can get someone more qualified, they will probably have me train someone more experienced and let me go. After I got my sysadmin job they fired my predecessor after 1 month and gave me everything he has, which leads me to believe they'll drop me as soon as they can.

Frankly speaking I'm totally OK with this because I feel like I made a good amount of money here and learned a lot so it just felt like an overpaid internship experience and I can put that I was a sys admin for 8+ months on my resume.

So where do I go from here if I get fired? Should I try to quit before I see the clock running out? What looks better for when I need to find a new job?

And what do I do? I really enjoy the physical layer of my job. Installing appliances in DC, cameras, workstations, replacing old hardware in tech closets, etc. On the sit down side of it I do stuff like SCCM, SCOM, ESXI/VM management of remote hosts, MDM admin, etc. I also enjoy networking but I'm completely unqualified and I get zero experience at my current job for it.

I know only I can answer the latter question, but basically I want to know what kind of jobs I should look. Do I need to go back to interning or can I land another sysadmin position? Or maybe it's just IT help desk in my future?

Thanks!"

I had no internships, and one decent Android application that I made for fun getting ~ 10 downloads a day. I've always loved programming, and I thought finding a job was going to be 'easy'. It wasn't.

I was lucky enough to be introduced to a google recruiter at a Halloween party, and this is when my job hunt got more serious (after getting through a couple phone interviews with other companies in the summer, but not going to onsites). I had a great phone interview with google, and did an onsite and didn't get to host matching. Then 3 months later they fly me to california for another onsite. No offer there either. Between that time I had about 5 other onsites with medium sized firms in Seattle. All got to onsites from the phone interview, and all failed. I needed help. I enlisted the help of a tech-family member, and we beefed up my linkedin. My app started getting 200 downloads a day, and making some money. Around this time I got turned down for a 50k/yr java programming position (java is my 'specialty', or, strongest skill). 

I was crushed. I thought I nailed the interview. I couldn't even get a 50k a year job in Seattle that I was referred for.

I had one last in, for an interview at Amazon. Throughout this whole time I had always been programming and studying. The google interviews helped stress-test me a bunch. So I just focused on people skills for this interview. I dressed really nice, and had a relaxed demeanor about me. This was January of this year, and I got the offer. Just months earlier I was crushed. Over and over, for jobs that would pay less than half of what I make now, I was deemed 'not good enough'.

And now, I love my team, my job, I'm challenged every day and I get to program in java. I almost gave up - I wanted to curl up in a ball at times. But I kept pounding away. Now I make just shy of 140k, I'm 24 years old, and I had a 2.4 GPA in college, and a DUI. And I love programming; the love is what got me to where I am.

So for those of you who are getting turned down for crap positions, and want to resign - don't. Keep pounding. You've got this far, and you are valuable. You just need to have one awesome interview - that is all it takes.

Good luck out there new grads, bootcampers, and self-taught individuals who are losing hope. The way people at my company talk about 'good' programmers - they're dying for them to accept the offers. So just get one good interview, and your life can change. Just don't forget to relax and laugh a little!"

Hi everybody,

Like the title says, just another American with a dream to live in Germany and a sob story to go with it. 

A little backstory: I'm 27 years old, and love German culture. I used to live in Heidelberg when my brother was stationed there with the US army in 2002. I moved back for a little through an internship in 2012 but it was a short term thing right after University.

My degree is in Interpersonal/Organizational Communication with a minor in Marketing.

I've got enough money saved up to last me two years while I study. The only thing that is causing me a bit of anxiety is that due to personal reasons when I was doing my undergrad my grades suffered due to things beyond my control. My final GPA ended up being pretty low. 2.488, which I believe to be a 3 with the German conversion? I've done my research, browsed through the DAAD site countless times to see if perhaps there has been a program I missed. But it seems that not only is my GPA working against me, so is what I majored in. It seems most international programs are either IT/Program/Computer Science related or Management. I've seen a few options in media studies in some rural cities that I am considering as well. But most of the programs if they don't seem to have a GPA requirement, then they don't seem to accept Majors outside of STEM. 

I've settled on following options, and I'm all set up with UNI-assist: 

International Master/PHD NUTRITIONAL. CLINICAL EXERCISE
Uni of POTSDAM

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT.
Hochschule für Wirtschaft und Recht Berlin
Department of Business and Economics

Master International Media Cultural Work (IMC) • Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences • Dieburg

International Management • University of Applied Sciences for Technology and Business Saarland • Saarbrücken

Master of Science in International Business &amp; Economics.
Hohenheim/Stuttgart

Masters in International Business Studies
FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg

TU MUNICH 
MASTERS IN MANAGEMENT 


ILMENAU Uni of Technology Media and Communication Studies


Heilbron University:
International business and mgmt

I really wanted the opportunity to study in Koln but the programs I wanted to apply to flat out told me I wouldn't get in due to their admission requirements. I missed the deadline for the one program I really would've been interested in Hamburg. And now I'm not so sure that I'll get anything in the Berlin area which is my favorite :(. I send out the first batch of applications on Monday, so wish me luck...

Basically hear are my questions:

1. Do you think I have any hope getting into any of the schools that I mentioned here? Clearly I really want this. And getting new copies of my diploma and transcripts from my school for each application is not exactly cheap. But I'm trying to cast a giant net and see who bites. Are the requirements as strict from one school to another? Should I even bother applying for a school like TU Munich, which I hear is really competitive?

2. Do any of you have any program/school recommendations that I may have overlooked? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Especially in the Berlin or Koln areas. I don't mind if its some random location in the middle of nowhere if at least the program is a good one. 

3. Are there any options perhaps outside of Germany that you may know of? 

4. If its unlikely I will get into school over there, what are the chances that someone with my degree and a solid couple years of work experience will be able to help me find employment over there?

Thank you to anyone who read the whole thing. Any thoughts or feedback would be of great help to me. 

(Bonus question: Do you think they would accept an American style resume? I saw that some want a tabular CV but I honestly don't even know how to build a CV in that format. The resume I have currently is really solid.) 

PS: I'm 28% fluent in German on duolingo lol. I'm studying every day. I'm still in beginner/intermediate mode but I can definitely understand a LOT. But I don't trust its good enough to take a fully German masters, which I know severely limits my options.

649vny,3,2017-04-08,Taking a second degree for CS. How do I make the wait for the next graduation as painless as possible?,somecsthrw1294,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/649vny/taking_a_second_degree_for_cs_how_do_i_make_the/,"I'm considering biting the bullet and going back to college for a CS degree. 

**The tl;dr is:** *This is not a career switch scenario, but more of a career has flatlined and needs to be revived scenario. I'm deciding to go back to college for CS 10 years after my last graduation to become more employable and not fall into the trap of poorly following industry trends.*

Despite having several years of web dev experience, I have found myself unemployed for the longest time since my *first ever job*. I have been hit with a big reality check.

Reasons that contributed to current career problems:

* Slow growth in career, higher expectations from jobs but having ""junior"" appearance 
* Poor opportunities to follow industry trends
* Employment gaps, leading to greedy career path of needing to take the first job offered
* Not having a professional network I can easily rely on for jobs

I want to expand my options for careers and networking, so I'm decided I want to go back to school for the fall semester.

*So first: I'm not interested in bootcamps. I want to be viewed as a CS person that engineers problems, not simply as a web programmer. Besides I want to do more interesting work than CRUD.*

*Bachelors vs. masters degree.* Aside from number of semesters, are there other major differences between the master's? Will I be missing out on certain kinds of jobs by choosing a MS instead of a BS? 

*Getting back to doing relevant work ASAP.* Even though I have already been out of the workforce for over a year, I'd still like to get back into it somehow as soon as I can. That's what the question in the title comes from. Can I get into doing some programming work while I'm still in school? Are internships even a thing for freshmen and sophomore students? 

As for how long I have been in the web dev career, I graduated with my last degree at 26 and going to turn 35 this year. Already that may put me out of being a ""traditional"" CS grad. Fortunately I look younger for my age, more in my mid-late 20s. "

I need some advice on immigrating to the Czech Republic. I hold a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from a US university. I have 3 years of work experience in the Industrial Automation field (primarily PLC's &amp; robotics) + additional internship and research experience. Currently working in the US on a student visa, using up my OPT. Even though my company is applying for the third time for my H1B visa, I am not really counting on getting it. I have above $25K in savings and additional money in retirement accounts. 
I have always wanted to live in Prague, but I am not to sure how to go about making the move, especially considering I have an Indian passport. I have not lived in India for over 10 years. I used to live in Kazakhstan before moving to the US. Anyone here with an Indian passport working and living in CZ? Do I have to first find a job to enter the country, or is there a way for me to relocate on a visa and then job search? Any advise on making the move would be greatly appreciated. 

Besides English I also speak Russian, and I would like to learn Czech. Any suggestions on good online resources for learning the language?

As the title says I'm a Applied Math major CS Minor at a somewhat well known state school with a good CS program and Applied Math program. 

I want to look for jobs as a software engineer when I graduate and the CS Minor provides me with a lot of practical and core classes - Analysis of Algorithms, Software Engineering, Operating Systems, Systems Programming etc. 

However, I do have the opportunity to take a pre requisite class during the summer and if I succeed I can enter in the CS program at my school. 

If I do so I'm set back to graduate 1 semester later than if I were to just finish my current track, but I do get to have a CS major. 

I'm looking towards the Embedded World too, and if I were to stick with the Applied Math major and CS minor, I can take summer courses that would be beneficial to me applying for internships for the Summer of 2018

I've checked out a bunch of other threads where Applied Math's can get a job as a software developer still, but is it any different if I get a CS Minor and go into the Embedded field? I read that it's a lot harder and might even require some EE knowledge. 

Would I have more of an edge if I did get into my CS program and finished with a CS degree even though I still learn the core things in the minor? 

Thank you.

Also I am single, with no kids.

So I'm picking two schools for a possible BS in CS... My alma mater which is UIC, or to UIUC.

UIUC has a much better science program, but it's in a college town in bumfuck nowhere. Not a lot of job choices there until you graduate when it starts to pay off. (Or maybe I can intern at an earlier year given my past experience?)

Has anyone lived in a college town attending college in their 30s or later? Would you recommend it?"

I was hoping for a summer one, but I took this one and went to school part time.
It turns out that I need to actually take a summer class or I would push back my graduation. It's complicated because I have no idea if I will be retained for the summer or not.

For the most part I like the internship. The work is kinda tedious and boring, but not too hard. Why do I not know if I will be retained for the summer? I have gotten zero feedback from anyone about anything. I have no clue whether I am doing a good job or a bad job. I try to do a good job. What makes it even harder to tell is that the other intern looked openly lackadaisical most of the time, spending more time on his phone then working, and he basically got moved into a bigger, more important role. Meanwhile, I would work my butt off and I never had anything said to me, really. The difference between me and him, though, is he is graduated and I am not.

I guess I wouldn't mind walking away from the internship. There are some things I don't like about the place. There are many tribal rules, and people are not very good at explaining things. You more or less have to learn on your own. Also, the guy I am an intern for is not really there for me on anything. What I mean is that if I have an issue with something, and I email him, he rarely responds. Even any other question, he rarely responds, and I am left hanging. I'm the type of person who likes things resolved, and when he says he will take a look at something, when I have to actually go to his office and talk to him, he never gets back to me. I never know if the problem is fixed or not.

Also, sometimes the company pushes me into working extra hours. For example, when I started, they asked if O wanted to work 60 hours. Uhm, no I take classes at night, and they know that. The one week, they pretty much made me work 60 hours when I had an 2 exams that week. I gave them what I could work, but they kind of just scrapped it. When I interviewed, they told me 35-40 hours a week, not 60.
How do I approach this situation? I have to take this summer class. Do I just ask if I am staying over the summer or not? Is it bad if I don't? I tried to do my best."

I've got a good data mining/NLP related internship for the summer and might also intern at a big 4 company in the fall. I can graduate on time if I do the fall internship or a semester early otherwise. I've got a GPA ~3.8 and have done good in all CS classes. But I've got very little undergrad research experience and no research papers etc.

I've always been interested in NLP and ML. I see that most places require you to have an MS or PhD if you want to work on ML/AI. I'm trying to evaluate what my best course of action should be considering my current situation and the fact that I want to do ML related work in the future.

So here's a few questions I had:

* Is it too late for me to do some quality undergraduate research work that will help me with grad school apps? 

* What are the top things I should do right now to improve my odds of getting into a good grad school?

* Should I try to get into grad school right after I graduate or should I try and do grad school while I work (if the company sponsors my tuition)?

* Any other insight you might have for me.

I'd love some advice on what to pick in order to make myself as employable as possible after graduation.,BftME,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/64eefk/i_have_the_choice_of_which_technologies_to_focus/,"Hi guys!  
  
So basically, my manager has asked me if I wanted to work on anything specific. After our conversation he emailed me a brief list of the technologies they are using, which looks something like C++, C#, Javacript, PHP, Shell Scripting, and a few other things, so it seems like there is a pretty good spread of languages used by this team and I have some options. I also have the option to work with React but that involves working with some legacy code so I think I'd rather stay away from that for now.
  
My question here is basically what you guys would recommend I focus on in order to prepare me for an internship next summer at (and I know this is going to piss some people off) a Big 4. I'm thinking I'll probably try to focus on learning C++ between now and this Summer and and getting some professional experience with it, and then I'll have knowledge of a few of the ""general purpose"" programming languages (Java, C, C++, and a little Python). Is this the best way to make myself employable at the bigger companies next year and after graduation? I know it's terrible to tunnel vision on trying to work for a Big 4 but I have a pretty good idea of which company/office I want to be working at within a few years of graduation as my ""first choice"". Once again, I know it's going to make all of you experienced engineers facepalm, but it rhymes with *Oogle* and I would eventually like to be working at their *Doorhinge County* office in Southern Scralifornia. I don't think that's too important at this point though- just learning some useful things for now.  
  
Anyways, any advice at all about anything related is much appreciated.

I am a 24 year old senior in college studying computer science and my fraternity chapter could potentially get expelled from school for stupid decisions that my chapter brothers have made.

I am really really scared about my future and I need some help!!

I only had a year left in school before I would graduate. I have taken all my required math courses, algorithms, data structures, operating systems, numerical methods, and maybe a couple of other cs courses that aren't coming to memory.  I have had an internship over the summer at a startup company. I am also currently on Coop this semester at another company. For those who don't know, a Coop is a work program where you can take off a semester(and remain enrolled) and work during the semester and summer. Similar to an internship, but it's just longer because it's during the semester as well.

Here is my experience at those two jobs.
Startup internship - Worked in a MAMP stack. I built a really simple beta website that was mostly html and css using bootstrap. There were some JQuery portions for some of the logic of the website. Worked on a decent size project in the MAMP stack. I could go into detail about that project if necessary.

Coop - Worked in a .NET stack. This company was pretty much a Microsoft shop. I wrote a couple powershell scripts, translated a lot of SQL stored procedures from Oracle to MS SQL server. Worked on an application in VB. I haven't really used any algorithms or data structures knowledge at these two jobs. 

Most of my experience is in C++, but I have played around with several other languages in my spare time. 

In an ideal world. I would like to transfer schools and finish up my degree. I know pretty much next to nothing about the transfer process! I go to a pretty well known school, at least in my area. It's in the top 50 for CS degrees. I mention this because I would like to get a degree from another well known school. Or is this even important? (considering this school may not be as well known in other parts of the country) 

I don't have any major side projects that I can show to an employer. Almost all of the full time jobs I have come across in the past require a Degree, so I feel that's important that I graduate somewhere. I honestly don't know how truly important it really is. I know in this field there are several people without degrees, but I imagine it's significantly harder for them to find jobs. 

Any help would be appreciated!! I am freaking out because I have come this far and worked so hard to graduate and now it might be taken away from me. I'm 24 turning 25 in November and I just feel like my time is running out and I don't want to keep building up debt that I can't pay off. 

EDIT UPDATE: There are some questions about what my role was in what happened for me to potentially get kicked off campus. There have been physical hazing allegations against my chapter. I did not partake in any of the physical hazing as I was on Coop this semester. However, just last semester a similar incident happened with another fraternity and all of them were kicked off campus, even one who was on Coop. Idk the details of their situation, so I am just hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. My chapter is small(9 members) and the other fraternity that was suspended was about 7 members. 


TLDR: Potentially expelled from school! Need help either transferring or starting my career!

First off, I wasn't the best student while in college. I couldn't get passed a 3.0 GPA in my classes, but still have a lot of passion for CS. During college, I decided to put my focus on leadership positions for clubs and such.

Flash forward, I graduated June 2016, spent a few months finding a job and landed one in Silicon Valley making more than I could ever dream (almost 6 figures). It was very, very lucky to be honest. They said I wasn't the most knowledgeable candidate, but I was the most team-fit and knew I could learn.

Unfortunately, 2 weeks into the job there was a rumor we were going to get laid off, and two months into the job it happened. I tried to learn as much as I could while I was there, and for the past month or so I've been applying everywhere I can with no success.

I didn't have any internships in college (besides one that wasn't very helpful), and finding it hard to land any type of interview at all. My resume isn't terrible, but it could be better.

Okay. The question is: What can I do to further my chance to landing a interview?

Recently some friends and family of mine have been trying to convince me that going to university for an engineering degree is a waste of time. They try to tell me that you can be an engineer without a degree, and no matter how many times I tell them, they don't seem to believe that you aren't a professional engineer with taking and passing the FE/PE. 

People tell me that I could be making better money working IT or being an electrician instead of going to school for Computer Engineering (in my third year btw). Not to be conceited, but internships I've offered have literally paid twice what these people make. My family think it's a waste of time because the 80k of debt that becomes incurred with it is inescapable which is blatantly false, especially with an engineer's salary. 

These same people tell me that the physics and maths classes I'm taking aren't actually applicable in my field (Microprocessor design and Electromagnetism aren't relevant to a computer engineer guys.)

I'm currently in my post-college job search, which I've been in for almost a year with little success. I can count the number of interviews I've gotten on one hand (two of which were for scam marketing jobs. Both promised office time but were actually fully out on the street, trying to sign people up for Blue Apron) and according to the email receipts I have, as well as LinkedIn numbers, I've applied to almost 500 jobs in the last year. I've had my resume professionally rewritten, and I've vetted references using of a friend calling and pretending to be a company interested in hiring me. I've even paid for LinkedIn Premium in an attempt to figure out which jobs I might be more likely to get a response for. I have an English degree, but I've got proven HTML/CSS skills. I have a portfolio of writing that's small, but the content is quality. I held a few internships while I was at school as I went to a college with little opportunities in the area for anyone other than engineering students, but I gained a huge amount of experience with the internship I held in my last spring semester. I, for all intents and purposes, was an Editorial Assistant.  Aside from that, I have nearly 6 years in customer service experience, from both retail jobs and food service.

Yet, I've been applying for the same position with publishers in NYC (the closest area to me with publishers. I'm about an hour/hour and a half commute from Manhattan) and I've heard nothing back. I've also applied for other assistant, entry-level positions with not only publishers, but literary agencies. I figured my lack of 5 years of experience for these jobs might be the issue, but as I'm no longer a student, I'm continuously told I don't qualify for internships. I've even gone so far as to email literary agencies and query about becoming a reader for added experience, not money. I either get no response, or a polite rejection as they're often paid positions. I've even widened my net, so to speak, and started applying for administrative assistant positions just about anywhere that's looking for one. I do have experience with administrative tasks from both internships, as well as from the retail jobs I've worked since high school (I had more than one manager who refused to do paperwork) and that hasn't done much for me either. I've also been applying for customer service agent positions. I interviewed with a temp agency, but I haven't heard from them in a while. After having to turn down two jobs because they started immediately and I was out of state (a fact I informed the woman I'd be working with when I interviewed with her) she stopped sending me possible opportunities. I emailed her a few weeks ago to check in, and waited four days for a one line email response saying she'd keep looking, but I've heard nothing since.

I've tried working the networking angle as well. My sister works for a large-ish tech start up that has a copywriting team, but they've shown no interest in hiring me, which I understand. A family friend used to work for a well known publisher, and still has contacts within the office. Despite his reference, I never got an interview. Lastly, a friend of mine works for a magazine and put my name and resume forward for an assistant for their sales team. I went through two rounds of interviews and while they ""liked me as a person"" I was deemed not a proper fit. They figure as my background is in editorial, I'd fit better there. I was also told from their HR person that she'd keep me in mind for future positions I might be qualified for. Except they have no entry-level editorial positions. My father has even suggested, just to get my out of my current food service job (I work in a bakery) that I apply for a receptionist position with a doctor's office. He works with the doctor in the hospital where the doctor does his surgeries and even that has done nothing for me.

What am I doing wrong? I'm at my wit's end. I've done everything that I've been suggested/read might help, and nothing has panned out for me. Any help/suggestions that you can offer me would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! "

I'm in my junior year of college and I'm majoring in IT. I just got into it because my freshman year I was a history major but everyone was talking me out of it because of the pay and how I would need two jobs to live decently, so I decided to jump ship and my sophomore year I was a CS major. It was okay the first semester but I fell behind and when I took a data structures course last semester I realized I didn't like coding for assignments and spending over 10 hours figuring out how to make something work. At the end of last semester I switched to IT and so far I'm about to finish a HTML course which is pretty easy and straightforward, a unix course which is fairly easy learning the commands and a networking course which I'm having a hard time in because the professor is new and I feel like I haven't learned anything and I'm struggling. Now this is where it gets to me. I work at a help desk at my college and it's okay but I don't want to work like my bosses and sit at a desk all day and answer phones. The track I'm interested in is network security but since I'm struggling in my networks class I feel as if I'm already screwed and I don't have an internship for the summer. Next year is my last year at college and I'd have to get a job once I graduate but I feel as if not having a internship will screw me and I feel as if I have not learned anything in my classes so far that would help me succeed in the field. Am I screwed? All of my friends have internships and I'm probably working at the help desk job over the summer so I'll be mostly answering phones and moving computers and I feel as if the only job out of college I'll get is a help desk job and I'm dreading that day. Sorry for the long post but I don't want to vent to my friends and family because after switching majors three times I feel doomed and I've been holding all of this inside for so long I think the rest of my professional career is ruined. Any insight would be amazing or help on things that could help me feel as if I can get a good job out of college/experience."

I was trying to apply for summer internships, but the only (very few) places I heard back from were places with projects I wasn't really interested in working with, which included web dev/basic databases/sys admin type work.

I've noticed that jobs in my field of interest (Embedded and control systems) seem really hard to find as a freshman. Companies that do such work much prefer juniors and seniors, or really great sophomores.

I was hoping for some other ideas and/or direction about what I could do this summer to make myself an attractive candidate for the Career fairs this fall, if I hope to work in embedded and controls. 

This semester, I played around a lot with Arduinos and took System Programming (in C) and Software Design Studio (Java and Android), so that's basically the experience I have as of now. I took Data Structures (C++) last semester, but didn't study for the interviews because I didn't have much time, so I did average in them. That's something else that I plan working on this summer too. My GPA is average (3.3).

Also, if you know companies that have entry level embedded and control systems jobs that are not in defense or the space industry, I'd really appreciate that.

I loved every aspect of it - my team, my work, the other interns, experiencing the new location, etc. Literally nothing at all for me to complain about, it was wonderful all around.






However, as interns, we were capped at 40 hrs/week. This was my first 40 hr/week job, and that seemed like plenty.






My team was made up of around 60 people, broken into smaller teams. Most of these people (~50) were software developers. Most of them worked from about 7:30-8:00am, until about 5:30-6:00pm, Monday-Friday. On weekends, the majority of them also did hours of work from home.






Is this corporate life (for developers, at least) in America? I had thought it was just an issue with this company, but have had people who despise the corporate world telling me non-stop that this is just what corporate life is, and there's no way around it. 







Am I doomed to work 60+ hour weeks for the next 30-40 years? I love programming, and have been so excited to graduate (1 month away!) and get all the way into the ""real"" world. But, if this is how it's going to be almost anywhere I go, I know I will be miserable in a year or two.






So, is this ridiculous amount of hours every single week the norm right now, or the exception? If it truly is the norm I feel like I need to begin figuring something else out. As much as I enjoy CS, I do not want to give so much of my life away (call me cliche, lazy, whatever, I don't think 60+ hour weeks for years and years for someone else's business is a great life).







Also if any of you could share your own experience(s) relating to work hours, that'd be awesome. Appreciate any answers/advice!"

However, I'm unsure whether I'll be able to succeed there. On paper, I look fine. I attend a top CS school and have a few cool internships and projects. I'm also naturally good at whiteboard interviews. I credit these to my ""success"" so far. In reality, however, all my positives are inflated.

While I attend a top CS school, I go out of the way to give myself the easiest schedule possible. Right now, I probably have less than 20 hours of work a week. Even then, my GPA is below average (though not bad by any measure). In my harder programming classes, I need a partner to carry me through the assignments or look at reference solutions to help me write my own solutions. My projects outside of school consist of crudely made hackathon projects that I tagged along with. I also can't say that I've ever had a successful internship. To be fair, some of it was not my fault, and I didn't take any of them that seriously. However, it's clear that I learn at a rate much slower than most of my peers, even when I place an honest effort.

I am incredibly worried about my first real job. I don't think I have legitimately worked hard for over 3 years, and I'm afraid that I have forgotten how to do so. I'm only competent at data structures and algo, and have no other skills. Should I be working on an independent project or learning new skills? Alternatively, is it OK just to relax for now and learn stuff when I start the job? Has anyone else been in my position before? Mostly, I'm concerned about whether I can be promoted to a respectable position before I settle down.

64ljig,1,2017-04-10,Need some executive role negotiating advice - can anyone help?,digitaldondraper,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/64ljig/need_some_executive_role_negotiating_advice_can/,"Hello all! Long time reader, first time poster :)

I have a very interesting situation that has happened over the last couple of weeks and I wanted to seek out some unbiased thoughts/guidance to figure out my next steps for something that should be coming to a head this week.

My background - I am 33 years old, I have been in corporate America since I was 16 (internship in high school turned into a full time role and never looked back). My skill-set is built up of Marketing, Advertising, IT and business strategy - all which have made up my 17 year professional career. 

I am going into my 5th year of employment at the company I work at. I was initially hired to be the Director of Digital Marketing &amp; Technology and was promoted this past December to Chief Strategy Officer. Essentially, I oversee all of Marketing &amp; IT for a $100 million dollar company.

Last year, our company did not hit our goal, which was a mixture of lack of sales leadership and a slowdown in our industry. Needless to say, bonuses did not go out. My CEO knew that I had one of my best, hardest working years since I joined the company - so we sat down and discussed what he could do for me both short term and long term. We had agreed that I would take the Chief Strategy Officer title and revisit my executive compensation package at the end of first quarter.

Well, I am happy to say that we had an AMAZING first quarter. I broached the subject with my CEO via email, reminding him of our discussion in December and asking if we could revisit my compensation aka ""part 2"" of my promotion. I asked for a bump in salary, and a car/cell allowance (which his what all of the other execs at my company have). I did not hear back from him for almost a week...which was initially making me sick to my stomach. 

The following week we grabbed lunch and he brought up the email (FINALLY lol) - and mentioned that the reason that he did not respond right away is because that very same morning I sent the email, our Vice President of Sales decided to step down and go back into full time sales remotely and it was quite the shocker because no one expected it. He went on to say that they wanted me to push my IT responsibilities to someone else on my team, continue to oversee Marketing - BUT absorb the VP of Sales role. This role consists of managing multiple General managers at our various locations, managing the overall sales strategy and leading a sales force of roughly 40 salesman across 5 locations nationwide. Soooo a pretty large bump in responsibility and a TON more work.

My CEO wanted me to meet with the existing VP of Sales, talk about everything and then provide him with a high level summary of what my ""new role"" would look like. I did just that, and at the bottom I placed my compensation requirements. I personally felt that I did not want to push the envelope too much, and I am not sure if this was a mistake or not, but I did not change my numbers from my initial request (BEFORE they asked me to take on this role). I felt that across the board what I was asking for was fair for both myself and for the company.

So when I reviewed this with the existing VP of Sales (who is an executive and would be part of the decision process), he seemed to have an issue with my compensation requests. He suggested that I just do a lateral move and ""prove myself"" before asking for an increase in salary. I hate when people ask me to ""prove myself""...its a pet peeve and makes me think ""what have I been doing the past 5 years here?"", ""so you think I do nothing lol?""...anyways..he brought up the executive bonus plan, which mind you I was already added on back in December (they had not communicated the breakdown as of yet because they were re-doing it), and he kept throwing these hypothetical ""if we hit ""X%"" to our goal you get this"" - its like cool man, that number could be a $billion and its still based on ""if"". I was just taken back because I felt he was trying to hard sell me on absorbing his role (and maintaining my existing one) for free...when this all started because I asked for my compensation package for my EXISTING ROLE...

I turned in my role sheet to my CEO and he said that he would meet with the other execs and then talk to me this week. I just have a feeling that the VP of Sales was in a way put up to trying to sell me on the role for free. These guys know I like climbing the ladder and I kind of feel that they thought I would be so excited that I would just take it out of the goodness of my heart. 

At this point I am looking for advice on how to proceed. I look at it as 50/50 on them giving me what I want or trying to negotiate me down from what I asked for. My current market value is much higher than I asked for and I feel that my requests were fair. Anything they have asked of me I have taken on, but I feel that this time I need to put my foot down. I feel that my original promotion to Chief Strategy Officer is almost being stepped over and forgotten about in this conversation and now were talking about ANOTHER new role...but potentially less than what I asked for (or if the Sales VP gets his way the offer may be $0). 

I would appreciate any and all insights on this matter. I have never negotiated a ""Chief"" role, looking back maybe I should have waited for the compensation before taking the role - but I figured that the title was better than nothing, and would help me in my future endeavors as I continue throughout my career.

Thanks for reading my novel. Appreciate it!

I have been continuing to teach myself in preparation for pursuing top-tier companies but, with ~20hours/week, I was wondering if I should focus on: 

a.) Learn the CS fundamentals I missed using something like this ""[Open-Source CS Degree](https://github.com/mvillaloboz/open-source-cs-degree)"" (university courses on intro CS, discrete math, calc, systems, compilers, etc) or 

b.) Get better at web development, build projects, and just learn data-structures &amp; algorithms for interviews

Number 2 spends significant time on coursework, includes relevant previous professional experiences but does not include work history. Not sure which way to go, or how to improve either. 

ISO entry-level type stuff like Helpdesk or Jr. Network Analyst, or even an IT internship that can provide useful experience.

**Background**: I am a former Navy electrician's mate ([The Fuse Story](https://redd.it/5z1buk), [The Great Ground Hunt](https://redd.it/5zkjd2)), former QA intern ([Fun With Active HTML... LIVE](https://redd.it/63c09k)), and tech support for my friends ([Dear God, It's Sticky](https://redd.it/5zyfxt)).

This is a series about my adventures as a field technician:

[Week 1](https://redd.it/5ygct3)

[Week 2](https://redd.it/60p4jh)

[Week 3](https://redd.it/61k0tn)

[Week 4, part 1](https://redd.it/6288y0)

[Week 4, part 2](https://redd.it/63uqyo)

**The Players**

Me: Your Humble Narrator

SDog: ""Sea Dog"" or (if he's been drinking) ""Salty Dog,"" a fellow Navy vet and team leader. Very good at his job, very fun to hang out with.

ZepFan: A fellow tech, big classic rock fan (we listened to a **LOT** of Led Zeppelin on long drives; I introduced him to Dread Zeppelin, a reggae Zeppelin cover band with an Elvis impersonator as lead singer, and we listened to a lot of them when we ran out of 'Zeppelin). With the exception of one week (week 3), we rode together for every week until after week 5, which will become clear shortly. 

BendR: Formerly known as ""Clipboard"" (ClipB); proven to be an alcohol-powered technician, a lot of fun to hang out with when he has a buzz on.

**TO EASTERN PA!**

Our first Saturday conversion was somewhere northwest of Philadelphia. We assembled in the parking lot promptly at 6 AM, hangovers and all, ready to embark on an epic journey.

While SDog was doing inventory on our load-out for the week, noticed something strange...

&gt;SDog: Huh. Never had one of these before.

&gt;BendR (very blearily): What? What we got?

Sitting near the front of the equipment van was a large, $Happy color MFP.

Yes, this was unusual. BankA had a standard that they never deviated from when it came to printers: 2 secure printers at the teller line, one $Happy black-and-white MFP on the floor, for the managers and financial planners. This would be the only time we carried one of these; after what it put us through, we counted ourselves lucky. That was clumsy foreshadowing.

We set off, and it was epic... until I got pulled over in New Jersey. I swear I was traveling with the traffic, right up to the point that they all slowed down for the cop I didn't see. Fortunately, he let me off with a license plate violation (that's $50 I'd gladly spend again to avoid a 75 in a 50 violation).

...and then it was a **careful** trip down the NJ Turnpike, into PA at the Penn Turnpike, then over about a half-dozen ""pikes"" to the site (I still want to know what a ""Skippack"" is, and why they named a pike for it).

**BendR Assumes His Final Tech Form**

After the successful conversion, we retired briefly to the hotel before the Google search for food. Settling on a place I think was called the Brick and Barrel, we set forth to try and enjoy the Saturday night before we headed out on Sunday morning.

ZepFan started off as designated driver. That lasted until the cute-as-hell bartender winked at him, and got him trying some new mixes she was testing on ""select customers.""

SDog took one look at the keys, shrugged, and ordered a beer before passing them on to BendR... who shook his head, ordered an IPA, and handed them to me.

Yep... from reckless driving to designated driver in less than 12 hours. Go, me.

Once we finally got ZepFan untangled from the bartender (after reminding him that he had a girlfriend waiting back home for him), we headed back to the hotel. The entire way, BendR was hanging out of the window, howling at the streetlights. I was never more happy not to see any cops.

**Sunday, To CT!**

...via Philadelphia. You do not visit the Philly area without at least trying a Philly cheesesteak.

**...and Tuesday, Back to PA!**

...because whoever made the schedule for that week was a sadist.

**The Mystery of the Color Printer Is Revealed**

We had been having a great week up to Wednesday. Every conversion was easy, we had awesome testers for UAT (I was starting to think that maybe it was just NY that bred bad testers, which rankled my NY pride), and we were feeling good about this conversion. Best of all, the bank closed at 3 PM instead of the usual 4, so we would be on the road an hour early.

We unpacked our equipment, got our tools out and ready, and gingerly lifted that color MFP off of the van.

&gt;BendR: This thing is $$$$ing heavy!

&gt;ZepFan: Good thing it's on wheels.

&gt;SDog: Good thing they laid it down in the van... that thing would have killed someone if they didn't.

We wheeled it into the bank and got it in place, then did the usual: Patched PCs, set up the pinpads and secure printers (BendR soloed the printers, and had them up in time to start staging the PCs... I told you he shaped up quickly!), and were ready with a half hour to spare.

&gt;Me: ...no... not going to say it.

&gt;SDog: No, please don't. Don't jinx it.

&gt;BendR (comes around the corner): Hey, we might just break the record tonight!

(Damnit. He had to say it out loud, didn't he?)

&gt;ZepFan: C'mon, guys, you're not superstitious, are you?

&gt;Me and SDog (in unison): We were *sailors*. It's pretty much trained into us.

Closing time! The bank people are surprisingly quick at balancing, and we begin setting up PCs quickly, knocking them out long before the bridge finishes its checks and configs and gets SDog swapping cables.

&gt;Me: Okay, now I'm feeling confident.

&gt;ZepFan: Good. Hey, got a sec?

&gt;Me: Sure.

We head back to the network room (which, surprisingly, was a spacious storage room, with actual room to move).

&gt;ZepFan: I won't be heading out with you guys next week. I got word Sunday morning that my grandfather died, and I need to take some bereavement leave.

&gt;Me (after appropriate condolences and ""if there's anything you need"" and a promise to get him home as quickly as possible... which he turned me down on, as it was his turn to drive): Did you tell SDog?

&gt;ZepFan: Not yet. After we wrap up.

**We Can't Log In... and Everything's Slow... And The Printer Won't Stop...**

Finally, the bridge cuts over to the BankA network, and we begin the scripts and software deployments.

Or, at least, we tried to.

Right away, we have problems getting to the login servers for BankB's virtual network. It would take multiple tries with our vendor credentials to get in, only to run into issues with the scripts... and *then*, the software deployment phase took ages, as the small downloads were taking forever to download.

All in all, it took an extra half hour to get to the point where we could run our own simple tests to see if the machines were ready for UAT.

Since I haven't said anything up to now about them, it was a quick and dirty test to see if they had network access: BankB intranet, internet, test to see if they printed on the old teller MFP, test to see if they printed on the platform MFP.

Each test took a geological epoch to complete, and we were all frazzled by the time we could turn them over.

But a curious thing was happening: we were getting extra test pages on the newly-installed MFP. A *lot* of extra test pages.

The teller and manager for the night began to log in to the PCs. SDog actually came up with a brilliant idea: Since the PCs were taking forever to log in, and since anyone could log into multiple BankA and BankB machines (as long as they didn't try to log into BankB's $ProprietaryPOSteamingSSoftware on multiple machines, which was a no-no), he had us have them log into every machine at once, so when they came up, they could be tested as quickly as possible.

Meanwhile, the new color printer was *still* printing test pages.

&gt;ZepFan: Wow, there's some serious lag in the system. We finished sending the test pages 10 minutes ago.

&gt;Me: yeah, that's... odd.

I grabbed the stack of pages, and started just sorting them by the PC that sent them.

Then I noticed something very wrong.

When a test page was printed, it had a header that had the BankB branch number, then an underscore, then the number of the PC that sent it.

If my branch was 123, and the PC was 004, the number should read ""123_004.""

We were getting 123s. Also, 157s... and 998s... and 445s... Light bulb moment imminent...

I got out my phone, and pulled up the schedule of branches for the week for each team. It was all on a big Excel sheet, with each team number, the day of the week, and the branch particulars.

&gt;Me: Let's see... 157: yep... 998: yep... *etc. and so on*.

&gt;Me: Hey, SDog! Tell the bridge that we're getting everyone's platform test pages! They pointed every platform printer **in the entire BankB network** at our platform color MFP!

&gt;SDog: What? No way. That can't be right.

Sure enough, when I showed him the test pages (and we got a few more as I pointed this out to him), he realized what else was happening...

&gt;SDog: The bridge DDoS'd us! We're getting all of the print requests, and it's keeping us from doing network stuff!

It took another 10 minutes (and about 15 more test pages) to convince the bridge tech that, yes, everyone was printing to our new color MFP, and yes, we were lagging hard because of it, and definitely, you guys should be fixing this, ASAP.

A general call was put out to stop testing the platform until the problem was resolved. Someone decided that it would be hilarious to send a few more test pages, so that got slowed down some more.

A quick rewrite of the printer policy, a quick push to the PCs, and some command line wizardry, and we were able to turn the PCs back over to the testers for UAT again.

I hate printers.

**Epilogue**

ZepFan did manage to get SDog aside for a few minutes and let him know what was going on. He was pretty somber on the way back home. This wasn't the last week we'd see him, but after week 5, he really wasn't a permanent member of the team... but that's another story.

Today, I was doing some follow up work for my company on behalf of BankA, and one of my stops was the color MFP installation site. The manager recognized me, and also...

&gt;Branch Manager: Oh, right, that was the night my new printer wouldn't stop printing. *laughs* That was a fun night!

**TL; DR:** New printer brings ALL the boys to the yard with her ~~milkshakes~~ color printing, and BankA network engineers let her.

EDIT: Added tl;dr for some folks; fixed a link."

2) I am extremely interested in some of the engineering project teams, particularly CUAUV. I don't know much about the recruitment process aside from the fact that there are applications. What is the recruitment process like for the project teams (are there interviews)? How difficult is it to get in one of these teams? My experience in programming is mainly composed of having done well in APCS and 3 years of programming for FTC robotics, so wouldn't consider myself a ""top tier"" programmer, but I'm willing to bust my ass to learn what is necessary and assist my team.

3) I've heard that teams like AUV do much of their work over the summer. Does this mean I will have to stay on campus over the summer? What does this entail for someone who wants to do internships over the summer?

Thanks for all the help guys."

Both data engineering and scalable backends are very interesting to me but I was wondering if someone could give me some advice. I've written APIs for my previous internships but I've never had to deal with scalability or worry about stuff like distributed system, a topic I really want to learn more about.

I believe Hadoop, Spark, etc. fits into the same category of distributed system, but in a different way. I don't have much experience with them and based on what I've read here, it's hard to get actual experience with them unless you're using them in production in an actual environment for a job, so it would be a very good opportunity for me for the summer.

As much as I would like to learn more about big data stuff, it doesn't really tie into my past experience as I'm mostly a full stack web developer. I definitely find building scalable backends very fascinating so I don't know if I should go into a totally new field that I don't know much about.

I enjoy the topics took the B.S path with additional econ classes because and really enjoyed statistics and my econometrics class. So I had the goal to pursue jobs related to my coursework. During my undergrad, I had the mentality that as long as I find some work experience during college then I would be able to find an entry level job after graduation. Now, my outlook in life has entirely changed and I question my work experiences. 

I could not find any job opportunities that would stick for the first 8 months with interviews that went no where. So I joined temp agencies hoping they would help me start working.
The temp agencies and online job sites seem to keep suggesting I do Accounts Payable because I had an internship in  AP. Now it seems like I won't get any job replies other than AP, which is a dead-end, super simple, high turnover, and work that bores the hell out of me. I had used my internships to find out what I did not want to do, but now I am in full panic mode because I can't get my foot in the door in anything else other than AP jobs.

Recently I had applied for a data associate job at X company, but was called by someone from the AP team. I thought it was weird, but continued talking to the person in hopes of shedding some light on the job opportunity. In my mind I knew for certain I did not apply for AP position. I asked and the lady told me she was referred by a co-worker who saw my resume and suggested I would be a better fit in AP. This bummed me out... and found out that the person who saw my resume for the data associate did not think I was a good fit for the role, but instead handed it over to the person hiring for an AP position.

Did I doom myself for having worked for AP? This made me realized that all the data related positions I applied for with little to no success, was utterly pointless. I am having many negative thought running through my head like many others in the world struggling to get a entry level job. B.S econ pointless? AP death trap of career? Entry level hell? Can't get entry level job without absurd requirements?

TLDR: Job hunted for about 1 year=no success. When job opportunities arise=only AP. Applied for data associate job, but instead had my resume sent to an AP position. What do?"

I would concentrate in CS at Harvard, Mech/Aero or CS at Princeton, or MechE/EE at GT. Eventually, want to work in autonomous robotics and machine learning.

Harvard is Harvard, and the resources (including FA) they provide to their student body are amazing. I love the housing system and the atmosphere/culture was very cohesive and not at all elitist like I was expecting. Their CS program is excellent and the STEM programs are rapidly expanding, but currently they are underdeveloped and seem to be an afterthought to the school.

Princeton has way stronger engineering programs, an equally competitive CS program, and certificates (their version of a minor) directly in robotics, cognitive science, or machine learning. Princeton has a similar size, atmosphere, and housing system to Harvard, although house pride/allegiance does not seem to be as big. FA is similar to Harvard's. Overall an incredible place.

Georgia Tech's engineering programs are the most highly ranked of the bunch, and Atlanta is a great location for finding internships or jobs. However, the school is over twice as big as either of the ivies and seems a little too Greek for my tastes. Definitely would be the most typical college experience out of the bunch. Oddly enough with financial aid factored in it would be the most expensive to attend. "

if my gpa drops to 3.6, is that still ""good enough"" for interviews @ Big 4?"

I am a Sophomore studying CS at a pretty prestigious state school in California. I recently finished interviewing at a well know web hosting company for a position as an SDET.

As far as I can tell from the questions I've asked and the job details, the position involves coding through writing unit tests, automating testing, and writing testing software. However, it is a part of the Quality Assurance department.

My question is whether or not it would be a good idea to take this role. I've read a lot about how any QA role or role with the title including the word ""test"" in it can ""curse"" you by pidgeon-holding you into being a tester. I should say that it is not my intention to be a tester for my career; I fully intend to be a developer/engineer working on customer products.

I also feel though that this being my first internship at a larger company would help more than it could hurt, especially since I still have a couple summers left for more internships.

I also am in the process for interviewing with another company for a web development position, although I am unsure if I they will be able to move fast enough by the time I would have to accept this offer.

What do you guys think?

Thanks.

I'm currently 6+ months working at my employer. First full on job, excluding vacation jobs and internship. I'm unsure if I should be happy though or if I should be more ambitious..

Background: 

I've graduated from college, what you'd call Computer Science in English I think. A bit of everything; networking, programming, hardware... I specialised in web dev and mobile programming. Preference for web dev; both front-end and back-end. All fine and dandy.

Job - PRO:

* Fun colleagues, good atmosphere
* Understanding boss, who has a background in IT himself
* Every 3 weeks we get a training day. No actual work, just the freedom to improve job related skills. Read a book. Try out a framework...
* All around I *am* pretty happy here, save for the following minus points. That's not to say I don't have bad days, but they don't happen often enough to worry me. 
* Possibly more that I'm forgetting...

job - CON: 

* Commute is a bit longer than I'd like ideally (45-60 minutes), though I must admit, where I currently live it'd be easily 30+ minutes regardless. If not more. 
* This is by far the biggest thing I've been thinking about and I'm honestly kind of ashamed to admit it. But the majority of my time I spend looking into legacy code like VBScript and occasionally VB6. At times there's C# and rarely React. We're working with an old product (10+ years old). There's plans for a rewrite, but it'll be progressive. Meaning it won't come to a full stop anytime soon. 

Now I know it's selfish to want to avoid those legacy parts and 'dump' it on my colleagues, but I have a hard time imagining it's good for my career. When I talk with friends of my age, they mention how they're learning and working in new technologies and when I have to admit I work with those kind of languages, it stings pretty hard...

Recently I've taken up a pet project in which I make something in React, both for fun and for practice. I feel it helps, but still. At the end of this ride, I feel like I'll have little to show for it.

I've started reading the Algorithm Design Manual by Skiena, but I'm unsure what the best approach is for learning. Should I attempt all the problems in the book, or should I only select a few that are relevant to my current goals (e.g., some questions are related to proving the correctness of recursive algorithms and I struggle heavily with these, but they also don't seem super relevant to job preparation). Should I also implement every single algorithm and data structure that I encounter in the book? How would I go about testing the correctness of my solutions?

Just wanted to share my journey real quick in hopes of inspiring and encouraging others. I'll start with my background.

I'm 24 currently, living in LA. In may 2015 I graduated with a bachelor degree in a non-technical field. A foreign language, to be more specific. In January 2016 I started OSU's program with zero background in CS. I took the 1-year track, and graduated December 2016. for the past 6 months I've been beefing up my resume with side projects. Specifically android applications. I had a really hard time getting any bites at all due to my lack of an actual internship or any experience. I even developed an app for a start-up in the meantime (which should be launching this week!) All of this was primarily to pad my resume and make me look more accomplished, because I was sorely lacking in experience. After a few months of no responses whatsoever, I started looking for internships that allowed recent grads to apply. One of those got back to me, from my dream company no less.

 It's a large DoD contractor, and they were looking for interns for a cloud systems engineer. We scheduled a phone interview, and I started studying. CTCI, leetcode etc. I did a lot of studying, and it really paid off. The phone interview asked some intern-level technical questions, and I was able to answer them pretty easily. At the end of the phone interview, to my surprise, they told me I didn't get the internship BUT, they wanted me to apply for a full-time position instead and come in for a day-long interview. So I did, and studied even harder for the next week, because I knew they were going to step up their game. I practiced interview questions, and pretty much found out everything I didn't already know about the company. The day consisted of 6-7 interviews with supervisors/employees, lunch, and a presentation that I would give on a project of my choosing to 10-15 people. (This part was optional. I did it because duh.) 

They were very perplexed about my education. Especially the 1-year track. I felt like I was grilled a bit harder because of how quickly i finished it, honestly. But everything went well, and I was able to answer their technical questions and express interest and enthusiasm in their work (which i am greatly excited about, so it wasnt hard ha)

And so they offered me a position, and I accepted! Now I'll be working on machine learning and cloud projects as they pertain to satellites and satellite data in the R&amp;D department of a DoD contractor! Truly, a computer scientist is the coolest sense!

The main things I think everyone should take away from this:

Be pro-active! 
If you really want it, work for it! do extra, show the people you're applying to that you're passionate and pro-active. They want to see accomplishments and enthusiasm. Just finishing classes with a decent grade isn't going to get you there. If you're interested in something, get into it! Work on a product from start to finish, release it! It looks great when you have something actually out there. 

Do whatever you can to get an interview. 
OSU teaches us just about everything we need to become professional software engineers. All we need to do is to put ourselves out there and make sure an actual human is sitting across the table to hear about it. Don't just send applications out into the world. They may never even get read. Network, reach out, talk to real people. Example: The guy with the start up who I made an android app for? He was my uber driver. That's how we met. Talk to people, talk to HR. be persistent. It will get you noticed, and it will get you through a robo-screening.

Keep up with your algorithms!
Face it, you're going to get asked to code something, and you may not know the answer. You should be practicing enough that you can at least recognize what you should do or how you should start. Make sure you know how to solve a problem with, for instance, dynamic programming. But also, don't take for granted your knowledge of sorting/searching algorithms and other ""basics"". write them all out, know how they work, because if you cant replicate one in an interview from scratch, it's not a great sign.

Getting that first job is the hardest. Get experience wherever you can. If you have the opportunity to get an internship, please please please do it and save yourself the trouble!

We are all equipped (or becoming equipped) to be great computer scientists! Never give up! :)

64ueg0,0,2017-04-11,Help choosing between two internships,mercedya,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/64ueg0/help_choosing_between_two_internships/,"I'm hoping some of you can help me choose between two internships this coming summer. I'm a rising senior at a Tier 2 school with no CS related internships so this is my last chance to get work experience under my belt before looking for full time. Salary is relatively equal between both choices, and the languages used at both companies are the same for the most part. Both companies also have a formalized internship program where all interns go through an onboarding process.

Company A is much more well established, unicorn valuation, and I've seen them mentioned once or twice in this sub, although they are definitely not one of the super prestigious unicorns like Uber or Airbnb. The people I met seemed more relaxed and relatable to myself since I don't consider myself ""extremely"" passionate about tech and coding. Their office was amazing and the free perks are as good as they get. The recruiting experience was also much more personalized, and I feel like they want me more. There's a wide variety of teams I might be placed in which is one of my concerns, as there are some sides of the company I do not want to work in. I've asked and while I do have some say in the manner, in the end there's no guarantee I'll work on my preferred team.

On the other hand I feel like Company B will be a more technically challenging role. Company B works with massive amounts of data (all relative I know, it's no Google or Facebook), and a person I know who currently works there on their backend infrastructure team says they deal with hundreds of terabytes of data every day. The people I met at Company B seem more 'tech-y', for lack of a better word. Company B is a more professional environment, and working closer with cutting edge technology.

In the end, what I'm looking for this summer is the chance to grow and mature both as a programmer AND as an individual. I believe I will learn more technical aspects at Company B, but I'd rather be like the people from Company A. Of course since this is just for the summer, if one internship will boost me ahead of the other in my future search for full time employment that's a strong plus.

Thanks!"

After graduation I moved back home and had no idea what I wanted to do. I finally decided to change my field to something relating to the technology industry. I took one semester’s worth of classes at my local university and did well in these classes. During the summer, I sent out some applications for positions but was told that I needed to continue improving my skill set. 

In the fall, my parents moved to a different part of the country and I moved with them. Ever since then, I have basically been taking online classes to improve my skill set. A lot of them didn’t teach me much but I finally found a sequence of courses that I am currently doing which have taught me a lot. 

I am now ready to apply to some jobs and I  am in the process of contacting recruiters. Here’s the problem, though: I basically have huge gaps on my resume since I graduated. Aside from the one semester’s worth of official classes that I took, I have only had one unpaid internship. This was part-time, not even full time and I worked remotely for the startup. Also, my supervisor was quite unresponsive and I am not even sure if he will give me a letter of reference if I need it for jobs. 

I worry about what these gaps mean for my ability to get hired. I could have filled the gaps by working as a cashier or something, but I have tried this in the past and it didn’t work out. At the beginning of last year I actually did land a part-time job as a server at a restaurant - but I panicked so much that I couldn’t go in on the first day. Since then I have not tried applying to any more jobs in the service industry. This makes me feel like even more of a loser. I have also been working through my online courses really slowly because a) when I get stuck I don’t have anyone to talk to, and b) I have little social interaction in general, which has kept me depressed and unmotivated.  

Though I am extremely grateful to my parents for still supporting me financially, I (and they) obviously want me to be financially independent as soon as possible. My parents also don’t really understand how serious my SA can get, and they sometimes yell at me that I should just get over those feelings, which of course is much easier said than done. I have tried bringing up the possibility of therapy multiple times, but they don’t want me to go to therapy because of the stigma. I don’t know if their attitude towards my SA and depression has kept me stuck for longer, but all I know is in the past year I have only made a little progress. 

However over the past week I have been feeling more motivated about trying to get a job, since I now feel more confident in my skills. But what should I tell hiring managers if they ask about these gaps? Should I be honest with them? Have any of you guys been in a similar situation? 

TL;DR: I graduated college almost three years ago and still have not had my first regular, full-time job (largely due to social anxiety and depression). What are my best options on how to explain this to employers?

64vape,7,2017-04-11,Where to apply for experiential learning in computer science?,WuhOhCookieDough,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/64vape/where_to_apply_for_experiential_learning_in/,"The presence of the phrase ""experiential learning"" alone may yell out ""Northeastern University"" already, but I'd like to have more options. Especially for those who are currently / have previously been enrolled in these kinds of programs, I need your help!


I'm an Asian female from Las Vegas with a pretty decent chance of getting accepted out of state. I'm fairly certain about majoring in computer science since I'd audited David Malan's CS50 a while ago and loved every minute of it. One of the biggest considerations I'm taking in my college decisions (besides money, which is the bottom line) is the ability to get internship or co-op opportunities. It'd be really great to get out of college and go straight to work for a company that I've previously had experience with. With that said, Georgia Tech and Cornell (yikes) are two other colleges I'm definitely going to be applying to. 


As summer is nearing, though, I feel like I'm becoming more and more detached from the actual reach of my high school performance. Colleges have been on and off my list (based on my chance of getting accepted, cost of attendance, average financial aid, quality of academics, etc.), and I just can't make up my mind about anything. I feel like I'm trying to look at too many factors at once, and I don't know how to prioritize them. It'd be great to hear from others what you guys think and what your experiences have been. Thanks!


Just for reference, here's some more information about me as a current junior:

*32 ACT Composite (will likely retake after summer since I'll probably score higher after studying this time)

*will take SAT after summer

*4.000 unweighted GPA

*4.725 weighted GPA

*probable valedictorian in c/o 2018 of a little more than 550 students

*for the most part, I've taken the most rigorous courses offered (next year, I'm taking Physics Honors over AP Biology since I had already taken Biology Honors freshman year, and never taken any Physics class)

*my current schedule: AP Calculus AB, AP Chemistry, AP English Language and Composition, AP Spanish Language and Culture, AP US History, and second year Web Design

*National Honor Society President

*Environmental Awareness Treasurer

*Key Club Sophomore Representative (2015-2016)

*co-founded a drawing club (2015)

*drawing club secretary (2015-2016)

*participated in a Startup Weekend and a Hackathon

*National Center for Women &amp; Informational Technology Award for Aspirations in Computing State Winner

*will work at Burger King this summer to save for PC parts lol


Also: I don't know if it helps my admissions or tuition, but my older sibling was a graduate from Northeastern a couple years ago, now working for a pharmaceutical company in Chicago


Also also: thanks again for the help :)))"

My story: I went from CC - Non target state school - FO BB 

my question is should I keep my CC on my resume or take it off? 

I don't have much experience other than my Internship/1st job, but I do have alot of extracurriculars and volunteer experince from my CC such as being the Student Government Treasurer which helped me grow a lot.

Theres an opening at another bank in an unrelated coverage group and I want to apply for it but idk how recruiters will react to seeing me not being from a target school and having a CC on my resume

FYI: I'm in one coverage group and this position is in an unrelated coverage group in another city

without my CC experience my resume basically reads 

- State School - GPA
- Analyst at BB
- Intern

With my CC it would read the same but below that it would include

- Treasurer for a multimillion dollar budget
- Election Organizer
- Orientation Leader

What would you do?

64vs41,3,2017-04-11,Wisconsin-Madison vs Northeastern for Computer Science?,ausbah,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/64vs41/wisconsinmadison_vs_northeastern_for_computer/,"I'm have narrowed my two college choices down to either Northeastern or UW-Madison for a degree in computer science, but am having trouble deciding between the two. 

Please assume paying for either college is no issue.

Northeastern 

-Location in Boston - great for jobs, making connections, etc.

-Coop program, graduating with 1-1.5 years of real world experience is a great benefit to have.

-Not as strong of a CS program as UWM, but probably not as far behind as it looks in rankings.

-Social scene doesn't seem to be as big due to the coop program, city location, lack of outstanding sports teams.

-Research is still a thing, probably even more so than UWM in the CS area.

UW-Madison 

-Great CS program, probably better than NEU's for learning.

-Recognition is great for getting internships and jobs.

-Larger campus and student body, plenty of opportunities for clubs, sporting events, and other things that are part of the ""college experience"".

-Love the location, urban feel with plenty of nature.

-Oversaturated program, many classes even junior and senior year have 50+ kids.

-Research is one of the big selling points of UWM, but doesn't seem to be as big of a deal in the CS department especially in the undergraduate realm.

-Things seem to require more self motivation if you want to get them, probably a symptom of the program's oversaturation.

Choosing between these two school is tough, they seem very similar in their strengths with pretty weak downsides. I love both schools, my heart says Northeastern due to the location and coop, brain says Madison as it overall probably has a stronger CS program.

Thoughts? Anything I am missing or wrong on that could radically change my views on a school for better or worse?"

my situation is never going to change

my parents won't let me move out for at least two more years, and that's only if i behave exactly how they want me to. dress properly, pretend to pray, pretend to go along with their homophobic beliefs, pretend women shouldn't have as much freedom as men, pretend i don't mind not being allowed to go out past like 9 oclock despite being 20 years old, pretend i'm fine with losing opportunities like exchange programs and internships and university programs in big cities because a woman shouldn't travel alone. 

i feel like i can never reach my ""full potential"" because of their rules and because of the anxiety their constant hounding causes me. they have a gps tracker on my phone and every time i see multiple texts from them my heart stops even if im not out doing anything wrong. they track my every move and question everything i do. if im going out, i need to tell them like a week in advance and talk about who im with and where im going for half an hour, give them my friends phone numbers, go to every fucking length for them to ease up a bit. again, i'm an adult

no one i've talked to understands. i talked to a muslim therapist who tried to get my parents to be more liberal, but she still tried to convicne me turning back to islam would help with my depression and anxiety. i know other women have it worse. i know. but i;m being selfish. this is what i'm dealing with, this is what's affecting me. looking to the example of Saudi Arabia isn't going to magically make me feel better about my life.

my university counsellors have been useless. i spend more time storytelling to them and dealing with psychological jargon about ""coping"" that won't change anything. how on earth is a white man with no oppressive religious background going to understand me. i dont call hotlines because the idea of reliving explaining all of this again is too draining. i've already explained to my uni counsellor, another uni advisor, and a paid therapist. i've done enough explaining and justifying and reasoning for why i feel so depressed. this sentence doesn't even make sense but i don't care


it's not just about stressing over when i can party or wear a short skirt or whatever. day to day i live a lie, i pretend to base my very existence on shit i don't believe in to the people who supposedly care the most about me. and anytime i seem to step out of line, they blow up at me and act like i am the worst person who ever existed and threaten to kill me
i'm fucking rambling because there is so much to explain about this that i can't explain
i swear the only reason i haven't killed myself is because of my younger siblings. my younger teen sister is also an exmuslim. but i really don't want to do this. there's no guarantee i'll be able to leave in two years. my dad is pressuring me to stay and help with his business instead of pursuing postgrad in another city. 



i don't want to stay here and live with being yelled at to pray more than 5 times a day, spend a month each year (ramadan) starving for no reason, being shamed for wearing clothing that is even slightly revealing or form fitting, hearing scientific facts denied, missing out on ""formative"" university experiences, being interrogated on why im not more involved with muslim youth communities, being yelled at for pursuing my artistic interests in any capacity because they are unislamic 

i'm so tired

i have to hide everything, i have to block all of my relatives on social media, i have to  scour google search results for my name to make sure there is nothing that my parents woudl get mad about (today my dad googled my name and saw a pic from my instagram of me in a skirt, it was archived by picagram, i've messaged them to remove it but i feel so stupid for letting that happen, my page is public because i have a lot of followers and it is a photography page)

i've become such a good liar

i lie to protect myself. i lie to my parents about where i'm going, who i'm with, how i feel. i lie to my friends about why i couldn't make it out, why i'm late, whatever. i'll get screamed at in the car by my mom about something stupid like clothing or not praying or makeup, and be the most sociable and friendly person at work or school. i have to go to bathroom stalls to hyperventilate or break down crying for a couple minutes sometimes, or i'll zone out on the bus before putting the mask on and being the seemingly confident and self-directed person i am. honestly a lot of people really admire me, a lot of my friends tell me they are fans of me and are jealous of me and are inspired by the things i do. which is so strange because i feel so choked up and unacommplished and i hate myself and my life

it's just so frustrating

it's little day to day things that other people don't have to worry about that are the end of the world in my parents' eyes


""what did we do to deserve a daughter like you""

""why won't you ever be happy""

""you will never be happy if we aren't happy with you, if you don't depend on Allah""

""no matter your grades or your job, if you move out without our blessing you will never find peace""

there's no end in sight

i dont know when i can leave and even when i do i will always have to hide nad to pretend
i can never publicly ""come out"" as an exmuslim or as a queer woman

oh yeah forgot to mention in the face of my homophobic parents, i'm also not straight

every time i write something or create an art piece about identity my parents ask me why i didn't include my religion

and i wonder why i can't include my sexuality

which is not my priority honestly 

the hierarchy of needs or whatever

it hurts but what hurts more is the pretending to be muslim. im not really pretending to be straight, that's an assumption that people make in a heteronormative society

i can tell my friends im not muslim. but when an arab meets me, they assume im muslim and i have to just be neutral about it. the community is too small

i dont want to pretend

im so tired

i fucking hate my life i wish i hadn't been born into a muslim family

i really wish i could end this without hurting my siblings

I’ve been a long-time lurker and this is my first time posting. Also, if this is the wrong subreddit to be posting in, please let me know as I really do wish to receive advice.

I am currently in my third year of undergraduate at the University of Illinois for computer science. I feel extremely passionate about programming and I tend to do well in my courses, but I can’t land an internship no matter how hard I try. I have attended every career fair on campus, always walking out empty handed. I didn’t stop there though, I applied to countless internships online and have taken countless online assessments only to be rejected each time. I have no idea what I am doing wrong as I find the online assessments to be straightforward. I just find it extremely unrewarding that I try extremely hard in my courses, often times sacrificing what I want to do with school work. I have a presentable GPA, but I think my problem may lie in my resume. I have no internship experience and no personal projects. I have many friends with arguably the same resume in terms of competitiveness, yet they don’t seem to have a problem finding an internship (some of which will be interning at Amazon, Facebook, Yelp and Twitter for the Summer). At this point I have given up on finding an internship for this Summer and am really just seeking advice on what to do. I am extremely disappointed in myself and fear I will not be competitive enough for the next year when I need to start applying for full time positions. It seems everyone around me has or will have internship experience under their belt. I definitely want to use the Summer to build my resume, but I don’t know what I should do. I have thought about starting a personal project, but I have no idea what type of project would most benefit my resume. Can anyone give me pointers on what types of personal projects have helped them land a job? I really don’t know what my interests are. I really am passionate about programming, but I have no idea on how I want to apply my passion.

64y8no,0,2017-04-12,"Deciding between three very different grad programs in Publishing: Emerson, UAL, or Columbia. Help!",awky_raccoon,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/64y8no/deciding_between_three_very_different_grad/,"Hi all,

Not sure if this is the best place to ask, but maybe some of you can help. I've decided to go to graduate school to study publishing and I've been accepted to the 1.5-2 year program at Emerson, the 15 month program at UAL (University of Arts London) and the 4 week certificate program at Columbia which is held at Oxford. I know some people will say a graduate program in publishing isn't worth it, but I'm 100% sure it's what I want to do.

I am completely torn - these programs are so different but each have their own advantages. 


Emerson Masters: 

- Near my home town, could save money and live at home, already have friends there 

- Longest program, could be completed in a year and a half if I take three classes per semester (which I've heard is totally doable)

- Classes held in evenings, and only one class per class per week. So three nights of class per week.

- Most expensive: would end up being $50k+ when all is said and done

- 40-50 students in entire program

- Aside from three core courses, I would have a lot of freedom to take classes that interest me. Mix between theoretical and practical courses.

- Can choose to take one extra class instead of a final dissertation/project

- GREAT networking for Boston area, where I will likely end up working anyway

- Night classes would allow me to work or have an internship at the same time


UAL Masters:

- In London, which would be so much fun. I also love to travel, so being so close to the Europe would be amazing. But I won't know anyone so I won't have the same strong support system that I have in Boston

- 15 months, only two semesters of classes followed by solo work on dissertation/final project

- Class held from 9-5 on Thursdays and Fridays only

- Cheaper tuition, about $20k for whole program, BUT this doesn't include living expenses in London

- 20 students in entire program, stay in same class with them all year

- No choice in courses, but will be exposed to areas of study I wouldn't have chosen on my own, may be a good thing - all very practical courses

- Final project is very flexible, can basically do anything I am interested in/passionate about

- GREAT networking with UK Publishing houses, which have sister locations all over the world

- Trip to France at end of second semester with entire class (but expenses not incl. in tuition costs)

- I've heard that UK grad programs are more laid back, and I would have time for work or an internship outside of the course


Columbia Publishing Course:

- In Oxford, UK - beautiful old campus, but found the town itself to be quiet and dull (I'm a city person). Probably won't matter since I'll be so busy all the time?

- Not a MA, just a certificate

- Only 4 weeks

- Very intensive schedule: all day, every day, working in groups mostly (I get sick easily when I'm in stressful situations for a prolonged period of time, so this makes me nervous. But who knows, it could end up being more fun than stressful?)

- Cost: $8500 including room and board

- 70 students in whole program

- Focuses only on book publishing - no choice in courses, but learn so much just by doing. I don't know if I prefer book to magazine or digital publishing, so I'm unsure if this would be a good idea, or if it would hurt my chances of getting a job in magazine publishing in the future if I find out that is what I want to do

- EXCELLENT networking with both UK publishing houses and NYC connections - program taught by industry professionals, many people are hired immediately after the program ends

- Have Columbia/Oxford on my resume


All these programs have great reputations in the publishing world, and would help me get internships/jobs. The cost is important, but I will be taking out loans so if I can get a better paying job upon graduating then I'd be okay with paying more. They all start in September, and I have to let them know by May 1st. I love them all and cannot decide which I prefer! 

Regardless of what the subject area is, which program would you choose based on the practicalities/logistics? Have you had to make a similar choice? Does it sound like one would be a better fit? I was hoping someone could point out that I seem to want one more than the others based on what I've written, so please let me know if that is the case. Sometimes it just takes an objective perspective to tell us what we really want.

Thanks guys!

**TL;DR**: Can't choose between three very different but equally great programs: Emerson, UAL, or Columbia. Each has different class formats, costs, location, and learning outcomes. I'm completely torn. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

64ye67,2,2017-04-12,Study Abroad and On Campus Recruiting,lyon6530,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/64ye67/study_abroad_and_on_campus_recruiting/,"Hoping for some advice from those of you who've been in the same situation as I really am quite stumped right now.

I'm a rising Junior at a target with OCR. If it matters at all in this context, I have a 3.7, along with research experience in finance/economics and an IBD internship (non-BB but well-reputed financial conglomerate: think BNP, RBC, Wells Fargo...) lined up for this summer. Because of certain constraints, I will only be able to study abroad Junior Fall. As part of my curriculum, I will be placed into an internship while I'm abroad (likely in finance).

My understanding is that since the past year or two, OCR for SA positions have been pushed forward to the Fall semester (at least at my University as this has been confirmed by our on-campus recruitment staff.) There are clearly pros and cons to my situation:



Pros:

If this decision were to be made on a purely personal and not professional basis, studying abroad is clearly the better decision for me in terms of mental health (needing a break from burnout), desire to travel and experience a new city (instead of visiting, for say, a week), etc...

The city (a financial capital) I'll be travelling to I can see myself potentially working in or studying in at some point in the future, and so this will be a chance for me to ascertain if it is indeed somewhere I'd like to spend substantial time in. I probably won't get a chance to spend this much time in another city with this little responsibility after graduation.

The university career centre will arrange an internship for me, which, although likely won't be at a well-reputed BB will still provide me with an interesting experience of working abroad and within finance/business. I'm not sure if this point is immaterial or not, but maybe this saves me the trouble of having to apply to a myriad of internships in my home city for the Fall semester if I were to stay.



Cons:

Primarily, that I won't be in my home city for an OCR, which for the most part will take place while I'm abroad. Also, not being able to network during Fall semester events.

The classes that I will take abroad will be of a similar calibre (in terms of quality of teaching) and will be relevant to my major, although the classes I would otherwise take in my home city will be most relevant in terms of being able to choose from a larger number (and thus potentially better) professors, more business classes, the perfect timing for particular classes given other requirements etc...

Lack of continuity in certain aspects. For example, not being able to apply for leadership positions in finance and non-finance clubs.

My question is whether or not you think I should study abroad, given the constraints (of not being able to do so any other semester) and pros/cons listed.

Although the career centre has reassured me that many companies are willing to conduct phone and virtual interviews, there are some, I'm sure, that will be reluctant to do so. What is the logic here (referring specifically to BBs)? Is it that there are as many qualified candidates locally that BBs will not be inclined to be inconvenienced to set up virtual interviews? Or do they encounter so many students studying abroad that they generally accommodate for these situations? Might they accommodate because they truly want the best candidates out of the pool?

I know that a few BBs have begun to conduct first round interviews through online platforms such as HireVue, and that some are willing to fly SA candidates out for super days when it comes to that stage, but how common is this? Which specific firms (BB or boutique) do this? Or, in other words, how much of a disadvantage would I really be at if I do decide to study abroad? I'm currently leaning towards studying abroad based on my feeling that I might really regret not doing so, and staying for an internship I may or may not get seems counterintuitive. I think a lot of this rests on whether or not I'm competitive enough to even get the initial OCR interviews.

What would you do?

Thanks in advance!"

The person I was shadowing seemed pretty negative, the office he was working in didn't have windows, and the building we were in seemed generally bleak. I was wondering if anyone has some more positive experiences they'd like to share about working there?

EDIT: 
Some more info about the job shadow: I was setup to shadow (essentially follow around an employee while they worked, learn about what it's like to work for Qualcomm, get a more casual tour of some buildings at HQ - San Diego, CA, get general career advice, etc.) through my college's career services center. It wasn't necessarily for an internship or job, it was just an opportunity to get to know someone on the inside of the company so that I had a contact to reach out to if I decided to seek out a real opportunity there later on. The guy I was put in contact with ended up being kind of shitty; relatively negative, and almost no communication about details of the job shadow after I had already been accepted to it. Safe to say he hasn't been a point of contact for me there. I'm just hoping that this experience isn't indicative of the company as a whole as I'm interviewing for a really awesome position there now."

64zhav,354,2017-04-12,"New grads and people looking for entry level or internship roles, let me help you with your reach outs to recruiters.",AverageJoeAudiophile,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/64zhav/new_grads_and_people_looking_for_entry_level_or/,"I'm a recruiter at one of the Big-N tech companies in Silicon Valley that people want to work at. I get as many well though out and earnest messages from people looking for entry level or internship positions, as I send out to people who look like a fit for my roles. Our two experiences actually have significant parallels. 

The issue then is often not what you are saying or how you say it, but **WHO** you are saying it too. Are you saying it to the person who can actually help you?

Just the same as I wouldn't want to message a JavaScript developer when the role is actually looking for Core Java developer. You shouldn't reach out to just anyone with the word Recruiter in their title. 

Most of the bigger orgs out there have hundreds (if not thousands) of in-house recruiters broken out into often very specific business needs or technical domains, and may not have immediate easy viability into what another part of the organization is doing/needing or who might even support those roles. In addition to being unable to absorb the time sink in being a middleman.

There are also often divisions between what these companies would call a UR or University Candidate (depending on the org 6-12 months from graduation date) and an Industry Candidate (depending on the org 6-12 months after graduation date); and who can even talk to them about roles. If a company has a UR recruiting team, chances are ONLY the UR recruiting team can help you with internships or because you are still considered an UR candidate based upon your graduation date. Regardless of the end role, your status as UR or Industry would supersede the details of the job description. 

To help find the profiles of recruiters who you should invest your efforts into, try this search string in Google and adjust the variable for your company of choice. This should significantly narrow down your results to people who are most likely to support the types of internship/new grad roles and hopefully get you connected with them more quickly.

There is nobody I want to talk to.,inheritanceofcrazy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6501wc/i_want_comments_from_redditors_there_is_nobody_i/,"My plans might lead me to become homeless. I am planning to flee, leave everything and everybody and go somewhere I don't have a chance to meet these people again. The past few weeks have been (10 weeks) have been awful. I feel so suffocated. I have now stopped caring about myself, and just the idea that one day I will have an opportunity to run away from home, keeps,me alive everyday. I had even thought of ways to end myself if need be, which seemed very much in that week, even tho I had once told my sister once and strongly believed that I would never commit suicide no matter what, neither should anybody else. Then I thought it would be terrible to kill myself at home . So I decided to flee. First I thought just like that one night I will just go when everybody is sleeping. Then since I had to still wait for the right opportunity to run away ( because if I am found doing that or after that, even I can't imagine what would be done to me). So while I had to wait, I thought I might as well discreetly prepare a bag of few clothes and ATM card . Then since the wait was longer and all I had to do all day was nothing but think wild, I thought since I am the youngest and if I flee , my elder sisters would not get married because in our society its shameful for someone to run away, especially if its a girl. Then I decided that I will cut off all ties with family after they get married . And now this thought has ever been since with me. 

,the conditions have improved a bit meanwhile, like I am not being screamed at and humiliated as much as when I thought it was better to hang myself and I started looking for sturdy things on ceiling for it. But I still remember the rage and hate and utter disdain on my fathers face, and my brother , tho still, but a little less, chides me for withdrawing myself. He must have wanted to call me bitch and all, but all says is fatass. I used to think them to be my heroes, but it changed , few months back for my father and recently for my brother. Now I feel nothing but hate when I think of him. My mother does the same things and even thinks its okay for him to hit me, and that I deserve it. Its her OCD that drives her like a rabid bitch. Ever since, her OCD has heightened she is out of control, doing and saying things like a psycho. But I blame my father for her condition; I have inferred it in my head. So that makes me hate him so much. First he makes my mother sick, and does nothing about him, and then like an atrocious dictator tries to control everybody.

This all is what I think, my opinion. These are facts too, but others may see it in a different way and find me wrong. And I don't mind. I am just here to speak my mind, with or without being judged. Things are nasty, and being left alone with myself, I might have made them up 10 times nastier. 

This January I moved back to home after completing my graduation and internship. I was a medical student in the best medical institute of my country, probably Asia too. I wasn't the best in my class tho. After internship, according to my brother's plans, we were supposed to go back to home ( in a different state) and prepare together for our next exams, me for admission in post graduate (hopefully from the same institute) and brother for dm ( he also is a doctor, same institute, he being the eldest had set high bars for us). But after we came home, my mother's OCD was aggressively out of control. Dad used to even beat her up when he got angry at her mostly because of her ocd practices. Her tongue would run wild and she would poop from her mouth. So one day , after one incident of being chided ( also I had been angry that day at my brother because he had done something) , I became angry (in my mind) and stopped responding to the parents or brother. I stayed withdrawn. Didn't talk started eating less. Remained alone in one room all day. Didn't even study for the exams. This behaviour made my father angry and he would scream and threaten me everyday ( I have seen the madness in his eyes), but I still acted the same. Same things happened each day, me being alone , dad coming and cursing and what not. It was during one such days that I thought of taking my life, later of running away, still later of post poning the running away for the time being. As of now, the intensity of things has decreased but the theme is all the same.

I am 23 btw and a female. I had so many hopes and dreams of becoming the doctor I wanted to be . Now it just doesn't seem possible. I am ruining my own life. I am not studying. I have left all hopes. And all I think of is how much I hate them and how much I wanted to get away from them so that all this ends. You can't imagine how sad it is to have to know that you could have been so much, but have to see your dreams dying. I feel lime there's no point in living, but ,so, instead I am leaving. Leaving for nothing, to nothing, just leaving, lime that. I know I will end homeless in a 3rd world country and oh where rapes are rampant, but I would risk it to end this. 

Today I chatted with my junior in the institute. She said she missed me and hoped I will be back in soon. No ducking way that is going to happen. I wish I could do something about me. But I have no will, no hope, no motivation, no way. The only way is away from it. This idea of running away is frightening, debilitating, yet freeing. Leo di caprio was right about it in inception.

I don't know what and how to do at this point. And at this point it might be that its very late. I am already regretting living this life, way I used to do when I was kid. Nm

I'm noticing a trend that there are only 3 points of entry into large corporations.  
1.  College internship.  
2.  Some flavor of ""Development Program"" for current students or recent graduates.  
3.  Regular positions which require 2-3 years of previous professional work experience.  

I can apply for none of the above and here is why:    
I graduated almost two years ago with no internships or work experience.    
Up until recently my time has been occupied by providing care for a loved one, which is a personal story, the details of which I'd prefer to avoid.  This means I've not been employed.     

So I can't apply for positions requiring years of experience.  If I do, the applications are not being considered.   
As I'm not a current student, this makes me ineligible for most internships.   
Since my graduation date is past the deadline of many ""Development Programs"", I am getting automatically redirected to apply for the more experienced positions.  

I believe my best bet is to find a way of personally contacting the recruiters working at these companies.    
I could explain that although I may be past their graduation date requirements, I would still like to be considered for these positions and belay any potential concerns over skill stagnation as I have spent all my spare time continuing to learn about and write software.

Workforce as a help desk intern at the age of 18, sure I knew how to build a custom PC and reformat a HDD at the time when I started, so I knew some basic stuff I had learned at home playing StarCraft. For the newbies out there, it will be extremely hard at first, grasping the new technology and the lingo of the I.T. business world. I remember walking in one day planning to do my help desk tickets in the queue and a co-worker goes ""You want to start managing Active Directory?"" That was the beginning of a career, and oddly enough I had no clue what Active Directory even was, Exchange? What is that? I thought email was gmail.com? And I thought Outlook was just some app people used instead of gmail.com or mail.yahoo.com. Don't even approach me with Linux sendmail, back then I would have said ""I've never touched Linux.""

Fast forward 9 years and I have built 2 datacenters, configured numerous SANs, NAS, fabrics, servers, operating systems, firewalls, routers, switches, VPN networks, WAN edge routers, load balencers, ESX servers, clusters, etc., and I am currently deploying my first enterprise IaaS/DBaaS stack for enterprise cloud computing using Nomad/Docker and a custom front end written in HTML5/Jquery.

So the gist of all this is if you're a newbie, don't get discouraged, instead keep barreling through the ranks of the I.T. world and absorb everything you can from your mentors. Looking back, I wish someone would have told me ""That guy that you see doing all the advanced stuff, he used to not even know what an IP address was"", because 9 years ago I was so overwhelmed at times I was discouraged thinking i'd never be able to learn it all.

To end on a high note, thanks to /r/sysadmin as a whole as well. I have asked numerous questions here over 9+ years and have had all of them answered. Thanks for the generosity, and hopefully someone can read this and go ""Hey that's me, I don't know 90% of the stuff he mentioned but at least I know what Active Directory is, so i'm light years ahead of where he was."" Then the post is worth it as it'll give a little confidence boost, or at least I hope it does for that future sysadmin or devops engineer reading this."

&amp;nbsp; 

**Background**


**Work experience:**
Currently 3 years of experience (5 years at matriculation) in a corporate finance environment at a well known company in the space industry (SpaceX, ULA, Orbital ATK). Currently a Senior Financial Analyst (three years, two promotions). I made senior a year or two early, so position may remain the same until application. Responsibilities have been FP&amp;A related for the first year and two years doing cost modeling for proposals (up to multi-billion dollars in size). Many proposal activities have been in lead roles where 1-3 of around 10 analysts would work under me at any given time. Mix of commercial and defense related business with major customers being NASA and the DoD.


**Extra curriculars:**

One year at a children's hospital working directly with kids/families/nurses in-hospital (~200 hrs/yr)

Two years at Junior Achievement leading groups of kids through business and personal finance simulations (~72hrs/yr)


**Undergrad school/major:** BBA in Finance at unranked State School


**Sex:** Male


**Age:** 28 at matriculation


**Race:** South-East Asian; First-generation American Born

&amp;nbsp; 

**Stats**


**GMAT Score (include breakdown!):** 730 on practice tests (hoping for 750)


**Undergrad GPA:** 3.1


**Explanation for GPA:** Hoping to explain in essays. Worked full time first two years to pay for college (parents could not afford), had a death of immediate family member during this time. Continued working part-time at internships last two years along with leadership roles in clubs. Slight upward trend, but balancing everything was challenging for me at first.

&amp;nbsp; 

**MBA Info**


**Goal of MBA:** Reaching goal would be to move into management consulting. I would like to remain in the aerospace/space industry because I have been getting a lot of direct experience with launch vehicles. The industry is growing and very challenging to work in, which has kept my interests. My backup would be to move into management in either Finance or a more Operations focused role in the industry to start getting more involved in the overall business at a higher level.


**Target schools:** Targeting Top 15's (maybe too high). Still trying to find what schools would be within my range and suit my goals the best. Any advice here is greatly appreciated!"

Also, what are some good courses that would look good on a resume that also give certifications. Obviously coding is pretty good skill (I signed up for a CS50 course online) but what other stuff is there.

I'm a high school senior who was accepted to both UVA and UW-Madison. I have a scholarship that requires me to major in CS, and I am thinking of doing a double major in math. The area of CS I'm most interested in is cryptography, hence the math major.

Basically, I need to choose one of those schools. Forgetting about cost, location, college atmosphere, etc, which school would you recommend based solely on these two points?

1. Amount of CS I will learn (this is what I care about)
2. Chance of getting a good job out of college (this is what my parents care about)

I would like to go to Wisconsin because I feel like I will learn more CS there, they also have more cryptography/computer security courses there. My parents want me to go to UVA because it is more prestigious and ""undergrad doesn't matter that much.""

Also quick question for internships - what's the chance of me getting a CS job/internship over the summer at this point (it's almost halfway through April)? Where can I find companies that hire interns out of high school?

Thank you in advance."

I checked the FAQ but I'm not sure that my question was fully answered. I saw people referring to taking time off to travel, have experiences, or work in other careers, but not taking time off and not doing anything productive in that time.

I'm about to graduate from college with a double major in computer science and mechanical engineering. I had one internship last summer, and have been involved in a project with two professors for the past 5 years. I'm currently 23 years old. I took a year off during my college career due to a diagnosis of breast cancer.

Last week, I found out that my cancer has returned. From my experience with treatment last time, I don't believe I'll be able to work until the treatment is over. Fortunately (or unfortunately?), I haven't yet found a job. I'm not sure how long it will take to beat this time, though I'm hoping it will be about the same amount of time or a bit faster.

I wasn't worried about taking time off last time, but this time I'm worried, especially considering I'm just now graduating. How much will it impact my career to take time off to treat and recover? I'm planning on trying my best to work on personal projects and keep up on coding, but I'm not confident I'll be able to do so. Also, how would you suggest that I explain a break in my work and personal history to interviewers once I do get to that point?

Or you can Bust, and continue living your mediocre life in Canada, where you will never find happiness nor true love.

6543um,1,2017-04-13,Junior in college and about to fail out. Any advice on what to do?,kyonzp,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6543um/junior_in_college_and_about_to_fail_out_any/,"Hey all. Like the title says, this is my situation right now and am in need of advice on what to do. I'm really sorry beforehand if what I type is about to be really incoherent and here is some background of how I let myself get to this point.

During high school, I was never one that put in too much effort into school, but enough that I never skipped class and turned in almost all my assignments. I never knew what I wanted to do, but decided to go to college because that was what everyone including my parents decided was ""good"" for me (went to one of those schools where everyone fought over class rank and the common thought was anyone who doesn't go to a 4 year after high school was an idiot).

Freshman year went well, I had a minor mess up in a math class but then retook it and got an A and ended up on the honor roll. I started to be a lot more reclusive though, and in retrospect I should have realized and done something about it sooner.

Sophomore year started off okay, until I missed a few lectures of a class and started being too scared of going back so I ended up only going for exams and lab sessions (where the teacher would not be there). I managed to pass the semester, but second semester of sophomore year was when shit hit the fan. I started missing a lot of classes, had a lot of insomnia and narcolepsy issues (I couldn't sleep at night, and would fall asleep even while standing up during the day) and barely eating anything. Around this time the stomach problems I had before worsened due to it and I ended up going to the school clinic and eventually got an endoscopy outside of the clinic for issues related to it. My grades tanked because I was never in class and I ended up going to the counseling center because at the time I had no idea what to do. My family had no idea what was going on and I did not want to tell them about any of this. Eventually I got diagnosed with dysthymia and major depressive disorder which also branched out into anxiety. I started taking meds and was able to withdraw from the semester and appeal to go back to school Junior Year.

First semester of Junior Year went well at first. I was on medication and forming habits to get my act together and was really doing well with not missing classes and getting everything done, until about 2 weeks before the semester ended where the only word I could use to describe what happened was relapsing. Again, I could not get out of bed and basically all the problems I had the semester before came back even worse. I ended up having to do an incomplete for 2 courses because I missed the final and am currently making up in my current semester in college. Talking to the counselor started helping a lot less too because she seems to think my problems was the school's workload when it is not and I started lying about my situation a bit. For example, I told her I was going to class sometimes during the last weeks when I didn't.

This semester was by far the worst in that my insomnia, fatigue, eating, and head is just really messed up. It started off okay, with me going to class until I got too sick and then ashamed to, and then to just feeling too sick to. The last time I went to anything in the early afternoon was to a psychiatrist appointment about a month ago and I ended up sitting by the road on the way back to my dorm dry heaving because I was too nauseous to keep walking. I missed a counseling appointment a month ago that I still haven't made up and keep postponing my appointment with my psychiatrist after that as well. The prescribed sleeping aid I got only made me extremely tired, but didn't actually get me to fall asleep and as of now I'm falling asleep around 8-9am and waking up in the late afternoon. 

My parents still have no idea that this is happening, and I know I have to tell them sometime before the semester is over that I failed out. I want to tell my mom first, but she is out of country receiving treatment right now and I really have no clue how to break it to her. She and my dad still thinks I'm going to find an internship this summer and always thought of me as ""the smart one"" in the family and I have no idea what their reaction would be. I've tried telling my mom I was depressed in high school once, and was dismissed because I didn't act like any of the patients in the psych ward when she worked at a hospital back in the day. I think telling my dad first would be worse because of the two he is really pressuring me into getting an internship and jumpstarting my career. I'm also terrified of telling them any of this as pathetic as that sounds.

Outside of telling my parents, I am thinking of working somewhere a bit to save up some money and at least get some order back in my life and then going to community college to get some credit hours. Are there anything else I should look into or anything I should keep in mind? Sorry to sound really overdramatic throughout this entire post but I just feel like I have wasted all my time up to now. Not only with choosing to go to college, but for always being too afraid of messing up that I end up doing what I am told to/is accepted that now I really can't do much less figure out what I want. 
And that's all I have to say/ask.

Deadline to pick is coming up and I'm really struggling, please help me out. I'm an international student by the way.

I want to work in the US or Canada, possibly Germany (but would prefer the US or Canada). Interested in starting my own company, but most likely will work for a big tech company.

**NYU AD advantages**:    

* Free (full ride).    

* Will be surrounded with very smart people.    

* Study abroad in London, Shanghai, NYC (and many other places I'm not interested in).    

* Paid summer internship in the US. This could potentially lead to a full time offer + visa sponsorship.    

* Better facilities.    



**NYU AD disadvantages**:    

* Weather. I don't particularly like the sun, and it's really hot and sunny there. Avg temp in August is 40C jesus...    

* More liberal arts focused. Not a big disadvantage since it courses I'm interested in.    

* Not sure about job opportunities.    



**Jacobs University Bremen advantages**:    

* Has a lot of people working for Google, FB, Microsoft. For a young university, that suggests their CS program is good. Good relationship with Microsoft as well from what I see.    

* More science focused.  
  
* Startup competition.    

* Germany &gt; Abu Dhabi for me.    

* 3 years to get a bachelors.    



**Jacobs University Bremen disadvantages**:    

* Have to pay 11k euros per year for three years. My parents can pay for it, but still a con.    

* Apparently, in Germany you're expected to get a Masters. Not sure if this affects me much, but yeah.    

* Financial troubles. Apparently it almost went bankrupt a few years ago before the city of Bremen and Jacobs Foundation pumped money into it. Enrolling and it going bankrupt would seriously fuck me over.    

* If I decide that CS is not for me, I'm not that interested in the other programs the university offers. It's unlikely that I'll change majors since I've been interested in CS since I was six, but it is a possibility and I like being prepared for everything.

However, I only have Lithuanian citizenship so I probably don't have privileges British citizens get in some Commonwealth countries.

Grads are plentiful so I was wondering about realistic chances of me being able to move from:

657fbp,4,2017-04-13,Is this an Internship or a potential Legal Trap?,munchkin1992,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/657fbp/is_this_an_internship_or_a_potential_legal_trap/,"I wanted advice on the internship offer, that sounds more like a contract job for a company that doesn't want to pay for an experienced contractor or be held liable for their past mistakes. It's a little long so I broke it up to help with readability: 
 
**The Internship/Job Post:** 
I applied to a temp remote paid internship for photo editing/photo research a few weeks ago for the relatively popular website. The job post specifically said Photo Research Intern and stated that no real experience in photo research or photo editing is required, just a background or love for photography. Shortly after applying I received an email from one of staff asking for a short bio and explanation of why I want the internship. In the email, they changed the name to just Photo Internship instead of Photo Research Intern. I wrote why I was interested and reminded that I applied to Photo Research position but was open to other photography-related tasks in the project.  
 
**The Company's Dilemma/Needs:**
After my response, a different person contacted me for a phone conversation to disclose the details of the internship. She basically tells me that they have a ton of blog posts that might have images that they weren't licensed to use because when they started the platform they didn't have a lot of knowledge of image copyright and pulled a lot of images from Google and other random sources. They need someone to go through all of their blog posts since 4 years ago and check or replace any images that do not have proper licensing before someone contacts them on copyright infringement. She said they would need me to start really soon. I responded on the phone that I'm still very interested because I would like to learn about photo asset management for a larger company. But I also mentioned I don't have professional experience with that. She seemed fine with it and told me she would be sending a contract for the internship for me to sign. She said I would be an intern on the payroll as an independent contractor. She didn't tell me the pay on the phone. 
 
**The Internship Contract/Terms:** 
I read the contract and immediately felt like the contract is asking for something completely different. It basically states that I would be a consultant/contractor agreeing to complete the following task:  
 
Photo research and other similar tasks. The project doesn't end until all content on the main website and other related platforms have been researched and replaced if needed. For 7 hour shifts at least 3 days a week with a payment of $90/shift. (Which the schedule can be changed by the company at any given time). 
 
Nothing is mentioned about it being an internship or a specific duration of the project in the contract. It also doesn't specify responsibilities or quantities of content that would need change. However, it says that the company can terminate the contract at any point for any reason, while I can only terminate if the company breaches the contract. And that's only if the breach isn't remedied with the 15-day notice of my termination through mail. If a dispute does arise then it can only be settled through arbitration court. I would be held accountable for any damages to the company related to my responsibilities. And I am also not allowed to take on any additional work that conflicts with this project or competes with their brand.  
 
**My concern/worries:**
In other words, this is basically a typical independent contract agreement, which I may have been fine with if there was clarity of my responsibilities, project duration, and better pay. My issue is that this doesn't sound like an internship, this sounds like a job for an experienced Photo Editor. And I am not experienced in that which I was upfront about. While I would like to gain experience and build connections for this type of job, I feel like signing this contract would be risky. Because I could be held legally responsible for something I have no real experience in and I could be responsible for their past mistakes in copyright. Also, I would be bound to this responsibility until ALL of their content has been checked (which they even told me they don't know how many posts they have over the past 4 years). Plus they post like 10 new blog posts every hour. So this project sounds endless, for very low pay and increasing responsibilities. Also, if I was offered a full-time job or other jobs that helped me make a living I might be held back by this agreement. I know you can end a contract at will but that can come with a penalty if you agreed to complete a task. And I would be waiving my right to take them to court. 
 
Am being too cautious/paranoid?  Can you pin such huge responsibility on an intern? Can interns be paid as independent contractors?

I don't want to agree to a huge legal risk that won't pay much and prevents me from getting better jobs all just for a nice spot on my resume. I also, emailed them back about my concerns, but they kind of brushed over them in my opinion. If you all would like, I can share more detail on that."

I have had 3 internships lasting continuously since January 2014.  I have a personal website alongside a Github.

My latest position has been at a well-known fortune 500 software company for a year and a half.  To be frank, my tenure as an intern has not been successful.  I have a number of small contributions, and one large web tool that I built (Angular SPA front-end backed by NodeJS app utilizing ElasticSearch).

On paper, I can spin these projects as being interesting and useful.  However, these contributions were in a lot of cases 'intern' tasks that were delegated to me for learning purposes (as opposed to solving business problems/adding measurable value to the team).  As time has passed, it has been difficult to get any work assigned to me (this is a heavily Ops-focused team in a very high-scale environment).

Since the end of this past summer, I stopped making an effort to work in the face of school in addition to growing apathy with the team/company.  As expected, I am not receiving a full time offer.  My internship ends soon and I am facing the dilemma of how to move forward.

My issue here is how to rebuild my credibility and put my career on an upward trajectory again?  I don't think I would get a strong reference (if any) from any of my supervisors at my current position.  This scares me because this position is longest and most substantial in my employment history.

I'm in the interview process with several companies.  I am not worried about getting to the final stages.  I'm pretty good at wooing recruiters/HR people and I'm working to hit algos/ds problems hard for the technical portion of things.

However, if and when I get to the offer stage.  It's going to be difficult to get references to back up the things I've done at my current internship.  Is this going to be a huge roadblock moving forward?

Should I focus on building credibility in other areas (e.g. open source projects) to draw attention somewhat away from my current position?

The first 6 months I spent traveling, but once I got home I had a quarter-life crisis. Since then I've been tutoring statistics, getting healthy, taking classes, teaching myself computer science, and doing some stand up comedy.

Recently I've finished some programming projects and uploaded them to github. They're nothing special, but they show that I have some level of competency. I feel like I have a ton more to learn, but I also feel like I need a real job fairly quick.

Ideally I'd like to work as a data scientist or a developer/engineer of some kind. I want a job were I have to learn and master a technology stack, that way I can build skills for future positions. I'm just unsure how to get started, and how to clear the hurdle of the extended gap in my resume.

I'm willing to go to grad school, but I need letters of recommendation and I'm not sure how to get them. A development bootcamp is also a possibility but I'd prefer to get a degree because I feel like it's a more reliable investment.

If you have any advice on what I should be focusing on next, please let me know. Here's what I'd like to accomplish:

* get a part time job or internship that forces me to have a regular schedule
* build references for grad school or better positions
* break out of my rut"

Look I know I should've been more social and made more friends so that way I would have more leads but that is in the past. I plan to be more social, try out some new hobbies, and improve my social skills so that way my second job will be obtained through a personal network. 

Anyways, I am in the final year of Industrial engineering and graduate in about a month with a 3.0 GPA. The problem is I don't have job offer in place.

I did find an internship through indeed.com but that was because of luck, my competition was other students, and employers mostly agree on the definition of an internship. 

Entry level can mean anything from straight out of school to ""at least 5 years of experience."" 

I applied to several dozen postings on Indeed.com, internships.com and my schools career page. Nothing seems to come up. Just a few interviews. 

I looked into a recruiting agency where I would take a 10-15% garnish on my wages since I am at this point desperate and I took 6 years to graduate, I really need to get my feet wet so that way I can start building my life, network, career, and be ready for the right woman before it's too late. Problem is many of these agencies don't have your best interest in mind and place you in whatever because they just want your money. 

Does anyone here have some good tips as to how I can effectively get a job if I don't have a large network of friends/family to help me? What is a good recruiting agency to use?"

Hey! So just I'm currently, credit wise a first-semester senior, but year wise a second-semester junior at a Big 10 school on the East coast. Essentially I was pursuing the wrong major (Biology) when I started university and failed calculus and got D's in both Chem I and Chem II. So after some reflection, I decided to switch my major and pursue another interest. 

-I am a double major in Political Science and French Language (GPA 3.7, 3.8 Respectively) Minor in International Studies (3.5)

- Exchanged at a prestigious university at during study abroad, Sciences Po Paris. 

- Currently conducting my own independent research at my school's Institute of Politics on media perception on US-Russia relations. 

 - Solid internship experience ( Pub. Finance at NYC Comptrollers office, pub affairs at NGO, pub. affairs at local senator's office).

 - A solid relationship with teachers/mentors/bosses for letters of recommendation. 

 - Graduating a semester early. 

 - Fluent in French (8th consecutive year studying), 

... What I'm concerned with is my current cumulative GPA at the moment is 3.1 - 3.2 because of my rocky start at university. 
I've shown interest, improvement, and self-development, but I'm worried about applying to graduate programs because of my rather weak GPA. I'm on track for a 4.0 at the end of this spring semester and that should bring me to a 3.25 or close to a 3.3

- Should I stay for the extra semester and try and boost it, or is it more impressive to graduate a semester early having had two majors and a minor? 
- What do you suggest if I'm really trying to apply to competitive programs at Ivys, or top tier schools, and top European schools?
- Do I stand a chance at competitive MPAs/ MPPs?

While the app didn't take me from rags to riches, the process of making it helped me a lot. 

I finally had something worthwhile to put on my resume, that was better than 'hey I've developed these apps, but they arent on the app store.' 

I dedicated a paragraph talking only about the technical summary of building my app. I talked about how I used CoreGraphics, AutoLayout, and how I monetized with Admob, amongst other things.

^This is the resume I would send out.

I focused on LOCAL companies, not the googles of the world. You guys need to remember that not every company can afford to spend $2k to fly you out. 

I applied to companies in northern va/dc area. I did NOT apply to 'junior' ios dev jobs or internships. I only applied to regular iOS developer jobs. And with this resume, I got about 20% callbacks. I sent out a good 30 applications, and in the past I would get practically 0% callbacks. 

At this point, once you have the interviews, the rest is on you. Thats my perspective. If I could just master iOS, I wouldnt even need my completed degree, considering companies would give me a shot even without one. (Otherwise, why interview me in the first place?).

I dont have stats on this, but anecdotally my friend who made an android app and published it also received a lot more callbacks, and now he works for a nice co. in san diego. If anyone has their own story that might be similar, id be interested in hearing them too.

65abuf,13,2017-04-13,Watch Out for Laowai Career Center &amp; Gi2c China Scam internships. They burned me to a crisp.,XpatInChina,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/65abuf/watch_out_for_laowai_career_center_gi2c_china/,"Although I applied for a job instead of one of their internships I met some of their pissed off interns complaining about just about everything from the smelly housing to having too many roomies they could not pick nor swap, to getting internship companies they never agreed to.  Here is my story. Be warned.

The last time I had my clock cleaned in China was with CUCAS two years ago, but this Laowai Career Center is so much more bold with their lies. Although they will ""find you a job/internship placement within 30 days"" as they say, it will not be the one you wanted nor the one you applied for nor the one you like.

They advertise heavily online and what they advertise are high-paying jobs or jobs that say ""travel the world for free"" or 'no weekend"" or ""free furnished apartment included"" or ""Fortune 500 company needs native-English speaker"". All these ads are hogwash. They use these fake jobs to collect a bunch of resumes. That's how they got mine. Yes, they are polite and friendly and even seem helpful. But I realized after I was swindled, they only told me what they wanted me to know. For example, that free furnished apartment came with two roomates and one was a Nigerian chain-smoker, and the other a guy from Pakistan who had Hepatitis and constantly argued with his GF on his cell phone - even at 1:00 am in the morning!

When I arrived in China it was to work as a Marketing Manager for a ""UK Finance Giant"" but turned out to be a telesales job for a small company called Montpellier that the expat people I cold-called said was a scam and angrily said they told Montpelier to stop calling them every month! When I demanded a refund after week one they pushed me to take a job teaching English that paid 10,000 a month, but all the other foreign teachers were getting 15,000. Guess where the other 5,000 was going?

I met two other LCC ""clients"" and one was offered $1,000 to make a ""promotional video"" with others but he later said that when he saw the video, they edited it to be a ""testimonial"" and that he demanded they take it off the internet and they refused. Two weeks later they invited me to a party and I noticed they had a girl and an Indian guy videotaping everything. They got a few drinks in me and then made the very same $1,000 offer to me and I sent them to hell.

In summary, this is a very tricky scam that peddles career dreams based on false images that they create for themselves. I met an employee named Rita and an older man named Stefan at the party and they both write blogs full time for Laowai Career Center saying how great China is to work but they never ever mention any of this here. https://scam.com/showthread.php?704467-UPDATED-China-Liars-List-ESL-TEFL...

Oh, I almost forgot, one of the other ""3,000+ satisfied clients"" was demanding a list from the Russian owner who started threatening her that he'd get her arrested and deported if she didn't ""stop making a scene"". She was asking him ""to list 10 Fortune 500 companies that LCC works with"" because at the orientation on the first day, he boasted that they were ""partners with over 100 Fortune 500 and MNCs in China."". When he couldn't answer her and kept changing the subject she started passing out something she copied from the internet about ""China's Legal Scams"". Here is the link of what she began to pass out. https://scam.com/entry.php?6418-Beware-of-China-s-many-Legal-Scams-like-... The owner took Kay outside of the conference center with another Chinese guy named ""Tommy"" and I never saw her again. I hope she is okay.

Just the night before Kay was telling us that she found out that the Russian owner also owns some other companies called Getin2China and Wiseway Global Education Group, and Gi2c which according to reddit are all scams too. I can't believe I was so stupid to fall for all their fakery, but I did. Kick me in the ass! http://reddit.com/r/chinascamcentral

Just Google ""Gi2c, Scam"" and read the stuff they have at realscam.com, and scam.com so you don't lose your time nor money. Learn from my  dumb blunder."

Currently only work every friday for 8 hours, but I make a decent wage until I get hired full-time.

Decided to go to dealership last Saturday. Credit score of 710. The manager said they only required car title to trade old car and pay stubs of current job. Gave him a 500 deposit. Promised that I would get my new car in 2 days (on monday) and my 500 deposit so I didn't need to do a down-payment. He was going to give me 200 towards vehicle. 

Sunday came. 

Monday came. No one called me. I called them, skipped school expecting to pick up car. I called them. They told me the car wasn't ready. Said they would call me the next day in the morning to get car.

Tuesday came. No one called in the morning. I call. The car salesman and the manger that dealt with me weren't even in for the day. I complained to another manager there. I was told the bank approved me, but they asked for pay stubs. Told them they had it. They decided to award me 500 for the trade in, and that the bank needed my 500. They had me come in to sign papers for the new car. It was sent to bank. They promised they would call the next day.

Wednesday came. The car salesman calls me. She apologizes for not being in work, BC she had something with school. She tells me she needed my old car registration. This was never mentioned before, but I emailed it to her. They said they'll have the car ready for me Thursday.

Thursday comes. No one calls. I call them. Now they tell me they actually need my W-2. Never was mentioned before. I email them the W-2. Later on the day, they called back saying they need a letter from my supervisor that I am hired there and that I will be hired in the next month. The bank thinks I won't make enough to pay for the car. Obviously, the w-2 from last year looks like shit. It was always something different everyday.

I am stressed out. I need a car for school and work. I already put insurance on the new car, and the bill was sent and I had already paid the month's bill for a car I still don't have yet. I gave my old car to them and signed papers. I was approved for the damn car. I don't know what to do anymore. I really need help and advice."

I've looked around online and haven't found too many concrete answers on this so I figured the good people of r/learnprogramming would be able to help out.

I'm wanting to know what some great resources are for someone to learn Java who is already very familiar with the basics, OOP, data structures, etc. in Python (or any similar language) and just want a more accelerated guide/tutorial that doesn't focus as much on the more trivial/fundamental concepts but more on the syntax, more complex concepts, and other things that differentiate the language from others. Many of the resources I've seen people recommend online have either been a bit too geared towards beginners or very outdated. Any other tips you may have (such as practicing by rewriting old Python code into Java) regarding learning another language most efficiently would be great as I'm sure many of you have been in a similar position to mine.

It's also a plus if I could get some advice on learning how Maven works as well! I'm not exactly familiar with what it does or how its used but everything I've seen online has been somewhat confusing or vague (maybe I just need an ELI5-like explanation)

Recently he opened a bootcamp focusing on business centric programming disciplines, specifically finance related. 

Looking at the program it is everything i want. The curriculum, the business alignment and the internships after the program. 

That said the only thing holding me back is fear. Surprsingly not fear that i wont be able to hack it no. Honestly introspecting my crippling fear is fear of hard work. 

Sure taking this on my grades might tank (im not cs major) but logically this isnt important when you can prove rare and valuable skills.

But the thought of staying up late after all my course work, endless frustrations at an accelarated pace terrifies me. The intensity of it all is what scares me i think. Yeah yeah i know im a pussy but thats the god darn honest truth. 

I was gona take on something along these lines eventually but the opportunity popping up threw  wrench in my plans. (Was planning on going at a moderate pace of a few cs classes a semester. )

Im now pressured to take this on because it'sworth it but damm is it out of my comfort zone. 

With my plans and aspirations yes i should go for it but he nagging feeling of anxietyty and fear wont go away. 

Id love to hear from those whove had similar crossing the Rubicon moments and how you handled your anxious brain

Not that I don’t enjoy the material; the classes and projects I’ve been in have all been interesting and I feel like I’ve learned a bit. However, I just seem to be the worst student in the program. I’m mainly posting this because I got a grade back on an exam, and I bombed it. This isn’t just one, it’s the most recent of dozens. And on Blackboard, the professor posted a graph/statistics of class grades, and I’m 20% below the mean, 21% below the median. I feel like it’s been this way for every class I’ve been in, always performing at the bottom. My GPA has never been above a 3. Up until last semester, it hadn’t been above a 2.5 either. I’ve somehow avoided probation, but that’s not saying much. It’s not as if I felt bad about the exams I took either; every answer I submitted, save for one or two out of several, were always answered with confidence, as I remembered from practice problems. I’ve abused office hours, used every tutoring opportunity, but I just can’t turn this around. My HW and project grades are stellar, but only count for 10% of the total, exams being ~60%-70% most of the time. I think in my entire technical college career, I’ve only gotten 4 B’s and A’s combined. .

I don’t know what to do. I’ve been unable to find an internship, despite interviewing at a handful (smaller ones, not the big-name ones), and I think that can be directly attributed to my abysmal grades. That doesn’t bode well at all for job prospects next year. And heaven knows I’ll need one to pay off these loans. I’m doubting my worth as an engineering student. They say “C’s get degrees” but on my college’s subreddit, people freak out over 3.3 GPA’s. My classmates will moan about getting a B- on an exam, saying it was terrible, etc… Is there really light at the end of the tunnel? I’ve got a year left and I doubt that year will have any major influence on my GPA. I’m thinking I’ll graduate with a 2.5, tops. What the hell do I do? I don’t have any networking connections, other than my closest friends, who (ironically?) have 3.8’s and jobs lined up immediately.

I’m not sure why I’m posting this. It’s a rant. Sorry for wasting your time.

TL;DR - I’m doing terrible and it’s almost the end of my undergrad and I feel like I’ve wasted it all academically

I've recently received several job offers coming out of a Master's degree program. One of them is a full-time, salaried position, while the other is an internship.

The full-time position is on the lower end in terms of salary, especially for the location and qualifications I bring.

The internship, however, is an hourly position. It's lasts for 6 months, and I can then either move on to bigger and better things or continue working with the company. 

The internship company can be quite insular and difficult to get into, which makes this internship opportunity tantalizing. However, I do feel apprehensive at taking the ""downgrade"" in the form of an internship?

I wanted to probe your opinions about the pros and cons of each.

Thanks so much for your help!

Rowan University is way cheaper but I heard Drexel is better for CS. I'm wondering which college would be more worth it in the long run. Like I'm assuming that Rowan would be really easy for me and I can do well there but is Drexel harder? I also heard you can get a job easily through internships at Drexel but is it that much better than Rowan? 

I honestly don't know much about college in general. I'm not that  passionate about CS either (I'm more into music production) but I have strict parents that want me to major in something lucrative and I have taken Java classes at school so I'm familiar with it and I'm fairly confident that I can learn it well. I used to be really into Computer Science but I kinda got turned off after my ""teacher"" of the course I took kept giving us tests every week and expecting us to learn on our own because he knew as little about java as we did. It's pretty pathetic I know but there was no one qualified to teach the course at my school so they just picked a random math teacher. So I'm kinda worried because yea, I can learn it on my own but I found myself really not wanting to. 

But anyway, personally, I'm not that interested in making tons of money in the future. I just want to live a life full of good experiences but people keep telling me that my views will change once I ""face the real world."" But at the same time I keep noticing that people make things seem a lot harder than they actually are. "

I am at a difficult fork in my career and would greatly appreciate your help. 

tl;dr - fork my career to IT or stay in supply chain?

I have a bachelor's in Business Administration but am also naturally very decent at programming/working with data. 

Previous job timeline:

Ericsson - Supply Chain Analyst Intern (6 months)

Ericsson - Supply Chain Analyst (1.5 years)

Ericsson - Warehouse Operations Manager (1 year, laid off)

Small Company - Data Scientist (4 months, quit)


Now I have a dilemma, I really didnt like working for Small Company so I started applying for new jobs. In the process, I got a contract offer for a DevOps Engineer from Southwest Airlines at $40/hour (83200/year). It is 26 miles from my house. I accepted this offer and am supposed to start on Monday.

Today, I got a full time offer from Lennox for an Inventory Planner position that pays 33.65/hour ($70k/year). It is only 8 miles from my house and is literally right next door to the university that I want to attend for my MBA. 

On one hand, I really want to get into IT because I enjoy that kind of work as well as the $, but this job is a contract so it is risky and also far from my house and where I want to go to school. But on the other hand, This other job after benefits is very comparable in salary to the contract position (which has some benefits) but is more stable and closer to where I want to go to school but in the supply chain field (less $). 

I am conflicted and would greatly appreciate your help.

CONTEXT: I have an assessment day at a mobile games company coming up, for an internship position. It is a data science/analyst role. Data science because previous projects have involved: 

""Predicting the long-term behaviour of game users from their actions in their first few sessions.
Predicting if a user will lapse from the game according to their recent behaviour.
Modelling a game subsystem or building a simulation to understand player behaviour and optimise the game’s design."" 

the job description says: Significant experience in working in Data Science, including the terminology and techniques that exist for finding insights in large datasets which I interpret as analysing the data created by the userbase of its games to monitor activity.

QUESTION: what do you guys, from your experience, think the questions will be in assessment day? They spoke about AB testing in the interview stage which I have never done before but understand the theory of. 

Also, in your general data science experience and intuition what would be the methods and practices used by data scientists in analysing user activity in games? 
Thanks for any help guys, I really want this internship, it seems like a really cool context to analyse human behaviour, and I want to be as prepared as possible.

Graduated from college, communication major, marketing minor.

I know this degree is really shit on by the community, but in reality I was not good at working with others. I changed a lot as a person in the program. However it did not have a lot of professional opportunities it seems.

Did not have any internships. Was on my own in another state, small college town, walked and took the bus everywhere so I didn't have many options.

After graduating I was doing the typical college graduate thing, living at home with my mom and her partner and applying for jobs.

No responses, continue applying.

Step parent who is the breadwinner randomly decides she wants a divorce and a sex change. Leaves my (actual) mother and I to fend for ourselves. I have no job, and desperately need one, so I apply for Walmart and work there to make ends meet.

My mom and I are renting a room from a friend, it's basically a gift because rent is $150/month.
We would not be able to survive without this huge favor.

Managed to save my money and buy my first car at age 25 by biking 10 miles to work every day.

Work ethic impresses upper management, begin training to be department manager, barely been there 3 months.

Over time I find I don't particularly enjoy the retail industry, but I continue pushing forward because I can't make ends meet with my measly $11/hour. I just want to make $35,000/yr on a job that I can exceed at and enjoy so that I can be independent and provide for myself. I know I can move up from there.

Over time I feel myself quickly burning out. I'm running out of gas in retail. I do not enjoy working in such solitary work. There is no problem solving, I just work in a freezer and count things making sure everything is accurate, I change prices and organize merchandise. Extremely simple and uninvolved work.

The work is incredibly simple and my mind struggles to keep paying attention. It's going okay, but not great and I can't continue this for much longer.

The next promotion to assistant manager doesn't look like it is much better. I need to get out of Walmart.


What can I do from here? I have 7-8 months at Walmart. I'm the very picture of a star employee there, I show up on time, I do my work, and I help customers every once in a while. I don't feel good about what I do at all. In fact I am absolutely loathing retail. It doesn't feel even the slightest bit impactful because the next day I just do the same thing all over again. In addition I do not feel I am gaining the professional skills for the white collar job I want to get.

I am starting to suffer from depression because I feel I am going nowhere in life.

I know I should have done internships in college but I had no time with being a student in a small college town with no car.

I feel that I should apply for more jobs, but I don't know where. I enjoy video games, I have a good understanding of social media and marketing because of my degree, but I don't get any response from these companies due to my lack of experience, which I can't seem to find any way to get. I have good analytical skills, I think business analyst might be a good path?

I feel that I have narrowed my options down to three.

1. Apply for any jobs within my degree in any state. Then hope.

2. Go back to school, study another field. I particularly enjoy the gaming industry, I like computers, business analysis, market research, etc. I would focus on internships this time because I have a car.

3. Join the military, get experience in something. Make a more livable wage.

I'm at a loss here for what to do. Any ideas?

65effr,1,2017-04-14,Advice on crafting a resume for Data Science.,G_MoneyZ,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/65effr/advice_on_crafting_a_resume_for_data_science/,"Helllo,

I was wondering if someone could give me advice on what I should do to build a strong resume for a data science position.

Currently, i am finishing my junior year studying Engineering Physics at a the University of Illinois. I always had a knack for numbers, and have thoroughly enjoyed probability and statistics my whole life. Because of this, I decided i want to pursue a data science career. 

Ideally i would have planned on doing this when i first started college, but i didn't realize what i wanted to do until this past winter. This makes me feel a little behind the ball in terms of building a resume. 

I am taking some 400 level statistics courses, along with an intro cs course on java (intended for cs majors so it is relatively in depth and goes over major concepts). 

As of right now I can say i have basic knowledge of java and python along with advanced knowledge in mathematics, physics and statistics. I realize my weak suit is cs skills, and it is something i am working to improve. 

I applied for some internships over this summer, and i heard back from IBM however for various reasons i wasnt able to follow up with the next steps in the process. I also feel that I might be in over my head if i jumped in right now because my cs skills arent as great as they could be ( I can write basic programs and understand the topics i have been taught, i just need more practice to hone my sills).

This summer my plan was to take a course or two at university, while doing a cs project that I can put on my resume and gain further experience. 

Here lies my question. what languages are most valuable that i should make a project in? I can do it in python or java and develop those skills more, or I was thinking I could try and do something in R and get some exposure to that. I basically want to do whatever looks best to put on my resume. 

furthermore, I have some basic ideas of what kind of program i would want to write, but i am not sure if they would be too complex for me at this stage. Could you point me in a direction as to what i should write ( or does it even matter that much to employers?) and what language would be best to practice over this summer so i can try to enter the field next may after i graduate?

If my plan doesnt seem solid and you think there is a better way i could spend my time, i would love to hear it. Thanks so much for taking the time to read this and i would really appreciate any advice or guidance to get me closer to my goal and entering the real world.

65egy9,7,2017-04-14,RETURN,NGISEHTROFKOOL,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65egy9/return/,"I'm not really sure how to begin this. He said it was for a larger audience. That I should make it sound like a story. I don't know what the fuck that means, but he gave me some talking points so I guess I'll just start.

My name is Caleb. I was born in a little-known town in Arizona. Growing up, I [split](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dnc2l/wellspring/) my time between there and Arkansas, which is where my dad lived. But I went to high school and college in Arizona. 

I guess this is where I talk about Addy. That was supposed to be the focus of this, anyway, and I hate talking about my childhood. Addy and I went to the same high school together, which is where we met. We ran in different friend circles, but there was one guy who was familiar with both groups and often encouraged their merging during parties or anything else fun that usually needed a bunch of people. His name was Aidan, and he was always brewing some kind of trouble, determined to make our existences in the otherwise sleepy farm town exciting and lively. He wanted us all to have teen years we'd always remember.

Anyway, pretty much every other week he'd plan something big, and then he'd try to get as many of us as possible from both circles to meet up in the courtyard sometime before school ended for the week so we could get the details straight. On this one particular Friday, he was planning an adventurous hiking trip that involved a treasure hunt of some kind or another. Most locals rolled their eyes whenever someone talked of seeking ""[treasure](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dr8qk/languish/)"" - the place used to be an old mining town, and everyone just *knew* there had to be gold somewhere before they found that the real prize was the drug ring downtown - but Aidan could make anything sound fresh, new, and fun. Most of my stoner friends were down, but most of the other group had ducked out during the week's planning process as final exams weren't far off. However, two of them did come over to say they were in. They were Addy and Kira.

Both seemed rather...mysterious. I know that sounds dumb, but it's the only adjective I could think of. Both seemed to have this ever-present half-smile on their faces, just shy of a smirk, and everything that slipped free of it was either a hilarious deadpan comment or something...[knowledgeable](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dwcp3/satiation/), I guess. They were the only ones during that hiking trip that seemed to have an idea of what they were doing. Prior to that, when we met on that Friday at school, I thought maybe they were a little stuck up and going to make the whole thing a pain in the ass. But we had a lot of fun, and I found myself constantly circling back to the two of them. I never knew what either would say next.

Despite looking vastly different from one another, they operated as if they were twins. They'd share pointed glances with one another that clearly contained a large volume of unspoken content. They had so many intricate inside jokes that their conversations often sounded like code. And they had a habit of either finishing each other's sentences or speaking the same thing simultaneously. It took a while to get used to them, but once I did, I found they had their own personal quirks that made them each uniquely endearing. 

For instance, Kira was clearly the most mischievous of the two and hatched some crazy ideas. Addy seemed to be the voice of reason, even if it was a fairly quiet and easily-convinced voice. She also had more stamina and [resilience](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3e0tmg/inveigle/), though, so while Kira was the one that convinced us to do something, Addy was who kept us going. Addy was also content to let conversations drift into long moments of contemplative silence, which I found sorta nice. Kira's mouth ran as fast as her brain, and anything was on the table. When Addy did talk, you could tell each word had been carefully chosen for a specific purpose, and you enjoyed every bit of it.

Sorry, I'm going into tangents. But I feel like it's important to know why I cared so much about this person. 

The hiking trip was less than successful in terms of treasure hunting, but we had a blast regardless. Our circles continued to try to hang out as often as possible, but we broke off into smaller, more contained groups, especially as graduation loomed before us. I started to spend most of my free time with just Kira and Addy. On weekends we’d spend entire days wandering the streets of our town, discovering new and hidden things that would otherwise remain in [darkness](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3e5udf/in_piae_memoriae/). We’d also drive down a rather large road that spiraled off into the depths of our local forest and randomly pick a trail to hike for a few hours. We usually rounded off the day with finding someplace high to sit on, despite my fear, and watch the sun dip beyond the horizon. I never spent more time outside than when I was with them.

Graduation came and went. Kira ran off with her family for the summer, who surprised her with a trip to Europe. It was a bit weird at first to have our friend group reduced to two, even if only temporarily. But I still enjoyed and sought out Addy’s company. And it was during these weeks, when I was completely surrounded by Addy’s presence, no longer pleasantly and routinely interrupted by Kira’s, that I began to truly savor the nuanced nature of it.

I’m not sure how much deeper I can get. He said to talk about Addy, to fully explain what made her so great, and why I got involved. But how can you explain a sunset to someone who’s never seen it? You can try your best, but you’ll never capture every color and detail.

Here’s what I can say: she’s soft-spoken. She’s well-read. She’s the kind of friend you could call in the middle of the night to ask for a ride home because you’re drunk and stupid and an hour away from her, and she’d pick you up in 45 minutes. She plays the guitar really well but keeps it hidden away and only plays it when her mind becomes too [tangled](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3ebzko/detonation/). She has a beautiful perspective on life; she likes being humbled and afraid by the enormity of it. She’s saved me more times than I can count. Her laugh is the best sound I’ve ever heard.

It’s probably fairly obvious, but if you haven’t guessed, I was hopelessly in love with her. Kira came back and everything changed. I could no longer find a moment alone with Addy, and their dynamics bled into each other once more. I tried to make my feelings known, but seemed to be rejected at every advance. Finally, I’d had enough, and when my dad offered to have me live with him until I figured out this whole college thing, I jumped at the chance. I left without saying goodbye.

I heard various rumors. Kira was offered a lucrative internship in Washington. She took it, but amazingly, Addy stayed where she was. Eventually mutual friends would reach out to me and ask if I had been talking to Addy, as she seemed more and more withdrawn. She blew off dates with most friends, and when she was with them, she was ultra paranoid. She told one friend, Andrea, that people were following her, but that she couldn’t figure out why. I began to grow concerned despite myself, but I had no way of contacting her and didn’t feel comfortable asking anyone for her info. A few more weeks went by; in that time, a couple of my friends asked if I wanted to be their roommate for a nice place they’d gotten in Phoenix. I had [grown](http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2015/06/the-cursed-forest-of-massachusetts/) bored with Arkansas and was really excited to see old friends again.

Just before I moved, I got a call from a number I didn’t recognize.

“Caleb, it’s me. It’s Addy,” said the broken voice I used to know on the other end. “I’m sorry to do this, but...I really need your help. You’re the only person I can reach out to with this.”

And just like that, I was reeled back in. I like to think it was because I was genuinely concerned, but a part of me thinks that I’ve always been addicted to her words, and this was the kind of hit you just can’t turn down.

I don’t know how much more I’m supposed to divulge. He said not to give too much away on *how* involved I was. At least not right away. But I did what I had to do, and never heard from her again.

More weeks passed. Friends came to me again, but this time to ask if I’d seen or heard from her at all. Then the police came, with similar, darker questions.

I visited our town. Her face on faded print-outs dotted the town subtly, peeking out at me when I least expected it. They estimated that she’d been missing for at least two months before people became sincerely worried. There was an additional person; her new roommate, Jenna, was also gone, and she couldn’t be crossed off the list as a suspect. Her situation was the saddest of the two, I think, because she wasn’t the one people asked about when she [disappeared](http://99wfmk.com/gladwinforest/#photogallery-1=1). She had no next of kin, and she’d lost touch with her friends the year before. Like Addy, she quit her job about a month before her approximate vanishing. There was nothing left to miss her except for a dusty cello.

I started making trips to the town more often. I wanted to help any way I could. Addy’s car was found on the side of that forest road the three of us used to frequent. People would take trips into the forest, working their way outward, looking for these two girls. They weren’t ever successful.

Then, I had an idea. I got curious. Again, not sure how much I can give away. Not that I remember most of it, anyway.

The important part is when I came back. I woke up in the storm drain, hyperventilating, my labored breathing ricocheting off the concrete all around me. Blood dripped from my head and was dried on my shirt, along with mud and god knows what else. I was clutching a picture in my fist - when I smoothed it out, I saw two girls standing next to each other, flash [revealing](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3fu794/refuge/) them in the dark, surrounded by thick woods, their clothes in a similar disarray as mine, their backs to the camera. They looked as though they were sleep-walking.

I blacked out again.

When I came to this time, I was sitting in a running shower, fully clothed. It was startling, and I had no idea how I got there, but I knew I had to clean myself up. There was a fresh pile of clothes waiting for me on the sink.

Then I met him. He told me as much as he could. He said I had to stay “[contained](http://www.nuclearflower.com/zone/zone08.html)”. Said that I had to do what he said if I wanted everything to go back the way it was. That he didn’t have Addy, but he knew what was happening to her, and that we were the only people who could stop it.

I have been gone for almost four years. I don’t know how that’s possible. My memories are fragmented at best, but he said what I have is good. They’re usable. I’m currently in a house, apparently under [protection](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3msyub/etadiuqil/). I don’t know what will happen next. I just want to go home, and I want to know that Addy and Jenna are safe and sound, even if I never see or hear from them again. I don’t want to live with these memories, but he said I have to if we’re ever going to save them.

I’m sending all of this to you. You said you’ll take it from there. You seem to know what you’re doing, and [I](https://www.reddit.com/user/NGISEHTROFKOOL) really, really hope you do. Please don’t fuck this up.

I've tried to explain my situation with the company, and although they do sympathize with my situation, it doesn't look like they'll be able to accommodate me.

As much as this sucks, I'm trying to look for alternatives to what I can do over the summer. Since I won't be able to be employed at any internship, I was thinking of taking classes and volunteering at places (since that's legal). My question is, what kind of volunteer work should I look for to help build my resume? Thank you."

I have a mediocre GPA (~2.7) and my work experience is comprised of being a Teaching Assistant for a Data Structures course at my school and an internship with a small local nonprofit that not many people have heard of. I have a Github page with 4 projects I've worked on, some in school and some on my own, and feel like I can talk at technical depth about all of them.

I've only heard back from around half a dozen companies in total out of the 40-50 I've applied at, two of which offered me on-site interviews. Of the two on-sites, one company turned me down and the other wants to hire me but has to wait for a contract to be approved before I can officially start working, which could take months and may not even happen at all in the worst case.

I think the reason why I'm not hearing much back is because I don't have a great resume compared to people who worked in the industry as students, had stronger internships, or had a good GPA. I've mostly been applying to Junior/Entry-Level SWE positions but I'm willing to consider positions that might be considered ""lower"" like Test Automation Engineers, QA, etc. What are some other job titles or positions within a company that make use of a coding background but that may not be as competitive as SWE roles, and that I'd have a better chance of hearing back from? I feel like the only thing stopping me from getting an interview is the lack of easily identifiable job experience on my resume, so I'm open to working as something else to get some experience for a year before making the jump to full-time SWE.

65frmo,0,2017-04-14,Questions about working hours,xMcNerdx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/65frmo/questions_about_working_hours/,"After reading the post about when you get to and leave work, I thought of a few questions of my own that I haven't seen discussed much here. I'm an undergrad and have no industry experience, but I have plenty experience working a wide range of low end jobs. 

At software development jobs, are lunch breaks typically not considered working hours? From the post, it sounded like most people were at work 9 hours a day and I got the vibe that people take an hour for lunch. Is this really that normal? I thought workers were guaranteed 30 minutes paid break for every 8 hours, but I'm assuming that's only for hourly workers. 

It sounds like a lot of people leave work at around 5 in the evening. At your jobs, is it typical for all workers to have the same general schedule, or can people choose when to come in and leave as long as they work the same amount? Personally, I'd prefer to get to try to miss traffic and get to work by around 7:30 so I could leave by 4 and have more evening time to myself. 

Is it typical to get breaks at work? Multiple places I've interviewed at for internships or I've heard of online have some sort of break room with a ping pong table or such. I always thought this was interesting, and I'm guessing you're not supposed to be in there if you're not ""on the clock.""

I'm hoping these questions are appropriate, seeing as how this is a career questions sub. Thanks for any input!

Here is a little draft with just a few schools added at the moment.

https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjFlMmE4ZDYtM2VmYi00N2RkLTgyNjktZDA0Njk4Njc0MTIxIiwidCI6IjZhYmZjNzNmLWRhNjQtNDEzNy05ZjlmLTE1ZmFhZTU2ZjY4NSIsImMiOjN9

Now for data requests.

First thing you will probably notice is Columbia's high ranking. That might be due to the fact that I had to record their class sizes in a very dubious way. If anyone can point me to where I can find class size distributions of 1-9,10-19,20-29, etc that you would find on a common data set, that would be greatly appreciated.

Second, I am looking for some sort of resource that can tell me how many students do internships at x schools during their careers. If anyone has a recommendation, that would be wonderful, because a heavily weighted part of the rankings is, in fact, internships and coops.

Last but not least, I want your opinion on how you feel the rankings turned out based on my current weightings. I tried to only include factors that would effect *undergraduate* students, which is why the ranking looks a little different from others, but the formula is very rudimentary and still a work in progress.

Thank you,

65ghno,225,2017-04-14,OC The downfall of the Rix.,Runner_one,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/65ghno/oc_the_downfall_of_the_rix/,"For a hundreds of thousands of generations the Rix ruled the galaxy. Their origin was long forgotten. Some said that they had been born out of the fires of the very sun that now formed the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Whatever their true origin was it was long lost to the sands of time. Over the last few million years their empire had spread to nearly every inhabitable world in the galaxy. As their population had grown they had searched for more and more remote worlds to inhabit. It did not matter to them if there was already sapient life on a planet. If it was suitable for colonization the indigenous people were conquered and subjugated as slaves. If a world fought too hard for its survival then the Rix would simply eradiate all life from orbit and then move in and make the world their own.

But something had gone wrong a few years ago. The Rix began to lose contact with some of the most remote worlds. Ships were dispatched to see what had happened. Each and every ship had returned with the same story. They were dead, all of them. Each and every world that had lost contact had been wiped out. Everyone was dead of some unknown illness.  At first the Rix believed that something had come home with the returning ships as their crews began also to die. But soon it became apparent that this was not the case.  Messages started arriving that almost every planet in the Rix empire was dead or dying.  Their top scientists and doctors worked tirelessly but no one could identify the origin of the virus that was killing them. It seemed as though every Rix on every planet in the galaxy was infected with this virus. Even worlds that had not been visited by other Rix in the last hundred years reported outbreaks of the same symptoms before going silent. Soon there was only one Rix world that still had life. In a medical facility in one of the largest cities the last remaining experts worked to avoid the seemingly inevitable. 

The Rix doctor looked in the mirror. The telltale sign was impossible to miss. On his upper mouth orifice a large boil had formed. In a day or so it would rupture and begin to drain puss. Death would be inevitable within a few hours more. The doctor lowered himself into a chair and held his head in his hands.  ""I have failed,"" he muttered under his breath.

""Dr. Iintobas"" yelled the young intern ""I have it, I know what is killing everyone!""

The older doctor lifted his head from his hands, ""You've said that before.""

""But this time I'm sure. It is a human disease.""
	
""Human? What is that?""

""They are… or rather were a race that inhabited a world orbiting a yellow star in a very remote arm of the  galaxy. The Rix invaded their world about a thousand years ago. Instead of surrendering to a superior force, they put up a hopeless fight. Command eventually made the decision to just wipe them out instead of conquering them. They were eliminated and their world was colonized."" 

""What makes you so sure you have the correct source.""

""I matched the symptoms, and then the virus itself to one of their own medical databases. The humans called this Herpes .

""Everyone knows that the knowledge of any conquered race is saved for the benefit of the Rix empire,"" replied the doctor."" How did you make this match when everyone else failed?""

""Well, Dr. Iintobas Their planet, Earth as they called it, was conquered so long ago no one thought to look that far back in history for a source of the disease.""

""So what is the cure?""

""I'm afraid there is no cure.""

""Then you have the wrong disease or it would have wiped out the humans.""

""No sir, it was not fatal to them over half  their population lived with this virus dormant in their body their whole life.""

""Dormant?""

""Yes sir, the virus lies dormant along nerve pathways until some unknown influence triggers it.""

""Nerve pathways. But we Rix have nerve receptors in the skin on our hands that we touch with other Rix to communicate silently."" 

""That is why everyone is infected sir. Every time we one of us communicated silently with another Rix we passed on the dormant virus.""

""That is insidious.""

""That's correct Dr. Iintobas, and based on my analysis of the virus it has been spreading thorough out the  galaxy for a at least a thousand years. But that is not all. I examined the virus at a genetic level. This virus has been modified somehow. It looks like the humans managed to modify the telomeres to greatly extend the dormant period. It is my opinion that the humans somehow learned that we have no resistance to this virus and modified it as a time delayed genetic bomb. All they had to do was infect one single Rix with it, and wait.""

""But they are all dead, they all died a thousand years ago. What would be the benefit?""

""The intern thought for a moment before speaking, ""Perhaps revenge?""

As the intern spoke the older doctor noticed that he too had a large boil developing near his  mouth orifice. ""My God, we were doomed as a race as soon as we sat foot on that world.""

Half way across the galaxy on a blue green world orbiting a yellow sun rubble and desert scrub brush concealed the former mouth of a long forgotten cave that had been blasted shut a thousand years earlier. Deep under this rubble inside a cave once known as Carlsbad Caverns an atomic battery still glowed with warmth. A nearby timer was counting down. At that moment the timer reached zero, a relay clicked deep in the nearby electrical cabinet. Long disused lights began to flicker on in the darkness. As the blackness of the cave was bathed in light row after row of cryogenic pods could be seen lining the wall all the way around the giant room. The first cryogenic pod to the right of the cabinet was labeled number 1,  the last one on the left was labeled number 1000.  Equipment began to hum to life, suddenly there was a hiss, and with a metallic clang the cover of the first cryogenic pod swung open. The eyes of the young man sleeping inside fluttered open, and he began to stir from his long sleep.

I'm a Junior at an okay cs university in the US majoring in Computer Engineering with 0 professional experience in the field. The only two projects that I have worked on in the side are websites that use HTML/CSS, php and MySQL databases. 

I have only received one offer so far for an ""internship"" over the summer as a backend developer for a startup in a very early stage that's pretty much full time (40-45 hours/week) and they say that I will learn and code more than I have ever done before which is very appealing to me. However, the position is unpaid and I know that unpaid internships are frowned upon in this field and most of the time even illegal. In the agreement offer, the words fellowship and internship are used interchangeably and I tried looking up the difference online regarding CS but I'm still unsure. Will the fact that they also call this an fellowship make any difference at all regarding the salary/stipend or should I just keep applying to others and hope for the best? The only reason that I'm considering this is because of how much they say I will learn and I'd rather have an unpaid internship over no internship this summer.

Need help making a decision quick!,qtumble,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/65i0tr/which_should_i_choose_need_help_making_a_decision/,"For this summer internship, I have the option of picking big data/data engineering kind of stuff like Hadoop, Spark, Kafka etc. or I can work with backend API/scalability kind of stuff. My main objective of this internship is to learn about scalability and distributed systems.

Both data engineering and scalable backends are very interesting to me but I was wondering if someone could give me some advice. I've written APIs for my previous internships but I've never had to deal with scalability or worry about stuff like distributed system, a topic I really want to learn more about.

I believe Hadoop, Spark, etc. fits into the same category of distributed system, but in a different way. I don't have much experience with them and based on what I've read here, it's hard to get actual experience with them unless you're using them in production in an actual environment for a job, so it would be a very good opportunity for me for the summer.

As much as I would like to learn more about big data stuff, it doesn't really tie into my past experience as I'm mostly a full stack web developer. I definitely find building scalable backends very fascinating so I don't know if I should go into a totally new field that I don't know much about.

These are the main questions I have regarding this issue:

1. Do you have any good stories of people making the transition by purely self studying the life sciences part (genetics etc.) as a software engineer?
2. Which life science branches could most benefit from computer science / software engineering?
3. How should I most effectively acquire the knowledge to, for instance, join a biotech company (or start my own) as a software engineer? Textbooks, hackathons, masters degree in some life sciences branch?



Background: I have been working as a software engineer for two years now (started as an intern, later a part time developer). I have tried front-end, back-end, all-end development. The more I work, the more I realize that I am that interested in my work. New programming languages, methodologies etc do not interest me. 

Neither the acquired knowledge of the software engineering major interests me much. I have heard that most bachelor programs seem boring as the main goal for the individual is to acquire the knowledge of the basics of the field though.

Despite that, most of my work has been and will probably in the future revolve around consumer, entertainment or financial product development. For now, it seems O.K, but in the long run it will get dull for me (although the money is good haha).

I love biology. I am fascinated of how vast computational resources with machine learning can be used to solve life sciences problems. Thus it seemed natural for me to start asking these questions.

I would highly appreciate some input on my situation, particularly if there is another more appropriate subreddit for this. 

I will be graduating from a non target state school in north New Jersey (debt free) in December, and am planning for the future beyond that. Some stats: 
- BA Economics, 4.0 GPA
- President of Economics Honor Society
- 3 years of private tutoring industry experience (owning a private business and account management for a larger business in an affluent area)
- NYU Language Proficiency Certification in Spanish 

I am passionate about math and would like to work where I can use mathematical modeling and crunch numbers to find answers. I am currently self learning SAS and R to also help my marketability. 

Career interests: 
- I would love to work for the Federal Reserve, particularly FRBNY, and have had an interview there for their 2 year research assistant position (I'm told they start hiring in the fall). My main drive for the Federal Reserve is to work on monetary policy and possibly supervisory work with banks such as Goldman Sachs
- Actuarial work, although I am unsure as to how I can begin that
- Interest in TIAA (had internship interview, denied)
- Interest in insurance brokerage (have an internship lined up for the summer with a private firm owned by Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co.), more interested in the math part of this, such as creating products and/or assessing risk 

Other Leads:
- Independent Financial Planning firm that wanted me to come on board for the summer for an internship (am thinking of requesting their time for the fall so that I can win them over in time for a job by the time I graduate)
- Peapack Gladstone Bank (Boutique bank in north east of which I know the president through networking events and have spoken to him about my career (he has shown interest in me and has advised to talk with HR when I graduate)
- Cowen and Company; met a senior director  through school (who is alumni) who currently has my resume and is working on finding a position for me to apply to, either temporary or for a full time job

I understand I'm all over the place in terms of interests, but I know I have to start somewhere. I don't have a family for support or advice, and am trying to piece together my future using networking and school services. 

A few questions that I had thought of, although please let me know if there's other comments that need to be made. 
1) Is it realistic to break into any large firm such as the Fed, or say, Goldman Sachs, at first without the support of a target school?
2) Financial planning seems too much like a sales job at first, especially with creating a portfolio of clients. While I receive compliments at being a people person and would have no problem doing so, I don't feel like I would enjoy that type of career. Should I go after it anyway just for the money? 
3) Is it realistic to make a career out of math modeling? I have people skills too so I'd hope to be able to combine the two and move up (insert humor here)
4) Are there any firms I should look into that I have not yet?

I have nothing to lose; no family ties, no debt, no real allegiance to anything. I really just want to get on the right path so I can work hard, find the right opportunities, keep learning, and be able to show case my skill set (or lack thereoff) to move up. Not sure if this is relevant or not, but I do have Deferred Action status (am looking at getting married with my long term girlfriend in the near future to apply for residency), in case that is a deterrent for the companies that I should look into (in case some are more immigrant friendly than others).

Location is East Lansing, Michigan

Last night I received an MIP and UIP (which falls under disorderly conduct in my area I believe). Here are the exact city ordinances: http://i.imgur.com/5idp1qY.png. In regards to this, I plan to just use my university's free legal service and do whatever legal council suggests. However I'm more at a loss when it comes to how to handle my job offer.

Months ago I accepted an offer for a 6 month internship with a fortune 100 company which I start in July and I am very rattled about how this will affect my offer which is contingent upon a background check that will be ran a month before my start date. There is a very good chance that the legal situation will still be pending when the background check is run by their third party and i'm not sure how to go about it. I'd imagine even a deferred sentence would still show up as a conviction during the deferring period?

Should I disclose what is going on to HR as soon as I can? Perhaps wait to go to court and receive some kind of judgement first?

Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you."

Does anyone have any advice on this path of education. It's too late for me to switch to a Computer Science major, so I'm worried if I won't be able to find work in the field after graduation. Within these next last two semesters of undergrad, I'll be taking the following COSC courses: Computer Organization 1 and 2, Special Topics/ Programming (pick a language and learn for implementing information systems), Data Base Management, and Data Structures/Algorithms. 

The minor requirement doesn't contain Discrete Mathematics, which from what I've looked at on graduate programs and job interviews, is very important. But, this doesn't fit into my schedule for the Fall, so I'm hoping I can somehow take it Spring 2018 (my last semester).

I've been searching for intern positions, but it doesn't seem like I have enough experience even for those. I only have a year's worth (almost) grasp of Java and programming. Should I continue searching and apply for internships for the summer anyways?

Would it be more worth it for me to try to get into a Computer Science graduate program, to gain more knowledge and learn more fundamental principles (what a computer science major may already be equipped with)?

I just got an offer for a small software+hardware company in Seattle. The recruiter told me everybody on the team unanimously said they want me to join. He said I excelled at technical interviews. Told me they were looking for a senior position, but decided I'd be a good fit despite only having 4 years of experience (2+y full time, 2 full year internships full/part time, freelance work). If there was something I didn't know in technical interviews, it was normal for someone with my experience to not know (I know the question - it was about details on device drivers).


**Current**

I currently make 75k in a small town, I could easily make 80k if I shopped around. Cost of living calculators show that would be 130-140k equivalent salary in Seattle.


**Offer**

The recruiter emailed to setup a phone call for an offer. However when he called - didn't really specify anything specific. He asked what I wanted, and I deflected. He ""crunched some numbers"" and basically told me it would be in the 90 to 100k range, was going to talk to the dept. head and get back to me.

To be honest, I think I'm worth more than that - but I'm having trouble getting other recruiters to bite. I have experience with the specific processor architecture (embedded system), build tools, and a lot of the other tools and languages they use. I think that makes me more valuable to them. My understanding is that this seems low, I'd really like 120-130. I hear a lot of people get RSU's and such too on top, this doesn't seem that out of line, what do you think?


**TLDR**

This is an awesome company I'd really like to work for, but the salary seems lacking. How do I approach this? I've read up on negotiating, but was hoping for some advice specific to this situation."

These are the main questions I have regarding this issue:
Do you have any good stories of people making the transition by purely self studying the life sciences part (genetics etc.) as a software engineer?
Which life science branches could most benefit from computer science / software engineering?
How should I most effectively acquire the knowledge to, for instance, join a biotech company (or start my own) as a software engineer? Textbooks, hackathons, masters degree in some life sciences branch?
Background: I have been working as a software engineer for two years now (started as an intern, later a part time developer). I have tried front-end, back-end, all-end development. The more I work, the more I realize that I am that interested in my work. New programming languages, methodologies etc do not interest me.
Neither the acquired knowledge of the software engineering major interests me much. I have heard that most bachelor programs seem boring as the main goal for the individual is to acquire the knowledge of the basics of the field though.
Despite that, most of my work has been and will probably in the future revolve around consumer, entertainment or financial product development. For now, it seems O.K, but in the long run it will get dull for me (although the money is good haha).
I love biology. I am fascinated of how vast computational resources with machine learning can be used to solve life sciences problems. Thus it seemed natural for me to start asking these questions.

I would highly appreciate some input on my situation, particularly if there is another more appropriate subreddit for this. 

I will be graduating from a non target state school in north New Jersey (debt free) in December, and am planning for the future beyond that. Some stats: 
- BA Economics, 4.0 GPA
- President of Economics Honor Society
- 3 years of private tutoring industry experience (owning a private business and account management for a larger business in an affluent area)
- NYU Language Proficiency Certification in Spanish 

I am passionate about math and would like to work where I can use mathematical modeling and crunch numbers to find answers. I am currently self learning SAS and R to also help my marketability. 

Career interests: 
- I would love to work for the Federal Reserve, particularly FRBNY, and have had an interview there for their 2 year research assistant position (I'm told they start hiring in the fall). My main drive for the Federal Reserve is to work on monetary policy and possibly supervisory work with banks such as Goldman Sachs
- Actuarial work, although I am unsure as to how I can begin that
- Interest in TIAA (had internship interview, denied)
- Interest in insurance brokerage (have an internship lined up for the summer with a private firm owned by Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co.), more interested in the math part of this, such as creating products and/or assessing risk 

Other Leads:
- Independent Financial Planning firm that wanted me to come on board for the summer for an internship (am thinking of requesting their time for the fall so that I can win them over in time for a job by the time I graduate)
- Peapack Gladstone Bank (Boutique bank in north east of which I know the president through networking events and have spoken to him about my career (he has shown interest in me and has advised to talk with HR when I graduate)
- Cowen and Company; met a senior director  through school (who is alumni) who currently has my resume and is working on finding a position for me to apply to, either temporary or for a full time job

I understand I'm all over the place in terms of interests, but I know I have to start somewhere. I don't have a family for support or advice, and am trying to piece together my future using networking and school services. 

A few questions that I had thought of, although please let me know if there's other comments that need to be made. 
1) Is it realistic to break into any large firm such as the Fed, or say, Goldman Sachs, at first without the support of a target school?
2) Financial planning seems too much like a sales job at first, especially with creating a portfolio of clients. While I receive compliments at being a people person and would have no problem doing so, I don't feel like I would enjoy that type of career. Should I go after it anyway just for the money? 
3) Is it realistic to make a career out of math modeling? I have people skills too so I'd hope to be able to combine the two and move up (insert humor here)
4) Are there any firms I should look into that I have not yet?

I have nothing to lose; no family ties, no debt, no real allegiance to anything. I really just want to get on the right path so I can work hard, find the right opportunities, keep learning, and be able to show case my skill set (or lack thereoff) to move up. Not sure if this is relevant or not, but I do have Deferred Action status (am looking at getting married with my long term girlfriend in the near future to apply for residency), in case that is a deterrent for the companies that I should look into (in case some are more immigrant friendly than others). 

Thank you for your time and support! "

**SJSU**

Pros

* 17k cause will be commuting
* Better Job Prospects (More known by companies)
* Known for Engineering
* Closer to Silicon Valley so can intern during school year (Big one)
* Accepted for Computer Engineering but want to Switch to Software Engineering. Might be hard too (Fine with CE but want to do SE more)
* Easier to get a higher GPA I think

Cons

* Might be hard to get classes
* Super impacted
* Yes its' average is 5 years graduation but I have about a 1 semester and a half of credit so I can prob graduate in 4 years (Will be note taker in class to get priority)
* Almost impossible to transfer to a UC from here
* Practical learning so might be bad for grad school
* Full of people from my school

**UCSC**

Pros

* Accepted for Computer Science and Engineering
* Better quality of education (Big one)
* More off a college experience since living on campus (I care about this but little)
* Going to go to gradschool
    * If I decide to go for CS I think a degree from here would hold more
    * If MBA idk
* Easier to transfer to higher UC from here

Neutral

* 33-35k cause living on campus (Money is no problem though)

Cons

* Far from internship opportunities, mainly Silicon Valley

I looked over the rules/FAQ and think it's okay but I've never posted here so I may be wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

I graduated last May with an EE degree tailored to electronics/VLSI/digital design and interned doing SRAM design stuff. I've been looking for a job for almost a year now, and I've had a surprisingly hard time. I was recently offered a job with an MEP firm doing CAD/design work, but it doesn't pay a lot and it requires moving back to my home town. Not to mention it is completely unrelated from what I studied.

At this point, I'm feeling like I can't afford to be picky and should take any work just to have experience rather than a year-long blank spot on my resume. However, the job pays less than my internship, and I'm worried I'll be closing the door on jobs related to everything I learned in school, which is really disappointing to me because I treated school as job training.

To complicate things further, I was contacted by a manager from Lockheed Martin telling me to apply for a job because he saw my resume in their system thought I would be a good fit. I had a video interview which went well, but I'm still waiting for word from them. But i only have 4 business days left to accept this MEP job.

If I take this job, will it be hard to get back into circuit design-related tech jobs? Will my low salary at this job determine my next job's salary, and the next job, and so forth? What if I accept this job and then get an offer from Lockheed? Will I be a bad person for backing out from the job?"

Here's what I'm looking at for each college:

**Boston University:**

*Pros:*

- Housing after freshman year seems very cool
- 20k scholarship each year
- A lot of clubs focused around CS (at least compared to SCU)
- Boston is a great city
- Lots of dining options

*Cons:*

- Very little open areas, cars honking, congested
- Buildings not very new but not too bad
- Four-semester language requirement
- Seems preppy at times

**Santa Clara University**

*Pros:*

- Great weather
- In Silicon Valley - tons of people getting internships
- Buildings are really nice
- Quarter system
- Feels laid back

*Cons:*

- Limited dining options
- More expensive than BU with Scholarship
- Dorms seem mediocre

There's obviously much more that makes up these colleges, but I think this is a good starting point. So, what would you do in my shoes?

They would make a website using various tools to make it as easy as possible for the end user to take control of the website afterwards. Lots of WordPress ""development"" At the time I was just out of uni and a little bit lost, I really enjoyed it but as they were quite small I wasn't really able to articulate and persuade them that they really need someone with this kind of technical skill in the long run.

Even back then I knew they were having issues when screen sizes close to 1080p would fuck (background repeat is still there) up website looks and they wouldn't use image thumbnails unless forced to. ( I know I'm making them sound shit but the guy running it is really into using business to get young people into work and starting new stuff and he had a jump in head first into the new thing trying to build something in a new area to help him improve his other businesses.

Anyway, there were all these little things and like the idiot I am, I thought the best thing to do is not push it too hard otherwise I would piss people off and get the extension after the internship. Didn't end well. Over the past 2 years, I've struggled to get a job but done quite a few small freelance projects which I think are pretty good however these did push me in places technically and have made it quite clear to me these guys are gonna struggle w/o a technical web developer.

Thier design is great but their implementation is not strong.   
-Never heard of SVGs  
-Calling entirety of bootstrap every time   
-Every site has stuff above the fold  
-Nothing is minified   
-No such thing as image thumbnails, one website index is 40MB.  
-Done 15 websites no GZIP   
-W3C is non-existent ( I don't know how important this is for SEO, they like SEO)  

Thier whole thing of we make WordPress website you can manage since I have experience in this area I could probably push, I'm just not sure the best way to do it

So yeah whats the best way to talk to them about it, the Girl who does most of the coding is actually in incredible designer who made some amazing stuff but has been forced to wing it with the programming, how do I push the importance of having someone who can actually program and optimise websites without being a dick hole?"

I'm a comp sci major who has probably read every textbook on java and still cant code. I work out half an hour a day and am so cautious about what i eat and still dont have the body i want. I dont have an attention span for more than 5 minutes anymore despite turning off all distractions and making so many to do lists. I buy so many folders and planners and binders and still cant keep organized. I make so many reminders to do things and still forget to do a lot of them.

I cant even remember to brush my teeth but I can remember to cry my eyes out every day. I miss being able to burn myself and be done with the feeling like I could in high school.

I used to put 0 effort into anything and be fine I have fallen off so badly. I used to be president of so many clubs i used to have a 4.5 I used to be able to make money off of music I used to have friends. My parents are so disappointed in me I'm a sophomore in college and still can't get an internship anywhere. How am I going to get a job? 8 kids at my college have committed suicide and i'm really jealous of their strength to go through with it. The only reason I'm still at this school is so I can say I go here but its obviously somebody clearly made a huge fucking mistake in accepting me. I have made so many suicide contracts and am so mad that i did. I constantly think about killing myself and purposely put myself in dangerous situations because I can't bare to watch myself get even worse. Why is everyone here so much better than me?
I am such a fucking failure.
I used to have the world in my hands.
I used to be pretty.

I have some experience with CS (a 5 on AP CS, attempted a local programming competition but didn't do that well), but I'm still working on beginner skills. I wouldn't say I have any genius-like aptitude at CS, but I'm a very hard worker and I put a lot of time into things I care about. 

However, while I know I shouldn't compare myself to others, this has been on my mind these days. My close friend who is a junior in HS goes to hackathons all around the nation, gets into selective CS summer programs, and wins awards here and there, and - due to her passion for CS - has gotten involved in so much already. A student I know at Berkeley who is currently an intern at Facebook started doing CS projects early in high school and won national competitions. I can't imagine how many more impressive people will be at Berkeley. 

I know this is not the average by any means, but I'm left wondering whether I'm a little ""behind"". I want to get good internships in college, but already the thought of getting involved in projects, leaderships, ECs, perhaps a TA for a class, and staying on top of my classes is a little overwhelming. The interviews I've done for college applications have been mediocre since I'm not a good speaker, and I yet see people on this sub applying to 150 internships and getting 4 interviews. I've loved the programming I've done so far and I'm excited to learn more. However, it seems like so much is expected - top-notch programming skills (both in depth and breadth), lots of experience, leadership, social skills. Are these all doable for a freshman who doesn't have much experience in CS? How can I prepare myself best for the future? 

I probably sound over-concerned and immature, but just looking for some advice. Thank you. :/ "

Given my current (weak) programming background, how would you suggest getting as good at programming/SE as possible during the 3 months? And is my goal feasible?

My current idea is to do some project using Java (maybe an android app?) since it's a compiled object-oriented language and easier to learn given my time constraints than C++. I looked into some functional languages like Scala and although they are really fun to learn, they don't seem mainstream enough. 

Background: BS in physics from top undergrad school, after graduating did management consulting (will be 2 yrs by the time I start school). 

Programming Experience:

Python (but mostly for data analysis or machine learning libraries)

Java/C from CS classes (but very basic, since these classes mostly involved writing small programs to implement algorithms or data structures).

Other:

I am very good at math and algorithms types questions like the ones I've seen in ""cracking the coding interview."" I actually find these enjoyable to study for so that shouldn't be an obstacle.

Bigger obstacle seems to be the lack of any real (internship or full time work) software engineering on my resume. Is there some sort of personal project I could do over 3 months that would be enough to somewhat mitigate this? I am hoping the barrier to entry is lower since I'll be looking for an internship.

Since most SE positions want someone with experience in a compiled language, I'm thinking of trying to get as good at Java as possible (C++ seems like it will take too long because it's more complex). Would the best way to do this be to pick some project (I'm thinking maybe an android app) using Java and building it? What about open source?

I took the job because I was so excited just to have a job at 19 while my friends were still trying to finish school.I am doing pretty good at the job too. 

So, my colleagues at the office are doing MCSA/MCSE and other certifications which is sensible because where I work, for every certification you complete you get a pay raise,

However what I've been asking myself these days is ""imagine being Masters graduate at the age of 21, how cool would that be? ""

I honestly don't know if that would be a wise decision or not. I could do the certs and masters at the same time, but is that the best option for me at the moment? stressing myself now to have a better future I guess? 

So assuming all goes well, Here's me at the age of 21 : Completed Masters degree, Completed MCSE in Server or Cloud and possibly promoted as a Tier 2 Techie.

I'm a Business major from Singapore, graduating in 3 months and for the past 3 years have been focused on building experience in finance/investments through college and internships.

After recently attending a talk on self-driving vehicles , I was struck with a quarter-life crisis. Before that, I secured a junior role in an investment firm - the pay and progression are decent, and the work is fairly interesting. Yet after the SDV talk, I felt a strange sense of calling. It dawned upon me that a career in finance of no doubt will be financially rewarding, but it just was not as intellectually demanding as I had desired. It also did not make a material, positive impact on the lives of people (or at least the impact wasn't that visible). Suddenly, a career in machine learning/computer vision seemed to be the answer.

So I did some research and learnt that a Masters in CS would be the way to go. Many challenges exist, namely (1) Cost, (2) Educating myself on CS/ML stuff and (3) Competition with folks with a Bachelor's and solid work/internship experience. I have completed Python on Codecademy but am following up with Interactive Python and coding challenges in the future. Also currently doing the ML course by Stanford on Coursera. I just can't believe how I didn't discover CS before I started college.

The big issue is breaking into ML as someone with a sliver of CS/ML knowledge. One route I have discovered was: pickup R, SQL and other skills requisite of a data analyst -&gt; intern in a data analytics role (more receptive towards bschool grads) -&gt; secure full time offer -&gt; build up 1-2 years of IT/CS experience -&gt; MSCS -&gt; ML scientist.

I understand the above path may be flawed as ML scientists usually have a solid research experience. Are there better ways to break into ML? Deeply appreciate any feedback/suggestions from fellow Redditors.

TL;DR: Finance grad here wanting to break into ML. Seeking advice, thanks!"

I enjoy programming a lot, I spend all my free time doing it when I am not working. I am currently working at a manufacturing factory. This job and the people are nice, but the pay is not and there is no room for advancement. 

The way I figure there are two paths that are available to me, either I can go back to grad school and seek an internship(a little safer option), or continue banging my head against job resume and interview filters made to filter people like me out.

The input I have received from people in real life was  

1. keep making projects 
2. learn a particular technology that is big in a subset of companies
3. go to grad school and seek an internship

I would like 

* 
opinions on which of these paths you see work more often(if you have an anecdotal percentage estimate that would be helpful). 

* 
discussions on what someone from another industry should do to better fit in as a programmer.

Nothing has worked no matter how hard I tried. Here's some of the things I've done: 

 - Graduated high school with good grades.
 - Graduated college with 3+ GPA
 - Passed all my CPA exams on first attempt (with 85+ score)
 - Got internship at Big 4 accountancy firm

Nothing helped. I've gotten more and more depressed and suicidal over the years. I have zero friends. I have no one I can talk to. I live with my family, but I don't talk to them anymore. 

I'm done trying. It'll never get any better. It's a lie people perpetuate around here that it does get better. I was bullied and beaten up in high school, had no friends in college. And I still don't have any friends or even someone I can talk to.

I can't sleep. I can't eat. I can't think. I can't work. I can't function. I'm completely broken. I have no goals, passions, or dreams. I have no purpose to my existence. I'm sick of living like this, and I can't do it anymore. All my life I've been forced to do things that go against who I am, things that I detest and hate. I always hated accounting and fuck me, I took up the CPA exams and that completely decimated me. Working long hours at Big 4, it's just fucking horrid. I can't do this. It's just not who I am at all. 

I've written on here before, but I never got any help and I ended up deleting my threads. I don't expect this time to be any different. My parents are concerned about me, but can't they see the pain I'm in? The pain I've been in since 10 years or more? Why they have grown to care now? If they care about me at all, they should let me go in peace. I'm just so fucking done. 

It's no longer if I'll do it, but when. I've already prepared my last to-do list before I go ahead and drown myself - I can't swim and I figured it's the way to go. I'm going to burn every thing I have, delete and wipe every picture there is of me. And then I'll go and meet my abyss."

65rerd,9,2017-04-16,How did life change for your post-diagnosis?,peregrin5,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/65rerd/how_did_life_change_for_your_postdiagnosis/,"I've had ADHD my entire life. It was pretty damn obvious since I was that kid bouncing off of the walls, and never staying in my seat. I had a family that didn't believe in it though so I lived my entire childhood without being diagnosed or medicated. 

I was in gifted and talented programs because I was great at testing and typically very bright but I failed many of my classes because I could rarely sit still long enough to complete major projects or do homework in high school.

I made it through college too just barely, though I had less success because you really do need to study for tests for college which I had never previously done nor learned how to do, and also requires a certain level of focus.

I read some books on learning and studying after I graduated college and got a certificate in teaching with a 4.0 after applying the study techniques I finally learned, but I didn't get a diagnosis until about a year ago (about 4 years into my teaching career). I actually don't take medication while I'm teaching because I find that my ADHD personality was actually very suited for teaching middle schoolers. (I pay attention to everything at once, so I catch almost everything that goes on in my classroom). I did however use it when I did some internships in the summer requiring me to focus or when I'm planning on weekends, with varying success (it helps me focus, but it still doesn't help me focus on the right things).

After this year, changing schools and states, I decided to go back to school to try out the school thing again, because I think I'll be more successful, I've always wanted to enter this field of study (electrical engineering), and because the school I taught at this year pretty much ruined teaching for me for a while (both the administration and the community were terrible).

I plan on using my newfound study skills, my knowledge about metacognition I had to learn to teach students successfully for 5 years, my medication, and of course my maturity and experience which have improved quite a bit since my first stint in college to try to be as successful as possible. My goal is not just to make it through college but to completely succeed in it, and also take on a few side-projects I feel passionate about (maybe starting or joining after school programs to bring engineering activities to urban students and organizing other engineering students to do the same), but I'm still a bit nervous just because this is such a huge change and the chance of failure looms always for me. 

*Has anyone made a similar kind of change? How did your diagnosis change your professional life or your ability to succeed in your studies? Should I be expecting a dramatic change in my success or am I overestimating my abilities?*

Also, some books that really helped me from college to now in case you're interested:

* **Mindset** by Carol Dweck (advocates that failing is actually good, and helps you learn, so don't be afraid to fail)

* **How to be a Straight A Student** by Cal Newport (and actually any book by Cal Newport is amazing; also his personal blog is inspiring)

* **A Mind for Numbers** by Barbara Oakley (goes into how your brain chunks and stores information and how to use that information to best learn and study for classes that involve a lot of math and science)"

I was successful too. Got weight stable, and by summer had worked through most of my issues. Was getting back to life.

But last April, a psych I saw convinced me to start citalopram for anxiety. Given the stress and anxiety and panic attacks at the time, and the fact that she didn't tell me any of the possible side effects, I started. Thought I could quit em if I wanted.

I was wrong. My health began to turn south in summer as they kicked in. At first thought we all thought it was related to anorexia complications. But it was the meds. So in August I began tapering.

I'm one of the few minority that enter truly horrible, catastrophic SSRI withdrawal it turns out. Digestive system is ruined. Drug induced gynecomastia (boobs, I'm a guy). Withdrawal induced weight gain. Insomnia. Akathisia. Constant nausea and vomiting. Edema. Cognitive issues. Chronic pain. The list goes on and on. For over 8 months non stop (I'm not fucking exaggerating). 

I have no life. I'm bed ridden because of what these meds have done. People who have it as bad as me take easily 3-7 years to recover, some never do seemingly. I've lost so much (girlfriend/my first love, physical activity/college rowing career, internships, jobs, friends, hobbies I cannot do...my entire identity).

I'm so fucking tired. Recovering from the ED was so fucking hard and now I have to somehow deal with this shit. I'm in agony all the damn time from my medical problems, and nothing has helped (I've spent so much time and money on various things and nothing's worked. Mentally the worst part is having gained 70 lbs on the drug. Dieticians can't figure it out. The weight keeps climbing. I'm so fat that I'm ashamed and want to die. My metabolism is probably so fucked from the ED and the drug that it'll never recover (wouldn't be the first person's metabolism messed up by SSRIs).

And why shouldn't I. I have nothing left I care about. I have a few friends, I resent my parents. I'm fucking fat. 

And this all could've been avoided if I was strong enough to not take the fucking SSRI, when therapy did way more than it ever did. I can't believe I was stupid and weak enough to take the fucking med. I want to kill the doctor that did this to me. I want to kill myself."
65rs2g,12,2017-04-16,Should I put in time or get more relevant experience (undergrad)?,BrainsAndBlessings,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/65rs2g/should_i_put_in_time_or_get_more_relevant/,"I've been working as a research assistant in a lab since February and will be continuing through the summer. I'm really interested in the topic of the study I'm working on (motor rehab of stroke patients). So far, I'm getting lots of experience helping to write research protocols, informed consent forms and applying for ethics certificates. In the summer, I will also get a chance to recruit participants and help run tests. I will maybe have some data to analyze by the end of the summer, but I'm not sure if I will have enough to really do anything with it.


During the next school year, I'll be doing a senior research project. The logical thing to do would be to continue working with my current PI. This would allow me to analyze the data I collected and see a project to (almost) completion. I have brought it up with my PI and she would be happy to let me continue the project. The issue is, I'm not looking to get into this field when I graduate. In fact, I don't even want to get into academia. I thought I did when I started university, but that opinion has changed, and I don't see myself spending years working towards a PhD, at least not right now. 


I'm majoring in neuroscience (computational stream) with a minor in linguistics. I'm really interested in neurolinguistics and computational linguistics, and will be taking courses in these topics next semester. I would like to get a masters in either speech-language pathology or computational linguistics (not sure which yet), because these relate more to my interests and would allow me to find work after 2-3 years of extra schooling, instead of 5+. There are a lot of companies in my area working with language recognition and natural language processing, and ideally I would like to get an internship at one of these places next summer. 


For both these potential paths, I think having some research experience in neurolinguistics would be beneficial. If I find another professor willing to take me on, should I make the switch in the fall? Or should I stick with the lab I'm in, because this will show I am able to commit to a long-term project, and will allow me to gain insight on every step of research, beginning to end? The position I'm in now is really a dream because I'm getting paid and I'm interested in stroke rehab (almost as much as neurolinguistics), so I don't want to throw that away if I don't have to. 


(Side note: Another complication is that when I was interviewing with labs to get the position I have now, I had an interview with a neurolinguistics lab. I didn't get good vibes during the interview, and wasn't interested in the projects this lab had running at the moment, so I turned down the offer to work with them in the fall. When I did this, I had already been accepted by the lab I'm in now, and just thought I would stick with this lab through the summer and senior year. Now I'm regretting this choice. I know I can't go back to this neurolinguistics lab, and I don't really want to anyway because of the negative feelings I had about it. But the PI knows everyone at my school working in the field, and she will know if I go towards another neuroling lab. My reasons for refusing her offer were that I wanted to focus on something with clinical populations. But there aren't any neuroling labs here that do that, so if she finds out she will think I lied. Should I even care about this? I feel like I'm overthinking.)


TL;DR - Undergraduate researcher majoring in computational neuroscience and linguistics, wondering if they should stick with the lab they're in or find something else in the fall more relevant to goal of pursuing neurolinguistics and computational linguisitcs"

I was doing this type of work, but had recently stopped to look for software developer jobs. Anyways, they shipped a big chunk of this work to India already after summer breaks for 2016 were over for a bunch of students. They now have 100s of employees there helping them with this collective effort. So I didn't understand why they would hire a bunch of students again if they had already established large teams in India and got them up to speed with the requirements. Also, vast majority of these students got in because they were referred to this job (via parents working there or friends), if that helps you assess this situation. They never opened up this position to the public and were able to successfully recruit enough students based on word of mouth from employees working there.

Because all students must take 3 courses per quarter to be considered a full-time student, these 9 courses will take exactly one year to finish. 

However, I'm worried about the thesis. I've heard that finishing your M.S. thesis depends a lot on your faculty advisor and the professor that you do research under. Is it likely that an M.S. student can start working on the research for their thesis in June 2017 and finish by June 2018? I know that most students take two years to finish their M.S., but I'm hoping to not have to take longer than a year to finish mine. 

It might be important to note that while I have a few internships under my belt, I don't have any computer science research experience.

Right now taking a class in C programming, UNIX, network programming, and feel like this class is breaking me emotionally. I would really like some advice because I honestly feel like I'm too stupid at CS.

I guess I've always been very high achieving and had the mentality that if I worked very hard, I would get decent grades. for context, I'm at a very competitive university and this class has students from both liberal arts and engineering schools. In this class we have weekly problem sets and it literally takes me hours to understand them; I also never finish on time despite not having a life at all and committing the majority of my time to the class.

I've never felt like a ""CS person"" -- my forte was always English, music, etc. and I'm breezing through the philosophy and music classes I'm taking. I guess I decided to take CS classes for financial stability and also because I didn't know what other subjects I could study that would lead to financially stable jobs in the future. That being said, I actually enjoyed my Data Structures class and decided to keep studying CS since I liked understanding the big concepts.

I know maybe it's the networks/nitty gritty nature of this class that is really hard for me. I can choose CS tracks in my future studies. I've also never made an app, website, or done any personal projects -- I have 0 idea of what I will actually do in the real world. So I know maybe it's not a good idea to call it quits now. I'm also going to intern at a company for the software development team this summer. 

So I know now maybe isn't the time to call it quits for CS. But what should I do going forward? If one programming class takes up all my time, does it indicate that I should go into something else? Should I do side projects ASAP? Biggest question is, how long should I stick with CS feeling so stupid? 

Thank you all for your advice!"

I am about to graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from a reputable university, and would love to move elsewhere. I speak Turkish, English and French fluently, and enough Russian and Finnish to survive / find my way around. 

I'm here to find out more about my options. I'm hoping not to drain my bank account so at this point I'm leaning towards finding a job (at least initially) rather than pursuing further education. I have a decent GPA, and reasonable amount of experience (two internships: one in industry and one in research). Unfortunately, I have found that my being a foreigner (see: Middle Eastern in today's world) is a considerable obstacle in securing a job in another country, especially in terms of qualifying for a work visa. I'm willing to spend a few more months here in Turkey for technical interview preparation and whatnot, but I would like to learn in advance what route to take so that I can proceed most efficiently.

Which countries should I look into? Any particular detail that I should keep in mind? Which countries / companies / positions are more willing to give work visas to potential foreign employees? What else can I do to increase my chances? Is it a good idea to take a ""vacation"" to one of my destination countries where I can attend CS-related events and network, should I fail to find a job solely through the Internet? What else?

Ah, so many questions, so little time. Please feel free to ask for more details.

Thanks so much in advance!"

I've done a bit of work with Jenkins setting up continuous integration systems.

Am I shoe-horned into working with C in the future? If I wanted to work for a 'trendy' company that needed Java/C#/C++ would I need to do a hobby project? There isn't really any opportunity for me to work with these languages at my current company.

Accept offer or remain an intern?,intern_throwaway764,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/65wn1n/what_to_do_about_fulltime_job_offer_from/,"I have one year until I graduate with a Computer Science degree from a small state school. The job is taking over the role of my mentor (Software Developer) who just gave their 2 weeks.  If I accept this job offer, my graduation would be set back possibly a little over a year, maybe 2? I have 6 core classes remaining in my degree along with random advanced electives required (typically easy), overall 10 classes left before graduation. 


Perks of accepting would be discounted class rate, since it is a job for the university, employee benefits and willing to allow me to be a part-time student and work around the scheduled class times (6 credits), normally taking 16 credit hours a semester as a full-time student. 

Cons of accepting would be no longer really having the sense of freedom of being a college student and being able to accept internship offers in Silicon Hills (Austin, TX), where my older siblings have a large professional network that I can take advantage of for internships in large tech companies (e.g. AMD, Samsung, Facebook, Amazon, Rackspace, Intel, Silicon Labs).


However, the offered salary ($45k) does seem low compared to national average for my field. Though I don't really care about money right now and as a college student I don't have a sense of worth, salary wise. They mentioned an exact dollar amount raise if I continue to be an intern too, so either way there is some sort of personal benefit. 


Is this an offer I shouldn't pass up?"

Company A (unpaid) - I would be put into a group with other interns and be doing Solutions Architect work, which i dont have an prior experience. Although it is unpaid, I would prefer to work at this company in the future.

Company B (paid) - I would be working along side their employees and be doing Front End Web Development work, which i do have prior experience (built a website). They will pay me $20 an hour. This internship seems to be more professional, because I wont be grouped up like the other one.

Also, I would like to note I would prefer to do Solutions Architect work over Front End Web Development once I graduate.

This might be a bit long but I am really desperate for any type of objective advice from people who don't have a stake in the claim.

I'm a first year college student in a big city in the United States, and I attend a private university that's obscenely expensive. I am taking out loans to help cover the cost of living and to supplement scholarships I got from the university itself.

In order to cut costs, I decided to sign the lease on an apartment near campus with three close friends. Living off campus is a lot cheaper than living on campus, but I cannot apply academic loans to a third party that isn't the academic institution-- so basically, any loans I take out to cover tuition will not be applicable to my rent.

Before I began my apartment search, my parents graciously offered to cover $400 of my rent cost per month. I am really surprised they even offered as I didn't expect them to contribute nearly that much (in hindsight, there is literally no way I would be able to afford the place without their help, and they're acutely aware of this). My total rent per month is $725, so I will be responsible for paying $325 of my own money each month.

This is where the problem arises. I am away from home studying as a full time student taking 18 credits with no steady work, partly because of my schedule, partly because my city is heavily driven on unpaid internships and jobs are very hard to come by, especially for college students in my area (almost everyone, including my friends, are very affluent and there is no need for the area I'm in to sustain a demand for college student labor). I work freelance positions when I can find them, but it hasn't been as consistent as I would like. I take full blame for not being as attentive in the job search first semester of college-- but, I was also a first year freshman trying to get adjusted to my new life.

I am headed home for the summer, and I have been calling/emailing/contacting literally every business in my small town about employment with no luck. I need to secure a job as soon as possible so I can go start working full time as soon as my plane lands back home in order to make rent. I want to amass at least a few months' rent over the summer so I'm ahead of the curve for a while. It's stressing me out so much though, because there's only so much I can do here in school to secure a job back home. I am beginning to get very nervous that I won't be able to find a job and then subsequently won't be able to pay rent in the fall.

Basically, I'm just being naive and learning from my mistakes at this point. I'm so scared I won't be able to sustain myself without seeking a private loan (which I probably won't get approved for, as I'm literally 19 with no credit). I also do not want to rely on my parents because I'm too prideful because I feel that it is not their responsibility to pay my every expense in college. They're already offering to help me way more than they should.

Reddit, what the hell do I do? I've been searching tooth and nail for a job-- do I just keep looking? Do I pursue a possible loan? My lease is for 12 months, and finding employment in the fall semester shouldn't be an issue. My main problem is making money over the summer to go in with some cash instead of none at all."

If it isn't please direct me to where I should post it.**


So I guess. I need to make this clear: I'm an intern. I get no mentorship on the job whatsoever, and my boss isn't willing to (or even able to) offer it. So that's an important distinction here.

I'm having issues at my job/internship, and need some input on what to do. My boss is a ""developer"" in the loosest sense of the word, meaning he takes as many shortcuts as possible to put together what he does for the company. Now, sure, this isn't strictly a tech company, in fact, the only reason we have a tech department is because we offer to create websites for our clients.

I was brought on three months ago to assist with the creation of websites, and to help with the backlog of websites that needed to be made. Turns out, that was false, and I was brought on to do a majority of the grunt work (trolling each website to make sure they're ADA compliant is a good example) that my boss didn't want to do. Sure, that makes sense, I'm supposed to be doing grunt work. I haven't been able to touch any of the code we have either, except for installing plugins, which isn't even coding, it's copy and pasting.

I started coding last July, and it has been entirely web focused, specifically with modern stacks (i.e. MEAN). So I was thrilled when I found my first job ""in industry"", but I've come to realize that my boss and my boss' bosses don't quite understand what they are asking of me with my new project:

They want me to research, design, create, test, debug, and prop up a PRODUCTION READY native mobile application for any of our clients' that ask. And I'm not just talking native iOS, I'm talking native Android too. Basically, he told me the features he wanted and told me to do it. He then told me that I'm 100% in control of this project and I needed to come up with a proposal, cost analysis, etc. for it. He also wants the initial one to be templated, so we can make a new one for each of the clients coming next.  I'm by myself at work, I'm the only dev that he has, because he is working on other things. He also didn't give me a timeframe to do this in. He said ""Let's add the timeline once we get the details. I don't want to drag my feet, but I'm also not in a hurry."" So I have no idea if he wants this next week, or if he wants this 6 months from now (how long it'd take me, or longer, to get to that point).

I feel this is 100% out of my wheelhouse and that I'm being taken advantage of here, especially when considering my pay is a measly $12/hr, when hybrid devs start in my area around $25/hr. Not to mention the scope of the project. The only problem I'm running into is that I wasn't made to sign a job description when I came aboard, and I think I just shot myself in the foot because of it. And to top it all off, he has me working on other stuff, not related to it, on top of it. So basically he's saddled me with the stuff he doesn't want to do, and also has given me way too much responsibility on a project that I shouldn't have the responsibility for. Especially because if this goes through, and I am made to make these apps, I'm the one in charge when something breaks or fails, and that sounds like way too much pressure for a junior dev.

Oh, and I asked if he wanted to get our Executive director's input on this, which is sounding like it needs to happen, I was told, flat out ""no"", because the ED would try and control it, despite the fact that I spoke with him privately and he was skeptical about us creating an app, because he didn't see a need for it. I have also spoken with HR (who happens to be my mother) about it and was told, flat out, ""I don't care how much you would be making somewhere else, this job pays $12/hr. This is how you prove yourself."" Um. excuse me?

Anyway, would you guys ever give your junior devs / interns this much responsibility, especially 3 months on the job, where you haven't been having them code at all?

**TL;DR** Boss gave me, a very green dev, a project of propping up a production level app, by myself. I'm pretty sure I'm being taken advantage of.

**EDIT:** So with all the comments talking about how this isn't normal, I'm still continuing my search for a real job, or at least one where I get work under actual senior devs, and I'm not being left to fend for myself.

On the other side of things though, if I don't find a job soon, I guess I'll be building an API and requesting server space to use. But we'll even see if they let me spin up a Node instance on the server. Hah.

I recently accepted an internship offer. They just sent over an email regarding background checks, university enrolment verification, etc etc.

They also want to check my credit. I am still a student so I pay for rent, textbooks, and other bills. I missed a couple payments on my credit card which I am sure will undoubtedly affect my score. I was not able to work enough shifts due to studying and interviewing. I know, I know, I should have put my CC first. Won't make the mistake again. I called my credit card company to find out my card has been revoked after a couple missed payments. I payed off a decent amount of it over the weekend after moving some funds around.

Should I inform HR, Manager, both, or just wait it out to see if they say anything?

I'm doing great in all my other classes, B+ or A range, but I'm in a bad place in my Linear Systems 1 class. I've gotten a 21 on my first exam, the class did very bad according to the professor, 44 on the second after doin gmany practice problems that week. Class average was 52. There are 2 more exams, 1 next week, not sure when the other, and a final. All exams = 60 % with lowest dropped, final 40%.

The next exam is LaPlace transforms based. I am trying to apply LaPlace transforms to different circuits, transfer functions on circuits etc and I just can't seem to grasp concepts of analyzing circuits. I spent over an hour on one problem today. How can I practice so many others when I have other classes to study for?!  I don't know, maybe I'm panicking and practicing the rest of the week would help, but according to a grade calculator..

You’ll need to average at least a 64.00% on your next 2 exams and your final to get a 60% overall.
    Your exam category is worth 60% of your overall grade.
    You’ve finished 2 exams already, and your exam average is    32.5%.
    You have 2 exams left.
    Your lowest exam score is dropped.
    Your final is worth 40% of your overall grade.

This is what I need to get a D. Just passing by 1 point. No idea if the professor curves. I asked him, no response. If I do drop it I have to drop Linear Systems 2 in the fall, which is not that bad seeing it leads to no where after I take it(Comp Engr major btw).

But I'm worried it might affect financial aid in the Fall, and I'm trying to get an internship for the summer and might get called in this week, but Im afraid I might have to end up spending the summer practicing circuits and learn python and another language instead of taking the internship. 1st semester Junior Year currently.

Both cost approximately the same because I'm out of state. My hesitation with Berk is that it's super big and as a result there's less opportunities for doing research and more competition to get internships. Also they seem to be struggling with resources (I personally know ppl who haven't got classes they wanted and even housing is an issue). CMU seems really good with interdisciplinary education and ML and robotics especially, but it seems like my overall experience there wouldn't be very well-rounded and I don't like the location as much, but has some advantage over Berk in its size and resources virtue of being private. UT, my in-state school, is also an option but it seems like recently I've been shifting away from it. I like the program (dual honors program Turing/BHP) because it lets me do CS and business, it's really small, like 50 people, is known for landing students good internships, and lets me do research (senior year thesis) but I'm not sure if going to UT will disadvantage me in terms of employment opportunities. AT UT they say Turing is equivalent to Cal or CMU, but I'm not sure if that's the case in the eyes of employers, although the program seems v strong to me and I know ppl who've picked it over the other two. Cornell engineering is technically an option but I've pretty much ruled it out because it seems to not just be as strong technically as the others and prestige/connections doesn't seem as important in tech (is this a correct assessment??). I understand that you can be successful from all these schools and that it's what you do there that matters, but it seems that there is some type of structural advantage for employment/internships (in addition to overall higher lvl of ppl and quality of edu as well as rep w companies) to going to a ""big 4"" tech school like UCB or CMU. Cost isn't really a factor btw. Any opinions?"

In these 2 years, I've mostly just helped out with my family business and not much else related to software. I want to change that. I am ready to work hard and I want to get back into the game.

I am currently debating between Iron Yard (Houston, TX) or Hack reactor (Austin, TX). Obvious Hack Reactor costs a bit more plus I need to find housing which would further increase costs, but I do notice Hack Reactor's admissions are lot more rigorous and selective. I'm currently working through Hack Reactor's pre-admission coding challenges. Hack Reactor also more open with their hiring rate data than Iron Yard. I just want some opinions, comments, and/or advice from someone that has gone through a program like these 2, and hopefully help me come to a decision on which one I should attend.

It was late already, and I didn’t want to be bothered to go up two floors to surrender this to Lost &amp; Found, so I just decided to take it home. I had no intentions of reading the journal - after all, I knew it was private, but something drew me to it. It must have been the doodles on the cover of the notebook - it was filled with colorful doodles, and in the middle – a huge name was printed in a pretty script – “Ally”. You could tell that a lot of work was put into it, so it piqued my curiosity, to say the least. When I got home, I placed it by the kitchen counter so I wouldn’t forget to bring it to work the next day.*

*While I was having dinner, a gust of wind blew the journal’s pages open, and the page where it was left open grabbed my attention. In huge letters, written in dark ink were the words “SOMEBODY PLEASE KILL ME.” I could sense the torment in that sentence, which was in direct contrast to the bright and colorful cover art. What could have happened to this girl? That’s when I decided to grab the journal and read through it. She has an interesting story to tell, and I am sharing the entries here. Since she’s obviously had this journal for a while, there’s quite a lot of un-related entries – mostly mundane, high school stories about school, her friends, and everything in between.

I found something really cool in school today. I was by the school yard, cramming some Algebra homework, so I needed to be by myself, no time to gossip about what Laura did during Homeroom. Haha. So I chose a spot where I wouldn’t be distracted by everyone else, and I found this huge tree outside. My god, Algebra is so boring, it’s so hard to concentrate on this stupid subject, that’s why I found myself staring off and that’s when I saw some weird markings carved by the base of the tree trunk. It was intricately carved, not like your usual tree markings of initials that lame couples do. They were carvings of a foreign language (Latin, maybe), and it went around the whole tree. I read the carvings and was amazed at how it was made, they were written in script, and it looked really nice. I took a Snapchat of it, but no one seems to know what the words meant. Cara said it might be a love poem written in Latin. How romantic!! But anyway, there. It’s just really cool that something like this exists in this lame school.

######October 10, 2015

OMG my life has been so busy lately. School is the absolute worst, so I don’t even have time to update here. But, okay, I’m taking a break from schoolwork first, or otherwise known as procrastination. LOL. Actually I wanted to write about something weird that happened last night. I don’t exactly know what happened, it was kinda freaky, but yeah. I woke up this morning with dirty feet. It’s not just the dusty kind of dirty - oh no - it was actually *muddy*. It was so gross I swear!! I freaked so much when I woke up and saw my sheets. The weird thing is, I have never sleepwalked in my entire life. And even if I did, where would I go? We don’t have a lawn, and our house is so far away from anything remotely resembling soil or grass. Plus, it hasn’t been raining lately, so, where would the mud come from? The mud didn’t smell like poop or anything (eeew can you imagine if it was poop! Ugh!), it really was soil. So weird. But whatever, maybe I walked on a potted plant that spilled over, or something. Now how to figure out how I suddenly started sleepwalking…

######October 15, 2015

Okay, this sleepwalking thing is getting real. It happened again last night. I woke up and this time, I was hugging a piece of driftwood. I know, why the hell am I hugging a piece of wood? I don’t even know what to make of it, it’s super strange! I told Liam about it and he cracked up at the image of me cuddling next to a piece of driftwood. “I hope you didn’t make out with it in your sleep,” he said. I rolled my eyes at him. It sounds silly, I shouldn’t have told him. But this is so strange! I looked closely at the wood and found that it had the same style of carving as the one found in school. So… what does this mean.. was I too obsessed with those carvings that I actually sleepwalked to school and got myself a portion of the carvings? What an absolutely dorky thing to do right. The thing is, this piece of driftwood doesn’t even remotely resemble the tree in the school yard. I’m pretty sure it’s from another type of tree entirely.

######October 21, 2015

WHAT THE HELL, I am legitimately freaking out. I woke up this morning and I had cuts in my forearms. Not just shallow, small scratches that I might have gotten from plant branches, but actual, deep cuts. I don’t understand at all. I didn’t have any dreams at all - I just woke up from a deep sleep and I could feel my left arm throbbing. I looked at it and the cut was still bleeding. My other arm also had two cuts, but not as deep as the one on my left. I quickly ran to the bathroom to stop the bleeding and saw the box cutter on top of the sink. Oh god, I don’t even know how I could have managed to hurt myself this way without waking myself up. Also, what the hell? I am so not a cutter! I don’t even feel sad or depressed or whatever! But seriously, this is freaking me out. I’m so scared. I didn’t tell my parents about the mud and the wood, coz that’s just weird, but now I have to. Mom’s gonna panic, I swear.

######October 25, 2015

OH MY GOD DID I JUST KILL A DOG? I’m hyperventilating right now, what the hell is the matter with me? I had sleepwalk-free nights since the cutting. I managed to convince Mom not to take me to the hospital (I didn’t wanna create a scene), and she agreed. But she told me if it happened again, we’d go ASAP. And I thought it would stop already. But this morning, I woke up with blood in my hands. I freaked out, thinking I cut myself again. When I checked, I realized I didn’t have any new wounds. And that’s when I heard my mom screaming downstairs. I ran down and saw a dog on the couch, its stomach slashed open, with its entrails hanging out. Mom saw my bloody hands and we both realized it was probably me who did this. HOW COULD I DO THIS? I don’t even know where this dog came from!! I have never hurt a living thing in my entire life, I am not a psycho person who kills animals. OMG I cannot deal with this. Mom’s taking me to the psychiatrist now. I really hope whatever this gets fixed already. OH GOD WHAT IF PEOPLE FROM SCHOOL FIND OUT? They’re gonna think I’m some sort of “Carrie” freak – which I AM SO NOT. Ughhhh. I hope I don’t run into anyone on the way to the psychiatrist. My life is ruined. GOD.

They confined me to a psych ward. My world is falling apart, I don’t even know what’s happening to me. Two days ago, the worst thing happened to me. EVER. I woke up inside my high school gym, completely naked, with blood markings on my body. I could not decipher the markings at first, but they looked familiar. I realized that the words written on my body were the same words carved into the tree trunk in school. Did I do this to myself? I knew I didn’t have any wounds on me, so whose blood was used? I was hyperventilating and close to losing it. What if someone saw me completely naked? What if this was some sort of sick prank??? Thankfully, it was still early, around 4 in the morning and no one was in school yet. So I went to the lockers and stole some athlete’s uniforms, and ran back home, crying. I’ve never been more scared in my entire life. Am I going crazy??? I feel fine, I don’t know why I keep doing these things in my sleep!! I tried to google if these were symptoms for some sort of mental sickness. Maybe I had a brain tumor? I don’t know. I’m so scared. It’s a good thing they let me keep my journal, I guess they know that writing these things down would keep me sane. Is this how it feels to go crazy? I don’t know anymore. I feel like such a freak I don’t even know how to face my friends anymore after this, SOMEBODY PLEASE KILL ME to end all this suffering. My life is over anyway.

* * * * * *
*At this point, I decided to stop reading for the night. I was troubled by it, and realized that it belonged to one of the patients where I worked. I didn’t remember anyone named Ally from the patients confined in the psych ward, but maybe it was a nickname. I knew I had to give it back to the doctors, but I was too curious. Seeing that there were still a couple of pages remaining in the journal, I decided to keep the journal with me for one more day. I promised I’d bring it back once I’m done reading it. So, I got ready for bed, and prepared to sleep.*

*I placed the journal on my bedside table, and slept the sleep of the troubled.*

* * * * * *

*I woke up to the sound of whimpering. I was so disoriented, I didn’t know where I was. I lived alone, with no pets, so the whimpering came out of the blue. As I opened my eyes fully, I saw that my palm had a weird cut, and it was bleeding. As I tried to ascertain where it came from, the whimpering became louder. It was the voice of a little girl. A chill ran down my spine. I was so confused. I looked at the foot of my bed and saw a little girl, dirty and muddied on the floor. She saw me and her eyes widened with fear. I felt another cold chill, why was she scared of me? I approached her and she squeaked in fear. I told her I wasn’t gonna hurt her, then I told her she could leave if she wanted. But first, I wanted to know what I did and why she was here in my apartment. She stared at me with large eyes then looked at her hands and feet. I saw that she was tied to the bed post. I panicked and immediately untied her. She lashed out at me and scratched my face, then seeing that I wasn’t fighting back, she ran out of my bedroom and out of my apartment.*
 
*I felt a numbing panic. I wanted to know what happened the night before. All I remember was falling into a deep, troubled sleep. And that’s when I realized that this sounded very much like what happened to Ally, where mysterious things happened without me knowing it. But why was it happening to me now? I knew I had to get to the bottom of this.*
*I realized that the girl in my room could be calling the cops at that moment, but I needed to know what happened to Ally – if she even survived all these crazy things. Maybe there was an explanation in the journal, and I could show it to the cops so they wouldn’t arrest me. So I barred all my doors, grabbed the journal, and started reading again.*

######December 5, 2015

All those tests done to me. All those pills I took. Being confined in the psych ward. None of it worked. Because I just killed a nurse. With my fucking bare hands. I think I strangled her, and when I woke up, she was dead on the floor. I screamed my lungs out when I saw her. They put me in restraints, did more tests. The next day, I somehow managed to escape. I woke and I found myself in an abandoned warehouse, and I had nothing but this journal with me. I stayed in hiding in the warehouse, I knew I was now a criminal, and I had to figure out what to do before I even think of communicating with anyone. My life is ending and I don’t even know what the fuck is going on. I do not have memories of anything at all. Everything is a blur. I don’t even want to sleep anymore, because I don’t know what I’ll do next. I’m trying to stay awake by writing on this journal. But I’m feeling so sleepy and exhausted…

######December 6, 2015

I woke up today and realized I moved to a different abandoned warehouse. But something felt different. This time, there was no feeling of confusion. This time, I had crystal-clear dreams. In my dreams, I was talking to a figure that looked like a shadow of a man. He was talking to me in a low, gravelly voice. Even if he was just a shadow, he was terrifying. He felt…evil. It pulsed around him. He was telling me about his plans for me - his plans for himself. He told me that everything that happened to me was part of a ritual to give himself physical form. Once he gets his physical form, he will no longer exist in dreams alone, he can now walk amongst the waking world. The driftwood, my blood, the dog, the nurse – these were all offerings and sacrifices that would eventually give him form. He said we were making good progress and that he just needed three more bodies to complete the ritual. I was horrified. Maybe a part of me thought that I didn’t do these things to these innocent creatures, but what he told me just confirmed it. I WAS A MURDERER. I didn’t want any part of this ritual. I cried and begged him to end my involvement, to end this curse, I didn’t want to do it anymore, I wanted to die. He already ruined my life. I bargained with him, and he relented. He said there was one way to transfer the curse. If I got someone to unknowingly take up the curse, then I would be free.

I woke up with a clarity that I never experienced before. I knew what to do.

* * * * * *

*I finished reading the journal. And I understood that Ally transferred the curse to me, and now the Shadow needs three more bodies to complete his transformation into physical form. I’m glad I didn’t give him the little girl’s body. Maybe the transfer of the curse wasn’t complete yet when it started to use me. As I am writing this, I am hiding out in a motel by the highway, the cops are most likely looking for me for kidnapping that little girl. I haven’t slept in 36 hours for fear of doing harm while I sleep. I knew how to rid myself of this curse, but even then, I wasn’t sure if it would work for me or just for Ally. So, I try to keep myself awake. It is torture. I am afraid, but my story is not done yet, so I will share with you the last entry of Ally’s journal. I *have* to share it with you.*

Dear Reader,

*hoc transferatur in maledictum , quisquis haec legit*

I am sorry I am burdening you with this. But I cannot be responsible for bringing such a malevolent force to this world. I am giving that responsibility to you. I have done enough damage. You have read my story, now it’s your turn. Now that you have completely read my story, the curse has been passed on to you. I pray that you are able to hold back the Shadow’s transformation. You know what to do. I will not risk falling asleep and continuing the Shadow’s work. As I write the last letter of this story, I will slit my wrists and allow myself to die - to sleep forever. I will not be an instrument anymore.

May you have the strength to resist the Shadow of Sleep.
Stay awake.

- We don't feel any national connection to this place. Certainly not enough to justify living in this constant conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, between Right winged and Left winged political groups, between orthodox and secular...
- While being born Jews, neither of us feel any connection to Judaism, and the religious character of the country means, for example, no public transport on weekends.

**tl;dr - B.SC in Mathematics and Computer Science want to move to Sweden with my SO, me for work/masters and her for bachelors.** 

Edit: Forgot to mention that we each expect to have around 15-20k euros in saving by July 2018, for the initial expenses.

Now just follows a barrage of questions:

- All published requirements in both [universityadmissions.se](https://www.universityadmissions.se/en/All-you-need-to-know1/Applying-for-studies/Entry-requirements/Bachelors-level-requirements/) and on Karolinska's website only mention required high-school level courses, while saying nothing about actual grades. Is there a way of knowing whether my SO even has a real chance of getting accepted and if any scores should be improved in advance?
- Assuming I want to find a job. How do I even start? Do I just move to Sweden for a month in which I apply to every job I can, hoping to find someone which would accept me and help me with getting a work permit? Can anyone actually be bothered with it?
- Suppose I booked a flight to Sweden. Should I be staying at a hotel at first or should I rent a place online? Is it even possible to find one month rentals? How is this all taken care of?
- Is learning Swedish supported in Sweden in any way? Are there any good courses/language schools we'll be able to attend?

I'm feeling lost. A lot of stories I here give the vibe of ""book a flight and go"", but it just seems like there's so much requirements..

EDIT: I forgot to mention I am about to complete sophomore year. I feel like my class standing may be relevant."

I loved it there, my boss and my team really seemed to like me but there was not enough in the budget for another regular employee. Now, they are looking for another hire, and my boss messaged me directly and offered an interview. 

There  have been some org changes since I've left and my boss now reports to someone new, who will be in town for this interview. To my knowledge, the new position wasn't posted publicly anywhere, so I'm led to believe that either the interview is more of a formality, or I'm one of a small handful considered. 

Does anyone have any advice to stand out in this interview, given I already have a fairly good idea of the job and what's expected of me and he already has a solid idea of me as an employee? Thanks!"

I am currently a 2nd year computer science major, and I have no internship lined up for this summer. I am looking for advice on how to best prepare myself for my school's career fair this fall. My background:

* No previous internship experience
* One semester of Python (extremely basic knowledge)
* Two semesters of C++ (basic knowledge)
* Long term goal to work with satellite communications, secondary goal of network security

After browsing this sub, I have gathered that I should spend my summer doing:

* Working on one or two long projects that show an advanced knowledge of a language
* Contribute to OSS on GitHub

Do you have any other recommendations? For instance, would it help to teach myself (or take an online class) on Java, C# (maybe develop a simple application), PHP, or JavaScript (maybe develop a website and learn how to use SQL servers)? Or should I focus on advancing my knowledge of C++/Python?

Any advice welcome! Thanks!"

Right now, I work two part-time jobs and an unpaid internship, so all-in-all, I work 7 days a week. If you include my crazy commute, I'm either working or commuting 60 hours a week. (add in the time I put into job searching and it comes to 65-70 hours)

That might not seem like much, but every other semester, I've taken 18 credits of classes all while working part-time and participating in extracurriculars to volunteering. I've had to put a ton of effort and time into my education to maintain my 3.9GPA. I've been going non-stop for the past three years. 

I'm completely exhausted at this point. I suffer from depression and anxiety and it takes everything in me not to intentionally crash my car on my commute. I'm buckling under the pressure of not having any time to myself and having to job hunt and make time for interviews. 

The job hunt isn't looking that great for me right now, so my parents suggested that I take the summer off and just work my weekend job just to have a little extra money. 

The problem is that, won't this look bad? I'm in this terrible place between wanting to commit suicide and being too scared to, so I have to plan for the future. 

I'm really worried that if an employer sees a gap, they won't want to consider me. 

It might also help to know that I'm 23, so I'm older than your average undergraduate, which makes me feel like even more of a failure. 

Does anyone have advice on this? Or just words of wisdom?

I know this is kind of a long shot, but does anyone have any advice on how I can spend my summer to help my chances of getting into these schools' engineering departments as a transfer? I never expected to be rejected from everywhere I applied to,  I don't really have a nice internship lined up or a research position or anything like that.

I applied to work as a software engineering intern at IBM back in late February and they've got a system that allows you to 'track' your application and see who is looking at it and who approves it, etc. It's been two months and I've moved from being filtered through to being looked at by HR, approved by HR, and my application is now being looked over by a hiring manager (good news I suppose?).


This whole process is taking forever though and I really need to nail an internship this summer cause I'm pretty desperate for cash. Should I stay patient with IBM because it looks somewhat promising or should I start shotgunning and cold calling places looking for other opportunities? 

I feel waiting for IBM is a dangerous move because they have a required GPA of 3.0, I only have a 2.8 but am getting pushed along anyway. Plus I live in Western NY and it seems their interview location is in Texas.... Although the pay is pretty sweet (~30/hr) and the job seems rewarding.


Anyone here have experience with this? Their slow hiring process? Whether or not this is all some kinda ruse? "

I'm a 26 year old female graduating with a masters in CS next month. My undergraduate degree is in something different but I took prerequisite courses after I graduated and worked my ass off. I also took a lot of math for my undergrad and did research with scientists that used machine learning. My specialization for my masters degree allowed me to  learn and get experience with machine learning and data cleaning, visualizing, analyzing in general. (Sorry for being vague...)

I am currently an intern getting paid $16 an hour doing development work. I'm making a web app even though the company itself is in security. I worked on the backend but now I'm using some JavaScript to visualize data.

I did a resume blast earlier this year which had recruiters contacting me. Only couple were in the field I actually want to go in - data analytics. Anyway, there is one big pharmaceutical company that might be interested in interviewing me. I'd be working on a contractual basis for $24 an hour. It comes to around $49k. I thought I'd be ok with it because the company name will look good on my resume. 


Honestly, I feel like crap. They want someone who can program in couple scripting languages and know machine learning amongst other skills on their wishlist. 


I had talked to another recruiter from a different temp agency who was looking to fill a security position - for $110k. It's been a while since I've done actual security work, and it's not something I want to do long term anyway. Another prospective job is for a start up looking for programmers. The pay would be around $50-$70k.


I'm sorry for being all over the place. I just don't know how much longer I can go at my current 'job'. I haven't even received a job offer. My work effort has been going down probably because of the pay and work.


Should I hold out and study linear algebra/data structures/ML? Maybe that would give me more options. I live in NJ. Am I getting low job offers because of how much I make now? If $26 an hour follows me throughout my career then it's a job not worth taking. I am so embarrassed to tell recruiters or ANYONE how little I make now. :(

I'm typing on my phone so I'm sorry for any errors. I don't think I can even stomach reading this wall of post without crying.

Spent 8 months part-time enrolled in a MS program in CS and constantly flipping out and realizing how much it sucks to be unemployed making a career transition. All the panicking helped and I landed a few opportunities for this summer. 

1) An underpaid internship, at $20/hr, which is below the average I KNOW Is paid to graduate interns at other similar companies (Sandia National Labs pays grad interns $32/hr and it's publicly funded). However, the work culture here seems very friendly, thoughtful, and academic, and the internship is strongly related to my niche since it involves healthcare informatics + public health + policy + data science. The internship is technically a data-science internship, meaning it might help me market myself in data science later on.

2) A software engineering job at a MedTech startup that wants to interview me because I have a background in physics AND med AND CS and they use all three of those things. They pay far better than the internship (not sure exactly what, but I think it's &gt;$35/hr) but they are only 2 years old and will probably go under and I don't want to work here for that long for this reason.

I was told I've got the internship today but have to let them know if I accept it by Monday. Unfortunately my interview for #2 isn't until next week - although I've been told by my friend who works there that I have a VERY good chance of getting it.
Should I just take #1 and be happy I have a data science internship? Does internship salary affect future salary negotiations at all? Or am I being desperate?
Where will a niche MD/CS person like me have the most comfortable and highest paying job opportunities later down the line?

Planned classes next year: 

- AP Calculus BC

- IB Geography SL

- Dual Enrollment English

- Computer Engineering

- Personal Fitness

(My schedule next year is all fucked up because I'm taking classes at an academy and my base school, so there needs to be a travel time between the two, meaning that I can't take as many academic courses because I'd be late to that class. Normally, most other students in my school who also take these academy classes will chill in the library until next period instead of going to a class because no academic teacher will allow me to be late every single class. However, I am thinking about taking personal fitness instead of chilling in the library so that I don't have to work out at home and I have more time to work on other stuff at home.)


Teacher Recommendations:
I haven't technically asked any of my teachers for a recommendation yet since I'm a junior, but I'm planning on getting my computer science teacher and my math teacher to write one. My math teacher loves my hard work, dedication, and enthusiasm. My CS teacher thinks that I'm an extremely passionate student because I already knew how to code before I took the class, go above and beyond (which sometimes pisses him off when I go too far), and help other students during class. Of course, idk what they'll actually write about me, but this is what I'm guessing they'll write about.


Stuff I'm planning on doing for the future (not all of which I can put on my resume):

- Summer internship at a software engineering company. (I've got connections :) )

- I have a Java coding competition in May

- I have an FBLA National competition for cybersecurity in a few weeks that I'm studying for

- I'm may try to get a few certifications. I've heard that the FBLA state competition is similar to the Comptia Security+ exam and the Network+ exam, so I might try to also go get those certifications as well. However, I may or may not do this before I apply to college.

- I'm going to study some metaspoit over the summer

- I'm retaking SAT and Subject SATs

- Next year, I'm planning to start a computer science club in my school. (I missed the deadline for making a club in my school this year :( ).

- I'm going to take the AP computer science test later this year

- I'm going to take the AP US History test later this year

- I'm taking the IB Math SL exam this year

- I'm taking the IB Psychology SL exam this year

- I'm taking the IB Computer Science SL exam this year

- I'm taking the IB Business Management SL exam this year

- Graduating with an advanced diploma next year


Questions:

1.) If I don't have a good shot at getting into these colleges, what other good CS colleges should I be looking at?

2.) What do you think are some good backup colleges for me?

3.) Will me taking personal fitness next year severely impact my chances of getting into a competitive college? I would rather be working out than wasting most my time in study hall, but will not taking on another IB class negatively impact my chances of getting into a competitive college?

4.) I've preformed quite poorly in some subject SATs (which I didn't list here). If the college we're applying to says that it doesn't use score choice, does that apply to subject SATs as well? Or does their policy only apply to the regular SATs?

5.) I know that my test scores and academics could be way better (I honestly prefer screwing around on my computer, something that could help me in life, than to study for a stupid SAT, something that won't help me in life), but can my extracurriculars cancel that out? Or am I completely fucked? Should I consider easier colleges? I really want to go somewhere nice, but idk if I'll make it with my scores."

3 months in and I'm realizing this is not the path for me, and more importantly that I  and that I would rather go back to my shithole of a boring miserable IT job than continue on in this overly-competitive ass-kissing industry. I'd still prefer something else over what I WAS doing, but I'm not sure what that is, but no matter what I want to move back to the St. Louis area, or at LEAST somewhere reasonably close. I uprooted my entire life there and regret every second of it every day of my life. 

As for my career-related skills, I CAN program although I'm not particularly great at it nor did I love it in school (but I'm open to it solely because my friends have said it's much better as a career than in school). I know C, PHP, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I feel reasonably confident in all of those. Also I've had internships in Networking and VoIP/Teleconferencing areas and am open to those as well. 

PLEASE anyone tell me their thoughts on any of this. I feel absolutely lost and everyone around me seems like they all have their shit together and I'm just over here drowning. "

Up until that point in my life i never allowed myself to get close to anyone. I never had a girlfriend and never had a close ""best friend"" either. I simply did not trust people. When i realized he was different and not the typical druggie or ass hat like the rest of my school i opened up to him and a few other friends. He gave me confidence that there are good people in this world. In 9th grade we became better and better friends. In 10th grade he invited me to go somewhere with him. I could not even remember a time before that i even talked to anyone outside of school. After that we became very close. I barely used my phone before I started talking to him. But after I started getting closer to him I would get annoyed he would text me so much. After a while I began to like it a little bit. The summer before my junior year I was hanging out with his friends in the somewhat “popular” group and doing things with them. All we did was hangout and text each other that summer. If I didn’t text him by 10am he would text me. Once a week we would go to the movies or play ball with other friends or ourselves. Towards the end of summer he invited me over his house. I stayed there overnight and into the afternoon of the next day. He seemed to like that I stayed that long. The next weekend I said he should come over my house and do the same thing. He seemed down with it until that night. He backed out. It was very obvious that he lied. I did not say anything but I asked a few more weekends and he lied again. I was crushed and started confronting him about it. He kept blowing it off and using every excuse in the book. I kind of backed away for a while until my other friend (who is a girl) said that he was asking her out on those weekends he told me no. She HATES him and has no interest in him at all. She told me everything. He was saying in groups that he would come over to my house and get drunk. (my mom is a teacher at this school HE COULD HAVE GOT HER FIRED). I don’t drink so that was a lie anyway.  I told him that I wanted nothing to do with him after that. I ignored him and his texts for a few days. He was almost in tears and told me that he couldn’t lose me and that I was like a brother to him. I told him I accepted his apology when I really didn’t. A few months later I asked him to come over after school and he said he couldn’t. But as soon as somebody else was also invited he suddenly could come. I left it go. I asked him what he was doing after prom because my date wanted to go home afterwards. He told me he would let me know. He never told me and I found out from another friend that he was going to an after party that I was also invited to. I did not go and the day after it was obvious he did not want me there. At this point I gave up and just let him do what he wanted. I said I wanted to talk about everything so we would quit fighting and he agreed. We didn’t even make it to that day because he backed out and I gave up. After a few nasty things were said we didn’t talk all summer. I got a great internship that will prepare me for my future and I didn’t think much of it that summer til I went back to school and seen him. He is unbothered by this and did not change at all. I am a senior now and ready to graduate. I lost almost all my friends because of all this. I disowned anybody who even talks to him. I have no self-esteem. And I am afraid to even look for new friends or try to have a girlfriend because of this. He watched me hurt for months and continued to lie worse and worse. I do not trust people again and I fear that will stick though college.  Should I just try to open up and forget about this? Or let people come to me? I am giving myself ulcers and making myself sick thinking about something like this happening again while he is still the cheerful funny person I thought was my friend."

I received 2 offers for summer internship (currently a grad student). 

One I will learn to use apache spark and may analyze some data but as far as I understand, I may not use too much ML/datamining techniques. But overall I am not as clear on what exactly I will be doing. 

The other offer is using python to go through the whole process from data gathering to analysis to writing a report/visualizations about my finding. 

I have gotten some experience using python to perform some basic data analysis (including ML) for a class this semester, but I still have a lot to learn and I feel like this may be more directly what I would want to do in the future. 

Which sounds better to you guys?

Basically my question boils down to:

Is it worth it to dive in and learn how to use spark (and probably learn a lot more since this is completely new to me)

Or 

Further improve my python data analysis skills. 

Thanks! Feel free to ask questions in order to better answer or if anything wasn't clear. "

(and maybe suggestions),cancanpiano,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/6685bu/chance_me_and_maybe_suggestions/,"I'm currently a junior at a high-performing public school in Silicon Valley. My GPA is a bit lacking compared to my SAT scores, and I am thinking of applying to some schools in the UC System, Cal Poly SLO, and a couple reaches like Harvey Mudd and Carnegie Mellon. I'm white, male, Jewish, and average socioeconomic status for this area (which is probably upper middle class or low high class). I'm not 100% sure what I'd like to study, but I'm probably going to apply for engineering or computer science.

**GPA**

So, this is the most lacking part, but hopefully my other parts can make up for this, as well as the fact that my school has difficult classes, even for regular classes.

Weighted: 4.09
Non-Weighted: 3.67

Last year, I got a C in AP Euro History, but got a 5 on the AP test when only 6% of test-takers did. Will schools notice this?

This semester I expect to get maybe one or two B+s.

**Testing**

I took the new SAT in December: 1530 (800 M/730 Reading).
I got a 1470 on the PSAT.
5 on the AP Euro exam.
800 on Math II Subject Test.

APs for this year: Spanish, Calc BC, Comp Sci, Physics I/II (I expect a 5 on Calc and Comp Sci, 4/5 on Spanish, and I'm not sure about Physics).
Nest year: Statistics, US Government, Physics C, Microeconomics

I'm taking the Physics and Spanish subject tests in June.

**Extracurriculars**

Piano - I've been taking piano since first grade, and I have completed up to Level 9 in the California Certificate of Merit exam, and plan to finish Advanced Level next year.

Musical Theater - I've performed in various productions at both school and at a local youth theater company.

Marching Band - I've been in marching band throughout high school, and I plan to finish a fourth year in the fall.

Choir - I've been involved in lots of choirs, and next year I will likely be in the top choir at my school which goes on international tour every year. I also do an international Jewish high school choir, which performed at The Met this year and at Carnegie last year. I'm a ""teen leader"" so I was the teen liaison for our chapter and went to leadership meetings and training, and held events. I was also in the chamber choir there, which had less than 10% of the singers in the whole choir (the best ones).

Robotics - I did FIRST robotics this year at my school, and our team is going to nationals. I was not the most involved person, but I learned a lot while taking a class and working hands-on.

Internship - This summer I am planning on working at a kids science camp with a good reputation (it's a big organization with various sites). It is a competitive internship, and I'm excited to work with kids as well as learn internship sorts of skills.

**Award**

National Spanish Exam Gold Award (top 5% of students, did this for Level 2 in 9th grade, Level 3 in 10th grade, waiting for results from this year)

Probably can't count this, but I made it to the state levels with my school's 4-person MATHCOUNTS team when I was in middle school.

There's a chance I could apply for Princeton, since I do have my dad as legacy there, but it's pretty unlikely I'd get in with my scores.

Sorry for the bad formatting, I'm kinda new to doing such long posts, but please give me suggestions or college recommendations, and chance me on the above. Thanks! :)"

This is officially my first time posting here, but long story short I TAG'd to UCI as an Informatics major and was accepted back in mid-March. I was really excited about it, but recently I've gotten a lot of second thoughts about Informatics. Namely, I've just been hearing about how it looks really bad on a resume when it comes time for job interviews because 1) Nobody really knows what Informatics is and 2) It's true that it's not as rigorous as CS, and I won't be able to get my foot in the door when applying for jobs.

I love design and programming, plus Human Computer Interaction sounded incredibly interesting to me, but I'm worried now that opportunities are limited with this major. The last thing I want is to graduate thinking my major is ""useless""...I know that it's not your degree that defines you, and I desire to get involved with research and internships at UCI, but I just can't stop debating whether I should stick with Informatics or switch to CS to have a better chance at finding a job after graduation. I am currently contemplating whether I should decline my acceptance in order to stay back another year at my community college in order to be able to switch to Computer Science (I don't have Calc 2A/2B, which are requirements for transfer). Truth be told this decision also scares me because I would have to go through the TAG and general application process again, and CS seems to be getting more and more competitive every year.

If anyone is currently an Informatics major or knows a friend in the program, can you please tell me how you feel about the major, as well as if the alumni network or career fairs have helped you create connections and find internship opportunities?

Thanks so much in advance! c:

The lame part is that I feel like my GPA doesn't really matter anymore; I'm going to start my second solid software engineering internship in June, have been doing pretty intense image processing research since sophomore year, and will probably have several publications by the end of next year. 

The issue is that I'm so neurotic about school that I'll sort of think that I don't care until my grades actually dip, at which point I'll go into this sort of weird incredibly motivated try hard hyper-competetive jacakss phase until I pull out As anyway (with significant damage to my soul, etc). It's getting real difficult now, as I'm done with both minors, only have 300/400 level ECE left, and work 20 hours a week in my lab.

I guess my underlying worry is that if I try to chill out a little and just accept a B or two, I'll end up with Cs, and that'll really mess up grad school applications. Any advice for taking my mind off of school a little even if I don't have straight As? I want to spend more time with my friends/girlfriend, sleep occasionally, and go hiking etc, but it's hard to think about when engineering is always in the back of my mind."

I'm a 25 years old male living in London. I've just finished a BA in Advertising and I'm looking for a full-time gig. The only thing I did during my years at university are 3 different internships (one of them paid) and that's it.

London is so expensive and I'm wondering when I'll start to save some serious money. Right now it feel like I'll never will. The contracts I'm looking right now are all in the range of £18-22k per year... which is barely enough to live here.

Basically, I'll spend all of my salary in rent, food, transports, clothes etc. For how long will I've to stay like this? 2-3 years? I'll reach 30 without even noticing and without having any money.

Living without money sucks. I envy people who can spend money without the need of worrying about the fact... that they're spending money. I'm not talking about big expenses, but I'd love to be in a position where I know I can pay rent, food, transports, clothes, book flights, go to restaurants, book holidays etc without being like ""oh fuck, how am I going to eat this month?"".

I feel like I'll never reach this. Or maybe I will... when I'm already in my 40s or something. :\

What should I do?

I have not done a CS internship and am nearing completion of my degree.

I've tentatively accepted the CS research assistantship. However, I am wondering if it would be better to take a research assistantship in this other field: It would mean experience in the domain I'm interested in outside of Computer Science, and I may end up doing graduate studies in that area. On the other hand, the CS job means work experience in software development which I don't have on my resume, and the time to apply for software development positions is fast approaching as I near graduation.

I don't think there is a 'right answer', but I'd love to hear your feedback - I think you all may have insights into this I do not have / have not thought of.

It’s far from a dream job; the hours aren’t bad and it pays enough, but the commute is a pain in the ass. I moved back in with my mom in the suburbs after my boyfriend dumped me so I’m stuck using public transit to avoid hours of bumper-to-bumper traffic. Every day, I wake up at 7, drive to the train station at quarter of 8 and take the local 8:19 into the city. In my office, I sit at an open desk the size of a folding table, trying to avoid playing footsie with my douchebag co-worker Dennis directly across from me. At the end of the day, I board the 5:24 train, usually squeezing into a seat next to a heavyset businessman arguing on his cell phone, if I’m lucky to get a seat at all. Then I head back home, make small talk with my nosy mother and check my Facebook timeline to see which one of my friends is getting engaged or having a baby next. If I sound whiny, it’s because I am. More than a year of this monotony with not enough money saved to make a change has rendered me pathetic. 

The only good thing to happen in awhile was the discovery of the shortcut. 

I buy a parking pass every month for the massive lot a block from the station. It costs a pretty penny on top of the train card and you have to pay for it in the station in advance. The lot is absolutely cutthroat in the morning; all of the good spots are taken by the 6 and 7 a.m. crowd and there’s only one driveway in and out, creating an inescapable daily traffic jam for drivers who need to swipe their passes for entry. 

I was running late a few weeks ago when I realized I never bought my April parking pass. Cursing to myself, I drove in circles, debating whether I could just take the ticket it would cost to park in a 2-hour meter spot when I noticed the tiny shop on Mulberry. Unlike the colorful cafes and upscale boutiques in the neighborhood, it was unremarkable, its exterior white paint peeling around the large “for sale” sign plastered to the boarded-up window and door. I vaguely remembered seeing the shop before it closed (a thrift store, maybe?) but there was nothing to identify it now. I did spot the tiny gravel driveway on the side and followed that through to the back of the building.

The small lot only had five parking spaces, designated with fading yellow lines. I pulled into the nearest spot, hopping out and glancing around for any private parking or towing service signs. Mercifully, there were none. I was closing my car door when I turned towards the store and yelped in surprise at the figure standing in the back window. 

I clutched my heart and exhaled in relief. It was a mannequin, positioned with hands on hips, facing the lot. Actually, it was quite a few mannequins, all clustered together in the crowded room. Some were full-bodied on platforms, some were just heads and torsos - all were smooth and faceless. Four of the full mannequins were arranged in different poses near the window while the rest were thrown around haphazardly, surrounded by boxes and piles of fabrics, amputated mannequin limbs littering the floor. I guessed that this was the store’s office or inventory room, cluttered with things left behind when the store closed. 

I clicked the lock on my keychain and began walking quickly down the driveway, praying I wouldn’t miss my train, but not exactly ready to sprint in my sensible heels. The store was a few blocks out of the way and I didn’t have much time to mosey through the busy streets and quick-changing lights of the crosswalks. I heard a rumbling behind me and the approaching whoosh of a train whistle, much louder than I would have expected. I whirled around to see the gray blur of the express train whizzing by up the hill behind the surrounding trees. Was it a cut-through? On a whim, I made my way back and scurried up the grassy embankment, expecting to be stopped by the chain link fence I knew ran beside the tracks up to the station. Surprisingly, there was nothing - just open air and a clear path to the station platform. A quick glance to my left confirmed that the fence stopped just short of the shop’s lot. Nearly fist pumping in triumph, I hurried down the platform and boarded my train a few minutes later. 

After work, I walked the length of the platform again and navigated my way back to my car, resigned to find a ticket tucked under my windshield wiper or - worse yet - an empty lot. I would feel so stupid dodging a $75 parking pass and paying twice that amount to a towing company. But my car was just as I left it, unscathed. I smiled to myself, satisfied with my small victory. “Thanks for watching it, girls,” I said to the mannequins in the window, giggling to myself in delight as I climbed back in my car. 

For the following weeks, I used my shortcut without issues. Nobody else ever parked in the lot and, as far as I could tell, I wasn’t trespassing or committing any parking violations. I felt strangely optimistic about my good fortune, as insignificant as it seemed. I was only saving a little time and money, but it was the first win I’d gotten in awhile and it was a welcome change of pace. 

A few nights ago, our office hosted a happy hour at the Asian-fusion bar across the street, paying for drinks and appetizers until 9. It was a nice, if not overdue gesture (we never had a Christmas party or anything remotely fun scheduled) and I actually enjoyed myself. Even Dennis managed not to piss me off. I kicked back two or three cocktails and ate my weight in potstickers before calling it a night, shrugging about the commuter lifestyle when a few senior interns asked me why I couldn’t stay longer. 

Drinking and driving isn’t a great look, I know, but I’m not a lightweight and I wasn’t even close to tipsy. I stopped by the drugstore for a water bottle on my walk to the train, chugging the whole thing dry during the 12 stops it took to get home. I hopped off and headed down my new route, wrapping my arms tight around my body in the nighttime chill and noting with a bit of disappointment that the bright station lights didn’t extend all the way down the platform. The area where the fence ended was dark and I stumbled a bit on my way through the trees. I pulled my phone out and turned on the flashlight app to guide myself down the embankment and into the lot. I had never been to my new parking spot after dark so it was a bit jarring to navigate through the brush to my car. I switched off my flashlight since I was no longer in total darkness. There was an eerie, yellow-orange streetlight in front of the store that cast enough light in the back for me to spot my car. I rifled through my bag for my keys. 

Something caught my eye and I paused. I swore I had seen movement in the store window. I squinted into the dark back room, unable to make anything out. I cursed to myself and continued digging for my keys. Maybe I really did drink too much earlier. 

I spotted a flash of light in the window, too quick for me to pinpoint the source. What the hell was happening? I froze, staring towards the building. Nothing. Slowly, I stepped toward the window, my footsteps echoing in the empty lot as my heartbeat thudded in my ears. 

I could just barely make out the shape of the five mannequins in the window. As I stepped closer, it looked like they were in the same positions as always. My eyes bore into the nearest one, willing the lifeless dummy to move its head or start walking and haunt my dreams forever. But it was, of course, still. 

I almost laughed out loud thinking about someone finding me like this - alone in the dark, peering into the window of an empty shop, staring at mannequins. I was definitely a more frightening sight than anything my mind was conjuring up in the moment. 

I started to turn back to my car when I registered more movement in the shop to my left. Was there something behind the mannequins? I cupped my hands around my eyes and the glass, willing my vision to adjust, glancing left and right. One, two, three, four, five mannequins. Five. Weren’t there usually four? Keeping my face against the glass, I sidestepped, assessing the smooth, white, featureless things. Until the last one. I could barely make out the figure, it was darker than the others, almost disappearing in the darkness. I realized its shoulders were moving slowly with breath. And in the dark I could see the slightest reflections of light into two wide eyes. I swallowed the rising panic in my throat and raised my phone with a shaking hand. Keeping my eyes on the figure, I clicked on my flashlight app, aimed it into the window and screamed.

A haggard man stared back at me with impossibly wide eyes, his mouth agape showing yellow, jagged teeth. His blotchy face was frozen in a silent scream, and his face and dirty clothes were streaked with blood. We stood for a few long seconds, just looking at each other. Then he took a step back, turned on his heel and ran out of the back room. 

I stumbled back and fell to the ground, scraping my hands on the asphalt. I clumsily got to my feet and sprinted to my car, searching desperately in my bag for my keys. I heard glass breaking from the front of the store and the sound of heavy footsteps, followed by an animalistic, gargled shriek. I dumped the contents of my bag onto the ground and picked up my keys, standing just in time to see the silhouette of the man running full-force towards me, screeching like a banshee. 

I unlocked my car and got in slamming the door as his hands hit my driver’s side window. I locked the doors and fumbled to put my key in the ignition as he tried to grasp the door handle. I put my car in drive and skidded out of the lot, rounding the corner of the store and clipping my passenger side mirror on the side of the building. 

I looked in my rearview mirror to see him chasing me, arms flailing. I floored it down the driveway and turned onto the street, driving 20 mph over the limit and attracting a police officer parked at the convenience store a few blocks from my house. My bewildered mother was woken out of bed by the sound of my car screeching into the driveway, followed by the blue and red flashing lights of a cop car blaring its siren. I’m not sure who was more angry with me, but they both seemed to calm down, seeing as I was a snotty mess with bloodied hands, trying to explain what had happened through my hiccuping sobs. 

The cop took my statement; he told us he would call in backup and investigate the store. The police phoned my mother yesterday - I had called out sick from work, faking a stomach bug - to inform her that they found the man I had described, roaming the street near the shop. He was homeless and clearly mentally unstable. He had broken into the store by punching through the boarded up, glass front door (hence all the bleeding) and was apparently planning on squatting there for the night. They found a dirty blanket and empty candy wrappers on the floor of the back room. They’re not sure where he came from, but they don’t suspect he has any ties to our quaint little town. They think he might have been trying to steal my car, but since he won’t speak in any recognizable language aside from grunts, they can’t know for sure.

I decided to call out again today. I’m not even faking the nausea; any time I think of leaving my house and walking along that train platform, I feel like I might throw up. I’ve been camped on my couch the past two days while my mom fields calls from relatives, dishing the details about her “daughter’s brush with death” with morbid delight. She’s got prime gossip for years to come. I’ve been drinking cup after cup of coffee to avoid sleeping, only napping for a few hours at a time during the day when I can hear my mom in the next room. I can work from home tomorrow and Friday no problem. But Monday I have a meeting I can’t miss. That’s when I’ll have to suck it up. 

It’s just that, everytime I close my eyes, I see him. It’s not how he sprinted towards my car or even the look of horror on his face when I shined the flashlight in his face. It’s the man in the shadows that I couldn’t quite see, breathing and staring in the dark with those big, open eyes while posed like the mannequins around him. That’s the image I just can’t shake from my mind. 

First thing Monday morning, I’m buying a parking pass. No more shortcuts for me."
66cg0l,0,2017-04-19,Should I keep this unpaid internship?,deeadpoool,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/66cg0l/should_i_keep_this_unpaid_internship/,"Let me start of by saying I'm not extremely interested in software engineering. I'd say at best I'll be satisfied with a software eng job, but who knows until I try. Career wise, I'm interested in software engineering, analytic work, IT consulting and honestly am open to even some less technical jobs.

I'm currently a junior in college. I took an offer for an unpaid internship for the rest of this quarter (ending when school ends) as a Developer Intern at a very young startup (planning on releasing a beta of their product soon) because I was  worried about not finding something for the summer. I ended up getting a summer offer for a reporting and analytics position and now I'm considering quitting the unpaid internship for a couple reasons.

1. Technically it is illegal if I'm doing anything other than coffee or food runs or any work like that.

2. They expect 20 hours a week of work (remote work to be specific). I have rent to worry about so I'm working about 10 hours a week at a restaurant currently. 

3. Not sure if I'll be able to balance school, work, a social life and this internship all at once. I feel something is going to suffer.

4. I really value having a social life and making memories in college. College is an experience you can't really have again. I could juggle all this work, but my social life will definitely suffer.

The biggest reason to stay would be for the experience obviously. Right now it looks like I'll be working with JavaScript mostly (which I have I'm still learning lol). I'm worried that quitting will hurt me down the line.

I was doing event marketing coordination and all of the things that go with it, yo know, things like getting the reps there, preparing speaking ops, etc. 

This morning I come in and everything is like normal, I do my morning email cleanse and then head into my first meeting. It is uneventful. As I exit, my new boss (she had been hired a month prior) asks to speak with me and I get an uneasy feeling. We go into a room and I see our HR rep and I know what's happening. 

My new boss proceeds to tell me that due to ""performance"" I am being terminated. I am immediately caught off guard by this, as I felt I was doing a really nice job executing the company's events plan. The job is basically ""did it get done smoothly? Yes? Ok, go to the next one"". This position was a yes or no performance job and I killed it since I got there. 

I asked to speak with the VP of Product and Marketing, whom I have a good relationship with, and am then told by my new boss that it was a group decision and that he is busy. I am holding back tears at this point, I really liked this job and I cannot understand why this is happening. I ask if they're just gonna have the interns do my work then, cheaper at that, and she said ""no, the company is eliminating the position."" This is bullshit, as the position and the work I did was central to our sales strategy. It was our best option.

At that point, two minutes in, the new boss leaves and I am with HR. She seems visibly sad to have to be doing this and I tell her I don't understand, all of that stuff, and she says she knows I how I feel. So there I am, being told I will be receiving my last check at the end of the month, no severance at all, and without work. The worst part is that my resume looks spotty, as I had been at my previous companies for similar time periods only for, and I shit you not, the departments to have significant budget cuts and be let go. So my last three positions have all resulted the exact same way, but this one is worse because I was doing really good work. 

I'm a fucking wreck right now. I know that being in marketing in Austin is a good place to be, but I am still choking up about how this happened and how I didn't see it coming at all. Why did I write this? Maybe to vent, maybe to field advice, I don't know. All I know is that today, fuck me. "

I just want you to know that you're not alone. 

Okay...so here it goes...

My whole life I've been frustrated with the way I learn. Learning a new concept always felt like I was pushing up against a brick wall, trying to break through and break it into pieces. So I pushed myself academically to coverup this insecurity of mine. I wanted people to believe I was smart and I wanted to believe it too.

I went onto college and studied cancer/constitutional genetics hoping to become a doctor someday. I filled my plate with clubs and leadership positions, was accepted to a extremely competitive undergraduate science program and was accepted to Yale Medical School for my clinical internship to complete my major.

 Sounds like I was doing just fine right? Wrong. 

I dropped out of leadership positions mid way through semesters, I flaked on club meetings, events and presentations because I felt so overwhelmed and didn't know where to start or how to switch from project to project. I lost 15 pounds, I was so anxious I couldn't sleep and skip  class if I was going to be even 5  minutes for fear of being seen as a slacker or failure, I cried almost every day, I was extremely depressed, felt like I couldn't make any friends and the friends that I did make I would always flake out on. I tried to breakup with an abusive boyfriend, but he threatened to commit suicide and said he blamed me. My grades suffered, I drank heavily to forget how I felt, I cried almost everyday for 2 years, I started sleeping around, doing drugs. I was trying to feel. Feel anything at all. 

One night I was sitting in my car in front of a brick wall during my last semester of my senior year sobbing. I wanted to kill myself. I wanted to die. I was so frustrated that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't be who I wanted to be. I exercised everyday, ate healthy, went to therapy, tried medication, did yoga and meditated, I tried to end an abusive relationship. Nothing worked and after almost 10 years of trying to be this happy, smart, joyful person...I was just tired. 

I didn't kill myself that night. I called my absent father and broke down to him. He listened and I felt loved. 

I suffered for about another year until I applied for a job in California and moved across country to start new. I thought it would be a good, fresh start. I excelled in my job, was promoted to manager after a year of working there. Yet I still struggle every single day to get by, with the same problems and the same hateful thoughts I have for myself. 

Through self reflection and therapy I've begun to notice that it has always been difficult/impossible for me to legitimize my thoughts/feelings and accept that this is who I am. But, maybe that is the first real step I need to take. 

I'm 24, diagnosed with major depression disorder and ADHD. This is my story, and I want you to know that we aren't alone.

Thank you. "

There is this program in my country that is Government funded where you pay half of the money for Boot camp and Cert Exams and if you successfully finish you get the Half you paid back, this is how I got my MCSA.

Now there is another similar program that is happening where i would get the Boot Camp+Cert Exam for an MCSA 2016 and an MCSE 2016 in addition to ""soft skill training"" and a Paid internship with one of the test center's Partners. BUT I need to Pass the CERT EXAMS with a MAXIMUM time limit of 2 WEEKS from the last day of Boot camp(of course If i fail I do not get my money back). I have already been interviewed and they really liked me so I can start as soon as I want.  

I have been told by some people already working as SysAdmins and Network admins in companies that it would be best to stop at an MCSA and then maybe do an MCSE after getting into the industry since I could get over qualification issues.

So I wanted to hear what the REAL Professionals in here think about this, should I start the Program, should I look for internships instead or for actual full time Jobs.

Came from finance, made the switch",CinnamonSwisher,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/66d3qf/just_signed_my_first_it_offer_letter_came_from/,"I've lurked in here a bunch during this process and wanted to share my story for anyone that it might help since posts about coming into IT seem to be common.

So I previously was working at a hedge fund. I wasn't thrilled with my role there and was trying to make a transition and pick up more technology related responsibilities and make a slow switch. With the hedge fund industry deflating we started to have layoffs, I thought I was safe after 2 rounds and 6 months but the third round got me. The severance was decent and I had savings so I wasn't panicking to find something else and decided to say fuck it I'll go full IT and start at the bottom.

I did a bunch of research on a path in. I touched up my resume, including (and this might be cheesy but whatever it helped) noting which certs I was currently pursuing. Note that I wasn't filling it with buzzwords and all the certs I ever planned to get, just the two I was currently actively pursuing which were the A+ and an MTA. I started applying to entry level help desk positions while I was studying with low hopes just in case someone was willing to take a shot. 

I ended up getting a lot of rejection obviously, but I did get a call. They happened to schedule my interview for the day after I passed the first half of the A+ so I was able to add that during the interview. I ended up getting a call a week later saying they wanted to go ahead and background and reference check. A key thing they mentioned that they liked from my interview was that I made it obvious I was eager to be an information sponge, while at the same time being aware of what I didn't know and exactly what I should be focused on learning.

But it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Because of my lack of experience I'll essentially be an intern for the first two months, but both parties are confident in my ability to go fulltime after this.

So I hope other people looking to get into IT from another field can take something away from my story. I'm pumped as hell to start this career path and even more pumped for business casual attire!"

This week I was offered two different jobs for the summer, but I'm really conflicted as to which offer to take.

The first job is a job as an assistant project engineer (basically an internship) at a mechanical systems design company. It's really relevant to my major field and the pay is pretty good for someone my age. Plus I really need the experience for my resume. 

The second job is for a leadership position as a waterfront lifeguard/swim lessons director at a medium sized summer camp. I've worked this job the last two summers as a regular lifeguard and applied to be the lead this summer and got it. The pay is also pretty good too and I've got a lot of friends that work there.

My conflict here is more or less the social aspect for each job. I've got pretty bad social anxiety at college and really don't get out much or have many friends, but every summer i've worked at this camp it's really brought me out of my shell. I've made great friends with the people there and they helped me cope with a lot of personal things. But if I take the internship, chances are i'm not going to meet many people my own age this summer since i'll likely be the youngest person at the company, and I worry that the friends that work at the camp will leave me behind when i'm not seeing them every day. Additionally, my parents are really pushing me towards the internship job, but i'm not sure if it's what I want.

So, I guess i'm really looking for advice for which one I should lean towards taking?

So far while I've gone to several interviews I have been unable to get any job offers. 

I got a job interview when I first started applying for a position as a programmer analyst in a company and while it went well I was a little rusty on Databases. Didn't heard from them until 6 months later asking if I was still interested in the position. After a scheduled phone interview in which they asked me questions about databases which was a job requirement I got an e-mail from the HR in which the interviewer recommended me for the position of a ERP Functional Analyst and a interview with the hiring manager. 

I'm honestly confused. Why am I getting offered a different position than the one I applied? Did I not get the job and was offered something else that was open? Should I consider the role even if I was more interested in a developer role? 

I am currently living with my parents while working part time on retail and I'm confused if I should just grab whatever I can find or keep applying for a more interesting position. Everyone I know so far has been recommending I go for it but I'm not sure what to do. 

Given I have a part time, I have flexible time to keep preparing for interviews but I'm not sure if I'll get any offers on the coming months. I want to start working but I'm not sure if I should spring into whatever pops up. I also don't have any experience so I feel like that's also holding me back on job interviews or applications.

I am looking for advice on how to better start off my career. 

**Here's a bit about me (education/skill wise):** I graduated in May 2016 with a master's degree in electrical engineering. My undergraduate degree is in physics. As a master's student, I focused on control systems, but also picked up some programming. I can code/script in Matlab, python (both 2.7 and 3.x), some C, and will be learning Java on my own after I finish my current project in python. 

**My goal:**  Find a job as an engineer or programmer, preferably somewhere in the northeastern states of the US. 

**What I've done so far:** I did my best to earn top grades, sometimes ranking in the top five of a class. I was unfortunate every summer when searching for internships, however. Post master's graduation, I had to postpone job searching briefly for about 3 months due to a legal name change that would have been annoying to deal with while job searching (also just to get a break). After that was over, I applied to every job in engineering that I could imagine doing based on the job description and volunteered for a few months at an animal shelter. Also doing some personal coding projects on the side.

**What I think my weakness is:** I do not have a lot of work experience. Only did a summer job for about 2 months one summer as an undergraduate. Other summers, I spent learning various things.

What's the best thing for me to do to better achieve my goal?"

1. I got accepted into series of other colleges like UCSD, CMU, UCD, Boston, and etc.. Among them, I only got into UCD biomedical engineerng and Boston College CompSci. I know that they don't have the best programs in both biomed and CompSci but would it be wiser for me to go to a college that I was directly admitted into?
2. I earned some AP credits in high school and would like to get into the CompSci department ASAP. I found out because I got 4 on AP Chem and 5 on AP Calc AB, I can skip Chemistry 142, 143 along with some math courses. With my backup majors, would it be wise for me to take Physics?(technically, I'm exempt from taking Chemistry 142 and Math 124, 125 right?) Will taking the summer school help me?
3. I got 3 on my APUSH exam(lame). Assuming that I major in engineering, do I still have to retake US history? 
4. What are general requirements to graduate in UDub?
5. My international student friend is hesitant on committing to UDub because he believes that UDub CompSci admission is based on a citizenship status. Does your citizenship status really matter, or is it all based on grades and stuff?
6. Same goes for internship. Will your citizenship status really affect your admissions decision and internship opportunities?
Huge thanks to those who can answer these questions!"

She invited me there for an off hours interview Saturday morning and I went in not knowing what to expect, very nervous. But the interview went great and we really hit it off. A few hours later she called me with a job offer which I took. During the interview she said that she purposefully wanted to find a student using the school's job portal because she knows how hard it is for recent college graduates to find a job and wanted to give somebody a chance who was fresh out of college.

I've been out of college for about 8 months and since then I've been working an entry level position in project management for 20k a year. In a week I will begin a job as a title examiner making 30k a year with annual raises.

I'm still trying to process this, the opportunity that fell right into my lap just because I was in the right place at the right time. This is similar to the internship I got last summer. I got it because I was THE ONLY PERSON to apply for it, and I was one of the few people who made use of the resources that my school offers its students to find a job.

It's weird. I feel like I somehow entered a cheat code because it shouldn't be this easy to get a job. When I was looking for one I'd apply at dozens of places and not hear back from them or end up with piles of rejection letters after interviews. Then somebody randomly reaches out to me and a few days later I have a job!

I dunno. It just feels surreal. Anyone else here find a job through pure luck?"

I was contacted by a recruiter about this position that would be building a tool to automate config changes in prod. To be honest, it sounds pretty boring, but I do not have an internship lined up right now. I have been applying like crazy since last week.

Do you think I can stick it out and hope another company comes along or should I cut my losses and pursue this? I tried talking to my roommates, but it is hard talking to non CS majors about this.

I just need some kind of discussion or reassurance or something! It's been stressing me out because I have already had 2 past internships, but big ol' dumbass me took a different way of applying this year.

There is this program in my country that is Government funded where you pay half of the money for Boot camp and Cert Exams and if you successfully finish you get the Half you paid back, this is how I got my MCSA.

Now there is another similar program that is happening where i would get the Boot Camp+Cert Exam for an MCSA 2016 and an MCSE 2016 in addition to ""soft skill training"" and a Paid internship with one of the test center's Partners. BUT I need to Pass the CERT EXAMS with a MAXIMUM time limit of 2 WEEKS from the last day of Boot camp(of course If i fail I do not get my money back). I have already been interviewed and they really liked me so I can start as soon as I want.

I have been told by some people already working as SysAdmins and Network admins in companies that it would be best to stop at an MCSA and then maybe do an MCSE after getting into the industry since I could get over qualification issues.

So I wanted to hear what the REAL Professionals in here think about this, should I start the Program, should I look for internships instead or for actual full time Jobs."

I am currently a third year MechE student (with zero experience/projects prior two these two offers) that is looking at a graduation of Summer 2018 or Fall 2018 if I decide against taking summer classes. I'll give you guys a brief description of each of the following companies

&amp;nbsp;


Company A: midsize medical devices/prosthetics manufacture 

1) This company is offering a three term co-op (1 summer/2 long semesters). 

2) I would be working this summer 2017, Spring 2018 and Fall 2018 meaning I could go to my schools expo during this fall and look for an internship for summer 2018 adding even experience to my resume before I graduate. 

3) Company A is a lot smaller than Company B in terms of global recognition 

4) The co-op is still in the same city as my university so I will still be able to stay in contact with all of my friends 

5) I believe the work I would be doing is going into a specific department such as legs, hips or arms and developing prosthetics for that area. 

&amp;nbsp;


Company B: Fortune 500 Semiconductor Manufacturer 

1) This company is offering a summer internship. 

2) Would theoretically graduate in Summer 2018 and start looking for a full time job.

3) Although company B is a much more well known company I have heard horror stories of working experiences at this company for interns and full time employees

4) Summer internship is also in the same city as my university although this won't really matter much as it would for a coop

5) The work I would be doing at company B is still slightly vague since all I know is that I would be in the innovation department.

&amp;nbsp;


I am not exactly sure what career path I would like to take after college but a big part of me is leaning towards going to O&amp;G because it would allow me the best chance to be back home in Houston and I have overall enjoyed Thermo and Fluids. Another factor that might be important to consider is that although the co-op is 3 terms meaning I would graduate a whole year late this does not bother me. Right now I am still in a bind of which company I would go with so if you guys could tell me your opinion I would really appreciate it!

I completed a degree in Applied Computing and earned first class classification (I'm in the UK) last summer. I started working in September for a large multinational company on a two year internship scheme. I get to spend time in different placements, but unfortunately they don't do any of their own Sysadmin, it's all done by an external supplier. I'm happy enough writing software or working in other 'IT' fields, but being a Sysadmin is something I think I would genuinely enjoy. I'm basically asking of you guys could suggest what I might be able to do to make myself more experienced so that if I do decide to try and find some kind of Sysadmin work after this scheme, I'll be more likely to be successful.

I have some very basic networking knowledge, I can setup a website from a raw vpn, etc, but have no other real experience, bar the drive to learn. Are there good online resources for self teaching some basic Sysadmin skills? 

At the end of the day I may end up staying with this company once I finish the scheme, but i'm just thinking about options.

66gjvs,2189,2017-04-20,"Besides the programming language, learn the essential tools",dkarlovi,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/66gjvs/besides_the_programming_language_learn_the/,"Hi r/learnprogramming,

I'm a lurker, reading how beginners tackle learning how to program is my interest as I'm head of development in a web agency so interested in that sort of thing. We have our first ever interns so here's my take away message from the experience: **learn the tools too**.

Here's what I mean (this is my opinion from 10+ years of professional development experience, working with junior devs etc):  

1. **Learn git.**  
When you're working on code with people, you're not going to be sending it to them via e-mail (hopefully) or FTP, you'll be collaborating on it using some sort of a so-called version control system. Git is very likely to be the weapon of choice for wherever you end up (or, if it isn't, the concepts are similar enough it doesn't matter). You must know how to: clone a project, make a branch, diff, commit &amp; push changes, pull other people's changes.  
How? There's  [an excellent free book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) on the subject. Find a project you're interested on on Github and try to get a change merged (pick a larger project which has an established procedure for that). If you mess stuff up, [you can undo almost anything](http://ohshitgit.com/), learn how to mess up safely, think of that as the first thing you learn how to do when staring sky-diving or martial arts - falling safely.  

2. **Learn an IDE.**  
Ever wonder how professional developers are able to handle huge projects with thousands of files in them? How do they know where everything is? Well, they don't, their IDE tells them. IDEs are able to scan and understand your code, you can browse through it just like a website. You can open files by: file name, class name, function/method/constant name. You can do all your git stuff (see 1). You can generate parts of code, even whole classes, with nested folder structure and metadata, all of it correctly named / spelled and complete. All of this can be done by shortcuts so you're even faster.  
For example, I have a function called `getName()`, how do I know where is it used? I just Ctrl-Click (in my IDE) on it and it shows me a dropdown of all usages. I can search text for that, but it's so common that I'll have 200 false positive matches. I can rename the method (refactor), changing its name and all the calls to it from a single place. That's productivity.  
Don't use Notepad, use the strongest IDE your language has to offer, even just for the trial period, just to see what it's like.  

3. **Learn how to command-line**  
Terminal is scary once you're starting, but you should try and get over the initial reaction.  
Why? Almost all tools you'll be using will be command-line. Some of them will have a GUI companion, but that'll be an exception, not the rule. If you learn how to work with a (good) shell efficiently, that's the same productivity boost you get from your IDE. Command-line tools can be automated with ease, not so much GUI tools (they can, but it's a kludge). How do I work with this thing? How do I specify arguments efficiently? What does TAB do, how do people type so fast? How do I traverse the filesystem in a shell? What are environment variables? Etc.  
If using Mac/Linux, try to do as much stuff through the command-line as possible (git too, even if you follow 2). If using Windows, don't use command.com, use PowerShell instead or [install the Ubuntu bash layer](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) and play with that. You should feel so comfortable with the terminal you open it up as soon as logging in to do some programming, it's second nature.  

4. as said by u/tamalo: **Learn how to debug.**  
&gt; And learn how to do it in two ways: Learn how to use a debugger. Your IDE that you picked up in bullet 2 above probably has one built in. If not, get a standalone one. Then learn to use it. Learn to set break points, to single step thru your code, learn how to inspect variables.  
&gt; But even if you have a debugger, learn how to debug without one. Use print or log statements to dump the state of your program. Debugging this way forces you to think more about what you are looking for in your code. It's a powerful skill. Many problems that get posted in this sub would become obvious if the poster added a few well placed print statements.  

As I said, this is all my opinion watching people learning stuff in this field and these are the most important ones, in that order. Hope it helps someone.

**Edit:**  
thanks for all the comments and replies in which you (dis)agree with some or all points made. As stated, this is my opinion based on my experience working with junior devs (now also interns), onboarding them on new or legacy projects and technology, etc.

The reason why I did not chose (say) ""write tests"", ""learn to design systems"", ""learn frameworks"" etc. is to limit the number of things to a manageable number. Also, this list is a supplement, not as a primary source, you don't need Git or IDE if you're not programming.

Whatever someone says, tools are important, even basic tools. You might be a master winemaker, you still need glasses for people to taste your wine from, I'm not going to drink it out of a puddle under the barrel in your basement no matter how good the bouquet is.

I'll explain my choices further:  

- **""git"":**  
you NEED to be get to other people's code. If you get to work somewhere, you won't get to start a brand new project (except for exercise) or will people come over and use the code on your computer: it's meant to get somewhere else, be it a test server, production server, etc. You need to be able to move the code around, ""git"" is the way to do it. Why not SVN or Mercurial? Because Github, but also because it's really likely you'll be able to use SVN if you know Git, not the other way around. Why Git first? If you can't Git, you can't get to the source code of a project you'll be assigned to work on, you only have a empty folder on your workstation. Can't work on stuff you can't get to.  


- **""IDE"":**  
this got some... interesting reactions. :) Why an IDE? When you're programming in X, an IDE to program in X is a tool specifically tailored to help program in X, that's the whole idea. You can go the ""poweruser editor + plugins"" route but, guess what, now you need to find all those plugins, learn how to set them up to work together, figure out incompatibilities, etc. You've started to do A, but you need to do B first, so you get lost in B. Once that's out the way, you STILL need to learn how to do stuff with it, so you haven't really removed that step. You end up with pretty much an IDE, only composed and setup not by a person doing it 8h a day, 5 days a week, an expert in the field of supporting people to program in X, but **you**, a person literally learning how programming in X even works. Would you take advice from yourself, a doctor Googling your symptoms right in front of you and checking out WebMD? Neither would I. Just use an IDE, stop using it once you know why you're doing it, not because ""it's stupid"".  

- **""CLI"":**  
 it's true, you don't need CLI as much on Windows. Also, people see CLI and IDE as mutually exclusive. I disagree: while you want an IDE as a tool specifically designed to do a task (you have at hand), being a CLI user enables you to not do **just** the task at hand. Being a developer means you'll use a lot of cross-cutting technologies, some of them were mentioned in comments. You cannot allow yourself to be ""trapped in your IDE"": if you don't have a button for it, that means you don't know how to do it. That stance is unacceptable from a developer. Also, not being CLI-handy means you're missing out on a LOT of tools available to you for tasks you might need to do. Need to do a complex search&amp;replace on a 20GB text file? It's [one easy `sed` command](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sed-102-replace-in-place), good luck doing it in your regular editor, you'd need to program it yourself and, guess what, probably run from the command line. Once you figure out you can combine multiple commands together in a chain or that you can do logical evaluation (conditional command execution with dependencies), you'll be blown away by it. "
66gpik,1,2017-04-20,How important is the title?,Snozed,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/66gpik/how_important_is_the_title/,"Hey guys!

Quick background: I'm about to graduate from a university in Northern Europe with a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering, specialized in Network Management and Security. I'm half american and have citizenship and would like to move there for work.

Last summer I was able to obtain an internship in the US at a construction company through a family friend. My title was ""IT Intern"", and I did a lot of different stuff but mostly spent my time with their helpdesk solving what problems I could. They gave me a job offer at the end of the summer for when I graduate, which I've been considering whether or not to take.

While emailing them I mentioned I was hoping to be able to put to use the knowledge I've learned in school. I also mentioned that I got my CCNA a couple months ago. This is because I was hoping they would offer a better position than just helpdesk. I got a response yesterday saying they are in need of a ""Field Technician"".  This would be someone who spends a good chunk of their time out at jobsites setting up and managing jobsite networks, attending to on-site helpdesk tickets and demobilizing jobsites when the job ends. 

They also have an Active Directory implementation underway and are in the process of upgrading some software/hardware and mentioned the Field Technician could be involved in these projects depending on their skill level and enthusiasm to learn.

The ""Field Technician"" position is not something I have heard about before and to be honest I was hoping to land a Junior Network or System Administrator job. I'd like to eventually transition into becoming a Network Engineer or perhaps get into Network Security. However taking this job would make things a lot easier for me as I'm moving half way across the world, and I don't really have the money to move and start job hunting for weeks/months.

Anyone have any advice to offer? Do you think this would be a good learning opportunity regardless of the title? Will it be difficult to transition into other better IT jobs later with a title like this? Any and all advice is appreciated, thanks a lot for reading this far! "

I decided to go with EE even though I was more than half way in my CS career but my gpa did take a hit and so I just graduated in EE. I really should of just stayed in my CS program and continue to finish it but that's too late now as re-entry at my university seems impossible for a second major after post graduation.

I'm currently in the industry for rf hardware due to my ee background. Not really liking it so much so I'm trying to switch to software. What should I be doing to prepare for software interviews? How can I bulk up my resume to become a viable contender? My only experience for software is an internship that dealt with Java unit testing and some undergrad research dealing with python in the past. I program on the side for fun but nothing truly competitive like a full blown app. Languages I focus in are C and Java, some php and sql for db management. 

Am I on the right track? Or is it just a matter of aggressively applying? Would I have more luck with larger or smaller companies?

Just need some advice for choosing my major at OSU. I've researched these careers (obviously) but can't settle on what I want to do. I was initially pursuing Electrical and Computer Engineering because I thoroughly enjoy building computers and gaming on them whenever I get the chance - I just don't enjoy programming and the curriculum as much as I thought I would. I'm also a hands on person and my 'dream' job was a computer hardware engineer but I now realize this was something I told everyone when the inevitable questions came about what I wanted to ""major"" in. Furthermore, at this point in my life, I would rather have a lucrative job than completely love my job - adaptation is part of the engineering job description after all. I've learned that Welding Engineering typically has a good starting salary and generally provides good income but I'm not sure about how much this would limit me in my career options contrasted to Materials Science and Engineering. Because I was in the ECE/CSE undergraduate program, I have an internship for this summer programming at a local, international company which I think will be fun despite the copious amounts of programming. Any input would be welcome whether it be about your lifestyle, why you chose the major, etc. because I don't really know how to describe myself other than the fact that new, interesting activities seem to hold my attention longer which I why, I think, I don't want to graduate with a CSE or ECE degree. I just want to graduate knowing that my chosen major will fit what I want out of life or at least keep me interested. Thank you for your time."

I went to school for Networking (2 year degree) and am in the process of finishing my last few remaining classes. At the moment I have no certifications due to not having much time to invest in studying.  
  
I am looking for a change as there are a lot of reasons regarding way below average pay for my workload, internal company disagreements, and that I just found out I am not eligible for a promotion for at least a year due to my companies slow development in their internal certification/qualification system for advancement.  
  
I have A LOT of experience in a lot of different things such as network troubleshooting, Microsoft server, windows, exchange, etc etc. Due to some of the items mentioned above, I really want to spread my wings and fly off to a different company that does not make my life so miserable. Ive never really done this before for IT because I was hired on by my current company after performing well during my Internship.  
  
Would it be more beneficial to swallow the next 8 or so months, finish my degree during the summer/winter term, and search for a new job during the new year? I have been denied a annual review due to a recent pay raise that was agreed upon over a year ago (makes no sense, but w.e). So I am kind of stuck where I am, no opportunities for advancement or wage negotiation. I was thinking that if I start searching now, it may be a hardsell since I am not done with school, nor do I have any certs. I also plan on moving out of my folks place this summer, so job displacement seems a little scary with those life changes ahead of me.  
  
Experienced IT folks wisdom would be appreciated. Its a big world out there and I have a lot of time left, but I dont want to be trapped as I see happening to some of my co-workers.  
  
Also how should I approach the type of jobs? After two years I do not like the style of managed service, at least my company's. Is internal IT for a school or hospital/etc a good gig?

It specifically says they will be assumed to have been produced during the term of employment and only for things relevant to the companies business or products, but I'm worried about the possibility of it causing problems with any CS job in the future. Not asking for legal advice, but I do think that would be an over broad interpretation, it just still worries me a bit.

How common are these types of clauses? Should I say something?"

1. I am out of state and a financial aid employee said that I may be able to establish residency after one year. However, everything I read on the website seems to say that this would be impossible since I live in South Dakota right now. Is it possible at all to get in-state tuition or is it nearly locked?

2. Co-ops generally begin sophomore year, but what are the chances of locking an internship the summer after freshmen year? I know NASA will hire interns with little experience, and also Facebook University, but these positions are probably highly competitive.

3. I got a $7,600 grant and was told that there is no guarantee that I will get another grant. This isn't promising but I also didn't expect any grants at all..

So overall is it even possible to afford Georgia Tech with out of state tuition and mostly loan debt that could easily total $150,000... I also am accepted into Embry-Riddle in Prescott, AZ and UAH with a full tuition scholarship. Is it even worth it to get a degree at GaTech for so much more money than any other school?"
66kbs5,4,2017-04-20,"Planning to ""depart with grace"" after newly hired and need advice.",nibwaakaawin,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/66kbs5/planning_to_depart_with_grace_after_newly_hired/,"I definitely didn't plan to be in this situation: I recently (~1 mo.) got hired at a very fulfilling, reasonably high-paying job, but it was my second-best choice between two organizations. Now I am looking to transition over to my preferred organization after a direct invitation to fill a critical and meanigful role. 

Here are some things to know about the two organizations: 
*Organization A* (top choice) is in a small town where I have family. I did an internship there last summer, and enjoyed both the professional realm and time with family and connected with everyone in a good way. This area is my community. 
*Organization B* (current employer, 2nd choice) is also in a small town, but in a place where I had never been to before and it has pretty much no one that I really know. After one month here, I could see a future (5-10 years at least) due completely to such a good job, but carving out brand new relationships while in my 30's will be the hardest part. 

How this hiring process went: 
Organization A  interviewed me, and then took a very long time in the decision process. During those weeks organization B also interviewed me and offered me the position. Before accepting, I contacted organization A indicating that they would be my preferred choice and that I would need a decision within a few days to let organization B know if I would accept. Within that time, they got a hold of me saying that they were offering the position to another person. That was no problem for me, as at least I knew.The next day, I signed the contract with organization B and sent it along. 

A few days later, I heard back from organization A, and they said that the other person turned the job down, and I was the only other person in the hiring pool with appropriate qualifications, etc. As happy as I was about the offer, I mentioned that I had signed a contract already, and I could not simply back out. They understood, and wished me the best. 

Fast forward to a couple of days ago, I got a message from organization A asking if I would like to switch over in order to fill the same position, which fills a critical role for them. (Since it is in a small town and requires a MA degree, there usually aren't a lot of applicants.) I once again indicated that they would be the best place to wind up working--but that I would need to be considerate of my current employer, as a lot of responsibilities are currently on my plate. The time of year is also important for my current job, but in June I think that it will be better to leave. 

My pro's for switching are as follows: 
--I would be closer to family
--I would be in ""my"" community
--I would re-connect with professionals in the organization that I already have strong rapport with due to a positive internship
--I could finally buy a house (currently renting) with the peace of mind that I will no longer be on the move
--In June, timing will be good as the job season busy-ness will be settling down in the summer
--I will have impacted this job in some good ways by the time I leave, indicating a strong return on investment for them, even for a short time
--Probably more that are not coming to mind

Cons: 
--I will be departing a critical role in this organization, and I know it will be just as hard for them to fill it. 
--I will have worked in this role only for a couple of months
--Since organizations are in the same field, I may bump into them at regional/national events that involve both organizations

Ideas for how to resign with grace after such a short period: 
Basically wording the pro's list above and emphasizing that 1) this was not something planned out from the time I was hired (I honestly saw myself being here for several years) and 2) the other organization *invited* me to go, not the other way around. 

Do you all see anything that could help this situation--any general advice? Am I assuming too much, or does this sound like it would be a ""graceful"" exit--insofar as that's possible? Thanks in advance for your thoughts! 

TL;DR: 
Preferred organization declined my hire for another candidate who later dropped out, so I hired on at a second-choice organization. A few days ago, the preferred org. offered to hire me anyways, and I said yes, but need to be respectful of current organization time-wise. Now I'm looking to depart this summer with dignity and respect for myself and current/future employer. "

Looking for advice with this situation I’ve found myself in. Early March I received an offer for a summer internship, decided to take it over other offers. Sent in my signed paperwork, received a confirmation email from the recruiter which said I should expect a separate email with on-boarding procedures. Waited a week for it, then sent an email, no reply. Waited 2 more weeks, sent another email, no reply. Called the HR rep and left a message, no reply. 

So here I am, on my offer letter it said my start date was a few weeks into May, but I had asked my hiring manager if I could start at the beginning of May and he said that was fine. 

What do I do at this point? It’s kind of causing me some stress, which I could do without since I’m going into finals week. 

Although it’s a 2 hour drive where I’m interning compared to where my college is, I’m thinking of just showing up in a suit tomorrow at their office to ask for an update. What do you think of this idea, or do you have any others. 

Thanks."

I've seen a multitude of questions here about ""STEM-related extracurriculars."" I'm planning on going into either economics or computer engineering / science, and the problem is that I don't really have any field-related ECs. I primarily do a lot of music and political stuff (jazz band, mock trial, student senate, etc) mostly because my school doesn't have a whole lot of math / science options when it comes to clubs and whatnot, and I don't live in an area where internships and whatnot are prevalent. The closest I've gotten to a STEM-related EC is working at my school's IT department every summer repairing / setting up computers. And I certainly have a bunch of solid leadership positions, so that's not an issue.

Also, people have been talking about awards. I don't have much aside from being an Eagle Scout and getting a couple of school awards (best history student, etc), probably a national merit semi finalist at least, maybe a few other minor awards  I can't think of.

Basically, I feel like I have strong extracurriculars with a number of sizable achievements (i.e. bringing our mock trial team back from the dead) but with few awards or career-related positions. I'd like to get you guys' opinions on this / how they size up for college. Thanks!"

I graduated in May 2016 with a masters in electrical engineering with 3.64. Technically, I started the job search even before then but had no luck getting an internship as a physics undergrad nor as an engineering master's student. I took about three months after graduation to naturalize/name change. I started applying for jobs after that and did some local volunteering work meanwhile. It's been like 8 months since I started job searching and I am having no luck landing a job offer. Primarily, I used the school's job search website and indeed.com. I've lost track of the number of phone interviews I've had, but I've only gotten 2 interviews in 2017, none back in 2016. I know I'm doing something wrong, I'm also extremely introverted (INTJ personality with a really strong I). 

Could someone please give me some suggestions to get me moving in the right direction? I am trying to find a full time position for either some kind of engineering work or coding work in the NE area of the USA. I took a handful of classes in control systems engineering and I have intermediate coding skills/scripting skills in MATLAB and python. I am also highly capable of self-learning skillsets/knowledge that I do not currently have. Currently, aside from job searching, I am also working on a coding project to create a simple calculator/time investment optimizer for gaming.

Things I am considering doing to help with my job search but do not actually know if they will help:
* trying to find a parttime job meanwhile
* doing coding projects and probably putting them on github to see if I can build something up from there
* submitted my resume to a headhunter agency in my city of residence

Thins I am concerned about:
* if or not I will remain employable for engineering if I do not find a position soon
* if or not it is possible for me to transition into software engineering without going back to school, and if yes, how can I succeed spending the least amount of cash"

I started a new job almost two months ago for around $53k as a sales engineer. My company sells a modular system for an industry and as such, we get customers asking for CAD assemblies incorporating our modular parts with their designs. I do this and handle some of the communication with the customer and go to trade shows to show off our products. This was the original job description and part of what I have done. However, I've also started doing some design work for new components, and I was just given a couple projects regarding FEA simulations. I'm also in charge of budgeting, assembling and implementing upgrades for all the office PCs (which is fine because PCs are a hobby of mine). I'm mostly just trying to make the point that my actual jobs are different from what was described to me and I know it's mostly them just taking advantage of having an extra pair of hands. A lot of these side projects are pretty low priority and not of much importance, but I am demonstrating my ability to be versatile and learn quickly. I'm pretty happy here because I'm given a lot of autonomy and the job is pretty low stress. 

Yet today I received a text from an old buddy who works at the company I used to intern at in Minneapolis. This company offered me a job fresh out of college for $60k in their facility in rural Virginia. I was flown out there for the interview and was offered the job but after seeing the place for myself, decided it wasn't for me and politely declined. I told them that if they ever had an opening in MN, to let me know. Today was that day. They told me the have an opening right now that I can have but there's no offer letter because I'd still have to go through the process for the sake of HR. They're more than likely going to offer me at least the $60k if not more this time around and I'm tempted. I got along well with these people and loved my job there. But now my girlfriend of 5 years also got a job in LA and I don't want to leave her. So while possible if she's up for it, it's unlikely. and I really do like my current job just like I did that one. I just feel that $53k is so unfair for Los Angeles. 

My question is, after 2 months at my new job, is there any way to politely request a raise. I didn't look for this new offer, it showed up on my lap and it makes me feel undervalued currently since I'm getting paid much less than I should. I only accepted the lowball because I was job searching for 9 months and getting desperate. But I do really like this new job and if they could bump me from $53k to $60k, I'd be more than happy for now. I want to bring this new offer into the fold but I don't want to sound arrogant or like I'm threatening to leave. I just want to reintroduce the conversation of what I'm worth while there is another company who put a price tag on it and they've had at least a short while to judge how I work. What do you guys think. Any advice?"

Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6688x6/vera_and_the_children_part_1/


Three days after I first saw Vera as her carer, I met with my mum and brother Jack to ostensibly catch up, talk about the new job, my share house, and discuss my brother’s wedding plans. I didn’t realize how much that conversation would come to focus on Vera. 

As soon as we sat down my mum got all of the logistical questions about my life out of the way before asking me about our old house, wanting to know what had happened to our neighbourhood, and what had happened to Vera. 
As often happens, it isn’t until you start telling someone else about something that your thoughts are drawn together and fears and paranoia exposed, and as I began to explain about the basement door and the shoes and my brother quickly decided I was insane. 

“dude, get over the ‘little red shoes’ thing omg. Seriously as if she would’ve even known or noticed a pair of shoes gone from like, a mountain of charity clothes – you yourself said that she was going on about shoes in the war or something, obviously not referring to a pair of shoes you stole as a fricken kid.”

“Jack – I swear” I could hear myself sounding ridiculous before I’d even had a chance to explain “She looked at me with this look of – remembering. YOU haven’t worked with people with dementia before -“

“neither have you let’s be honest” he cut me off. 

“What are you saying Rach? That she doesn’t have dementia?” My mum chimed in. 

“Look – the file obviously says she does, but I feel like she can switch this blankness on and off, like, she chooses when to act like she can’t remember stuff.” I could feel myself getting flustered. I was always bad at debating, bad at expressing myself clearly when challenged.

“Why? So she can be spoken down to and have to pay for a carer? Why would anyone pretend to have an illness like dementia for god’s sake? Listen – your auntie has a pHD in studying patients like Vera and she is the one who treated her and confirmed the diagnosis” My mum’s voice was raised. I knew she was worried I was going to throw this job away by doing something stupid. I felt heat rising in my chest. I was so sick of this, of them ganging up on me whenever I had one of my left-of-field theories or hunches about something. 

“I guess you’re right.” I sighed, admitting defeat, it was easier to nip an argument in the bud with these two, we’d always been a close family unit, and my brother being a patronizing ass stemmed from concern and having to fill the role of dad when we were growing up. “Why would she have noticed the shoes in all of that stuff. Actually,” I said, realizing suddenly “she still has some weird children’s stuff. That’s creepy right.” When I had scanned the house on my visit I’d noticed little things, a teddy-bear, a neatly folded children’s jumper, some dolls through the slightly-ajar bedroom door. 

“Old people love that shit,” my brother said draining his now cold coffee. 

“Rachel, you’re being silly, and I don’t want to have to pay your rent again any time soon, I’m pretty strapped myself. Can you just let this job be a good thing?” My mum’s lips were pursed and I knew to drop it then and there. 

That night my housemates threw a party, but I wasn’t feeling it. I took a can of beer into my room and sat cross legged on my bed, laptop at the ready, and decided to apply for some internships. 

I opened messenger only to see my brother had sent me a bunch of memes about the ruby slippers in the wizard of oz. “screw you!” I typed back, laughing. 

I google-imaged some hideous shoes and sent a pic to him – “looks like you stole these back in the day and have been wearing them ever since”

The next thing he sent made my blood run cold. It was a screenshot of a newspaper headline “shoes the key to unsolved case?” He had sent it because of a stock photo of some red child’s shoes that was attached to the article. “Fuel to your fire” he sent, with a laughing emoji. 

I opened a new tab and searched the headline, my stomach sinking with every sentence I read. “JACK!!!!” I typed furiously, “DID YOU READ THAT ARTICLE??”
He hadn’t seen my message five minutes later, so I called him.

“What do you wannnnnt” he sighed into the phone, “please no more of your insano minor detective work Rachel I’m watching Netflix with Suze.” 

“Jack” my voice was audibly shaking. “That screenshot – of the article about the shoes.” I paced myself, wanting to make sense the first time.  “It said that a girl went missing, in 2002. In Mid 2003 some kids found a pair of red shoes trapped in a reed bank in WILLMER’S CREEK. Those shoes belonged to the missing girl, but no further evidence was found. They trawled the creek.”

 I paused. “Jack I threw those shoe’s into that creek. In mid 2003. After stealing them. FROM VERA. We would’ve moved a few months before they were found so it never got to us via news or local media or whatever.”

“Shit.” For once Jack sounded genuinely a bit shaken. “So someone put them in the charity drive. Fuck that’s heavy.” 

I stopped. For some reason this hadn’t crossed my mind. I had assumed that the clothes in Vera’s basement were from Vera or people she knew. I hadn’t thought about them being stored clothes from donation bins. 

“Please do not tell me –“ Jack began, voiced raised, reading into my silence, “That you’re gunna tell me Vera is related to that missing kid”
I began to explain myself but he cut me off. 

“Rachel – mum is worried about you. You live in this share-house barely making ends meet and she always has to foot the bill when you can’t. This job is what you NEED. I am insisting you don’t fuck it up. You said you had a party tonight? Go and fucking join it and don’t call me if you’re gunna spout this garbage ok? Goodnight Rach. Sorry to be harsh but this is what you need to hear.”

My eyes stung with tears as I put the phone down. I didn’t know why I was so damn emotional. I guess I hated the fact Jack thought I was an idiot, who abused my mum’s willingness to help me out financially. I was also reeling from the article I’d read, the idea that I had been connected, as an eight-year-old, to some other eight-year-old girl who had gone missing and never been found, and probably had something terrible happen to her. 

The next day was a rainy Sunday and I spent it cleaning my room, applying for more internships and distracting myself. That night I tossed and turned, knowing I would be spending the day at Vera’s, trying to push down paranoid thoughts. 

I dreamt I was in a room. I’d never been there before, but I knew in the way that you just know things in dreams, that it was a room in Vera’s house. 

The walls were carpet, like the basement, but this room had a high window and a bed. With a start I realized that I was surrounded by shelves and shelves of old toys, broken toys, doll’s missing eyes, a rocking horse with a crudely painted face that was unevenly weighted and slowly rocked itself back and forth. I realized there was no door, and I knew my mum would be home from work, wondering where I was. 

I screamed but no sound came out. I dragged the rocking horse to the area below the window and strained my neck trying to see out of it, but I was too short.  I opened my mouth to scream again and this time I heard “help” in the voice of a little girl. I hadn’t spoken. I stepped down from the rocking horse and heard it again, ‘HELP!”

It was coming from under the floorboards.

I woke with a start, back in my bedroom to the sound of my alarm. I put on my shoes slowly and took a deep breath as I headed out to see Vera for the second time, stomach full of dread, head full of nightmares.

Wants continued support.",myownthrowaway000,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/66n4z2/nv_wife_kicked_me_out_in_september_broke_up_with/,"We started going out in May of 2009. About a year later I was diagnosed with cancer and she took care of my for a year or so, after that I started back into college and we were both not working, supporting bills with student loans.  I got a decent job late 2013 and had one since, paying for pretty much all bills until mid 2015.  During that time she did help, with her student loan money.  Mid 2015, she got a more steady couple of jobs that she still has.

Anyway, we split in September, right after I got out of the hospital for a month.  Kind of a long story for that, can explain if it'd help but basically she didn't think I was supporting her mentally. We are technically still married.  I made some very poor decisions to try and help keep her in the home we had (bought it while we were together, but I think its only her name on the loan) and help her in general because I didn't want to see her out on the street.  By doing this, though, I neglected the loans and credit cards that I had, plus I was already out a months worth of pay.  I've been doing that since but I'm trying to stop, especially since I took a new job that has a significant pay cut, and will for a few months (had to step down to an intern level for a better job later).

She is demanding support every month.  She does have medical issues of her own that she says are stopping her from working as much as she wants to, so she can't support herself.  I myself have been hospitalized twice since we broke up for a week each.

She is threatening me with going to court for alimony. She says (I'm a little skeptical) that her wealthy grandfather will pay all of her legal fees.  I don't have anyone like that to help me.  I fear going to court will ruin me financially either legal fees/lawyer costs, or alimony that I just can't afford.

I haven't been able to find a lawyer around me that will do a free consult, not sure what I'm doing wrong there.  I'm hoping someone can help me out here with some suggestions, maybe I'm really overestimating the cost or something.  I'd also like to get an idea of what, if any alimony I'd be paying... I'm concerned I set a precedent by paying her so far.  But I just can't afford it, and if I look back on it, I couldn't afford it before either.

Luckily, no kids involved!

Married in 2012, so a little over 4 years before she left me, if that helps.  Right now shes on my Verizon plan, technically on one of my car insurance policies I think, and driving a car I own.  I'm not sure right now if her name is on it at all.  There is also a loan in my name that we used to renovate our house last year, plus some shared credit cards.  Please let me know any other info you need.  Sorry if this is a little all over the place, I'm not sure what would help.

EDIT: One more question - she says that since Nevada is a ""community property"" state, she is entitled to half of my income and to know how much that income is.  I'd rather not tell her what my new income is unless I have to, plus this new claim that she owns half my income seems pretty bullshit.  Can anyone confirm?"

Pros: 

- Robust tutoring program where you can get very good help with your CS classes. If you become a tutor, then you get lots of cool opportunities, like internships, etc. 

- Not as academically time consuming; more time to do side projects, develop practical skills, do research, and prepare for internships. This is very important for me. 

- Very collaborative. I didn't really get this vibe at UCLA, I feel like it is more competitive and no strong tutoring system. 

- Strong research program (Regents Scholarship) which will help to get into top Grad Schools (one of my after college goals) 

- Will stand out more

Cons: 

- The brand may not be as strong as UCLA

- Campus is not the greatest in some places

UCLA

Pros: 

- The brand. I like the UCLA hats. 

- The food

- The campus

- Los Angeles 

- The vibe


Cons: 

- Very theoretical CS curriculum
 
- Very time consuming academics. 

- Negatives according to this Quora link: https://www.quora.com/How-good-is-UCLAs-computer-science-program/answer/Daniel-Duan-1?srid=zEch

- Bad to get into grad school because of GPA deflation, won't get as many research opportunities as UCSD

Why should I come to UCLA? How does it compare to all the positives of UCSD (ie, is there a strong tutoring system, etc.) I also got into Berkeley but will not be considering it because of the time consuming academics and stressful environment. "

What should I do now? 

I'm feeling kinda lost. 

Should I attend community collage and try to get perfect grades and transfer to Cal? 

That would be almost ideal, if I could pull it off, I think. 

Should I go for a guaranteed transfer to another UC? 

Seems like the reasonable option. 

Should I return to UCR? 

If my parents would allow it, I could get an off campus apartment and take UCR classes via the extension center. 

It would be good because I've already friends and obligations there and it would be good not to abandon that. 

It would also be good because I really would rather not live at home. 

On the other hand, I never really liked UCR. 

Should I attend some other university? 

I have no idea. 

Should I take a summer internship or seminar or something in the liberty movement? 

It would be fun, and a nice change. 

Perhaps that's what I need, change. 

Still, it isn't something I really want to pursue, and I have other reservations. 

Should I put off doing anything and instead focus on addressing my mental health issues? 

Mental health is important, and I can't do much else without it, but treatment doesn't seem promising.

66nzd6,18,2017-04-21,Come and See!,TheBrewtonStandard,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/66nzd6/come_and_see/,"Chapter 1: **Grief**  

It was three days after the initial missing persons report filed on March 26th that Annmarie Seger and her two daughters, Janice and Taylor, were found deep in the woods of Superior National Forest. Through the following days questions would arise but one thing was abundantly clear, the Seger women had been murdered.  

The first body found was Annmarie’s, reported by two men hunting off season. She lay near Mulkuk Bay, across the shore from the Fall Lake Campground where she had been renting a cabin. Partially buried, she appeared at first like a tree stump rising out from under the earth. The hunters phoned the Park Rangers when they discovered it was a woman. A bag was over her head, her hands and feet bound with rip cord. Fishing line was tied around her neck, but no apparent abrasion near her throat was visible. She was naked from the waist down.  

Janice was found up north by Mile Island, floating by the beach. The Pastor of The Sacred Heart Chapel said he had seen something out near the surf when he went to go and investigate.   

“I thought it’d been a wooden dock leg come loose, maybe. I didn’t take note at first but it just stayed out there, never really coming to shore.”  

It was when the Pastor made the journey out to the beach that he saw it was a body. Hands tied behind the back, feet bound, naked below the waist. Janice stayed in place like an anchored boat. Rangers would confirm Janice had fishing line tied around her neck as well, attached to cinder blocks on the lake bed.  

Taylor was the last of the Seger women to be found.  

Miles south in a clearing off Fernberg Road, a fifteen mile stretch of desolate freeway that carves through Superior National Forest, a group of Veterans hiking the Fernberg Trail called in what looked like a young girl with a bag over her head sitting against a scorched tree. Taylor had managed to free her left hand from the rope before dying, clawing unsuccessfully at the bag over her head. Fishing line was tied around her throat, attached to the highest branch. Her thrashing had caused the line to cut deep, seeping red color into the neckline of her shirt.  

Besides her free hand, another signifying mark separated her from her sister and mother. On the bag covering her head, a smiling face had been drawn with the words “COME AND SEE!” written across the top.  

Word had spread quickly about the fate of the Seger women, about the brutality of their murders and the obvious sexual nature of the crime. No doubt they’d been tortured during their last moments, raped and murdered in the cold wilderness amongst the rising conifers that stretched above them like giants, along the still waters of Fall Lake. No doubt this was the workings of someone with a dark psychology, whose mind turned in ways counter to the rest of us. A reporter, Olivia Olson, had made the journey out into the thick of the forest, talking to Rangers and later to the State CID officers who swarmed the scene. She was the first to report the murders.  

“[The police] were everywhere; in the sky, on the ground. It was chaos. Not unexpected, but chaos still.”  

Olivia had been with the Duluth Sentinel some twenty years. Born and raised in Duluth, she was a woman of quiet temper and brooding vision. Years prior, I had worked under her before absconding with what little I had left of my life to the warmed airs of eastern Florida. Olivia had been my guide through the politics of the Sentinel, rearing me from intern to crimes reporter. It was late when she called, around one in the morning. Two weeks had gone by since the Seger women had been found.   

“It’s obvious we have a serial killer on our hands, but there’s something else. I’ve never seen anything like it.”  

Olivia explained that just a week after the Seger women had been found, investigations by both state and local police ceased almost immediately. When questioned, they responded saying an approaching storm would hinder any serious effort. They stopped responding to her calls a few days later. The storm ever came.   

Then there was the issue, Olivia went on, of the vanishing news reports. All over the Arrowhead Region, no paper or online publication kept their stories up for more than a couple days. Olivia recalled seeing one paper feature the story on the front page, then whittled it down to the back pages until it finally moved out of existence, all in a span of three days.  

“I can’t believe it, Simon. There’s some sort of collective amnesia at work here. No one talks abut the case anymore. I’m the only one reporting.” Olivia sounded rattled.   

“A triple homicide, the work of a serial killer. This should be national fucking news.”  

“Do they have someone in custody?” I asked. This was strange, to put it mildly.  

“They arrested this boy out of St. Cloud, said he was there at the time of the murders. Locals and eye witness’s place him at the Camp Ground, talking to Janice, having dinner with them the night before. He even has a boat. They’re trying to get him to name accomplices.”  

“So maybe they have him?”  

“He fits the type; late twenties, respected car mechanic, rap sheet of petty theft and one count of sexual battery.”  

“There we have it, then.”   

“I don’t buy it.”  

I sighed. Olivia had made a career questioning bits, or whole swaths, of information if they didn’t fit a predetermined narrative in her head. Most of the time, she was right. Most of the time.  

“I’m going to drop box you some related documents about this whole mess. I want you to have a copies.”  

“Why?“  

“It might do you some good.”  

“I don’t report homicide anymore, Olivia.”  

“Well keep it anyway, look it over.”  

“What for?”  

“Because someone’s following me.”  

“What?”  

“I said someone’s following me.”  

I sat up.  

“Olivia, are you serious?”  

“No. I don’t know. I’m old, Simon. My mind wanders. In any case, I want you to have all the shit I’ve gathered. Maybe it’ll have some use for you, or maybe I’ll turn up face down in a ravine.”  

I closed my eyes to the image.  

“It’s good to see you haven’t lost your sense of humor.” I smiled. “I almost forgot it.”  

“So listen, I might be coming down for vacation in a month. You should show me around, show me off to all your girlfriends in the Sunshine State.”  

“I’ll be sure to do that.”  

Olivia laughed.  

“Olivia.” I felt a tightness around me.  

“Yeah?”  

There was something in her voice. In all the years I had known her, I hadn’t know her to sound like this, whatever it was.  

“Take care of yourself. If you-. Just take of yourself. I’m here if you need me.”  

She paused.  

“I will. See you soon, kiddo.”  

She hung up and I listened to the dial tone for a while in the heat of my apartment. That was odd to me, she’d never called me kiddo before.  

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&amp;nbsp;

It’s been four days since Olivia’s missing persons report was filed. Neighbors say they saw her Easter morning, gearing up for her daily run that took her four miles around Munger, past the old highway and looping around the Tavern &amp; Grill.  

I’ve been reeling since the onset. Olivia is a formidable woman with a calculating mind. She measures outcomes and instances and is careful with her work. Not kind, and not always caring, but careful. She knew Duluth and every secret fold of the town, every street and alleyway. It almost makes no sense.  

Earlier today I had a chance to look over the documents she had sent me. It was a flurry of disorganized scans of paper, screen shots of requests and audio interviews. Some things, however, stood out. Like when Olivia first heard of the murders.  

Annmarie Seger’s body had been reported to the Park Rangers at 5:34 AM on March 29th. Janice’s body was reported 6:02 AM, Taylor’s at 7:15 AM. Olivia, however, had logged all three murders at 6:30 AM in an online journal she’d been keeping of the crimes. How was that possible? The first statement issued by Police was at noon, before then there seems to be no talk about the murders. Not online anyway. How had she known about Taylor forty-five minutes before she was found? What kind of information was Olivia operating with? It wasn’t until I listened to the audio interviews that something dark became apparent.  

It was clear something had deeply unhinged Olivia. Some reecorded weeks prior to the actual murders themselves, the interviews weren’t person-to-person, but rather hours worth of audio where Olivia would talk in an almost manic state about anything that entered her mind. One ‘interview session’ went on for three hours where she discussed at length the people of Munger, talking little about the actual murders. She edified how she believed the people were under “its” influence. How they operated for ‘it’, never clarifying who or what ‘it’ was.  

“They don’t have eyes. They have holes where it looks out of. It’s the only way it’s able to find me.”   

They left me in a daze. If Olivia sounded less like her self when she had called, now she sounded like someone else entirely. Like some other person had stolen her voice was using it to speak with. I walked through the city for most of the day, running her words through my mind. Was she really being followed by someone? Had her life been in danger? When the sun set I found myself near the Fort Walton shores. I imagined what seeing Janice on the water must have felt like. A floating body, unmoving as it rose and fell with the silent tides. Then I thought of Olivia on the water, her hands and feet bound, naked below the waist. A bag over her head. I shuddered. I turned around and walked home as thunderheads developed over head. A storm was coming.  

I got home and pursed through some more of the documents Olivia had sent when I found it. It was a photocopy of a post card that had been addressed to her. The front had a faded picture, the facade of Superior National Forest. “Enjoy the Fresh Air!” it read. Turning it over, I froze. Printed in fading ink, then hand written over and over and over again until it filled the back, the words stood bold:  

&gt; COME AND SEE!  

The card was post marked two weeks before the Seger women were found. Before they had even gone missing.  

I have a plane ticket in hand and I’m sitting at Pensacola International waiting for the 5:30 AM flight to Duluth. No paper has reported Olivia’s disappearance. I figured as much.  

I wasn’t sure how long I’d be, so I took little with me, figuring I’ll buy what I need when I need it. The few things I’ve brought are my computer, writing supplies, and a post card I got in the mail earlier today.   

On the front is a fading over view of a water tower that reads ‘Queen City - Virginia, MN’. On the back is a phrase written in dark hand writing over and over, leaving almost no white space.

66os5w,6,2017-04-21,Interview situation that is similar to a work situation with office politics. I hope it's okay if I post here. I need help wording this professionally.,beigestripes,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/66os5w/interview_situation_that_is_similar_to_a_work/,"HR, I hope it is okay if I post here. I have an interview type situation that is similar to a work situation with office politics and professional relationships. If this is not allowed, I can remove the post.




I need help on how to word this succinctly, professionally, a in way that avoids gossip, maintains professional relationships that could help me advance my career.





I am part of a program that is very expensive, prestigious and encourages students to find official / unofficial mentors and to network professionally.





This means I interact with many people on an acquaintance and professional basis.





It is very common for people to ask how I afforded the program / who is supporting me.





I don't feel comfortable giving specifics and truthful answers because they are private, however I can't also ignore the question because these people are the gatekeepers to further professional networking and internships. Internships are also generally unpaid or barely paid.





I am meeting these people through my professional organization, so it is not directly on their work site, and it seems perfectly legal for them to ask me questions about money.






Here is the thing. I currently make less than 20,000k per year USA and use that money to support myself and help with family members who are struggling.






I am able to participate mostly through luck with managing several different scenarios.






For example, I am a student and so I am eligible to apply for certain loans, certain grants, etc. I also live in a 200 square foot apartment with 4 other people, which reduces rent a lot.






Some people don't ask direct questions for money, but indirect one such as - which street do you live on (this is a very small area, different streets have different property values). 







I met one guy at one of these events who was very upfront with me. He told me this profession rewards pedigree because it is important to have grown up understanding the value and wealth associated with this profession as well as people who are able to do years of study, work for minimum pay and yet afford to wear real jewelry and expensive clothes every day. He was able to manage because he has a PhD from the Sorbonne and so he could bring that to the table, but I don't have that.






I have already invested so much, I just need a little more time before I can leave.







How do I answer questions?






If I answer honestly, people encourage to leave this field / automatically refuse my application sighting I wouldn't be able to support my living costs on that pay / ask further questions to explain who I am able to make it work. Also, it is embarrassing to share so much about finances with strangers who hold the keys to my future.






If I answer dishonestly, saying that I can afford it from family money, I am included much more - unofficial lunches, private gallery invitations, ""let me introduce you to so-and-so, he has a great network"". However, it is hard for me to keep up here, as the casual lunch can be over $50 dollars, and sharing an Uber car home to chat further / bond in a more casual setting is an additional $20, where I could walk 1.5 miles for free.






However, in some of the companies, their certain opportunities that are reserved for students who are low - income. If I mis-represent my financial status, I eliminate myself from that demographic. In those companies, it really helps me to be honest because it puts me in competition with my actual peers, not peers who have had years of pedigree training.







So in some situations, being honest is helpful, in some situations being honest is unhelpful. But this is such a small professionally community, it is difficult to say different things to different people. It could come back to bite me in the future.







Do I say I took out loans? Do I say I have wealthy grandparents? Do I actually take out loans? 






One of the ways that I am able to participate is a very unusual program at my community college. It would also help me if some might be able to help me word this succinctly.








Part of my finances come from an art competition. My school is received a private donor who created a fund to support a competition that groups participants by generational wealth. That means, the winners are chosen from their category, does that make sense?






For example, 100 students create a piece and complete the essay and application. Generally, there would be a first, second, and third prize winner from the group. However, this competition divides the group into three categories. The category you are in is dependent on the documents given to the financial aid department (and therefore verified by the federal government). So, students with family income between  0 - 50,000 have a 1st, 2nd, 3rd prize winner. Students from 50,001 - 80,000 have their own three winners. 80,001 - 100,000 have there own winners. 100,001 - 125,000 have their own winners. And I think the last category is 125,001 - 150,000 while those above 150,001 all compete together.





I don't know the vocabulary to explain this clearly. It quite a unique situation, but I find it greatly helpful because they are having people compete against others who have similar financial support and similar exposure to this profession.







Thank you for your thoughts, I am happy to answer any questions.






Edit - I thought of an example. If I say I live on XYZ street without explanation, I am invited to parties - which in this situation, it is who you know not what you know. If I say in the staff quarters, I am not included to socialize. But usually when I am invited to socialize, I have to borrow or buy a dress to wear, because the clothes I have are not of the same caliber."

**Work experience:**
Right now I'm in a F50 leadership program (specifically focused on IT). We work two positions through our rotation, my first one was was doing PMO/PM work for a massive enterprise change management initiative, one that is expected to save the company over $1B a year. My second position will be focused on the technology which educates doctors on how to properly use our products, it will involve a lot of hands on technical work and developing proof of concepts, as well as great exposure and interaction with how the business functions. I expect a promotion sometime this year.
(Since I'm a recent grad I guess it may be worth mentioning internships as well?? I interned for a quasi-independent state VC fund, and for the same F50 company before I came in as full-time).

**Extra curricular:**
I lead multiple fundraisers for charities (raising over $5k for two different charities, one with large recognition) + volunteer with high school students to teach them about technology jobs and skills

**Undergrad school/major:**
Graduated last May (2016) with a Finance + MIS degree at a Northeast ""Public Ivy"" - Not like UCLA/Michigan/Virginia, but it has been given that title. It's a Top 50 Public school that is fairly new and improving every yaer.

**Other education/coursework:**
Was a part of the winning team of the senior consulting project at my college, 78 teams competed all composed of graduating seniors.
Hoping to get a ScrumMaster certification sometime this year.

**Race/nationality/Sex:**
White Male

**Other:**
Not sure if this matters at all but I moved here with my mom when I was very young as a refugee, grew up in a single parent household with free lunches + foodstamps + moved around a bunch when I was younger (moved into middle class around middle school)

**Stats**
GMAT Score (include breakdown!):
Still studying right now, would like to know what kind of GMAT I would need to aim for to make my goals achievable

**Undergrad GPA:**
3.75/4.00, Magna Cum Laude

**MBA Info**
Goal of MBA: I'm not a big fan of the IT field, I would much rather be doing consulting. I have developed technical skills that I feel would be valuable in connecting some of the gaps between IT and business, and think I could be a great asset to companies. Also would like to end up in the Northeast so aiming at schools that place well there. I still need to work on my story.

**Target schools:**

**Reaches?: **

* Darmouth
* Duke
* Yale

**Targets?:**

* Cornell Johnson 
* Virginia Darden

**Safeties?: **

* Georgetown
* Carnegie Mellon Tepper


So with this, I'm just trying to figure out where I stand. What kind of GMAT would I need to make my target school list feasible. Is it even, or am I not on the right track at all?"
66pp59,1,2017-04-21,I couldn't finish my thesis on time and here are my options,IridiumPoint,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/66pp59/i_couldnt_finish_my_thesis_on_time_and_here_are/,"Hi r/advice,

I have found myself in a quite complicated situation and I hope you will be able to help me choose how to proceed. However, before we get to the crux of the problem, I would like to give you the background of how I got into this mess. If you're short on time or patience, feel free to skip to the last two paragraphs.

The story begins 6 years ago, when I enrolled in a translating/interpreting course on a university. I had always been quite good at languages, but I found the course pretty dissatisfying. 

I have dropped out after a year, but since I had pretty much no marketable skills at that point, I decided to try my luck in another course. I wanted to study something creative, but I didn't know what, so I went for something general – mass media communication. I'm sure most of you are rolling your eyes right now, but it seemed like a pretty sweet deal at the time – the university I chose had access to professional grade TV and radio equipment and they had creative classes of all kinds.

I have enrolled in the course and for the first year I had the time of my life. At some point during the second year I have rediscovered my love for programming and I have finally decided that my future career would be the one of a web developer. I have started learning web dev stuff again, so I had no time for the extracurricular activities which made me enjoy the course in the first place. I had decided that I would quit after getting my Bachelor's degree.

After a long and painful struggle I did indeed get my degree. However, the second part of my resolution was not destined to pass. You see, my older sister had dropped out of her Master's/Engineer computer science course in her last year a few years earlier. She had a reputation of being a great student, a borderline genius even, but she completely burned out and failed at the last hurdle – her thesis. Our parents, especially our mum, had invested quite a bit of time, energy and money in ensuring that we would be able to concentrate on our studies, so they were understandably dissatisfied. I think it's because of this that they put me in a position where I was basically forced to continue my education.

I have changed my course to marketing communication, which I thought would at least be somewhat more beneficial to my web development career than the mass media one, and onward I went. In our last year we had to find a month-long internship in some marketing-related company, and I managed to get it in one pretty cool web development/IT company. The manager had offered me a job when I get done with my degree (though I'm pretty sure what he meant by that is that I would finally have time to work fulltime, not that I would actaully have a degree in hand).

Enter today, the day I was supposed to hand my 90k character long thesis in. It is currently only 65k characters long and I'm pretty sure that most of it is complete b******p anyway. I have fallen victim to the same thing that had happened to my sister – I burned out. I realised that the time I have spent studying is time wasted, completely useless to the career I had planned for myself. I realised that the university was geared towards making us all into academics, and that's something that I have just no interest in.

Finishing the thesis on time is out of the picture now. My options are these:

1. Try to finish the thesis over the weekend and try to hand it in on Monday. I have heard that there is a chance it will be accepted anyway. The problem is that I'm not confident I'll be able to finish it well enough to pass and I will waste money even getting it printed and bound.

2. Try to get the hand-in date moved to sometime in June and exams to August. However, this will mean that I will have to keep up with this Hell for another 3 months. Also, if I'm unable to start working I might lose the job spot promised to me, but if I do start working I might not have time to produce a good thesis anyway.

3. Just quit. I would be able to start doing what I want and even get paid to do it. However, the situation within my family is already pretty tense and this could push it over into all sorts of unpleasantness. I actually got a call from my mum while writing this post and when the truth came out... Well, it wasn't nice.

So, what shall I do? I'm looking forward to your suggestions."

The interview process was quick and painless and I like the location and responsibilities I would have.

The only problem is that they are offering me minimum wage ($11/hour) and only 3 days a week. For the field I am in and for someone with my major at my school this is FAR below the average. I tried asking for more but they basically told me the hourly wage was fixed and I could only get more hours if I am needed for big projects.

They want a response by Tuesday, as I told them I have another interview on Monday (I don't). My question is can I/should I accept the offer and then apply to more places and go with them if they give me a better offer? I've applied to about 5 or 6 other places at this point and this is the only other one that has even contacted me. I'm going to apply to more places but would it be bad form to accept and then reject it? I need some advice here, so anything is appreciated."

I'm currently a freshman in university, double majoring in Economics and Japanese. Very little computer science background: coded in Batch as a kid, took a C++ class in high school, know some basic HTML, and spent a couple years making Adobe Flash games with ActionScript.

I'm interested in looking for internships over the summer related to my college that have to do with the college website. There are a lot of slots for different positions open, and their descriptions are vague. Even if that fails, my father works in the IT department of a relatively large company, and I think I could get something there.

Essentially, if I'm beginning web development/programming/design, what language(s) should I learn? I figure a list in order would look something like this:

- HTML

- CSS

- JS

- PHP

- SQL

- jQuery

Just going off of what I see on the [SoloLearn website](https://www.sololearn.com/Courses/). I completed the basic HTML5 course. Should I pursue HTML more deeply, move onto basic understanding of CSS/JS, what should I do?

Also interested in making web games in the future in my free time with whatever I learn, so anything that could help with that would be awesome."

So I am going to be a junior in the Statistics and Computer Science program, and I am wondering the following: How many openings do you see about Data Science internships from your past experiences at the career fair? 

I want to eventually become a data scientist, but I also want to be able to work an internship next summer as well. This summer I plan to work on some projects in order to expand my portfolio. If the general idea is that there is not many opportunities to get to interact with a recruiter about a data science internship possibility, I would rather focus my upcoming summer on expanding my software engineering  knowledge because I know there's internships in that. 

So once again , based on your experience, does it seem like there are a lot of recruiters at the career fair seeking data science interns?

Well I finally got accepted to one last week, so I was feeling relieved.

One of the requirements for accepting this job was completing a drug test. I was talking to my sister about it, and she mentioned that she had to do that for her last job. Unfortunately she drank too much water beforehand, so her sample came back dilute. No big deal, she has to go get tested again.

This is where I fucked up. I got nervous last night about not getting a diluted result, so I made sure not to drink that much. I woke up this morning, and had a glass of orange juice. I wasnt too worried, as I almost always have to pee in the morning, but I didnt today to save it for the drug test.

Anyways, I get to the clinic, and i fill out all the forms. 10 minutes later they call me back, and lo and behold, I cant pee enough. At this point its around 11:30, and I have a class at 1. I drink as much as I can right away, trying to get water through my system so I can go pee. It gets to 12:35 and I decide I can't wait any longer, because if I miss this class, my grade will drop a whole letter grade.

Well, due to the fact that I was so dehydrated when I woke up, the water that I drank took even longer to go through my system, and I wasn't able to complete the test. The guy in charge said if I left, this would count as a refusal of a test, which many companies take as a positive.

I emailed my contact at my new job, basically saying I'll do anything to fix the situation, including taking a test later in the day. Unfortunately, they have every other Friday off of work, so I havent gotten a response. 

Now I just have to wait until Monday, hoping that I get some good news.


TL:DR I wasnt able to pee enough for a drug test, might have lost my only offer for a summer internship."

So I'm currently a 2nd year statistics major and I've been trying to go into data science. Recently though, I've been having a lot of issues with motivation, and honestly, I just don't know if data science is something I'm really passionate about. Logically, it's a great career path with high pay and high projected growth, but to be completely honest, I just don't feel passionate about it at all.


Before going into data science though, I actually really wanted to go into management consulting. When I was working towards becoming a management consultant, I was extremely motivated. I got up at 6:00am twice a week to go to my internship I had during the school year, I was voraciously reading like everything I could about being a consultant, I had even bought one of Victor Cheng's books, I was in a consulting club, so many other things. I LOVED the idea of being a management consultant. I loved how they got to solve real world business problems, and I loved how they learned so much about so many different industries.


I think what changed and steered me away were 3 things: 

1.) the people in my club were kind of douchey,
 
2.) I was really worried this drive (I had never felt so much drive in my life) was going to be a temporary thing, and that I would grow to hate the job (i.e.: the travel, being away from home/social life 4 days a week, etc.)

Specifically, I was afraid I was just passionate about the image and the idea of being a consultant, and what it would be like to make it to a company like Bain. I worried when it came to do the actual work, I wouldn't like it at all.

3.) and the biggest thing, I felt incredibly incompetent when I did my first case competition.

Our team still placed in 2nd out of our entire school, but I felt like I was a burden to my team the entire time. I was by far the weak link. My team gave me the least/easiest slides for me to present, they walked me through things, etc. I was really, really worried that I just didn't have ""it"" to be a consultant. I was afraid if I worked for a consulting firm, I wouldn't contribute anything valuable. I was afraid I just didn't have the business intuition to do it.


This was combined with a fear that my parents wouldn't support me if I did something that was more business-y.

That, and my GPA right now is nowhere near where it should be to recruit at consulting firms (it's a 3.3...most consulting firms won't even look at you without at least a 3.5). My school is also considered semi-target for consulting, as in it's not Ivy League, but it's top 20 nationwide.


I feel like there were a host of other reasons that I just can't remember, but they all fell under doubts of:

1.) not being good enough

2.) if this drive was real

Consequently, I decided to do something I felt more confident that I could do better in: data science.


I figured that if I stuck it out for long enough, the drive would eventually come. It's been about 5 months, and here I am typing out how I have no passion for data science. 
I've tried making myself passionate by googling how data scientists change the world, but I can feel that its just not genuine and that I'm forcing myself to feel this way. It just doesn't come naturally like it did for consulting.


Side note, one of my dreams is to one day start my own company, and I feel like consulting would give a lot more background on that.

So what do you think reddit? Do you think I should stick to data science, or do you think I should do consulting?"

66t8ti,11,2017-04-21,Major crisis in deciding where to attend,college_throwawayyyy,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/66t8ti/major_crisis_in_deciding_where_to_attend/,"I'll preface this post by saying that I know that I am very fortunate to have been accepted to such selective schools. I understand that I am very privileged in my current position, but I am still experiencing some intense difficulty deciding between my current two top choices: Columbia and Brown.

Let me give some background for the situation I currently find myself in. Columbia has been my dream school for years. Ever since I first began thinking about where I might want to go to college, Columbia has been at the very top of my list. Columbia was the first school I ever visited, and I knew immediately that it was the place I wanted to end up. Taking all this into consideration, I applied ED in the Fall. I was deferred, and I was devastated. I let the college admissions process affect my own self-esteem far too much, and I spiraled into a bit of depression and anxiety that made it difficult me to do schoolwork or talk to my friends. I remember walking around my house, saying things like ""If I get into any school other than Columbia, I'll try to transfer after my freshman year."" I know all of the Columbia promotional material by heart and can recite it essentially verbatim. I hope this shows exactly how hard my heart was set on Columbia for so long.

So as you can imagine, I was ecstatic when I was fortunate enough to have been accepted to the class of 2021 during the regular decision round. I was also accepted to some other schools on March 30, including Brown. Up until this point, I had never visited Brown's campus, and I still had my heart set on Columbia, but I was pleasantly surprised to have the option.

Fast forward to Columbia's admitted students event: ""Days on Campus,"" which was held on April 9th and 10th. This was the first time that I had ever visited Columbia's campus while there were undergraduate students present--the other times I had always visited over the summer months. While all of the admissions officers and student volunteers seemed friendly, I felt as though the general student body held a general disdain for the prospies on campus. This belief of mine was confirmed by looking at Columbia's Yik Yak that day: several comments had been made along the lines of ""Prefrosh should jump off a roof"" and ""All these prefrosh are making me late to class."" Overall, I felt like I was not welcomed by most of students at Columbia, who made it abundantly clear that I was at the very bottom of the totem pole at a major institution with little regard for your individual troubles. I experienced some of what I had only read about before, and never quite understood: the bureaucracy of Columbia. After attending Columbia's Days on Campus, I feel like the word ""bureaucracy"" seems like a perfect fit for what the administration is like. Days on Campus seemed like a formality, accepting the next class of students into the whirring machine of advanced higher education that would spit out our generation's pushers and movers--but little else. Dean Valentini (who seems like a very nice man) gave a speech, as did the Dean of Admissions, Jessica Marinaccio. I felt that the staffers and organizers were doing the best they could, but it was difficult not to feel as though the entire event and the university as a whole was somewhat impersonal.

Beyond this, I wasn't entirely thrilled by the attitudes of some of the other prefrosh. Sure, there were plenty of nice people there, but there were also lots of students who seemed like they were just bragging about how they were trying to choose between Columbia and Harvard, but would probably just end up choosing Harvard. It seemed like a lot of the other people who attended the event went to private school (which isn't necessarily bad), but they brought with them a sense of prep school elitism that I had never really been exposed to before. There was an overwhelming sense of entitlement among many of the prospies that I was, quite frankly, appalled by. I have been fortunate enough in life to not experience hardship. I am thankful to have loving parents, teachers who care about me, and lots of friends who support me. Yet, despite my own privilege in life, I couldn't help but feel that many of the kids at Days on Campus were in a different stratosphere of wealth and were far more self-assured about their right to have a place at such an elite institution. Since being accepted to college, I have suffered to a certain extent from imposter syndrome, questioning whether I truly belong at such an amazing place. Yet, many of the prospies that I encountered at Columbia did not appear to feel similarly, and it honestly seemed like they had been afforded every blessing in life. I met kids who went to some prep schools, and had already mastered multivariable calculus and linear algebra before even entering college. As a prospective math major, I felt inferior to these students, when I myself had struggled through Calculus BC. It made me question whether I wouldn't be discouraged from attempting to pursue a math degree, because I was already so far behind many of the other students.

On top of all this, I got the overwhelming sense that the student population really was as stressed as people online reported. I heard several students comparing GPAs with each other, the general student did not seem overly happy. This actually reminded me of [a post from this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/63mj5v/columbia_university_a_student_perspective/), which made a similar comment:

&gt;When I see people walking around campus I don’t see much happiness or enthusiasm.

This comment seemed almost naive to me at first when I first read it a couple weeks ago. What do you honestly expect out of the student body of a top-ranked institution like Columbia? People there are serious about their studies and have a New York attitude--a certain sense of independence. Yet, looking around Columbia's campus a few weeks ago, I realized just how accurate this sentiment really is. People there certainly seemed ambitious--I overheard many a conversation about the latest internship or job offer. Yet, so few of the people I encountered seemed like they had the spark of passion in a subject that I had dreamed of. And still fewer seemed like they were actually enjoying themselves on such a beautiful April day. It reminded me of a comment I read on the Columbia subreddit a couple months ago, in response to someone who posted about recently being accepted: ""Get out while you still can.""

New York City, too was not what I had previously expected. I have been to New York a handful of times, always in awe of the buildings and culture there that is known the world over. However, on my most recent visit, I got the sense that I had never perceived before, of being entirely overwhelmed. I come from a very small town, where the pace is comparatively slow. Yet, when I found myself rushing to the subway so I could quickly get downtown to the hectic hellhole of Penn Station so I could get my train back home, I felt what I imagine is the hustle and bustle of a ""New York minute."" To be honest, I didn't like it. To me, it seemed as though I was more irritable than ever before. I felt like I had a disregard for other people as I pushed past them toward my final destination. Maybe it was only because I had drank a cup of coffee (something I don't often do), but I felt self-centered in a way that I was acutely aware of and did not necessarily enjoy. I had always assumed that I wanted to live in New York later in life, but I'm not certain such a stark transition would be good for me, and I'm very afraid that the climate of New York would only bring out the worst aspects of my personality, namely anxiety, stress, and a self-centered ego that makes me feel like I am the only important person in the world (I have certainly been guilty of this last one before).

Enter Brown. I attended their admitted students day this past week, A Day on College Hill (ADOCH for short). A Day on College Hill was literally the **best** three days of my entire life. It is the happiest I have ever been. All of the activities that they had us do were so much fun. From eating in the Ratty to going to the bookstore to check out all the cool merchandise to exploring Brown's beautiful campus, I absolutely loved it. I really cannot understate how much fun I had. I could really see myself on Brown's campus for the next four years. Brown had almost the exact opposite vibe of Columbia. My room hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful (not that my host at Columbia wasn't), and they went above and beyond to answer any questions I had. My host even took me to one of his classes, and told me about how his professor learned all of the student's names, even though it was a massive intro-level lecture. There was even an option to speak one-on-one with the admissions officer who had read your application. When I went to talk to the officer for my region, she was busy with another student, so I walked away. This lady was so nice that she e-mailed me the next day to meet up with me so that she could talk to me. She knew my name and the details of my entire application, and I felt really personally cared for. In addition, another senior admissions officer texted me personally and asked me if I had any questions and if I was enjoying my stay. When I was talking to that officer, she knew my name and exactly who I was, even though we had never spoken face-to-face before.

In addition, the students at Brown seemed incredibly friendly. One student stopped in the middle of his studying to ask if I had any questions or needed any help. He then walked with me outside to show me where I needed to go. Another student saw that I was confused when looking at a map and again offered to point me in the right direction. I felt welcome and cared for in a way that was 100% not the case at Columbia. The sense of elitism from Columbia was also not present on campus. All of the other prefrosh seemed genuinely interested in hearing each other's opinions and listening to what they were passionate about.

Many other students at ADOCH that were choosing between Columbia and Brown felt much the same way as I did. I spoke to two other people who both were choosing Brown over Columbia. One of these people goes to the high school in the county over from mine, and was almost as dead-set on Columbia as I was before attending ADOCH. Another girl I talked to seemed surprised when I said I was considering Columbia over Brown: ""But everyone is so laid-back and friendly here,"" she remarked, and I must admit she had a point. My host's roommate was also super chill, and honestly one of the coolest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet in my entire life. He said that a year ago, when he was deciding on a college, he was choosing between the University of Chicago (which, like Columbia is known for its stress culture and poor mental health) and Brown. He said he was so unbelievably happy he had chosen Brown, and that all of his friends were glad they did too.

In addition, I also was convinced of the effectiveness of the open curriculum at Brown, compared to Columbia's core. I had always been a fan of the Core curriculum, because it would give me the chance to learn about the great works that make up western civilization. I have always wanted to be well-versed in high culture, and attending Columbia would allow me to achieve this. I also have been enamoured with the Contemporary Civilizations and Literature Humanities courses, where I could learn about all the philosophy without having to take formal philosophy courses. I have always loved philosophy, and Columbia would offer me this sort of easy accessibility to great western works. While visiting Brown, however, I was convinced that the open curriculum is not without its own merits. I am not entirely certain that I want to pursue a degree in mathematics (I also have interests in stats, computer science, and economics--though I am wary of selling out to Wall Street). At Brown, I could perhaps pursue these interests to a greater degree, simply because I would have more time and freedom.

This all being said, there are a few problems I have with choosing Brown over Columbia.

I recognize that much of the reason why I am making this post is because I am still in love with Columbia. I have a massive issue with confirmation bias, and I am mostly making this post because I want someone to tell me that my fears are unfounded, and that I shouldn't focus so much on the intangible aspects of choosing a college. Instead, I should just be happy attending the school that has been the object of my dreams for years: ""the greatest university in the greatest city in the world.""

In addition, I am a little concerned that all of this worry over the choice of college is a manifestation of my own self-defeating tendencies. I am simply afraid that I won't be able to cut it at Columbia, and so I am filling myself with doubt so that I will attend Brown, where the students at the very least seem happy with their choice. There, I will still be challenged and have the smug superiority of having attended an ivy league university, but I will be in a more hospitable and accepting environment. This reflects one of the comments I heard at ADOCH this past week: ""Think about where you want to be when you are stressed out and need help. Brown provides a community... unlike some other schools."" This comment seemed specifically tailored to me.

Another problem is the sense of regret. If I attend Brown, I know I will regret not going to Columbia, which has been my dream for years. Instead of facing the stress of the big city and a major university, I know I will feel as though I simply avoided the issue instead of trying to deal with it (even though this feeling seems irrational and unfounded).

Prestige is another issue. Both these schools are ivies, so this literally doesn't matter, and I recognize this. Still, there's something that really just gets me deep down when I can say that I was accepted to the third most selective college in the nation. I get the same feeling when I think about saying to someone later in life, ""Oh, I went to school in New York"" or ""I had an ivy league education."" Something about being an ivy league new yorker makes you feel on top of the world and that's a difficult emotion to give up, even if it is irrational.

I am also wary of basing my entire decision off of three days of my life. Is the accepted students day really representative of what life in college is going to be like? I am so inexperienced and know so little about what it is truly like to be independent in college, that it is impossible for me to even tell. ADOCH was certainly fun, but is it worth changing my entire life trajectory over a single event? I don't think so, even now.

On a more concrete basis, I'm not entirely certain what to think about the pure math department at Brown. While Brown does have the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM), my host said that the professors in the pure math department for undergraduates were not the best. Instead, Brown has a very strong focus on applied math rather than pure math. That being said, I am not certain exactly which side of math I would like to pursue. Yet, I am afraid that I may be pushed closer to the applied side at Brown, simply because their applied department is stronger. In contrast, my childhood hero Brian Greene is a professor in the math department at Columbia. While I am under no illusion that I would be spending time with Dr. Greene, I still think it would be really awesome to attend the same college that he works at.

I am also very interested in getting involved with the radio station wherever I go to college. I absolutely love listening to NPR, and both Brown and Columbia have had alumni go to NPR (including Ira Glass and Robert Siegel, respectively). Yet, the future of Brown's radio station has recently been called into question, as they are considering selling it. Though it does not look like the motion to sell will pass, it is something I am considering, as Columbia's radio station seems to be just as strong if not stronger than Brown's.

In addition, I would like to join marching band in college, especially since it was one of the activities I most enjoyed during high school. Both the Brown and the Columbia bands are similar--they have a ""scramble"" format--but Columbia's band also does Orgo Night, a beloved night of comedy the evening before the Orgo Chem final. I am interested in writing comedy and feel like this might be a good outlet for me to explore that interest. Several members of the marching band at Columbia even live in a suite together. Perhaps this would bring me the sense of community that I so desperately desire at such a faceless institution.

To complicate matters, there's an element of this entire issue that I haven't even discussed yet. I also got into the University of Pennsylvania, and now I feel like I never gave it a fair shake in this entire process. After having visited both Penn and Columbia before, I had decided that given a choice between the two, I would choose Columbia. I was so confident in this decision that I did not even attend Penn's accepted students day, and with ten days remaining before I have to commit, it seems like there is little chance that I will be able to visit any of these schools before deciding. Yet, I cannot help but feel that since I seem to have misjudged both Columbia and Brown, could I not have done the same thing to Penn? It always seemed to me that the choice between Penn and Columbia was obvious--a choice merely between New York and Philly. Both excellent institutions with similar student bodies and similar goals, just different locations. Now, however, I have come to realize the importance of intangible aspects of universities at a time that seems almost too late. Would I have preferred the social aspect of Penn, as it is known as the social ivy? I might never know, and that is a difficult truth for me to face. I am used to having complete information when making a decision, but it appears that this simply is impossible in my current situation.

And now, let me arrive at the crux of the entire scenario I currently find myself in. The single greatest issue that is making this decision difficult for me. The main reason why I am using a throwaway account to make this post right now. I met this really cute girl while I was visiting Brown.

I realize that this is the single stupidest thing ever. But we really hit it off, and I can't help but think that it made my entire visit to Providence seem way better than it actually was. I don't want this to define where I go for the next four years, and I need to make sure that it won't. I have worked so hard for years, and I can't let this stupid crush change the way I live the rest of my fucking life.

So, please help me reddit. I have relied on this subreddit heavily in the past, and I need your guidance now more than ever. The agony of this decision is killing me. I would like to thank you if you made it to the end of this post, because I realize that I have rambled on for quite a bit longer than I was originally expecting. But, I felt it was important for me to parse all of my thoughts out, and it seems only fair to give you the entire background of my story.

Any advice at all is appreciated."
66u5nf,1,2017-04-22,(College sophomore) Which career path should I take?,blokj,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/66u5nf/college_sophomore_which_career_path_should_i_take/,"Hi,

So I'm currently a 2nd year statistics major and I've been trying to go into data science. Recently though, I've been having a lot of issues with motivation, and honestly, I just don't know if data science is something I'm really passionate about. Logically, it's a great career path with high pay and high projected growth, but to be completely honest, I just don't feel passionate about it at all.


Before going into data science though, I actually really wanted to go into management consulting. When I was working towards becoming a management consultant, I was extremely motivated. I got up at 6:00am twice a week to go to my internship I had during the school year, I was voraciously reading like everything I could about being a consultant, I had even bought one of Victor Cheng's books, I was in a consulting club, so many other things. I LOVED the idea of being a management consultant. I loved how they got to solve real world business problems, and I loved how they learned so much about so many different industries.


I think what changed and steered me away were 3 things: 

1.) the people in my club were kind of douchey,
 
2.) I was really worried this drive (I had never felt so much drive in my life) was going to be a temporary thing, and that I would grow to hate the job (i.e.: the travel, being away from home/social life 4 days a week, etc.)

Specifically, I was afraid I was just passionate about the image and the idea of being a consultant, and what it would be like to make it to a company like Bain. I worried when it came to do the actual work, I wouldn't like it at all.

3.) and the biggest thing, I felt incredibly incompetent when I did my first case competition.

Our team still placed in 2nd out of our entire school, but I felt like I was a burden to my team the entire time. I was by far the weak link. My team gave me the least/easiest slides for me to present, they walked me through things, etc. I was really, really worried that I just didn't have ""it"" to be a consultant. I was afraid if I worked for a consulting firm, I wouldn't contribute anything valuable. I was afraid I just didn't have the business intuition to do it.


This was combined with a fear that my parents wouldn't support me if I did something that was more business-y.

That, and my GPA right now is nowhere near where it should be to recruit at consulting firms (it's a 3.3...most consulting firms won't even look at you without at least a 3.5). My school is also considered semi-target for consulting, as in it's not Ivy League, but it's top 20 nationwide.


I feel like there were a host of other reasons that I just can't remember, but they all fell under doubts of:

1.) not being good enough

2.) if this drive was real

Consequently, I decided to do something I felt more confident that I could do better in: data science.


I figured that if I stuck it out for long enough, the drive would eventually come. It's been about 5 months, and here I am typing out how I have no passion for data science. 
I've tried making myself passionate by googling how data scientists change the world, but I can feel that its just not genuine and that I'm forcing myself to feel this way. It just doesn't come naturally like it did for consulting.


Side note, one of my dreams is to one day start my own company, and I feel like consulting would give a lot more background on that.

So what do you think reddit? Do you think I should stick to data science, or do you think I should do consulting?"

66u8ns,0,2017-04-22,Job search communication etiquette?,yahskapar,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/66u8ns/job_search_communication_etiquette/,"Rather recently I had a somewhat abrasive exchange via e-mail when inquiring about a position I had interviewed for two weeks ago and another similar position that had popped up. I'm not sure if I just caught this particular HR person on a bad day or what (it was Friday and I'm sure the end of the work week can feel heavy for some folks), but it was a very confusing experience for me.

I currently am a lab intern, now on a part-time basis, at a group within a pretty large semiconductor company that deals with lighting controls. Even in the past, I've sent pretty respectful e-mails inquiring for a status update about positions I've applied for or simply happen to have a few questions about. By no means do I demand a reply, and I'm not calling these folks on the phone or anything like that - just an e-mail.

I was told ""e-mailing multiple people at one company is a red flag for hiring"". I e-mailed two people, total, one about the past interview and one about a position I was interested in and wanted to learn more about. This company the HR fella represented is by no means small as well - it's a large, multinational computer company that has a pretty big grasp on storage technologies. 

I might be overthinking things, but **what are your rules for etiquette when communicating for a job search?** I always thought I was fine in that regard, but I'm beginning to wonder if I perhaps come across as too inquisitive. My individual job search so far this year hasn't been going all that well, and more or less I'm stuck in the same position that a family member helped me get an year ago. Also, is trying to reach out online too much a bad thing?

I feel extremely lost so I thought I would ask you all for help. I do use this platform a lot silently and it has helped me a lot, but I have never posted before. 

A bit about me, I am a 22 year old female, doing my Master's in Electrical Engineering from top University in USA. My original career plan was to follow Signal Processing.  But due to the freedom of choosing courses at my university I was lucky enough to get a Data Science and Signal Processing track and I absolutely fell in love with Data. 

So I ended up taking courses like Probability, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning etc. 

Now I am an international student here and ideally I should have a summer internship. I have applied wide and far, to more than 100+ internships. I am not even hearing back from them. I have lost hope for this summer because the deadline to submit my internship offer letter at my university is soon approaching (May 12th). 

I code in Python, and I will admit that I am not as fast as a traditional CS Student. However, I do write decent code, eventually. We never got enough exposure to programming in EE, during my bachelors back home in India. I have done a lot of projects (Kaggle, coursework etc) and have worked up on my Mathematics and Statistics. 

I know I am extremely hard-working and can adapt and learn really fast. I am just waiting for that one opportunity to click. I am scared too because I have already taken the leap of faith. I have spent $$$$ on this Master's and have abandoned my EE path. 

It seems almost impossible to crack Data Science without work experience, and I need some work experience to get started. How do I land an opportunity and prove my worth! 

Please any help, any advice, anything that steers my rocky boat in the right direction would greatly appreciate it. I want someone to believe in me and give me that chance :( 

EDIT - Thank you for the responses! You have no idea how much responses mean to me right now!"

But I had a phone interview recently for an internship that was somewhat unexpected so I had little time to prepare.

In any event, it was mostly generic questions about myself and despite knowing myself, I struggled to give answers. I don't know if this is an ADHD thing or an anxiety thing, but my mind just blanks. Plus, when it comes to a question like, ""outside of programming, what are your hobbies?"" it's hard to know what else to say. I have a ton of hobbies, but they come and go - but the computer-related hobbies have been persistent. I think I eventually just picked a couple of hobbies like playing music and reading.

My greatest question here is what should I consider to decide I want to pursue CS (I briefly had the interest but it's definitely a very difficult subject for me)?

I have the opportunity to intern for a company that uses AWS. If the internship goes well, I sense there is an opportunity to become their AWS System admin. I am targeting Sysadmin work, and IT management as my career path.

I have no experience whatsoever with AWS or other cloud based infrastructure however I am aware there are certifications that Amazon provides. The only issue is the pre-requisites for these certs all call for some hands on training which I am looking to learn independently before and concurrently with my internship. I am in the process of completing my Bachelors in Information Science, and I have a background that mostly consists of Windows Server administration, some linux and light networking. I am nearly done with all the core classes for the first 2 years of my bachelors, which included c++, database design, web design, and networking.

I work full time bartending while I goto school so the chance to possibly have normal full time work in the industry is extremely enticing.

2 Questions:
What skills, including core and ancillary, would a great AWS SysAdmin have and how do I get them (considering my current level of knowledge)?

What skills would I need to learn before becoming an AWS Architect?

2) Ling and CS - Since it's been a year from my last CS course I have to take summer classes and catch up for CS.

I went to job websites, labor statistics, my career center, and psychological counselors but I really have to decide before I enter junior year.

I basically did all the work for a month or two (It was web design/email marketing.) until they brought in a new manager. I was doing almost 3 peoples jobs for the pay you'd give to basically an intern. He decided that the art director should do my role and they should just fire me to save money. 

So the company that I busted my ass for, came in on weekends, got home at 6:30 a lot of times, and did everything in my power to make them money, sat me down and said, if you leave in a professional manner we are willing to let you pay 500 bucks a month to keep your health insurance. It took every amount strength not to jump over the table and strangle him by the neck. 

I had been using drugs to try and stay above water (Nothing serious really). But now I'm kinda 'coming down' so to speak. I was still kinda buzzing when I got the news so I was able to take it in stride. No that I'm sobering up, it's kinda hitting me. I wasn't even making enough money to move out of my parents house and now I have nothing. (I'm 28 years old). Without insurance, between meds and therapy, I'd be paying 500-1000 $ a month. I applied for unemployment and the shitty unemployment insurance the 'allowed' me, which is still $500 dollars a month I don't have. So before I even start thinking about moving into my own place, food, phone, car, etc. I have $500 dollars I have to pay.  

I've been so unhappy living in the midwest. I'm an artsy type and I don't fit in with all the townys that live here still. All my friends have moved away. I've wanted to move to a place like the coasts for as long as I remember. I can't even move down the street much less across the country. I don't have a gf or even a dog. Depression and anxiety have made my life extremely difficult but I busted my ass to try and 'make it'. It wasn't ideal at the job but at least it was a job. Now I once again have nothing. I have $1,500 to my name and I talked to my parents about moving out and living off unemployment till I find a job. And they basically said 'no freaking way that would work.' They can't support me either as they do okay but not well enough to pay for my living expenses and health insurance/meds. 

I'm 28 years old and I'm the same place I was in highschool. I've done everything in my power to try and overcome my circumstance and ultimately it got me no where. It would be okay if I was three years out of highschool but I graduated from highschool ten fucking years ago. I have no friends, no gf, no one hobbies, and no money. The idea of living on my own and supporting myself seems like a pipe dream. I gave it all I had but I can't do it anymore. It's not that I didn't try, I busted my ass. Years of trying and failing. I feel like this was the last straw. I'm done with anxiety, depression, all this nonsense. I don't want to hurt my family so I've thought about just taking my car and 'disappearing'. I'm tired of paying shit tons of money just to exist. And a fucking shitty existence at that. I'm tired of being a burden on my family. 

I literally can't face another family get together with my snobby aunts and uncles and tell them I got fired again. 

I used to have a drive inside me. Not all the time but it was there. like a flame or a fire, a purpose. Lately I can't feel it. And when it's not there anymore I feel like living is too much to bear. "

As of right now, I'm pretty sure that I want to go abroad next summer (after sophomore year), whether that be through a study abroad or an internship. Since CS is kinda the same everywhere, I'm not sure how beneficial academically taking classes at a foreign university would be (although I still believe it would be worth it for the cultural experience).  
  
An alternative I've been looking into would be to try and get an internship in a foreign country instead. However, I imagine there are a bit more roadblocks here: I'd be subject to foreign labor laws, as well as a larger language barrier. Since I only speak English, I think I'd probably be restricted to the UK and Ireland, unless the Latin-speaking Vatican has a burgeoning tech scene I'm not aware of.  
  
Is it even a realistic option to get a summer internship in another country? If so, would it be better to target companies based in the country, or should I focus mostly on American companies with a presence there? Are there any kind of visas or background checks I should try and get taken care of this summer so I'd actually be eligible to work there?"

How can I stop obsessing over success ?
u/tgpop
Hey guys, long story short, i'm a 23 year old male, and have had a whole host of anxiety issues (OCD, general anxiety, some mild depression thrown in there too for good measure).

I've been to therapy, am on meds (beta blockers to treat the physical symptoms of anxiety; some prozac to control the cognitive side of things) and yet, most of the time, I have a chronic state of tension and stress, and I believe it's due to early teen experiences.

I'll not go into too much detail, because If I do people will only pick apart what I'm saying. Basically when I was 14 I got very,very unhealthily addicted to stock trading/forex trading. Spent thousands of hours refining a method, and at one point when I was 18 was offered some money to trade. I turned that opportunity down because I felt way out of my depth and was burned out from forex and stock trading (for anyone involved in the markets, i'm sure you get what I mean, even as a swing trader it is impossible to fully switch off).

I guess ever since I give that opportunity up, I have always hated myself and the sense of regret is overwhelming. Every time I try and dabble back into the markets, I end up doing ok and all of a sudden (like now) , I just get absorbed totally by it again, and it's constantly on my mind.

So what have I done, aside from trading in the meantime? After I quit trading at 18,I actually had to take a year off before heading to university to build some confidence in myself.

Of course, I don't deny that brain chemistry plays a role here as well. Starting that year out at 18 I was suicidal and seriously burned out. I had stress-induced hair loss, insomnia etc. I was diagnosed with OCD and general anxiety at the time. No matter what self help book or therapist I went to said, I couldn't shake the anxiety or stress. What amazed me was that during that year out, I actually took a job in a busy subway store. And I freakin' loved it. worked 100+ hour weeks for months on end, became the stores youngest manager, learned the ins and outs of the fast food business. Didn't even care that it was minimum wage, it was just so satisfying to be an ace at something, no matter how 'petty' a subway store may seem.

I then went to university, focused on getting good grades, and told myself not to look at trading ever again. I came out with the top marks in my university year three years in a row, and landed a training contract with a big 4 accounting firm after not screwing up on a summer internship.

That's basically where I am now. I'm really enjoying accounting. But , still ongoing, is this pressure to succeed at business, trading,investing or something along those lines. I just can't shake this off, and whilst I know I do enjoy accounting, I really can't help lose this sense of self hatred and materialism.

I'm certain that my brain chemistry plays a massive role. And logically speaking, I would objectively say someone with my personality is probably suited to a stable, rewarding career with constant stimulation and challenging tasks. Despite that, it's just something I can't switch off, I literally cannot stop thinking about markets, trading, stocks, investing. Worse still, any time I do 'get back in' to it, I am completely in the zone, infatuated with the whole experience of trading.

I am just really confused to be honest. My OCD makes it very difficult to make decisions or come to conclusion on issues like this. On one hand, I can't keep myself in check or obsessing about markets when I do dabble in them. On the other hand, no matter how rewarding some other pursuit it, I am always trying to 'fill a hole' in one area or another. Heading into accounting? cool, let's make partner in 15 years. At the gym? Right, lets get super ripped and start a successful fitness business. Like working at subway? save up all your money and start a franchise-business.

I would really appreciate any help here. I just feel like a sack of shit if i'm not achieving something 'great'. I can literally not relax. If i'm not doing something productive I am stressed and down. I do not want to end up twice divorced and a depressed alcoholic at 40."

I seem to fall just short of certain positions and get outright ignored on others.

I'm in a very precarious monetary situation and I don't know what to do.

I like programming and was really hoping to get some junior developer position for low pay and have them help me with some of the more intricate parts of coding as I feel my basics are great and I'm decently aware of DSA/CtCI type stuff.

I would seriously take very low pay for the industry (even if it's just like $30k) if someone would be willing to deal with a slight learning curve. I'm in the Cincinnati area and can't move because of custody reasons, although Indianapolis or Chicago probably wouldn't cause huge issues.

Help!

I am currently a comp sci major in college, and I have the month of May free with classes ending and my internship starting in June. I have recently gotten really excited about JavaScript and have an application that I want to work on in that month for fun, learning, and because I think it could be freaking cool.  

Getting to my issue, so I have the idea, and have a lot of the drafting of looks, features, implementation, and have dabbled with the code a bit. I have never really worked with JavaScript(or any real web development before which I think is part of the issue) however I am confident in my ability to code, and to pick up new languages and technologies via documentation and such. 

Now that I have narrowed my what I'm looking for down a bit here is my main issue. I have no idea how to set up the project! I know that JavaScript Fatigue is a thing and I think that is part of the problem, 

I know some of the technologies I want to use

 * TypeScript: for OOP because that is what I am comfortable with and it makes more sense to me from a scalability point of view.
 * React: because I like the portability of it with its use of VirtualDoms which allow you to use JS on any device(mobile, etc.). 
 * Draft.js: because that is the nature of the project, at its core I want to build a text editor/ WYSIWYG editor 
 * Electron: Because building desktop apps in JS is pretty fricken sweet(as far as I am aware this is kind of unrelated to my question but I don't know if I know enough about my question to be sure of that)

So back to the question, how do I build the project? Or, another way to look at it is, how do I learn to build the project?

I usually am able to get by with google searches, docs., and good old SO but every guide/tutorial/reference i look at tells me a different way to get it to work with the technologies that they like or use. To a certain extent I am able to trace how things are put together from example to example but I can't combine the example using TypeScript to the one using Draft to the one using Draft plugins. One person tells me to use Brunch to build it then the next thing I look at is using Webpacks and the change in the base foundation throws me off (this is an example my question is more general). 

I have used reddit for forever but have never posted anything so let me know if I missed anything or should change anything. Honestly this whole thing frustrated me so much I almost dropped the idea but decided to go out on a limb and ask for help instead.

Any help is greatly appreciated, and thank you in advance!"

1.Is phone support reputable for baby's first IT job or should I take a contract position to get better experience doing systems facing work

2.If I do take this phone support job as it would be full time non contract would it be more beneficial to pursue certifications or a bachelor's degree (I have no certs under my belt now)

I have been close to two of them (let's call them A and B) since high school, while I have known the third (C) since last year.

Roommates A and C are both in Computer Science, while roommate B is in Computational Mathematics. I am the only one in the apartment who's not focusing in software. A and B don't necessarily have the best GPAs, but they have plenty of experience to make up for it while staying humble about their skills. Both have internships lined up for the summer. From my side, I have a modest amount of experience (including an internship) along with a fairly high GPA, and also generally don't talk about them without being asked. After graduation, we all plan on working in industry.

C, on the other hand, intends to pursue a PhD in CS, focusing in machine learning. To be fair, he *does* have a lot of research experience, has won a few research awards, and even has his name on a paper. However, his GPA is around a 2.5, and his work ethic towards most things not related to his research is... well, rather subpar. Yet he often speaks with complete confidence that he'll be accepted into a top-tier graduate program like Stanford or MIT.

All the while, he has consistently expressed his dislike of engineers (for who knows what reason?) and comes across as if anyone not interested in software, or even machine learning specifically, is beneath him. And for someone who hasn't yet had an internship, he is *really* picky about who he wants to work for. He's had a few interviews, but no offers. Meanwhile, he dismisses entire companies for ""not being innovative,"" even some pretty well-regarded ones. Elon Musk is his idol, which is all well and good, except for the fact that he views those who aren't willing to work 60+ hours a week at SpaceX, Tesla, and the like as not being passionate enough, not hardworking, etc. Implying people like A,B, and myself.

With me personally, among plenty of other things over the months, he's tried to lecture me on how to learn math ""properly"" despite me already having taken more math classes than he ever has to. I've made that previous fact clear, yet he acts seemingly surprised that I can help B out with calculus here and there. The thing that pissed me off the most was last summer, when he flat-out told me that I'm not cut out for doing research when I expressed reservations about my technical ability. Incidentally, I've been working on a research project throughout this semester.

I could go on with other minor sources of frustration, but this post is already pretty long. A and B have had their share of ""personal"" incidents as well, and between the three of us, we're all tired of C's lack of humility and general attitude about things. We used to gently express our opinions (oh yeah, C is also really short-tempered), and C would almost always double down on his position. Occasionally he would try to backpedal when he realized he was speaking (i.e. arguing) from flimsy grounds.

Nowadays, the three of us just nod along and pretend to agree with C because it's just not worth the effort to argue with him. We kept our grievances to ourselves for the longest time, but now openly vent about C when he's not around. As much as I hate to say it, it's rather cathartic for us. However, it's also kind of sad that C has this attitude, and will most likely be disappointed by whatever ends up happening. Naturally, we have decided to renew our leases and live together again next year since we're all ""friends.""

Do y'all have any advice on how to deal with this situation? Should the three of us be more firm with our skepticism, or just forever hold our peace?

TL;DR: cocky roommate, should roommates and I continue to let him be a cock?"

Feel free to comment any observations, thoughts, or what you would do in general - I would love you forever. 

For some context, I'm an international student who wants to get a degree in computer science. I want to work either in the U.S. Canada, or the EU. But I'm leaning towards Canada at the moment because they seem to pay higher wages than in EU. While not having many of the issues that are prominent ion the U.S. I have an EU and Mexican Citizenship so I can somewhat work in both spaces, its more about finding the right job (NAFTA, please don't die).  These are my current options. The only school I have to hear back from is U Waterloo, but that's after the 1st of May. 

* UBC (27,000 USD/With Living) - I like this university, I like Vancouver, its reputation (Top 30 for CS) and the awards they gave me. Although, what I'm worried about is that getting into CS is very competitive, and it's a drop out school. Moreover, I have this feeling in the back of my head telling me that it's not that good of a school because some people from my school - who are my friends and I don't like that I have this opinion - also got in, despite them not caring about school resulting in low grades. On the other hand, UBC does have a good CO-OP (Paid Internship) programme which is something that I want to take part in. - I have to decide the 1st of May.

* UofT (37,000 USD/ With Living) I may get some awards - For me, UofT seems like a more expensive UBC, in Toronto, and with the better reputation. I don't think their CS program is significantly better than UBC's. I got into their honours programme which allows me to take part in their CO-OP. Although it's the same as UBC's. My cousin also studies there, and I'm fond of him, so that would be a plus. My only worry is that its the most expensive choice. - I have to decide the 1st of May.

* University of Glasgow (37,000 USD/With Living) 3 Years, I may get some awards - I mainly like Glasgow because they are offering me a Masters degree in 3 years. Within the UK they are in the top 10 for CS, but worldwide they are nowhere near the 'rankings' of UBC or UofT. Moreover, if I want to work in Canada or the U.S., I think it would be harder for me to work there since the yearly salary for a cs graduate is on average 30,000 USD less a year. I belive that a masters would help me in my career, and at the moment I think that I would pursue one. However, that might change. I have to decide in July :3.

674ww0,2,2017-04-23,Financial audit to CS,iKorAX,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/674ww0/financial_audit_to_cs/,"Hi everyone,


So I am in a bit of a crossroads situation right now. I work at one of the Big 4 auditing companies (kpmg, ey, pwc, deloitte) - this will be my second season in auditing. I have graduated with a BA in business administration in Dec 2014. I am 22 now, turning 23 this year.


Cutting to the chase: I am not bad at my job - in fact, I'm one of the better associates my office has (not my own opinion - the general opinion of the superiors that I have worked with). I did an internship straight out of college, then tried and quit a Master's degree (I'm in Europe, it's not essential for any certifications etc.). 


Fast-forward to October 2016 - I get the job that I currently have. The busy season, which is due to be over around the next two weeks, went really well for me. However, at some point, it just hit me that this whole ""easiness"" is simply because this job is like playing with easy-level bots. The busy season is like playing with 100 easy bots instead of 10 - the job is easy, it's the volume that kills.


I also find the job extremely boring. Basically, can't wait for the moment that it gets automated, which I'm sure is possible despite what folks in accounting think. So, I want out, and it is perhaps a question of when, not whether.


The point is: I've always wanted to go into CS. Due to a lot of unfavorable circumstances, both within and out of my reach, I chose to do the business degree. Now, however, I'm in a position where I have enough money to last two full years without a job. I am 22. I have coded some simple stuff in the past (Pascal and Delphi in high school) and was into web design (HTML and CSS). I have recently signed up for a 6-week course in programming, where they are showing/will show us some beginner stuff in C#, Java, JS, CSS, HTML. I like programming and am a computer enthusiast in general (as in, since secondary school, I've been reading up on how computers work, how to fix them, why things in computers happen the way they do, etc.).


What I think I could do:


1. The firm that organizes these courses can help us get interviews with potential employers. I might be able to use that, maybe get some unpaid internship or something. I could start from there and build skills.


2. I am also considering a complete overhaul and going to college for a second bachelor's degree. There is a college that will allow me to do that and will provide foundation courses in physics, algebra and engineering before I start studying for the degree. I am certain money is not going to be the problem - I am thinking, I could do summer work in the U.S. for the first years and then start looking into summer CS internships etc. as I get the much-needed theoretical base.


The question:


Are there any flaws in my ideas, other than ditching my first degree and taking the loss time-wise? Is there anyone who has been in a similar situation? Is a second bachelor's degree a good idea? I don't mind the time that I'll have to spend doing it - I'll still have like 35-40 years for work afterwards, might as well bite the bullet now."
6750r1,5,2017-04-23,Need advice: conflicted about college choice.,10footnotes,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6750r1/need_advice_conflicted_about_college_choice/,"I lurk on A2C a lot and the people here are generally helpful, smart, and nice, so I'm hoping to get some good advice to factor into my decision :)

Some quick background about myself as an applicant, I guess: 1450 SAT, 4.1 W GPA (don't know my UW, but all A-range grades except one B+ freshman year). 4 total APs, the rest honors. In the top 5-ish % of my class. Decent ECs.

So, the problem: I applied to just one college this application cycle, and am now regretting it. I got accepted early to Emerson for Creative Writing, and basically sat on my laurels after December 15th. I'm lucky enough to have a college fund, and that combined with scholarships actually made Emerson affordable. I thought a bit about applying to other places, but Emerson was my top choice and no one expected me to apply elsewhere, so I didn't. And in November, Emerson was really all I wanted. 

However, I feel like I'm different now than I was in the fall. I'm doing better in some classes than I expected (A+ in Honors Calc and AP Physics), and I'm more engaged in my English class than I've ever been. I'm more outspoken and more confident in who I am and what I can do, and because of that, my academic goals have expanded. I don't just want to study Creative Writing, though I love it - I want to explore other fields and almost certainly double major. I've realized that I honestly like learning and applying knowledge, and I don't want to be (hopefully) good at just one thing.  But Emerson is a school for communications and arts and not much else. There's gen eds and minors, but still a limited array of topics to study and not many options for double majoring. I'm afraid that if I go to Emerson, I'll miss out on academic/career opportunities that I would have loved but haven't considered so far. 

The most important part is that I'm disappointed that I didn't challenge myself during the application process. I only applied to one school, one which I had a high chance of acceptance at. No more matches, and no reaches. I didn't think about academically challenging myself either: I considered a double major, but just as an afterthought. Now I'm stuck thinking ""What if?"", and I kind of hate it. 

I'm currently considering whether to take a gap year or go to Emerson, which I'm desperate for advice on. Also, bless you if you've gotten this far, since this is already longer than I thought it'd be. 

Go to Emerson in the fall. 

- Pros: I love its location. The community is passionate about their majors and there are extracurricular opportunities surrounding them. Merit scholarships make it barely affordable. No uncertainty about college this summer/fall.

- Cons: No opportunities for in-depth study of non-comm/arts subjects. Not as academically challenging as I might want. Doubting myself. 

- I know I would have the option to transfer if I don't like Emerson. I'm kind of apprehensive about that (maybe I shouldn't be?), but it's an option.

Take a gap year and reapply to colleges. 

- During a gap year, I would reapply (after lots of research, and to multiple colleges this time), get a job and/or internship, volunteer, take some MOOCs, retake the SATs and take subject tests, write a lot, get back into a business I started, travel in the spring, do other fun stuff purely for myself, maybe confront some fears and/or found a local cultural or volunteer group. 

- Pros: Not be doubting myself about college. Have some new experiences and learn new things, and hopefully grow as a person. Explore other academic options.

- Cons: I saw someone (maybe /u/Ask_Admissions) mention that gap year freshmen get less financial aid than hs seniors, which is concerning. If this is accurate, why and generally how much less? I'm also worried that I wouldn't do enough during the year, although that might motivate me even more. The big question is: would I be taking a gap year for the right reasons?

- I don't think loss of academic momentum would be a problem. I'd work to make sure this didn't happen.  

- Having an entire year of my life for myself is a pro and a con. I don't have a lot of worldly experience, and a gap year would be valuable for that. However, it's also a whole year that I can't get back if I don't spend it well. 

I've talked to my guidance counselor and my parents about this, and they seem to be trying to make me feel better about Emerson (but will support me either way). Logically, Emerson is probably the better choice, but there's a part of me that resists that and wants to take a gap year. Part of that is because when I'm not worried about it, a gap year sounds appealing. Part of it might come from seeing the motivation on here and being frustrated with myself for being complacent when I know I can do more - in applications and in my general goals. If I can't decide by May 1st, I'll probably put the deposit down but keep thinking about whether to withdraw before tuition payment. Besides losing the deposit, are there any consequences to this? Oh, and I know deferrals are possible, but I don't think I could defer because I'd be applying to other colleges as well.

Yikes, this post was really long, sorry about that. I tend to overthink and heavily research and plan things, so this has been a bit of a nightmare and I have no idea how I'm going to decide. If anyone could please give me advice, I'll be seriously grateful."

I am a white male in my penultimate year at one of the best universities in the US, majoring in Finance, and Computer Science. I learned the basics of Finance when I was 15, and have been trading financial derivatives since I was 16.

In the past 2 years, I applied to 156 internships, from small investment firms to large institutions. I was interviewed 3 times. My best friends and roommates, African-Americans, and latinos, have applied to less than 10 and received multiple offers. We have a pretty similar background, so I was happy for them, but when a girlfriend of ours got three offers from a big investment bank, while knowing close to nothing about the industry and studying communication, I was pissed. 

I understand why governments encourage companies to increase diversity, but this is getting imbalanced. 

So here I am, a year from graduating, having to work again in a retail store selling shoes, while everyone is moving to NYC, making over $30 an hour, doing a job I would be 10x better at.

Rant over. Thank you. 

Tldr: white male with significant background in the industry applying to 156 internships, no offers, African-Americans, women, latinos, getting multiple offers when they barely looked. "

675yv1,10,2017-04-23,Oculus Dei,_Oshun_,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/675yv1/oculus_dei/,"It arrived three days after the [9guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/63zugp/the_9guys/)
, pouring up from the desert location from which those nine monsters had disappeared and coming together like hardening tar. It rose from the sand, bubbling and congealing until a hard exoskeleton was formed. Four long limbs ending in points sharp enough to impale jutted angularly from a long, black, wasp-like torso. The column of its neck rose from this obsidian, insect-like body, ending below an angular head marked only with a single, equally black orb of an eye.  
  
It paused, standing like a lone sentry under the blistering sun, until, after a few hours, it began to slowly make its way west, knifelike arms folded in front of it like a praying mantis’. The sharp points where its feet should have been sunk a few feet into the sand with each deliberate step. After about 10 such steps, it dropped down to all fours, crawling forward in a jerking, uncoordinated fashion, growing smaller as it moved with the sun. This was where the video feed ended, and I watched the stony faces of my colleagues, looking for any sort of reaction. There was none, too many of us desensitized after the previous anomaly.  
  
 I glanced over at my partner standing next to me. He looked defeated. He’d been trying to scrub a video of a draining in Singapore from the internet to no avail. The video kept being re-uploaded to a large online forum dedicated to exposing hidden videos of humanoid creatures. Words like “skinwalkers” and “greys” were being thrown around. It was some consolation to most in the room that they hadn’t guessed the true nature of the 9guys.  
   
Just like with the 9guys, no hint of this new creature could be detected by any of our officers and stations or by countries that have partnered with us since the original anomaly. At least, not until recently. We were alerted by Canadian officials that they had the creature in custody and were hoping to transfer him to a more secure facility in the U.S. where both countries could study it. Energy readings showed this creature was only slightly less powerful than any one of the 9guys were, giving off enough energy to power a small city. How they’d managed to keep this creature secured, I wanted to know. Though a nagging thought at the back of my mind told me that the creature was staying just where it wanted to be.  
   
The transfer was relatively simple, given the circumstances. I can’t, of course, disclose exactly where our lab was located, but I’m sure my friends in the Mid-West might be uneasy knowing this creature was being held (allowing itself to be?) in their region. Either way, this creature, who our obnoxiously Catholic biologist overseeing this project was calling “Oculus Dei,” or 0D, was now property of the U.S. government. I was able to see it briefly. It was in a cell deemed indestructible, which seemed a bit too optimistic for me once I had a close view of the creature inside. Through a tiny slit of a window, I saw the 0D, with a blindfold over its single, large eye, sitting curled in on itself like a dead roach. It was still as a statue, and I began to fear it was dead, until I thought I saw one of its arms move perhaps a fraction of an inch. I stared, watching, holding my breath, but I saw no more movement.  
   
I was pulled away by the biologist, who had further tests to run. So far, samples taken from the 0D were inconclusive. It had no DNA like creatures of this world, no blood, no obvious genitals to determine sex. I was told the creature had ceased moving, all parts of its body still except for that eye, which moved from side to side in a manic way, much too fast to be registering what it was seeing. The blindfold came after an incident with a young intern named David, whose family was told that he died due to exposure to samples of a rare virus and whose silence was bought.  
   
He had snuck in to see the OD, most likely having heard whispers from higher ups. Footage from the lab’s cameras showed him staring at the creature for almost a half hour before dropping to the ground. This intern was my next stop in the facility. He had remained unconscious for days after the incident, until on the 7th day, when he opened his now-blind eyes and began to mouth words silently. He had not stopped since, now four days later, ceasing to sleep or eat. Pictures I’d seen of him reminded me of the pictures I’d seen of Japanese who had witnessed the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, eyes blinded from the flash of the nuclear bombs.  
   
I had with me my secretary, Bonnie, who grew up deaf before receiving cochlear implants. She was still adept at reading lips, and I hoped she would be able to help me understand what this poor boy was silently telling us. She had been filled in only on what she needed to know, and, to her credit, did not seem too shocked by what she was seeing. She started to speak to him gently, letting him know we were by his bed, but stopped when she realized he showed no sign of hearing us. She put her bag down, pulled up a chair, and nodded to me before turning back to the young man. She focused on his lips for what felt like hours, and I held my breath when she turned to me, only to be disappointed when she asked for a pen and pad. I quickly handed both to her, and waited patiently while she wrote down all she could. She finished a half hour later, simply telling me that he’d started the whole story again and asking if we had a department for records or history.  
   
As it was getting late, we rushed down to the cramped little office where my partner set up a makeshift research department on the Rapture and various religious texts about the end of days. Bonnie shoved the sheets of paper she had written on into the hands of one of the sleepy men pouring over a book full of what looked like Hebrew characters and told him what was on this paper was urgent and to have a copy typed, with footnotes explaining names, sent to me by morning. The young man took the sheets from her and looked to me, and I nodded to back up Bonnie’s statements. He started skimming the sheets handed to him, eyebrows raising as his right hand reached blindly for the laptop next to him.  
   
We left him at that point, and I didn’t sleep a wink that night, continuously checking my email for any information on what David might have been saying. The answer came around 4 A.M., just a short transcription attached to an email with no body. I impatiently waited for the attachment to download, and what I saw before me merely served to confuse me more:  
  
*“The Watchers of God came down in the days of Jared and came to stay on Mount Hermon, two hundred in all tasked to watch over the humans of the earth. Yomiel fell to the temptation as the others fell, entering unnatural marriages with human women and turning his back on the Lord of Light. The two hundred begat the Nephilim, giants who began to pillage the earth. But, God sent a flood, to rid the earth of the Nephilim, and He bound the Watchers in the valleys of the earth until Judgment Day. In everlasting chains of darkness they were bound, but my lord Yomiel awoke first, and now awake, has conceived an impossible thought, to place his throne higher than the Lord of Light’s.”*  
  
I stared at the words on the screen, reading them over and over again. It seemed my partner had been right. The 9guys were only the beginning. I began to imagine a future where more creatures, each more terrifying than the next, rising up from the ground, appearing from thin air, descending upon us as we humans, small and weak, could only watch, helpless against these unknown nightmare beings. I wish that was where my story ended, that even if I left you with the unknown, this could be as bad as our time here post-Rapture has become thus far. The majority of you, those who don’t have contact with higher-level government officials, who go to your jobs, who occasionally skim the news, who go home to your families and continue to live out the monotony, won’t see the difference in our ending world until it’s too late to protect you. I wish I could say you were in good hands, but we don’t know what we’re doing, especially now that the Oculus Dei disappeared.  
   
Yes, my hunch was correct. That thing could have left at any time it wanted, and it did. By that time, I had gotten numerous files on the Watchers and the Nephilim, read about the rapes of human women, the monsters they produced, learned how they whispered into the ears of humans, spreading false information and terrible truths. Any false information I see flash across screens, now, debates over whether this politician did this or this world leader said that, I wonder if it’s that thing trying to poison us, to divide us, to rule over us.  
   
My partner called me up yesterday, our lab on the West Coast is holding a woman who seems to be suffering from the same stupor that poor, young David is. Her eyes are an unseeing white, just like him, lips ever moving in a silent litany, just like him, and this woman is pregnant, quite unlike our David.

I am 20 years old, just finished my Sophomore year of college (second year of university). The language that I am learning through the school is Java with a little background in C++. Unlike most people I know or have talked too, this has been my first year learning anything programming related, so I feel a little overwhelmed and behind. Even though I finished my second year I still have 3 more because I declared my major late. 

So right now I could use some advice help make some decisions. I really want to learn Python, but I know it would be better to improve my Java first so I'm not learning two languages at the same time. Also, I figure that it will increase my job market having multiple languages under my belt. I don't know if I just get a part time job in the summer and dedicate more time to programming, Get a full time job and not be able to dedicate much time to programming, or take a summer off to better my skills? I know that working looks good on resumes, but how help full is it really when it has nothing to do with what you are studying? My goal is to get an internship, but most places near my school require you to be finished with your junior year of the major you are studying (another 2 years still for me). My parents want me to be working full time in the summer, and are pushing me towards a landscaping style job because that is what my brother and I have always done growing up and it is supposed to instill good work ethic (which it does). I just feel like it isn't going to benefit me as much for my future at this point in my life.  Really any advice would be awesome because I really just feel overwhelmed and my parents are not a huge fan of me always sitting behind a computer, so it is hard for them to help advice me on what will be best. They don't understand that just doing work at school wont necessarily prepare me for a job. Software Development is pretty much my end goal.

Right?


WRONG. Reality hit me like a freighter truck. For example, I didn't do laundry. I gained ~30 pounds. Didn't shave. Classes were *hard* (I still *really* hate Scheme and all derivations of Lisp as a programming language but I digress). Failed two courses, barely scraped by in Gen Ed Bio and Microeconomics, and ended up with a 1.28 GPA for the first time in my life.


This semester; I knew things needed to change. Bad. I signed up with a mentorship program, changed my entire way of life, diet included, and committed myself to change.


And whaddya know, this semester is looking to be one of my best ever; with a GPA looking well into the 3s and to top it all off I was just admitted into Yale New Haven Hospital's IT Summer Internship program.


So; I just wanted to say another example of ya'll can do this. If you set your mind to doing whatever, you can do it. Especially as finals approach for a lot of us.

I've accepted an internship offer from a Big N bank to intern as a quant and I'm crazy excited for it. I graduate in December with a BSc. in CS and I wanted to make my internship this summer challenging so I applied to companies that I thought were out of my reach. I've sorta made it into one &amp; now wondering if I'm cut out for this. I interned last summer as Software Dev. at a name brand company but without super technical interviews. 
&amp;nbsp;

Over the past couple months I studied &amp; interviewed with Big N tech and unicorns only to not meet any of their hiring bars. This happened frequently for 7 months (it sucked but i didn't let it get me down though). The road to this job offer consisted of several interviews in 2 days. Stats related questions, brainteasers from Discrete Math, and behavioural q's. I fumbled on 2/3 brainteasers, felt mediocre on the Stats q's but pulled my weight on the behavioural part. Two interviews simply felt like discussions based on my interests with how I play with data. 
&amp;nbsp;

I love manipulating numbers to find relationships/patterns but I can't help but feel like I'm in over my head with this lol. I don't know if I'm the ideal candidate. I enjoy classes that munge and leverage data especially with Stats but the theory of it all comes at a slower pace to me. I have no Finance knowledge either. I graduate in a few months so a return offer would be unreal. The women/men on my team all have Masters &amp; Ph.D's so I think they'll expect golden work from me. Pretty nervous about this whole thing so I wanted to get some info here
&amp;nbsp;

My questions to you guys: 
&amp;nbsp;

Will I be able to pick the Stats/Finance knowledge on the job? I didn't take any Finance courses as electives and I'm going over my Stats notes again though 
&amp;nbsp;

Is there a lot of programming (comparable to software devs)? I was told I would be using Python/R. 
&amp;nbsp;

How are the work hours?
&amp;nbsp;

Finally, would any quants that started as devs and vice versa mind giving their pros &amp; cons of FinTech?

I was extremely lucky to have landed an internship role at this company because I feel as though I don't deserve it in the first place and here's why:

I've scraped through my grades over the past few years but mind you, I am an ambitious person and still hope for good grades even if it is still my last chance. I only got this internship role by pure luck - a recommendation from my tutor. 

My interview with the company manager was done on a Skype call, and I kid you not, I was a train wreck throughout it, but since my camera doesn't work, I couldn't see his face but can only hear his voice. 

Every time he speaks, I can tell that he is very intelligent, mature and well-spoken. I, on the other-hand, always sound extremely nervous. I can't think straight every time I say something to him, I end up mumbling, breathing heavily and jumble my words every time because I'm scared that he might think of me as some dimwit who won the lottery for the intern role. 

Because of this, I always hear an awkward silence from him every time I end my retarded - sentences, which makes me feel so inferior and anxious. I have to do something about it, but I don't know how.

Does anyone get nervous when talking to someone you haven't even met in person but have to work with on Skype?? Gonna need some advice, guys!

Thanks,
LP.

I've been doing a bit of research on what Data Science really is, as I was quite clueless before. To preface, I have a good knowledge of C and fairly good knowledge of Python (I've built a couple web crawlers and smallish scripts/petty programs for fun). So I have a somewhat decent grasp of programming but I know data science is a whole different ballgame.

I really want to do my best to not be the incompetent newbie who'll need everything explained to him(although I'm sure I'll still need alot to be explained) but I would like to have some miniscule advantage where I could at least say ""Oh, I've learned a bit about that"" so I'm not completely clueless. Basically, what books van I read, what projects can I work on, what software or languages should I learn, so my supervisor can look at me and say ""hey this kid's done his homework."" 

I'd contact my supervisor directly to ask him ahead of starting this internship but the recruiter told me they'd give me that info a few weeks before the job starts in early June. So in the meantime I'd like to get a leg up,if possible, and I was hoping maybe sone fellow data scientists/supervisors could tell me what they'd recommend a new recruit to do/learn.

Any feedback is appreciated, thank you.

Tldr: starting data science internship, what can I learn to ""be ahead"" of expectations?"

(My Story),mrbak3r,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/679ydg/it_can_get_better_my_story/,"I struggled with social anxiety for the better part of the last three years. It started my Sophomore year in college. I would begin to get anxious over little things like hanging out or going out to dinner with my friends. It got really bad within the past year. It was at the point where I would be to0 scared to go anywhere because of my anxiety. If I did venture out to have dinner with a friend it wasn't uncommon for me to throw-up at some point due to the anxiety.

I finally said enough is enough this past fall when I decided to go to the counseling center at my school. I enrolled in a group therapy session once a week for the semester and I was surprised at how much it helped me. I was finally able to open up to people without fear of judgment or a lack of interest. Towards the end of the semester, the group members all said that they have seen my progression through the semester and that really hit home for me. 

I was able to turn my life around from the shithole that it was to a successful life after graduation. I interviewed for an internship with ZERO anxiety. I wasn't even sweating. A few months before I would have been a hot mess preparing for that interview. It's like my anxiety just disappeared out of thin air. I'm not sure if I just learned how to manage it, or some other reason, but I didn't think I'd see a 180 that fast. 

Now I know everybody is different, but I never thought I would overcome my anxiety and here I am. Stay strong everybody! Take a group session if you can, even if it gives you anxiety just thinking about it! 

I'm sorry about the long post but I just wanted to share my story!"

I've realized that I have an issue: what I am going to do after I finish my undergrad. I've been betting on going into academia, but I don't think I should put all of my eggs in that basket. I'm an average 3.0 student and don't have any papers or research experience as of yet, so this is currently unrealizable. I am interested in the theory of computer science. I don't care a lot about money, but having a stable decent paying job after graduation would be a plus.

Here are a few options I've thought about:

Option 1: Take classes this summer and put everything into studying for my research-oriented class this upcoming fall. Pray to god I can publish a paper, ace GREs, get into a decent-ish grad school --- graduate spring 2018.

Option 2: Drop everything, find any technology job for this summer. Drop research class and take something practical instead. Graduate spring 2018. Hopefully get a job? Apply to grad school a few years later.

Option 3: Take classes this summer and fall, focus more on working on personal projects, do an internship, or two, next summer or spring. Graduate fall 2018 and apply to grad school then. Get a job after graduation and work until grad school starts. Maybe defer grad school a year.

I realize whichever path I take it will take a lot of work. I don't really have any substantial projects under my belt other than class projects. As I mentioned, I have no research experience either. I'm a mediocre student I mostly just get B's in all of my classes. This is my situation and it's mostly my fault. I'd really like to correct it. I also haven't networked very much. I'm been looking at jobs and many require a list of references. I don't have three people who could serve as references. I'm trying to get the most out of my next year or two.

About two weeks ago, I finally got an email back for one of the internships I applied to (finally!). We set the interview at campus and it just happened last week. However, there were a lot of things about the company that set off red flags.

The moment the interviewer said the internship was unpaid, I cringed. Without giving too much info, they're a startup that's focused on selling green living products. I can understand that startups may not have a lot of money to go around, but it still seems messed up how they're not paying ANY of their engineering interns. Especially since my tasks would be designing the product on Solidworks or working on the LED lights with an arduino. That would mean I would be helping the company make money, which means this is super illegal. 

I'm also concerned about the lack of structure. The interviewer said I would have to contribute a minimum of 5 hours a week to the internship. When I asked how would they measure my hours, they said they would measure my progress on a task. Every week I would be given a task from the main engineering intern, and I would take however long I would need to take to complete it. They said it wouldn't matter whether it would be a few days or a few weeks. As long as I'm doing something. It just sounds like a very vague way to measure hours. I would also have to attend once a week meetings with the head engineering intern.

Overall, I'm not feeling the company too much, and they just recently sent an email saying I got the job. However, the only reason I'm considering the offer is because this may be the only offer I get for the summer. I haven't taken most of the important classes for my major yet (like Dynamics or Mechanics and Solids) and I barely know Solidworks, Autocad, Matlab, or any other programs or languages. I realize I'm not very marketable, so this may be the only chance I can get professional experience this summer. I know as an under-qualified engineering student even I deserve better than this, but maybe I should suck in my pride and accept the offer so I have something to put on my resume. 

I plan to bring this up to my career counselor this week, but I also want to know what you guys think (especially if you've been in this position before).

TL;DR: should I accept an unpaid position from a startup just for a resume builder? "

I'm about to complete my sophomore year. My GPA is below average (2.875) and I haven't learned a thing since I got there. I'm not really sure what I want to even do after school. My main focus before school was to be a web developer and I thought I needed a computer science degree for it and never really looked into it. Then I was looking at jobs the other day and most of them don't require a degree or let alone one in CS. I just feel like since I got here I'm only learning about the theory of computers and nothing really about what I want to do. I guess I didn't even realize what a CS degree was. I don't really have anytime to work on projects anymore because of classes and I'm becoming a worse programmer. I was fortunate enough to have a large enough college fund to pay for everything and a little left over.  I have a job, but I don't really need it. And to be real it's maybe 2 hours a week while getting paid for 20. (I work for web support and help departments with their department sites so I do nothing really). To cut straight to it I basically want to make at least $50,000 a year if that’s even possible without a degree. I have done freelancing and I made about $500 a week which is nothing basically, but I ran out of time with all my classes. But I was happier doing that. So I’m just wondering what I should do. I’m not really sure if I’m going to keep passing my classes here. I was thinking about switching to an easier college, but didn’t know if that would affect my chances of getting a good job. My goal would be to just get some internships and then try to get a enough experience to get a full time job. With that I would also have my college fund as cash, or I could give it back to my parents.

I am currently a senior at a big state university right here in the good old USA. I supposed I’m asking for advice, guidance, as well as personal stories that tell me maybe I’m not alone.

I never liked school, and in fact I failed high school and almost didn’t graduate. I took the ACT and got a 32, so I think I had the baseline intelligence to go to college but not the desire. My parents, bless them, made me go and I am truly grateful, however all 4 years here have been a struggle. I am currently a senior with one summer and one fall semester to go before I graduate, but I still feel lost and incapable. 

I bounced between majors before finally settling on a double major in philosophy and anthropology with a couple minors. I enjoy them on a personal level but I have NO desire to go into academia. I want to want to, if that makes sense, because I do enjoy the fields, but I just don’t like school!! Grad school isn’t an option for me anyway. I have failed at least 4 classes since I’ve been here and truly struggled in the others and my GPA is around a 2.7. 

I don’t know why I do so poorly in school. I think it’s probably a time management thing, as well as a work ethic thing, as well as lack of focus. It doesn’t help that I have worked at least one job, sometimes two, since I’ve been in school. So here is how it typically goes for me: start the semester strong, make good grades on tests and projects, but as the semester goes on I lose energy and focus and fail to turn in end of the semester projects/papers. And then I start to freak out and procrastinate even more, then pull all nighters and turn in subpar work (if I turn it in at all).

(I suspect there are some mental health issues at play here, I was diagnosed as bipolar at the age of 18 however I’m not sure how accurate that diagnosis is. I never sought treatment. I don’t want to use that as an excuse anyhow). 

I don’t know what I’m going to do when I graduate. With a degree in a humanity and a social science I don’t think I’m really qualified for anything. And I still don’t really know what I want to DO. I have a little volunteer work and two internships on my resume, but besides that all I have is my food service gigs and crappy GPA. I do have things I’m interested in (wellness/fitness, outdoor recreation, organic farming, environmental conservation, creative writing) and all I really want to do is help people. But I feel like I don’t have skills to effectively do that. I would love to join some organization like Teach for America, Americorps, or the Peace Corps but I don’t think I will be accepted.

I regret so much about my college experience. I haven’t even enjoyed myself! I have made some friends but don’t exactly have a burgeoning social life and have spent a lot of time here very depressed and anxiety ridden. I feel like I’ve wasted so many opportunities.I honestly just don’t feel capable of anything. How have I spent 4 years here and not figured this whole thing out?!

The worst part is, due to my double major, failed classes, and general bullshitting around, I have to take 18 hours in the summer and 18 hours (of 4000 level classes) in the fall to graduate in December! I know that sounds insane but I have to get out of here. I don’t want to spend another semester in school that I don’t have to. But the full sprint ahead is so stressful I can’t focus on my finals now. 

Ugh. Anyone else a humanity/social science major with a low GPA? Any advice? Words of consolation? Or a verbal kick in the ass? I’ll take what I can get. "

What should be my next steps given my background, and are my goals realistic?** 

Hey /r/cscareerquestions, I come again looking for advice given my recent departure from academia. Here's a little bit about me and my current situation:

* 24/F/Northeast US
* Education: BA Linguistics, MA Applied Linguistics w/ a focus on computational linguistics, dropped out in my 1st year of a PhD program in Information Science and Technology
* Why I left the PhD: Struggles w/ chronic and mental health aren't compatible with an academic lifestyle, boredom and frustration with classwork and research, realized I applied because I thought I needed to in order to get a job and the real world seemed scarier. I see myself possibly going back in the future but for now I really need to find myself and what I'm passionate about again. I have been in school for almost 20 years straight and I just need a break for a bit. 

* Areas of interest: natural language processing, machine learning, AI, data science, information visualization, applied corpus linguistics, social computing, tech for good, anything with lots of data but I'm also interested in wed development and have been interested in D3. 

* Work Experience: language technologist internship, NLP and machine learning using Python and bash. Impostor syndrome hit me hard because I got this job without a technical interview but I actually really enjoyed it and did well per my boss and the CTO. I was actually offered to continue working there but had already committed to the PhD program. 
 
* Skills and Gaps: My MA program was 1/2 linguistics and 1/2 computer science. Because of this my CS education feels incredibly disjointed. While I've taken intro courses like intro programming, discrete math, and data structures, I lack knowledge of databases, algorithm development, and other core CS courses and undergrad would take in a BS program. I do, though, have an advanced knowledge of NLP and machine learning since my MA was set up for me to specialize in those areas. I picked up R recently and have immensely enjoyed having design back in my life (I used to do a lot of art before school ramped up in college). 

So I guess the question I'm asking is what would be the best course of action given my circumstances. I see myself doing similar work to that of my internship as a research/software engineer, a full fledged data scientist, or a data scientist specializing in visualiations One fear I have is that many people in NLP and ML have PhDs but I know it's not a necessity if you're good. I've met more dissatisfied PhDs in my field than happier ones, something that was a bit concerning to hear right before I was leaving to start a doctoral program, and many say they wish they just went straight to industry. Data science is appealing because I love data (even the cleanup and dirty work) and gain immense joy from visualizing it. 

 I'm open to working industry and freelance, and would prefer not to move given my current medical situation. I was considering applying to CS MS programs but am not sure it would even be worth it given that I already basically have half of it with my MA. Or should I look for courses online that may fill in the gaps, not even worry about them and just get really good at machine learning and NLP? Like I said I'm open to exploring other areas of computing and a code camp seems like a good way to switch gears.

I was also wondering on how best to approach a portfolio. I'd like to conquer my impostor syndrome by actually making stuff that I can put online. I have ideas for lots of visualization projects but as for NLP and machine learning I was wondering what would look best. 

Thanks in advance!

67cizi,1,2017-04-24,Do I really need a BS in Computer Science if I already have AS for it?,iBawk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/67cizi/do_i_really_need_a_bs_in_computer_science_if_i/,"I'm 23 and I've been in school for almost 5 years, I have an AS in Computer Science and just recently got hired full-time as a jr .NET developer from being an intern, because of this I got hired before completing my BS in Comp Sci.


You're probably wondering why I dont have my BS if I've already been in uni for almost 5 yr.

* wasted 1yr not knowing what to major in
* didn't meet the requirements
* had a kid my 3rd yr of college
* dropped too many irrelevant courses that met goal areas.
* never been a fan of school and standardized test
* policy changes for comp sci major

Because I wasn't able to take these advance topics, I spent time on my own learning them and became a freelance web dev over the summer in my 2nd yr of uni.

If I continue to go to uni I'd only be able to take two courses a semester thus pushing my graduation date further 2yrs instead of graduating in the next upcoming year. Reason why I want to take 2 courses a semester is because I dont want to overwhelm myself working FT and going to school FT(I did this last semester and it was hell) thus hindering my work performance. I dont see myself leaving the company I work for because I enjoy the people I work with and I feel I can work my way up to a Sr .NET dev since 30-40% of the staff are retiring in the next 3-7 years.

College is expensive and I really dont want to take out anymore loans pursing this degree if I'm already Jr .NET dev making about 60k/yr and soon to be promoted to a non Jr level dev in 2 months. So is it more important to have a BS in Comp Sci or is it more important having the experience?

Lets say I want to leave my place of employment and I have 3+ yrs of exp as a .NET dev. Would employers still look for a bachelors degree or are they more interested in my working experience, would they pay me less because I dont have a BS?

Other than bragging rights, making the parents happy, and possibly making more money. I'm finding it really hard on why I need a reason to complete this degree. So I need your guy's advice on what you feel is the best possible solution.

TL;DR: Im a 5th yr comp sci student that still has an additional 2 yrs of school and just got hired FT as a Jr .NET dev do I really need to pursue this degree or should I spend the time focusing on work?"

My parents really want me to go to UCB, since it's close (travel for holidays would also cost less, they will want me to visit for all the major holidays), cheaper, and my sister also goes to UCB. For housing, UCB is much harder to find after first year and will cost more. CMU takes credit for all of the APs I've taken, while UCB only takes one or two, so I would potentially be able to graduate in less than four years. I'm also interested in pursuing a master's degree and CMU offers a 5 year track for that. 

I'm concerned about the GPA requirement to declare CS for UCB. I feel like if I spend enough time and energy studying, it would be possible for me to achieve the 3.3 requirement. If I don't, though, I don't have any fallback majors that I'm interested in—it's nearly impossible to switch to engineering at UCB, and I'm pretty set on studying CS. And, I'm worried about the competitive environment that the impacted major brings, and also the large sizes of classes at UCB. At SCS, the classes are smaller and there are a lot more faculty available (and would be more willing to help), which would make it easier to get to know my professors and do research. I want to do research, hopefully starting in my freshman year, so that I can get more experience with CS and explore my interests. 

In terms of the CS program and job/internship opportunities, I know that they are pretty much equal in terms of strength of curriculum and opportunities. I've heard that CMU's curriculum is very technical and applicable, and also that it is quite hard and people spend a lot of time studying. I'm also assuming that I will have to spend a lot of time studying at UCB, to stay above the GPA requirement. I've also heard that recruiters prefer CMU grads, but also UCB is in a better location (I'd like to do summer internships in the silicon valley). CMU also gives me the opportunity to minor in art (CMU has a great design school), something I've been considering since I've always loved art but never had much of a chance to explore it further. I'm also really interested in the intersection of computer science and the arts. Overall, UCB is generally more highly ranked in other disciplines in case I change my mind about my major (right now I think it's pretty unlikely for that to happen but who knows). 

For extracurriculars, I know that UCB has a wider range of clubs, but you have to apply to them, while CMU has fewer but are easier to join. In terms of environment, UCB definitely feels more lively than CMU, but I really like the SCS within CMU. I've heard that the social scene is much more active at UCB, but I'm not big on parties so it's not too important to me. 

I've talked to CS students at both schools, visited both, and sat in on classes at both. Personally, I prefer CMU over UCB, but my parents really want me to go to UCB, and CMU does cost significantly more. Cost is not a determining factor—my parents would be able to pay for it (and I intend to contribute by doing research and internships, possibly finding a part time job), but it would be significantly harder to afford the 72k cost for CMU versus UCB's 34k cost. Overall, I think that there will be more opportunities and a community that fits me more at CMU, but I'm not sure if the cost is worth it.

Also, resume service recommendations?",wholikestoeatanyway,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/67d4rq/where_docan_i_go_also_resume_service/,"I've been unemployed and stuck for a long time.  I have no idea what the hell to do with myself - no degree, few marketable skills. I can computer, but mostly thanks to google, and I don't really qualify for anything but entry-level tech support - and I would rather eat a bullet than do phone support.  Can code a bit, but can't just sit down and teach myself enough to get a job doing it - plus, I need something starting now, not in 6-12 months.

My best job was 15 years ago now. My last job ended 4 years ago, with a shitty company that's almost worse for your rep than unemployment. I spent two of those years trying to finish a CS degree, started off great but eventually crashed and burned due to a recurrence of the depression/anxiety/ADHD-like problems that made me drop out the first time. The two years since then, I've done occasional in-home computer stuff, but otherwise jack shit due to aforementioned mental health problems.  Not here for help with those, I have a therapist, I just need help with the restarting my career part.

I have the brains for software dev, just not the self-motivation to do it by myself - if I got an internship where I went to a place to learn it and got paid for it, I'd be fine, but you can't generally do that if you're not a student. Otherwise, some low-level IT job with no/minimal phone shit and where I could learn useful system/network/db admin stuff and eventually move up that way would work. Have no idea how to find or get any of these. Any hints for what to look for, and how to persuade them to actually give me a job?

Also, due to my ultra shitty work history with its gaps and incomplete degree and lack of skills and just generally feeling like anything I write is terrible and/or a lie, I can't handle my own resume. I'm looking for a professional resume writer, because they'll a) be much better writers and b) know how to polish the turd somewhat, but I don't know how to separate the good ones from the shitty or the scams.  Does anyone have any advice for this or know somebody really good?

Thanks much."

I've been down in the dumps because I can't get an internship. I've applied to a bunch of companies but a combination of lack of experience and questioning what I want to do in life I think has led to me not getting anything. I'm a major in Informatics and am interested in working with technology but everytime someone asks me what I want to do I genuinely don't know. My experience is from research and tutoring with computer programs like Access and Excel but I've never worked for money and I'm a junior.

67ddu5,5,2017-04-24,Just took my quant 1 exam and got a terrible grade. I might need to change majors. Please help.,evening__blue,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/67ddu5/just_took_my_quant_1_exam_and_got_a_terrible/,"This is my first semester at UCF. Right now I'm taking all of the primary core classes to get into the accounting program. My current grades are C, C, B, B+, A (but the A is just for GEB so...). I'm aware the final exam for quant 1 counts twice. But I have a D, C, and D as my exam grades. For the past week or so I've been paying a lot of money to meet with my tutor. I practiced, paid attention to what the professor said would be on the exam, I went to my tutoring sessions. I felt so confident. I thought to myself that this time I really feel like I'll get at least a B. But I didn't. I got the lowest test grade that I've had in quant 1. My other C is in my Business Finance class. 


In order to bring it up to a C+ I'd need close to a perfect score on the final. I'm paying for a tutor in finance too. So I have two tutors right now. If my grades go even lower or stay as they are, that means I'd have to get an A in Quant 2 and an A in Intermediate Accounting. It's not the end of the world for me, no, but I tried to make sure I did well on my exams this week so I would have more leeway for my next classes. I'm at a loss for words. I'm starting to really doubt myself. I'm not a genius but I never thought I was this fucking stupid. I was starting to lose my feeling of self-worth before but after my tutor sessions I felt so confident, the sessions would fly by because I could do whatever we were working on. 


I might end up having to change majors if things get to that point. But I've had my heart set on accounting for a long time. I thought I wanted to be in the medical field before, I did a few internships at a pharmacy and at a dental office. Then I decided it wasn't for me so I got an internship and then was promoted to a job at an accounting firm and I loved every minute of it. 
What am I supposed to do if I have to find another path for myself. What am I supposed to do when I've had my heart set on something but my academic performance won't allow me to continue? I don't even know what I would switch to. What do I do. "

Cooper: 
Pros: small student-faculty ratio, you will know everyone else in the engineering school and teachers as well in engineering, great opportunities for internships and jobs in Silicon Alley, will get into a good grad school assuming you survive, great place in nyc to hang out, eat, and explore, amazing facilities to do research
Cons: no campus, pretty competitive, people have 2.2 gpas, barely any girls in engineering in general, no meal plan, academics first unless you want to fail, about 120 people total in engineering, have to do work-study
NYU: 
Pros: Great campus (easy to go between brooklyn and manhattan via shuttle buses they provide), pretty large dorm rooms compared to Cooper, Chipotle right in front of tandon, great food to eat on campus and around the area, tons of social activities, clubs and events, good chance of me transferring to CAS, large alumni network, can interact with grad students easily by working on research projects
Cons: Mech E isn't great but it's good, didn't get accepted into honors program, classes aren't as small as Cooper, a lot of cheating (asked some sophomores taking calc 3, and vibrations)
Case Western:

On their own I'd say these payrates aren't half bad. But I'm curious if there's some kind of rule of thumb or something that could help me determine what I would get paid to do these positions full time instead of as internships.

I've recently run into some school trouble that may mess up my graduation timeline and the company this summer needs IT workers, so part of me believes that if I work my ass off I could attempt to go full time or extend my internship through the fall and then attempt to go full time until I can get things with school and student debt sorted out."

I think right now I'm leaning towards choosing between Cal and Duke, since CMU seems like too small a school I hear its academics are pretty much equal to Cal's, but then again I change my mind every day.

A few things I've been considering:

* I'm not 100% certain that I want to go into Computer Science, but it's likely 
* I don't have much experience with CS other than taking APCS (that Cal CS 3.3 GPA req :\^( )
* I definitely want to be able to find internships over the summer and a job afterwards without too much stress/luck
* I also want to not hate the next 4 years

For Cal, I have regents, so choosing classes won't be too bad. I'm also not too concerned about large class sizes, but I am afraid of being unable to declare CS and having too much competition amongst other CS majors. If I do declare CS successfully, I'd be really happy with all the job fair and class opportunities (many more electives!) and general recruitment. Also my petty negatives are that the bathrooms were dirty both times I visited, the dorms seem smaller/more crowded, I'm kind of scared of the campus+surrounding area, and I am not EECS master race.

For Duke, I really really loved the campus, but it seems like there's nothing really going on outside of campus, in Durham. I also know the CS program isn't as good as Cal's, but I would plan on double majoring (maybe in CS + econ?) and I can at least guarantee declaring the major. I heard that people in CS don't really get internships freshman or sophomore summer, which concerns me a bit. Also I'm afraid I'd be behind on general CS knowledge compared to tech-heavy schools.

Food at both places is solid, but I'd have more friends to get food with at Cal. Also I'm lucky enough that my parents have assured me that the cost of tuition should be a lesser factor in my decision.

The first job is offered by a medium sized airline. I've been there as an intern. They offered me to be a supervisor in a major airport in Europe and check/monitor the daily operations. It pays really low salary, barely enough to live in the city. It is a very stressful job with high working hours (9.5 hours per day), an error causes thousands of dollars etc. The good thing is if I work there, I can get experience and move to better companies and positions with a better salary. The company treats its employees very poorly and expects me to be a workhorse. 

The second alternative is to be a flight attendant. In some parts of Europe, being a flight attendant pays really good like 2-3 times of the first job, enough to buy a house in 3-4 years. It offers great financial and social opportunities and I could visit a lot of places. But I can't really move on from there careerwise. Maybe I can move to office jobs after 1-2 years, but it is hard to do so. I don't find anything attractive in that job except great salary. 

I would like to choose the first job focus on my career instead, but in the real world, it is hard to live with barely enough money until getting a promotion (1-2 years).

Company 1 is startup doing big data/machine learning. My work would be very hands on with no directs to manage. Very interesting tech and leaves me in good position 3-4 years from now skillswise (minus the leading/managing skills). I would be in a pretty senior position day one at a fast growth tech startup (40 employees, survived over 4 years, finally profitable, etc.). I would be expected to lead architecture and design considerations on top of automation projects and ops of course. But there would be no one to handle the more boring tasks of day to day tickets etc.

Company 2 is big name fortune x kind of company where I would be a ""hands on"" manager. 30-50% hands on with some seriously big scale projects that would have a lot of cachet. Immediately taking on a 2 pizza size team I would be a mid manager. I think I would be 5-6 levels below the CTO kind of company. However I would be able to work on my managing + still be working on some pretty impressive tech stacks. Mostly just front facing websites and back end connectors but scale would be large. I am worried I would get pigeoned into a ""enterprise manager"" for all future jobs.

Company 3 is a AWS MSP partner. I would be doing pre-sales + architecture + implementation + higher level trouble shooting. Basically meet with clients, develop solution, write it up and start implementation. There is a team of lower level guys to do some of the more mundane and manage the ongoing work and low level tickets. So at some point you get to hand off the work when it gets boring ;). Lots of varied work and strong support to handle most of the boring tasks. But I don't exactly like writing SOWs and tracking my time by the minute.

All the salaries are pretty close to my current salary. Bonuses are the only real difference. Startup stock options with 1, cash/stock with 2 and rev share with 3.

All the companies have one thing in common they want to know that I can actually do the work. So I am hesitant with company 2 because I will be losing some of my skills as I spend more time in meetings and doing management tasks. However I am getting older and you can only do this work for so long before you get too old and need to move into management. My inclination is to take 1 and hope the lottery ticket pays out. I liked the team and feel I can take the risk of a startup because I can get a new gig in 1-2 months if things turn south. I should also mention 2 and 3 have strong managers that I think I can learn from. Company 1 has some leaders with startup experience and are dialed into that scene and have other skills I can learn from. Specifically how to be CTO at a future startup if that is the way my life leads me.

I really liked all 3 teams and all 3 jobs. All 3 feel financially stable with 1 being the most likely to boom/bust obviously. What are some other considerations? What do you guys think of my princess and the pea problem?"

I am a current student and doing a part time (20hrs/week) internship. I was excited since it was my first real CS/programming internship. However, I'm not sure if staying is worth it anymore.

I know basic Java and data structures/algorithms and the group I'm on works with a few other technologies/frameworks I've never been exposed to but mostly works in Java. I was given a basic assignment to develop a small piece of code but I'm struggling. 

I've never seen code written the way they write it, I've never seen half of the methods or functions they are calling, etc. I'm reading the code but am having difficulty picking up on a lot of it. I tried asking for help but everyone I've asked is ""too busy right now"" and my main contact said ""well I would need to teach you the entire framework and functionality of what we write, but I just don't have time"" when I repeatedly asked for help. I just can't seem to find anyone that has the time to sit down and give me a few hours so I get up to speed in order to provide some decent work during my time.

I'm trying my best but I guess maybe CS isn't for me? I am speaking with my manager and going to perhaps see if I can't just get assigned some basic data entry or reporting work but maybe it will be better to just quit?

I've had internships (not CS - engineering and Data Analysis) before so I know how to function as an intern somewhat. It's been a full 1.5 months here since I began. I was given background reading and busy work before hand. Career wise I'd like to venture into technology and maybe programming but perhaps this proves I'm not cut out for it.

Thank you for your time I'd appreciate any feedback."

Just a few thoughts: I feel intellectually worthless because I don't know mathematics at a deep level. I feel worthless in practical terms because I don't know programming. I feel like a lower caste because I didn't go to a university with as high a reputation as I could've gone to (went to my nearest one), though I have no debt.

What is the life plan? I know I'm simplifying things, but it seems that you're either working in high finance, or have somehow made money from your own software company (a lottery), or working in a cushy famous software company, (or an academic but that's not an option after I hated my undergrad degree and put in minimal effort)... or you're a big loser. The corporate world seems like a rigged game that I will never succeed in because I'm an unattractive and nerdy looking person.

I am glad my job is temporary, I want to postpone the beginning of my career. I know you may say, ""Welcome to the real world!"" but hopefully fellow losers can empathise with my view that being in the real world is fun and games when you're surrounded by Normie clones or are Chad / Stacey, but it's a different game when you're not like them. It also doesn't help that I don't have a posh or southern English accent or even a ""bantz with da ladz"" person.

I am finishing my undergrad in accounting this summer but have concluded that accounting isn't for me. I've taken an accounting information systems class where we messed around in Access for god knows how long. Other then that I do a good bit of gaming on PC and have got to do lots of trouble shooting to fix other people's PCs as well as get mine running in top shape using bootcamp and custom graphics drivers (awful I know but it's what I got to work with). I have essentially been tinkering with computers and gaming since I was little. So I would say beyond just being considered computer savvy by friends on a base level, I have limited skills when it comes to IT though I have always wanted to get into the field.

 Where should I start? I wont lie working my way up through help desk or other lower base level positions appeals to me. I am really looking to get aggressive about this as I have been doing a good bit of research around IT lately and seem to have found a potential passion. Would getting Certs like the A+ be a good idea?

I am 22, a CS major, have an ok GPA (Above 3.3 .. For now). One thing that I have had pretty bad is severe social anxiety and depression and in all honesty school, and while really not trying to sound personal, this school in particular has been a big stressor/ trigger for me since I readmitted here in the fall. I guess what I have been learning about myself is that I am a very simple, reserved person and I think making the attempt to try to complete a university degree was all a huge giant mistake and a waste of time.

Sometimes everything seems too crowded, too noisy, I cannot seem to find any real friends or people I can relate to and in all honesty the structure of school, being something where you feel like you have to spend all your time worrying about a test or a project to do all the time and it fitting standards that are arbitrary and do not seem relevant or just nitpicky has just been bothering me to a huge degree

 I know the world and the workplace is filled with this kind of BS but at least in the quarter and summer I had off at least when work was done, it was done, the routine got a lot more predictable and easier to manage and best of all I got paid. I had something tangible or worthwhile to make me feel it was all worth it. 

I enjoy my major a little bit but I dont like learning it in a classroom setting anymore, I dont like going to UCI anymore. Honestly everytime I have been near or am setting foot on-campus I have felt my sense of panic and anxiety skyrocket.

At first I was gonna try to make it through one more quarter but I don't know if I can do that anymore. There seems to be more group work and face-to-face meetings in my classes and it is making me feel straight out awful. 

I thought maybe applying for a research program or applying for summer internships would help but right now I just don't feel hopeful about anything. I have some interviews lined up but I have been rejected by two already and honestly I dont know what to do that will work. I know if I just leave I can't do the internships since they're student internships but it all doesnt seem worth it.

I guess I am venting and really lost right now. Spent the last two days just forcing myself to sleep because being awake was just too stressful"

As a 'new' grad (I graduated last spring) who has been applying to positions, what is a realistic salary expectation for an entry-level software engineering position and an entry-level quality assurance position? I have 1 (academic) year of experience working as a python developer for my senior project team. I also have about 2 years working as the senior QA at my internship (sophomore - junior year). I started as junior QA but got promoted to senior QA within months (before the year was up is what I mean - btw is it misleading to put senior QA instead of junior QA on my resume then?)

I am asking because I am changing my strategy by contacting technology recruiting firms to help my job search. However I recently had a discussion with one (granted this was not a technology recruiting firm) and he seemed incredulous that I would ask for 70k out of college - this number was based on research done based on the average software engineering salaries from glassdoor, indeed, and payscale (I also look at the entry-level ones when available). Am I expecting too much? Keep in mind I don't mean Google, Facebook tier companies. Just normal ones no one has likely heard about.

I have taken a look at the salary sharing responses but I am still a little worried. For what it is worth, I have applied to many positions (not sure the amount and have gotten rejected by a fair number and perhaps ghosted by many more), had phone interviews (about 6 - stopped process on one because it seemed like a scam), onsites from those (about 4 - one of which was Amazon, but that was for QA Engineer - failed this one though). It seems from my experience getting the resume approved is the hardest, the onsite is a very close second, and the phone interview is the least hardest.

Basically - given this info, am I expecting too much to ask for 70k as a new grad not-quite-fresh out of college for Boston, MA? I have not had a job since my graduation (bachelor's - computer science).

Also - if it isn't too much, then what can I say when they ask what my current salary is when I am unemployed? Once they get that info (currently making $0) they seem to laugh - not outright, but you can tell."

67o9ct,2,2017-04-26,Job search rant,jobsick,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/67o9ct/job_search_rant/,"So I decided to just write this because I just received my millionth rejection letter. Just really giving up hope on ever getting a job.

I studied engineering in Australia, and at my university, you need to do a work placement in a related field for 3 months if you want to graduate. Generally, you're expected to do this over the summer break at the end of your third year. I had actually been looking for engineering jobs students could do since 2nd year but couldn't find any. Since then until the end of my third year, I had applied to a countless number of companies seeking an internship placement to no prevail. I was getting super anxious by this point as the the summer break had already started and I was unable to find a work placement. Through sheer luck as if god wanted to prove his existence to my atheist beliefs, I was notified of a job mildly related to my field at a construction company. I contacted them immediately to which they accepted me to work there for a period of 3 months. This was perfect for them as it was their busy period and perfect for me for obvious reasons. The 3 months I spent there were rather dull but everything went smoothly. There were no issues whatsoever. I was paid for the work and the people there were also nice. But nearing the end of the 3 month period and being required to go back to uni, I had to quit the job because they needed a full timer. I had a positive outlook again.

It was 2016, a new year, another year of possibilities. But now I needed to find a graduate job. I had worked previously as a retail assistant prior to my work placement at the construction company, but I had to quit that job for my work placement job, and decided I would just focus on my studies for my final year while I looked for a graduate job. Again I repeated the process for applying for graduate jobs and any entry level job related to my field of engineering. I attended all the careers markets at my uni. Had my resume checked by 3 different reputable people, 2 who were careers advisers for my uni and and one who is a friend that works in human resources, to which they all said my resume was very good. Having read a lot of advice to not send out my resume like spam mail, I have been applying for 1 job every day. Each job I apply for, I tailor my resume to the companies specialisation and requirements. I write a personalised cover letter. Where possible, I call up the company and ask around for the HR department to ask further details regarding the job position and get the HR manager's name to add in my cover letter. I spend anywhere between 2 to 4 hours on each application depending. And still no replies. This was last year.

Currently, I live with my aunt and uncle who have been kind enough to provide me with a place to stay during my studies. But now their daughter (my cousin) who lived overseas will be moving to Australia to settle down with her new family and will be staying in the house. Seeing as there are no other rooms, I'm going to have to move out pretty soon. But with no job secured and nowhere to go, I've been desperately applying for any job now. Retail, labor, whatever.

I just really hate my life right now. How do people get these job things? I think I've applied for over 200 jobs by now and seeing as I've only managed to get 1 interview, to which I failed at miserably due to being so nervous, I can only assume there's something wrong with my resume. But liked I've said before, I've had it checked by the people I mentioned who said it was very good. The other reason would be my very average uni mark which is a 70 out of 100 WAM (don't know what GPA that is).

I'm also writing this because I honestly can't find any more companies to apply for. Where do people find jobs at the mid to small tier level? The big ones are easy to find. Unless the mid-to-low tier companies post on jobsearch sites to which Ive exhausted, don't know where else to look.

My friends in engineering who got a job were all through contacts. I have zero contacts in engineering. My best bet is that my friends who have gotten jobs can refer me in a couple of years after they have established their placement in the industry. I can probably find a full-time job somewhere and survive but its just depressing to think that I've spent 4 and a half years of my life slaving away at uni to end up down a career path that I have little to no interest in and not much room to develop a professional career out of.

Anyway, rant over. Sorry for the depressing article. Just needed to rant somewhere. Thanks for reading."

Me and my girlfriend are looking for a fresh start outside Brazil. We both have college degrees and we're not that tight on budget. I'm also Italian, so if we choose anywhere in Europe we plan to get married, just to get her in. A got a few concerns:

1. I have a degree in marketing/advertising + and unfinished degree in cs, which is my focus. I have a few internship as a developer but no ""real"" job.
2. We only speak english and Portuguese.
2. I have know idea what I have to do to move to europe. I just need to go?
2. I doesn't NEED to be permanent. A 2-3 year stay is enough. Later on we think about it again.

I was thinking on London or Amsterdam, but I think the cost of living is pretty high, isn't is?
I also considered Canada(but I'm not sure if anyone would want to sponsor a junior candidate) I thought about enrolling in some kind of course, but I don't know if I can work simultaneously to cover the costs.

Do you guys have any other suggestion? Thanks in advance! "

The problem is: I have just the bare basics of programming down. During the interview, I was asked if I had any developing experience, and I replied with ""no, but I can do my best to learn what is needed"", and she replied with ""not a problem"".

I have an interview with the department head tomorrow, which is obviously great, but I'm still worried that I'm gonna miss out since I don't have any programming skills at the moment.

I have recently been offered a position at FDM Group. However, after diving into further research, I have seen a lot of mixed reviews. On Glassdoor, there are reviews on both ends of the spectrum and are very polarized. 

I guess I should talk a little about myself. I'm about to graduate college in less than 3 weeks. I have been searching a lot in the job field that is related to consulting/IT as that is what I have been studying, but because I switched majors midway, it was kind of late for me to be able to get any internships or experiences because of i had to catch up on the core courses. Because of this, I spent the last several months being unfruitful in my search of a job. Every place I applied to comes back with the response that they have more qualified candidates.

Because of all this, I thought that FDM would be a good place to kickstart my career. I could really use their training program to brush up on material, and I heard it is a good way to get your foot in the door. However, a lot of the negative reviews really don't favor the company at all, calling it pretty much a factory where they churn in and out recruits.

I was wondering if any of you guys have any advice for me on how to proceed. I have around a week to accept the offer before the deadline, and I really just want to get my foot in the door and build from there. The two year contract really does sound awful, but I don't think 2 years is that long of a time compare to what I been through the academic life.

67rw5r,30,2017-04-26,How I managed to get into grad school,nutrikinetics,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/67rw5r/how_i_managed_to_get_into_grad_school/,"Hey guys, first time poster here - but wanted to share my story on how I got accepted into my dream graduate programs.

I accumulated a 2.8 overall GPA by the end of my sophomore year of college. I had received 2 D's, 1 F, and multiple C's, and had generally poor study habits. 

As I entered my upper division major courses, I decided that I needed to clean up my act. I didn't have any particular goals regarding graduate schools, but I knew that I wouldn't receive acceptance into dietetic internships if I didn't make major changes (I am a nutrition major, and these internships are extremely selective, and as such, have very low acceptance rates). 

So, below is a list of what I did - 

1. Improved my study habits (obviously) - I had to find out what study habits worked for me through trial and error.

2. Devoted a few hours each week to read peer-reviewed articles related to my field. Honestly, I cannot stress how much this helped me. Having an understanding of the general trends and emerging research in my field allowed me to participate in class discussions and provide meaningful insight into topics we we were going over. Also, it helped me really connect with professors who had similar research interests as I did (more on this below).

3. Developed genuine relationships with my major professors - I took the time to visit professors during office hours; doing this allowed my name to be known within the faculty. I spoke with professors about recent research papers and controversies. 

I connected especially well with a professor who had spent decades doing groundbreaking research at a prestigious facility. Why? Because I kept up with the literature -- I knew what the emerging research and lines of thought were, which research groups are involved in certain areas, and who the big names were. This allowed me to discuss everything from research groups from various universities around the nation (and talk crap about some of them -- many researchers secretly love doing this) to how our field of science is perceived by journalists and the public. Forming excellent relationships with my major professors allowed for strong letters of recommendations.

4. Join professional societies related to your academic area, and try your best to attend conferences and networking events held by these societies. This is where I met future employers, and potential graduate school advisors. 


5. Work hard, don't stress out excessively, and just be a chill person. You want to make friends. You want people to like you and support you. I guarantee that you won't be able to make many friends if you're a stuck up dick. So be easygoing, chill, and work collaboratively with other students. Don't be neurotic. Accept your mistakes and learn from them. 


Fast forward two years later, I competed all of the rigorous, science heavy major courses at the very top of my class. I will be graduating in May at the top of my class. I am held in high regard by all of the faculty members, and respected and well-liked by all of my peers. Moreover, I got into all of the graduate programs I applied to with the major professors I wanted to work with. 

So for those of you who are in your earlier undergrad years who aren't doing too well: there is still hope. You just have to put in the work."

So I'm a second year electrical engineering student at a large state school known for it's engineering program. So far I have a 2.85 cumulative gpa and am on track to finish this semester with all C's. 
I'm a pretty good student. I study for several hours a day outside of class, I go to office hours regularly, I always do homework and try to review material regularly, I start studying for tests several days in advance, take practice tests, I try to study with other students when possible. I did take advantage of tutoring services, but now that I'm entering into more upper division material those aren't available anymore. I have previously met with an advisor to rework my degree plan to decrease the amount of engineering courses I have to take each semester. 
I feel like I've tried everything and am still struggling. In my program, about half of students seem to get an internship after sophomore year and almost all get one after junior year. I've applied to at least 50 different positions this year, and gotten one interview that ended pretty quickly and did not end up in me getting the position. I feel like when I meet with employers at job fairs, they generally seem interested at first and accept my resume, but then do not contact me. I have had career services at my school and upper level friends look over my resume and changed it based on their advice, so I feel like the problem must be the listed gpa.
I'm a team lead in an engineering org, and plan on throwing my self into that over the summer. I genuinely do like engineering and have wanted to be an engineer since middle school. I'm not really sure what I'd do instead.
I'm just not really sure what to do... It seems like I can't succeed in this major despite my best efforts. I don't want to waste time and money on my degree if I'm ultimately going to end up un-hireable or not able to succeed.
Please give me some advice."

It seems I have three options if I go the CS/IT route. Either get a Master's in 2.5 years costing $20000 and then internship, a CC certification in software development in 1.5 years costing $5000 and then internship, or just try to jump right in to an internship.

Other potential major interests:

Theatre

International Affairs

History

English

Computer Science

FSU Pros:

-Prettier/generally nicer campus

-In Tallahassee, for capitol internships

-Handful of friends going here, none at UF

-A handful of FSU kids have received Rhodes Scholarships and other prestigious awards in recent past years

-They gave me 3000 per year, but cost isn't an important factor with these schools

-------------------------------------------------------

UF Pros:

-Much higher ranked, for pretty much everything except theatre and maybe Poli Sci/IA, especially good in case I decide to switch majors

-More famous alumni and politicians from here, connections and networking are probably better
-Slightly nicer honors dorm

-Recruiters and opportunities are probably more plentiful here since it's seen as a better school

I was struggling to find an internship, so she contacted her father (CEO) and he set me up with an interview. I was offered the job and told I had until my finals were over to respond.

This job pays very little and I will barely break even by working there. However, her dad texted her and said I had to respond by the end of the week, so I ended up accepting the job.

Now, some two weeks later, a large company that has been my dream to work for has contacted me for an interview. This job is in California (I've always wanted to live there), pays more than double, is in the field I want to work in for the rest of my life, and provides housing. I'll barely be able to afford the job here in Texas (moving expenses are going to kill me), and because of my senior project won't be able to have a job next year. Taking the Texas job means I will be extremely financially strained over the last year of school.

The California job will result in about $6000 of savings for the coming year where the Texas job will land me $1000 in the best case scenario. That $1000 will maybe last me half of the semester.

When I began as a freshman I was a Mechanical engineering major with a passion for aerospace so halfway through my sophomore year I made the switch to an AE major. Due to lack of opportunities for internships/co-ops and a 2.89 cumulative GPA, I have gotten no relevant work experience throughout college and I have heard zero responses from all my applications for entry level positions. I learned recently however, that if I wanted to add an ME degree and double major, I only lack 5 classes that are 15 total credit hours that would take two more semesters to complete. If I chose to continue with graduating with my AE degree, then I would enter a job search whilst being about 40k in student loan debt. But if I chose to double up on majors then I have the opportunity to work a part time internship as an ME and make enough money to continue to pay off student loan interest while postponing my graduation until May 2018 finishing with a double major and likely a Reliability and maintainability engineering minor. This would vastly expand my job opportunities and give me a solid chance to raise my GPA (as I tend to get better grades in ME courses). But doing so will result in about 65k in student debt post graduation. I keep weighing the pros and cons and have to make a decision to postpone my graduation within the next week but it's a very hard decision. Knowing I could finish right now with a degree and consciously making the decision of another year in school is something I kind of dread, yet again my job opportunities will greatly increase if I do. So I can either elect to follow through with my graduation and hope I can find a job with my below average GPA in aerospace to pay off a 40k debt, or I can elect to broaden my chances whilst digging a bit deeper hole in student debt. I feel like a lot of AE majors switch into ME just because of lack of jobs but I chose to stick it out and now I feel like I may be regretting it despite following my passion of aerospace. If anyone has any input I would greatly appreciate it!"

So I was basically hired as an intern for this non profit 2 years ago, and I was doing what the basic responsibilities of any other intern would be. They have this new project where they have a STEM building, and I they told me I was in charge of setting up 30 new computers for the building because they knew I was ""good with computers"". They were surface pros (pain in the ass to deal with). I was not even close to proficient in sysadmin work, so I had to teach my self about Group Policies, cloning, etc. I have done nothing but work on these goddam computers for the past 6 months, because all they want me to do is add functionality and fix problems whenever some stupid kid installs Roblox or some other program. 

They have their own it guy that they use occasionally  , but they'll probably get a better deal paying me the minimum wage.

Are they taking advantage of me? I need some advice.

Extra: on top of that, they gave me a 3% raise on the minimum wage at the time ($10.30), and when the new minimum wage took effect 15 days later, they just took the raise away

My dad would also randomly disappear (usually to go gambling) and wouldn't come home for 1.5 days. My parents fight, and my sister is 8. I'm concerned for her mental wellbeing. They're not abusive, they've never hit me or each other, but my dad would sometimes throw stuff and hurt himself when he's angry. It's heart breaking to watch.

I'm in my 4th year of university but I still don't know what I want to do for a career. I'm scared that being kicked out of engineering means that I'll never be able to find a job. 

I'm very ambitious, I want to have a nice house, a nice car, and to be able to go on yearly vacations, but I'm scared that I'll never get to that point. I feel trapped and helpless.

I'm also scared of working part time during the school year, because I won't want my grades to suffer. My sister is my life right now, I love her so much and I want to encourage her to do stuff that I never had the chance to do. 

I've never been too scared to take risks, but ever since I got kicked out of engineering I've been timid. I feel like a failure and I feel like I shouldn't waste anymore time and money trying to ""better myself"". I feel like I should just settle for a minimum wage job to support my parents for a bit, but I also really don't wanna do that.

I was admitted last month as a Computer Science major, and am now thinking about taking CS32 this summer. For context, I took CS31 last summer with Professor Stahl. I am worried about having a year+ gap between these two classes if I wait until winter quarter for CS32 (It's not offered in the fall, right?). Most students

By taking it in the summer, I figured I could devote more time to CS32 and more easily catch up on whatever I may have forgotten from CS31. Also, I would be 2 semesters ahead in CompSci classes  by the time I started freshman year. 

Does anyone have thoughts on whether this is a good idea? I'd really appreciate any advice!

Bonus question 1: I've heard freshman usually don't get internships after the first year. Could being 2 semesters ahead in CompSci classes potentially lead me to an internship after freshman year?

Bonus question 2: Any recommendations for other good classes to take 
over the summer? CS32 would be 4-6 MW and 2-4 F, so hopefully around that time. 

Thank you!!

I'm a new intern at a company. I took a class in Excel last year as a freshman in college so I'm pretty comfortable with the software, but I'm not a pro or anything. At work, I use Excel 2013. One of the projects I need to do is put A LOT of dealerships in a spreadsheet. I go to the car dealership's website, and find all their dealership locations. Companies usually have 20-200 dealerships. Some companies have all their dealerships in one page and I can just copy and paste them. But there's some website where you have to click on a state in order to find the dealerships. 


Anyways, what I need to do is put these dealerships in a spreadsheet and list their: Dealer Name, Address and Phone number. 


What I usually do is I go to the company's website under ""Find a Dealership"" section, copy and paste only the dealership info and put it in Excel. This is the hard part. When I paste it into Excel, all the info is in one column and I usually have to copy and paste the address &amp; phone number in a different column. And, then I delete all the other stuff that I don't need. The copy and pasting stuff takes too much time and I think there's a better and more efficient way of doing this. Is there a way I can make this easier without all the copy and pasting stuff? 

Thanks in advance."

There is a possible change in the business franchise coming to the company I work for and my boss keeps pointing out that the affiliate network have their own extensive IT team. I'm not entirely sure what that means for me but I can't shake the feeling my time here is counting down. I'd like to be prepared to move before that time comes but I'm not sure where I'll fit these days as my current work is so sporatic and I haven't applied for a job since this one 4 years ago and that was for an internship. I was hoping to get your opinions on what type of position would be a good fit. I'm currently the sole IT Support person for an SMB in the Midwest United States. I started here as an intern, that internship ended with me studying and getting certified in International Business from a Business School in France. I then returned and was hired on as part-time support while I was finishing up my degree in MIS Business Analyst. Right around when I was finishing school, my supervisor and the person who had originally helped set up the IT here left. I was then offered a full-time position and took over the IT related side of my supervisor's position. I've been here for 4 years now and have focused on automating basic tasks so that I can work and focus on larger more lucrative projects. I designed the over all strategy of IT for the company after meeting with the CEO to see where he saw the company going. I have designed and implemented several projects that have helped the company to grow and be more efficient. This past year, I studied for and got certified in ITIL Foundation to help me get a better system for organization and planning projects. I also do a lot of odd projects for the company, like working with automation servers for HVAC controllers, setting up surveillance and security systems, managing the vehicle fleet, and various other random tasks. 

I was thinking I would apply for a junior System Admin position but although I frequently work on Windows Servers, I'm by no means fluent in all its workings. I can do basic domain changes, group policy changes, backup and recovery testing, etc. But haven't set up a server from scratch. I'm working on getting my homelab setup so I can do that and start working with ESXi but have been delayed and now I'm wondering if I should hold off to see what is going to happen to my job. 

With my history and experience, what do you think would be a good position for me to look for?

**Context**: I'm hopefully graduating May 2018, currently have a ~2.9GPA. Not many personal projects, some school projects (cover letter), mainly list hackathons and past work experience on my resume.

I applied to some internships in the winter and recently started applying to a bunch these past few weeks. The only internship that has offered me a position is only paying $10 an hour (full-time in summer then part-time in Fall semester) for basically doing things with medical information handling using Javascript, C#, and maybe some others I'm forgetting. 
They're a very small team and the people seem cool enough but it's obvious they're more or less a start up and they doing everything very ad-hoc and seemed to suggest I would be doing *alot* of work.

$10 is really low compared to other dev internships in the area ($15 is very standard) but it's my fault for not being a better candidate and for not applying earlier.

***My question is/TL;DR*:** **Should I just take a very underpaid, possibly overworked intern position since I'm this late in the game or keep looking?** Also, any advice for future people in my situation (i.e. not much experience/projects to show) or for me in the future?


 
I've only been coding for a year and a half (switched majors) so I was pretty intimidated when first applying.
If anyone in a similar boat is reading this *just apply even if you think you're under qualified!* Worst case is you get rejected and but you now know what to work on/what employers are looking at and know what a coding interview is like. Don't let a rejection discourage you, either.

Please learn from my mistakes!

Edit: also, do projects even if you think you don't know jack about coding, that's how you learn. Don't be scared to make a shit project, you'll learn alot along the way and it helps if you do it with some friends."

A little background, I'm an accounting major and currently go to a meh school that isn't really a targeted school for accounting firms to hire from. Not to say that they don't but it's not like UCS material. Just like ever major your GPA matters a lot when recruiting with these accounting firms. My GPA is pretty average its sitting in the 3.5 to 3.7 range depending on how I do this semester. 

I've been fortune enough to have an internship with a firm this upcoming summer which is exciting. However after I complete my internship I have the chance of getting a full-time position for the following year once I graduate. Depending on the firm they usually take most of the intern class (last year I believe they took 10/15 or 11/15 students at my firm). I can't help but think I'm going to be one of those 4 students that don't get a full time position. 

My grades right now are very shakey, I essentially have to get 90%+ on my finals to pull A's in two classes. The only thing that sucks is that the material in one of my classes builds off each other and is only getting harder. Im unsure if I can even pull it off. On top of that my mentor says that not enough to stand out from the crowd and my full time offer dwindles if I do pull B's. 

I keep trying to convince myself that not getting full time isn't the worse thing but to me that's everything right now. How do I even change this mindset? It's all I've been thinking about at night and it stresses me out.  

This sounds more like a rant but I do want on advice if someone found themselves in a similar situation.

Then I despair, because I realize everyone's life is sucking HARD...

Then some of my college acquaintances (not really friends), are almost all unemployed, all of us have crushing debts (me included), some are unemployed AND have kids.

Many people I interact with also have parents dieing on them, usually due to cancer or old age, frequently these people STILL depend on their parents (like me), so I know people that are using 50% of their time to try to find any money, and the other 50% visiting hospital while their parents die, and then they somehow figure where to pull some more 10% to try to play games online or something, but end depressing everyone by complaining that when their parents die they won't have anywhere to go, having no job, and no income, and noone to care for them, and no parents income (since they are dead).

Or some of my older female 'friends', that found relationships, and careers, and now are freaking out because when they finally decided to have babies, it is too risky, or they flatly can't (one for example got sterile while she was 35).

Or younger 'male' friends, that have terrible lives in general, and also feel hated, they are hated for being male, for being white (even when they aren't white, see Brazilian university quotas controversy, where guys that have real black ancestors are not allowed quotas for looking too white), for being heterosexual, for being unemployed, for being 'young irresponsible gamers', and so on... And then when they try to find relationships, no women want them, because all they own are huge debts.

Of the around 200s people of my age I know more or less of their lives, I think only 20 own a vehicle, only one own a house.

Many don't have college degrees, despite going to college, because here in my country internship is mandatory, unpaid internship is illegal, and companies don't have money to hire interns, so they never finish their degree because they never find internship...

And the list goes, and goes, and goes... basically everyone I know are acting as if they have no future, I had people tell me they wanted to suicide, and I couldn't find a silver lining in their lives to convince them otherwise, they literally have no future, there is no housing, no money, no children (and the ones that have children are worse for it), no relationships...

In fact I see a dreading amount of people confessing they wish World War III actually happened, they want to see the world burn and turn to ashes, hoping that out of it something for them might maybe rise.

I feel fine, but I also feel I have to shut myself from the world, become oblivious and even more lonely, every time I interact with someone of my age, all I get is barrage of bad news, or fake good news (like some guy that posted on facebook he relaxing on a very nice pool, and later I found out he was an waiter at the hotel that has the pool, a very badly paid waiter at that...)

Maybe because my social circle is more educated than the rest of my country I am not seeing a drug epidemic or suicide epidemic yet... but only 'yet', the amount of suicidal messages are slowly increasing."

As the title states, I'm a declared 3rd year CS major at Berkeley. I have no full-time tech internships on my resume, and I am worried that this summer might be my last chance to get one. I have been applying since the beginning of the semester to a wide range of internships and asking professors about research opportunities, but I have not heard back from most of them. I have not received any solid offers as well. I know ""internship season"" was ideally last semester, but there's nothing I can do about that now.

I have a 3.4 GPA and some project experience, so I hoped I would at least hear back from companies. However, at this point, I am considering taking next semester off in order to try getting a full-time internship or research position.

Is it too late to receive any offers for the summer, and is taking a semester off viable? Thanks."

680cf8,5,2017-04-27,How do I tell my manager that I want to change teams?,nixt26,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/680cf8/how_do_i_tell_my_manager_that_i_want_to_change/,"I work in a large tech company. I have been in my current team for about 8 months now. This is my first full-time job although I have a Masters with multiple internships. Tomorrow I have my one-on-one with my manager. I want to move out of my team and would like to bring this up tomorrow. Words are hard; what is the best way to put this forward?

Here are the reasons I am not happy and want to change teams:

- I am not passionate about the project(s) our team works on. When I was given the offer I was not given the choice of which teams I could be on. I find no motivation to work on these projects knowing that the company I work for has more exciting stuff happening elsewhere for which I am better qualified.
- I am not learning at a pace I'd like. I have definitely become more productive than I was 4 months ago but the overall pace tends to mediocrity. I feel like my job can be done by just about any programmer out there.
- We almost exclusively use Java. I understand why Java is a more suitable, idiot-proof language for our product but I actually dislike Java and want to work on a project that uses C++. We did a lot of low-level programming writing game engines in my Masters and I do miss that.
- Team dynamics - While people in my team are generally easy to work with, there are a few people who are not. Little rant: Past 3 months I have been working on a project with this SE2 who the manager has appointed to drive the project. This person has very ~~high~~ specific expectations and thinks the project is his baby. Code reviews are a pain. Today I checked-in some code after it was signed-off by two other members in the team. Just a while ago this person walks over all frowned and goes, ""Don't check-in anything I have not signed-off on. I want to see everything that goes in."" Then he goes on to point out a test-case I missed.


My manager is one of the best managers I've had. He will try hard to keep me around but I don't think this is something he can fix. What's the best way to express my points without coming off as rash, pointing-fingers or offending him? "

A lot of it is due to my confidence, social anxiety, and my skills frankly. I settled for an info sec position at a major bank, the problem was that it was dealing with the mainframe info sec. I was gaining skills but not marketable skills, and quite frankly I think I'm less marketable now then I was back when I graduated but I am a more confident person. The work is easy, boring, I don't do much, I telecommute, and I get paid well (65k), but I am miserable and am pigeonholing myself.

I tried to transition in a developer role this past year but got no interest. At that point I thought that my only chance was if I went to graduate school to get more recent experience and get that piece of paper, and hope it'll make me more attractive to employers. I enrolled this past January, I tried again applying for developer/programming roles, and have been receiving no interest and rejection emails ever since. So I thought I should apply for internships, its been four months, but I landed an offer for an application developer position where I'll do web dev for a decently known retailer, I know they have been recently trying to transition their site from jsp to react.

Now I have this dilemma, do I leave my full time job that pays 65k for an internship that will set me up for the career I want and is a lot more marketable but only pays $15 per hour and is temporary? Is it worth the risk? FYI I live at home right now and have a monthly car payment. I have about 7-8 months of paychecks saved up. I am definitely leaning towards the internship but a little hesitant because I know that it is a big risk.

tldr; Should I leave my mainframe infosec job for a developer internship? Thoughts?"

683sde,3,2017-04-28,Do I stay the path or do I take a risk?,Advice_acc_throw,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/683sde/do_i_stay_the_path_or_do_i_take_a_risk/,"I feel like I'm stuck in a no man's land and hopefully someone can help with perspective or advice. I don't want to belabor this, but backstory is needed.

In college I made As and Bs at first. I had a freak medical issue that required me to withdraw in my first semester since I would be functionally disabled for weeks. I returned to school and would make the dean's list a few times, but the fact that other freak medical issues would happen as well as stresses related to my family situation led to depression. I had to withdraw some more and also failed classes. I took some time to gather myself and things got a little better, and I was able to finally graduate, albeit a year and a half later than I had planned and with a shitty gpa.

I wasn't born in America and my parents decided to settle in a small town in the southeast, so there were limited opportunities near my hometown. I applied to companies across the country. But I was getting immediately filtered out of jobs applications. That I have a BSEE from georgia tech means nothing to employers, because my GPA was not good I wouldnt even get call backs. Why interview a candidate for relocation if their resume is trash anyway?

The one job I could find was due to making a public resume on monster or something, and a staffing company found it. I didn't have any options so I took it. I figured I use it as the internship I never had when in school.

I am currently employed as a glorified temp, I make 30 an hour but that's it. I guess I'm more formally a consultant but it's pretty trash as a job, I get zero benefits of any kind. No pto, shitty health insurance, and no other compensation than a weekly paycheck that is 100% dependent on hours worked. The work is incredibly boring and most days I don't even do anything but sit on reddit. I get paid by the staffing company for working at the actual company, but the actual company's contract with its client is ending this year so this job is disappearing.

I really hate living here, there's nothing to do and no one to meet for anything. I feel like I have to devote a whole day to justify going into the city because it's two hours round trip. I don't live in a trendy place like the northern suburbs. The combination of a boring dead end job and living in an isolated small town wears me down every day, I usually just go home and veg out with TV or movies or video games until the next day.

Family commitments kept me from applying for jobs last year. I applied for jobs in January to a bunch of companies in cities I think would be nice to live and work in. I've spent my whole life in Georgia and I've never loved it, and I know there are places that are supposed to be booking for someone like me. Atlanta has jobs in software, but I only know C at an academic level since my background is electrical, and I have always felt a need to go west.

I interviewed for the only job that called me back from this year's applications, and they were pretty quick to make me an offer. The job is going to be very steady and the offer is great and even better than I had asked. Its in a nice sized city that also has a big college, so I'm guaranteed to find things to do for people my age. Low cost of living, interesting sights, and I'll also get benefits and time to actually enjoy living. However, it's a job in defense with a DoD contractor.

The most immediate issue is that it now takes months to get security clearance. I have to fill up a huge questionnaire that will be verified by the government, and that is a process that is taking months. My brother had a job for a DoD contractor years ago and it took him a week to get interim clearance, and for me it might take six months.

Here's my problem. I could just quietly stay in this awful job and wait for clearance, at that point I can quit my current job and move. It's just going to be very boring. I made a commitment and I can keep my word, for whatever it's worth.

However, I am not sure if I should keep applying for other jobs. I have no reason to think that my accepted offer would be rescinded, but the fact that it will be months before I move and start getting paid and get those benefits does bother me. The fact that my job searches have turned up so little is very discouraging. For as great as my accepted job will be, it kind of feels like I still don't have any choice.

I don't know if applying for jobs would be grounds for rescinding this offer, I certainly don't want them to find out. But I thought I would be able to apply in January and start a job by March, and its almost May. "

If any CS/EECS majors can help me out, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!

1) How hard is it to get research positions and what do you have to do to get those positions? Would it possible be get a research position as a freshman? As a sophomore? I know there are 800+ CS/EECS majors, and that number is rapidly increasing, so I expect that competitions for research positions is becoming more competitive.

2) How do I become a TA for a lower division computer science class as an undergraduate? How competitive is the application process?

3) Where did you intern over your summers, and how did you land your interviews? How do most people get their interviews? (ex. Career Fairs, Referrals, Applying Online)

4) I know Berkeley has a “big name” in the field of CS, but how does that actually help you when you’re applying for internships/jobs?

5) At a career fair, how does a recruiter from a big company like Google decide who to offer interviews to if there are 1000 CS majors showing up at their booth?

6) Do you feel that it is hard to find internships because Berkeley is so competitive? Or do employers not compare students within schools?

7) What percent of CS/EECS majors get interviews with the “big name” companies? (ex. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon)

8) What CS related clubs/activities are there on campus? I heard that some are competitive to get into, so are there any that readily accept freshmen?

9) How do I find people to study with?

10) How do I meet and become friends with upperclassmen? I’m hoping to do so so I know someone who can give me advice about getting through Berkeley.

11) Is this a good schedule for first semester: CS 61A, EE 16A, Reading and Composition, L&amp;S breadth"
684dgg,135,2017-04-28,The Third Demon Seed (Part 1),PsychoPost,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/684dgg/the_third_demon_seed_part_1/,"**""Do you know where your son is?""** An unnaturally deep, artificially modulated voice asked me over the phone. 

I glanced at Mr. Neffle (my boss) in the office across from mine. He was sucking the powdered sugar off his fingers after his morning donuts. Then at Mikey the intern, trying to figure out how to make copies (for the tenth time). It was an ordinary day like any other, except for the private number which called my cellphone. 

If this was a joke, then I wasn't laughing.

""I think you have the wrong number,"" I answered cautiously.  

**""Jeff Halowitz. Sixth grade. Do you know where he is?""** the voice repeated. I checked my watch and swallowed involuntarily. 9:50 AM. He had to be in school.   

""Of course I do. Who are you?"" 

**""No you don't. He's with me,""** the voice rolled melodically in pitch, falling casually as though discussing the weather. **""Do not hang up the phone. You will not tell anyone about this call. You will not contact the authorities in any way.""**  

""What do you want?"" my voice was barely above a whisper. I've heard about these sort of things happening, but never here. Never to *me* or my family. We live in a small town in Arizona. We didn't have much money. We didn't deal with drugs, or gangs, or anything. Besides insubstantial memories from movies, I had no idea how I was supposed to handle this. 

**""10,000 dollars by tomorrow night if you want to see him alive -""**

""Wait, don't you hang up either! Put Jeff on the phone."" 

**""You have 36 hours -""** the voice continued. I had to buy more time. It's not like I could track the call or anything, but any clue could be critical -

""Stay on the line. I'm going to get your money."" I spoke as slowly as I dared. I held the cell to my ear with my shoulder and picked up the office landline to dial Jeff's school. ""Where should I bring the money?"" 

I muted my cell MIC and strained to listen to him while simultaneously holding the other phone to my free ear. 

""Mable Middle School, this is Serene -"" 

""Serene where is Jeff? Is he in class?"" I asked.  

**""Just focus on collecting the money. I will contact you again with details soon.""**

""He better be, or he's going to have some explaining -"" 

""Please Serene, this is urgent. Go check and let me know.""

The cell line went dead. I held my breath until I heard the rustle of Serene returning to her chair. 

""Mr. Halowitz?""

""Yes - yes I'm there. Is Jeff?"" 

""Jeff is in his math class taking a test. Do you want me to give him a message when he's done?"" 

I laughed out loud from relief. The school administrator must have thought I was crazy, but I didn't care. It had all been a prank. A twisted, evil, depraved but ultimately harmless prank. 

""No, that's alright. Thanks Serene."" I hung up and laughed again. But what was that all about? The caller couldn't have seriously expected me to still give him the money when I found out he didn't have Jeff. Unless of course, he was planning to have Jeff by then. 

""Where are you going?"" Mr. Neffle shouted as I dashed out of the office. ""Hey can you bring me a Snapple on your way back? Hello?"" 

""Get it yourself, you fat fuck."" Not the best way to talk to your boss, but all I could think about was getting to Jeff's school before something happened. 

--- 

""Thanks for picking me up dad,"" Jeff said on the drive home. ""I was bombing in there."" 

I couldn't just tell him what I heard. It wasn't right to terrify the boy over something which might just be a bad joke, but I also had to find out if he knew something which could help identify the perpetrator. 

""How has school been going otherwise? Classes good?"" 

He shrugged. 

""No trouble with other kids? No-one picking on you or anything, right?"" 

""Nope,"" he said. ""Where are we going?"" 

""Have you had any fights with anyone online? Or been to weird sites or chat-rooms?"" 

His face went bright red. Right, I was talking to a sixth grade boy. ""Not that kind of site,"" I added quickly. ""I mean where you've talked to people."" 

""Sometimes I'll leave her a comment to make her feel good about herself, but -"" 

""No! Never-mind."" 

""Is everything okay, Dad?"" 

""Yeah. Everything is going to be fine."" 

---

The phone rang again as I pulled into the driveway. Private caller. I stared, considering just ignoring it until he gives up and harasses someone else. I needed to hear what he had to say though. If it was a threat, then I wanted to be ready. 

""Aren't you going to answer it?"" Jeff asked. 

I didn't want to scare him, so I stayed in the car while he got out.  

""So I don't have to go back to school today?"" he asked. 

""Just go inside. And stay in the kitchen where I can see you until I come in."" 

I answered the phone and was immediately greeted by the same modulated voice. 

**""Do you know where your son is?""** 
 
""Yeah, I do. He's with me you lying piece of shit."" 

**""No he isn't. He's with me.""** 

""Who the Hell are you? What do you want? You know you aren't going to get any money out of this, right?"" 

**""It was never about the money, Mr. Halowitz. Do you want to see your son again?""**

""I can see him right now, you stupid bastard! He's making a sandwich in my kitchen.""

**""Do you know where your son is, Mr. Halowitz?""** 

""I just told you-"" 

**""Thank you. Now I know where he is too.""**

The line went dead. 

What. Just. Happened?

There had to be an easier way of finding out when he was home, right? Were they just trying to screw with my head? I got out of the car and headed inside. I wonder if the police would do anything in this kind of situation. It's not like they would leave an officer on guard 'just in case', would they? I probably needed to have some kind of proof or evidence which supported my fear. 

**Come with me, Jeff. We're going now.** I instinctively checked my phone after hearing the modulated voice, but there wasn't another call. That sound was coming from inside my house. 

I ran to the door, but it was locked from the inside. 

""Jeff? Are you in there? Jeff talk to me!"" 

An indistinct scuffle from within, and then - 

""Hey, get your hands off!"" 

""Jeff get out of there!"" 

I *slammed* my shoulder into the door so hard I could feel my shoulder dislocate. I slammed again, almost passing out as the bone grinded around the socket. No good. I ran to the glass window in the kitchen and leapt straight through it. I landed on the table in a rain of broken glass and splintered wooden window panes. 

I was dazed for a moment, but the voice cut through my dizziness and steered my stumbling feet toward the living room. 

**""I do not want to hurt you, but I will.""**

Jeff was unconscious and slung over the figure's shoulder. The man wore a gas-mask which must have contained the voice modulator, along with a pristine suit and long coat. They were headed out the back door. 

""Who are you? Why are you doing -"" I gagged before I could finish the sentence. The pain in my shoulder almost disappeared, but the dizziness was getting worse. I squinted, and the figure was beginning to blur. 

**""Go to sleep, Mr. Halowitz. Your son will be safe, so long as you follow the instructions.**"" 

""What instructions -"" I fell to my hands and knees and threw-up on the carpet. I blacked out after that. When I woke up, my wife Anna and the police were in the room. I don't know whether it was from the gas or what happened, but I feel so empty I might as well be hollow. I explained everything the best I could, but they didn't seem to have any better idea than I did. 

There was only a single lead on the case, but I decided not to share it with the investigators. There was a folded note in the pocket of my pants when I woke up containing the figure's instructions. Yeah it might have helped the police locate Jeff, but they never would have allowed me to carry out the orders, and that might be my only shot at getting him back. 

The note said:  
Henry Iggins   
**** Windsor street (The address was there, but I do not want to involve anyone by sharing it).  
Kill him and your son will be returned.

I understand that with a ChemE degree I can go to grad school for MatSE. And with a ChemE degree I will can go straight to industry with a B.S. The thing is too would a B.S. in ChemE be ok for grad school in MatSE? I heard the curriculum is hard and that grad school would look at your G.P.A., so would starting off in ChemE be much worse than starting off in MatSE? Also is it true a degree in ChemE is more versatile?
Also if I come in as a MatSE wouldn't be easier to switch majors if need be, since its in the college of engineering. But if I wanted to switch to ChemE would I still be able to graduate in four years and still get the same undergraduate experience, like membership in AIChE and internships. It would be great to hear any experiences in either of the two majors regardless if it doesn't answer specifically any of my questions. "

What do I do?",chaotic2h,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/684j82/no_internships_no_side_projects_programming/,"Title says it all. I'm an excellent student and as long as I can follow a structured course that teaches me CS fundamentals I'll do fine. My issues arise with trying to teach myself programming outside of class. Where the heck do I start? 

Do I try to make an iOS app?

Do I try to make an Android app?

Do I try to watch YouTube videos of personal projects?

Do I try to code blindly on my own?

Do I go back to online tutorials such as CodeAcademy?

As you see, whenever I try to teach myself programming, I opt for one of the above options for a few hours and then I just give up after a day or two because I don't feel like I'm actually learning anything. 

This lack of experience in side projects and internships is making me nervous I'll never find a job outside of college. What can I do this summer to supplement my learning in college so I'll be able to secure an internship for next summer. As I'm 21 and a sophomore in college, it's giving me extreme anxiety that I haven't yet secured an internship. I just don't feel like I would qualify for one since the extent of my programming knowledge is making an online Tic Tac Toe game.

Could I still get hired?,messedupowl,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/685h3g/should_i_take_a_drug_test_even_though_i_think_i/,"Hi reddit. Today, I went to an interview for an internship. I am currently a college student, and this opportunity would open up many doors for me. The internship is paid and I am still kicking myself for what has happened.
After the interview, and even a mock-sales pitch, my interviewer told me how impressed she was with me as a candidate and told me she wanted to make me an offer to take the job. I did not hide my enthusiasm and immediately accepted. After this, she showed me around the building and even introduced me to people I would be working with.
Right before I left, she mentioned that my drug-screening information would be mailed in a few days. The drug test involves a hair sample.
I am aware that a hair sample detects usage from up to 90 days ago. I have smoked weed regularly about 3 times a month for the past few months and can almost guarantee I will fail this screening. (I know. I have spent the better part of today crying)
The way I see it, I have 3 options at this point:
1. Take the drug test, probably fail, see what happens after that.
2. Email my interviewer that I have decided to not take the job.
3. Email my interviewer, explaining that I tried pot once about two months ago and feel that I would fail a test, that I am informing her so as to not waste the company's money on a drug test, and express my deep regret. I'm almost positive the outcome of this option would be a response of her saying she regrets that she cannot hire me. 

Can anyone give me advice regarding this situation?
Thanks in advance."

I'm a soon to be grad with an Associates Degree, continuing to work towards a BS.  I'm also in my mid 30s, so my career path is a little shorter than your typical fresh grad.  

I've recently been interviewing with Company A for a developer position.  After getting in there, I find out that they use MAPPER but are in the process of revamping their entire IT and development systems to more typical Java/C#/SQL operations.

I also have a interview set up with Company B as an Java intern.

If it comes down to an offer from both, I'm not sure if there is a clear cut winner.

Pros of Company A: Decent starting pay, amazing benefits, everyone who works there, loves it.

Cons of Company B:  Mapper will do nothing for my future career.  They are eventually getting better but it will take a few years.  Also, downtown of where I live, kind of a pain in the ass to deal with traffic.  

Pros of Company B: Getting experience with Java right off the bat.  People in general seem to like it there but I dont know as much about the atmosphere.

Cons of Company B: Hourly employee, no guarantee of full time position.  Pay will be comparable to Company A though, if offered a position.  Decent benefits but not nearly as good as Company A.  

I like to tell myself that I'm going to be looking for something new every few years, trying to progress, blah blah blah.  But I've also been working at the same place currently for 8 years now.  I get comfortable and it makes it hard to leave. Being in my 30s, I feel like I have less time to bounce around, try things out, etc.  I just want a job I like, continue to like and make decent pay.  And by decent, I mean upper middle class for this area, which isnt hard to do. "

Your advice is wanted.",SlinkyBlue,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/68671a/high_school_history_teacher_looking_to_switch/,"Hey, first, I really appreciate you taking the time to read this. I'm in need of bouncing ideas off of people more knowledgeable than myself.  

A little background information about me: I am male, 27, and I hold:  

California Single Subject teaching credential  
B.A. in Social Science  
Completed 2/4 of the classes for my minor in CS, schedule conflicts prevented completion.   (Intro to C++ and Computer Architecture)  

I've spent the last two years substitute teaching to get experience and knowledge about the field, which for various reasons that I won't get into here (unless you want me to, but chances are you can guess) teaching seems to be a poor career decision for me. I also have 5 years of customer service in retail, and 1 of which was supervisory.  

I have always been a technically apt person. I oftentimes find myself in awe about how little the people around me know about the technology they are using. I have ended up being the one people call when issues arise, and I find myself more interested in the computer systems rolled out by my district than I am by the actual job.  

As I'm sure lots of us here did, I ran into some road blocks in it with my education.  

About 5 years ago, when I was in my Computer Architecture course, I had a lot of difficulty understanding a few key concepts, and I really shut down. I often left the class feeling like I couldn't be successful, and often resented my Computer Architecture teacher because he openly talked down about History and Social Science degrees, which both my wife and I are. That didn't help.

Anyway, I remember pretty vividly. We were on the topic of full adders, and got to the point in the curriculum where we discussed subtraction. We analyzed how the adder circuit can't necessarily perform subtraction, only addition, and studied the one's complement of binary addition as a solution to that problem.

After 10 minutes of reading a book, I understand this completely now. However, back when I was in college and swamped with Social Science research, I literally felt unable to grasp concepts like this. I went to study sessions and tutoring from fellow students and continued to just fail to understand. I passed the class with help from friends, but conceptually felt really lost. I did pass C++ with an A, however, and really enjoyed it. Scheduling prevented me from taking the next class, which was Data Structures.

In other words, years ago, I convinced myself that I wasn't good enough to study CS. Now, I am doubting that this was correct. I am absorbing information and learning things I didn't understand previously. Maybe I *can* do this.

If I were to consider a career, I can envision myself learning the ins and outs of being a system administrator, maintaining and upkeeping a network of systems in a healthcare or educational setting; in the longer run, learning the intricacies of data storage and security interests me greatly.

I am currently looking at classes at my local college that provide an Associates in Networking and Security, and provide an internship along the way. The curriculum has classes that prepare students directly for Network+, Security+, and Microsoft Certified Technician certifications.

I would really like some advice or feedback about your thoughts regarding my teaching experience and how this would look to a hiring manager in the field of IT. Any advice to continue or discontinue this career path in your view is also welcome.

The thought of leaving a profession I've dedicated my entire professional career to thus far is incredibly daunting, and terrifies me. Your knowledge and insight can go a long way for me.

Thanks again for taking the time to read this."

25 Years Old.
I am currently doing 6-month internship at IBM and I have a full time offer starting from July from them as well. They are paying well as per my country standards since I have a masters degree. 
I am doing testing &amp; automation of certain set of features of an existing product for them.

Situation:
I know eventually I will be moving towards development side either within the IBM or outside of IBM.
Lately, I have realized by looking at profiles of experienced software engineers(7+ years experience) that they have certain expertise in a particular field.
Since I have just started my career in IT, the road down the line looks a little blurry for me. The reason is that during my masters I got exposed to whole new sets of tech stacks(MEAN stack, Web Application Dev etc.) and fields(Data Science, ML, AI, Computer Vision, NLP, Cloud(Openstack,Bluemix, Watson, AWS) wtc.) and we know that each one of the have their own industries and clients.

Let me share some of the paths:
1.a. ML+Data Analytics+Big Data
1.b. AI
2. Android/IOS App Developer
3. DevOps and Cloud Computing
4. Web Developer(Javascript and it's ecosystem -  Front/Back End)
5. Python/Java/GoLang/any_popular_language Developer

I am sure that once I make a decision regarding my path I am going to channelize all my energy towards learning it very well including ins-and-out.(For example for ML, i will start with mathematical foundations - Probability, Statistics. Linear Algebra).

How as an inexperienced guy(like me) can determine early in their career as what they want to do in future? 
IBM has really a relaxed environment for work, but doing testing is not my cup of tea in the long run. My learning curve is not at all exponential here.

Also, just for the passive income, I tried to get webscraping jobs (scraped 3 sites earlier)  but couldn't succeed either after submitting countless proposals on Upwork and freelancer.in. Can someone share tips regarding that?"

Should I...

A. Continue working and taking part time classes until I get my degree and make more money

Or 

B. Take the job stick it out while taking classes and hopefully get promoted and make more money. At least I would get my foot in the door with IT

I've been applying to jobs for the past few months and finally heard back from one of them.  I was excited until the recruiter told me the salary over the phone: 40-45k with no benefits (or hardly any, they weren't clear but it sounded like they were trying to euphemize not offering anything), but they said there would be benefits later if it turns into a more permanent position.  I tried negotiating but they wouldn't budge.

About me: I'm an older graduate (31yo) with a decent GPA, have worked pretty much all of my adult life (though I only included the past 10 years on my resume) and, though I didn't do any internships, I have been working a permanent position as a technician at an engineering company for the past 2.5 years running force/pressure analysis for our engineering clients (all different applications, mainly mechanical in nature), writing reports based on this data, as well as other engineering-related tasks, so this should count as relevant experience.

From my research online, it appears that median entry-level salary for mechanical engineers in New Jersey is around 61-64k according to some sources, 70k+ according to others.  I've seen lower estimates but I noticed that they count non-engineering positions in their data (mechanics, maintenance, etc.) but even then, those estimates are in the 50's.

I expressed to the recruiter that I feel that 40-45k is extremely low (especially with no benefits) but he keeps saying that this is normal for fresh graduates.  

I've been around the block in terms of working different jobs in different fields but working in engineering is a new league for me, so I'm not sure if this company is just assuming I'm naive.  Can anyone give any insight into this situation?

I agreed to do an interview anyway, figure it won't hurt, but I'm not sure I will take it in its current condition.  The only reason I'm considering it is because it's been a battle just getting a response at all.  What are all of your thoughts?"

First off I understand that the EECS major is probably the hardest one you can apply for at UCB and I realize that they do holistic reviews but I simply do not know what more should I have done to get in... 

* I've completed all the pre reqs + more.

* My GPA isn't the best (3.80 overall) but I have been a straight A student for 3 semesters in a row now and I think that's a good indication.

* I've been on dean's honor's list for every long semester I've been at my CC.

* I've interned for almost a year at NASA's JPL developing a Python flight hardware testing framework for the Mars 2020 rover. My contract was extended 3 times so far due to my good performance while most interns stay just for 3-4 months.

* I've participated in a two semester undergraduate research program at my CC and have successfully designed and built a consumer product.

* I've volunteered as a supplemental instruction (SI) leader at my college holding weekly sessions to help people with their programming questions.

* I've served two semesters as a VP for my college's honor society. 

* I've volunteered as a breakfast cook for needy families living at a community house.

* I've taken flying lessons during college and I'm getting my Pilot's license soon.

* I've successfully started a startup and grown it to almost 20,000 users. 

* My app ranked first for a challenge at NBC universal's LA hackathon in 2014 (A photo of me standing next to their VP of emerging media was on their website)

I'm not trying to be cocky (I realize other people probably have their own set of achievements) but I seriously wonder if I'm really not good enough for their school?"

I have a paid software engineer internship this summer with one of the big tech companies. Overall I'll make a net income of $25k over the summer, and possibly a job offer for when I finish school.

I did Running Start and have been grinding in college every quarter since I was 16. I burnt out pretty hard last semester, and I was going to take a semester off, but I took it anyways because I hate living at home and want to be financially stable enough to move out and start my adult life asap. It's really hard seeing all of my friends enjoying their late teen/early adult years, and I haven't been enjoying much of anything for the last few years. But I am pushing through anyways in hopes of living a better life where I am independent. I currently have $6000 in subsidized debt, financial aid grants have been pretty good. Was employed for a short while at a low-wage job, but quit because of school workload. I don't want to balance my home situation + job + school workload.

A short explanation of my motivation: 
I was homeschooled and, for the most part, very sheltered most of my life with a controlling parent and a passive parent. I enjoyed my early childhood and wouldn't take it back for a 'normal' childhood, but I basically grew up in a different universe than most in the US. I really had no idea how the world really worked. I started Running Start and began thinking for myself, it massively changed my mindset and way I saw the world. I was changing rapidly for two years, and worked on myself a lot because I needed a lot of work. Now I'm basically on track socially/culturally with most of society for my age. I still live at home with the controlling parent, because I have nowhere else to go if I don't want to pay rent + higher car insurance, etc. But I am very driven to move out and continue with self development to live the life that I want to live.


I'll graduate next year, probably with multiple job offers w/ good pay due to my prestigious internship. My debt may increase or decrease, depending on what decisions I make during next school year (move out, spending habits).


I'm very excited about the changes that are coming in my life, but I am also very burnt out. I need life advice for when I move out and begin my adult life working in a professional environment.

EDIT:
My original post didn't make this very clear, but basically I want any advice you feel that I need. I also am unsure what to do during next school year, whether I move out because I have money, or push through all of it another year so that I can graduate possibly out of debt and better financially.

I am currently doing 6-month internship at IBM and I have a full time offer starting from July from them as well. They are paying well as per my country standards since I have a masters degree. I am doing testing &amp; automation of certain set of features of an existing product for them.


Situation: I know eventually I will be moving towards development side either within the IBM or outside of IBM. Lately, I have realized by looking at profiles of experienced software engineers(7+ years experience) that they have certain expertise in a particular field. Since I have just started my career in IT, the road down the line looks a little blurry for me. The reason is that during my masters I got exposed to whole new sets of tech stacks(MEAN stack, Web Application Dev etc.) and fields(Data Science, ML, AI, Computer Vision, NLP, Cloud(Openstack,Bluemix, Watson, AWS) wtc.) and we know that each one of the have their own industries and clients.


Let me share some of the paths: 

1.a. ML+Data Analytics+Big Data 

1.b. AI 

2. Android/IOS App Developer 

3. DevOps and Cloud Computing 

4. Web Developer(Javascript and it's ecosystem - Front/Back End)
 
5. Python/Java/GoLang/any_popular_language Developer


I am sure that once I make a decision regarding my path I am going to channelize all my energy towards learning it very well including ins-and-out.(For example for ML, i will start with mathematical foundations - Probability, Statistics. Linear Algebra).


How as an inexperienced guy(like me) can determine early in their career as what they want to do in future? IBM has really a relaxed environment for work, but doing testing is not my cup of tea in the long run. My learning curve is not at all exponential here.


Also, just for the passive income, I tried to get webscraping jobs (scraped 3 sites earlier) but couldn't succeed either after submitting countless proposals on Upwork and freelancer.in. Can someone share tips regarding that?"

I am a IT-security student and I am supposed to have an internship for 11 weeks but due to reasons out of my control I haven't started yet.
I am currently sitting at home chillin/studying all day. I am a passionate Python programmer, like I can literally study Python 10+ hours
a day without getting tired of it.

 

I consider myself an intermediate Python3 programmer (hopefully on the way to being advanced). I like getting to know how it works under the
hood, etc... I have experience with many packages from the standard library, some matplotlib, did a couple projects with Django, can't wait to try out Flask. 

 
I love metaprogramming.

 

My question (this isn't just a 'look how good I am' kinda post) is this: I have 0% official training in Python or programming, have 10+ years
experience with GNU/Linux from private use and would really love to fill this free time I happen to have with some part-time programming job.

 

As I said in the beginning I am supposed to start an internship so I am not looking for huge projects, just something to keep my mind occupied
with while I am in this unemployed 'limbo'.

 

Since I don't really have experience in real-world-work-scenarios I don't expect huge payments or big responsibilities. I want something to get my
hands dirty with, collecting some real-world experience and maybe get an extra buck on the side. What would be the best way to go about this?
I tried to look for telecommuting Python jobs but it's all either senior-positions or junior with at least 3 years experience (which I have but not
from company work, just being randomly interested in it and devoting my free time to learning).

 

Suggestions/critiques/useful links are very very welcome :)"

68akrk,1,2017-04-29,Accidentally became a teacher - some advice?,Maybe_teacher94,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/68akrk/accidentally_became_a_teacher_some_advice/,"Hello! I came across this sub and thought you all might be able to give me a little guidance or help. This is going to be a VERY long winded post so I'll be sure to include a semi-succinct tl;dr at the bottom!

I have never had any intentions of teaching. Not even vague ones. Hell, even a year ago I would've openly said that I really don't like being around kids. My mother is an art teacher for pre-K through 8. I had those art genes passed down to me, and art was always sort of my focus, so I wanted to find a way to do something art related, but still get paid. So I went to school for graphic design. 

I worked a variety of graphic design internships, graduated with a degree in it, and always enjoyed myself even if I didn't seem to love it with the same passion a lot of other people had for it. I even think I'm actually pretty good at it sometimes, but again, at the end, I wasn't loving it.

I thought maybe I was just burnt out on design, so after graduating I decided to not look for a job and just take the summer to clear my head and work on personal projects (writing music, doing my own art projects) that had been shunted aside during school. At the end of the summer, right when I started applying to design jobs, my mother found out she would need to miss a good chunk of time teaching on sick leave.

Now, the school she works at isn't especially flush with available substitute teachers, especially ones that could take over art duties. They also weren't making many moves to help her find a replacement (which is shitty considering her circumstances at the time...the administration at the school is questionable at best). So she floated the idea to me of me taking over for a few months for her.

The idea both made and didn't make any sense. I had no experience teaching, BUT, I came from an art background, I knew all the projects just from being around her and from helping her with my dad to put up the school art show in the past, AND she wouldn't have to write out months and months worth of detailed instructions for a substitute unfamiliar with art and the projects. She could just feed me info as and when I needed it. 

So I said yes. My Mom is one of my best friends in the world and I wanted to help her when she needed it. So to start out I shadowed her during the school day for a couple weeks, to get the feel of how she teaches and how the classes were run. Basically, it was a super compressed student-teaching experience.

When it came time for her to leave school for medical treatments, that bit of confidence I gained from shadowing/co-teaching with her went a long way. Another help were the other teachers. While the administration is nothing to write home about, many of the teachers at the school are brilliant, brilliant people who were incredibly helpful and supportive. It also helps that I actually HAD many of them as teachers years and years ago when I was in elementary school there.

From October to February, I was the art teacher there. It took me a little while to realize it....but I loved it! Despite having to get up earlier than and job I'd previously had, despite not knowing much about teaching, despite the circumstances under which I took the job, I realized that there was never a day that I didn't look forward to going into work. (Well, expect maybe Tuesdays, but that's just because I had a 6th grade class from hell on Tuesdays!)

At the end of my tenure there I realized I was sad about leaving. I loved helping the kids with each problem they came upon in a project. I loved seeing them make progress through the year. I loved getting to know them, joking back and forth with them. Basically I loved teaching. Conflictingly, I was also incredibly happy to be leaving, since it meant everything went as planned and my Mom was A-OK and ready to teach again!

Before I left, I was approached to be on the substitute list. I thought it'd be good to have some small cash flow coming in while looking for design jobs again, and having already enjoyed myself there I accepted the offer. 

Now again, this school is super short on subs, so I've ended up being back there quite a bit. A few weeks ago, an aide for Pre-K ended up having to be out of school for two weeks, so I filled in there, and I loved that too. I enjoyed that maybe even more than teaching art to all the grades once a week. It was great to really get to know the different personalities and learning styles in the class. Paired with the natural curiosity of that age, and how much I enjoyed the silliness and playfulness of a pre-K classroom, and it was a blast.

Now I'm back to applying to design jobs. I'm actually more excited about design than I've ever been, but teaching has just been stuck in the back of my mind. It's pretty much been the most fulfilled in a professional capacity I've ever been, but, at the same time, I haven't had a ton of work experiences outside of internships. It wasn't just being around the kids either, I had a lot of fun thinking of potential curriculum ideas during my time with art, and had a lot of fun thinking of how to set up a classroom (how to paint the walls, maybe murals, I like working with my hands, so building low shelving for art supplies, etc.) 

I'm considering teaching more seriously than I would have since a few things happened. A few of the teachers asked me if I was going into teaching as a career, since they thought I was pretty good with the kids. My mom has also told me about encounters she's had with parents, where their kids had told them they really enjoyed having me there. I knew that *I* was having fun with it, but had basically no idea if I was doing a  good job. Those little bits of validation and encouragement from other people getting paid to do this (teachers), and people that were paying me to do this (parents) made me think about it a bit more seriously than I would have otherwise.

I'm just a bit lost at where to go from here. Would I need to go back to school for teaching to find a good job as a teacher? I feel like I owe it to myself to get a job in design and see how I like it, but I don't know if I'm wasting my time doing that. Did any of you stumble upon teaching without really meaning it? Is there any major part of teaching that I haven't touched on at all that you think is important for me to consider?

**TL;DR: Never meant to teach, ended up teaching art as a long-term sub, loved it, taught as a general sub, loved it more, now have no idea if I should keep going in my original career direction, or go back to school for teaching. Even though all my questions were a bit vague I'd love any input or feedback at all, thanks!**"

edit: just realized that title reads horribly.

So i'm getting ghosted by a certain large, rain-forest company, after killing the technical interviews. Don't know what to do.
Here's the process: So I got a referral to the company and applied for SDE internship positions in Feb. I got a ""form"" to fill out early April. Then a recruiter called to clear up a clerical error they made. Then while we were talking, she asked me if I was interested in ""insert Specialized team"". I said yes because I had some relevant research/experience in the field.

She said I would have two normal phone interviews, then a special interview for the specialized team, which was a very difficult interview.

However, she said if i passed the first two and failed that one, she'd just put me on a normal team.

I had two interviews on April 17 and April 19th. I killed both of them. One interviewer actually said ""wow, i'm really impressed"". I've definitely failed interviews in my time, but I did exceptionally in these.

Then we went about scheduling the third interview with the special team, and the scheduler said she was having problems getting the interviewer. It was supposed to be on Tuesday of last week, then rescheduled to Thursday, then she just stopped replying.

I was trying to keep in contact with them as best I could, through their reschedules and whatnot. But they eventually just stopped replying to my emails.

I think I may have sent too many emails. I was sending them quite often, as I do with other companies, giving updates to them, asking for updates, etc. It's usually well received by the HR, and I was very courteous.

After they stopped responding, I sent a final one, requesting that I be considered for the normal teams and not the specialized one, because summer is so close by.

note: one of the HR reps called me and seemed very upset about our conversation, when I was asking her questions about the interview process. Kept sigh'ing into the phone, etc. I know they're worked really hard and people told me not to think too much about that, but I have been.

I'm a little worried that she ""lost"" my application because of that.

I have a decent GPA (3.1 cumm , 3.3 in major), long story short was hit with a few very difficult professors in the last year which took a toll on my GPA, I say decent in that I know it could've been a point or or two higher. I don't think my GPA will hinder my ability to get a job ,so I will leave that out of the equation. I also have intern experience with a large telecom company doing network analysis.  I have fairly good analytical skills and good at working with teams (I actually prefer working with other and bouncing ideas around). I have a strong interest in automotive, and would like to see where that could go for me, but I don't live in the region of automotive manufacturers and would prefer to stay home my first year or two. I am mainly taking interest into big data/ data science because of a course I am currently taking in Big Data. Aside from that I have started my job search fairly late, have gotten two legitimate interviews which I basically bombed both because I wasn't prepared. Although I know I bombed them I know what I did wrong and have taken them as learning experiences. Throughout my college career I have been a highly motivated student , but the last few months have been a huge decline from how I previously treated responsibilities. With that I know how to work and buckle down and get what I need to done. 

My Dilemma now is I feel like the job search is insanely difficult and is basically a roll of a dice, I feel like websites like Linkedin and Indeed are extremely overwhelming. It feels almost impossible to sift through the information and find jobs which I feel like I have a shot at being a match for. I typically search with keywords like software dev/engineer  and python with the entry-level filter on. the majority of what is coming up is 3-5 year experience and I would say between 60-70% of jobs are looking for people that know some web development (which I have no experience in) . With this it's becoming fairly demotivating. So now I'm exploring ideas of gaining some type of big data certification and/or doing a coding boot camp primary with the goals of learning full-stack development.

Any suggestions of comments are welcome.

68cdno,12,2017-04-29,Really stuck between computer science or computer engineering and would really appreciate some insight,walkietalkie753,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/68cdno/really_stuck_between_computer_science_or_computer/,"So I'm 2 weeks away from finishing my freshman year as a computer science major.  So far I've taken intro to Java programming, data structures/algorithms, and discrete mathematics.  I found all the classes pretty easy even though the averages of them are in the 50s.  However I hate discrete math and proofs.  Data structures/algorithms was interesting but most of it felt pretty trivial.  This has me thinking I may belong in the computer engineering field since I really like circuits/physics/calculus which is no where to be found in the computer science program at my university.  Everyone tells me I should stay with computer science because of the jobs and higher salary.  I enjoy programming, but I would like to get a job that isn't strictly just programming.  I am doing an internship right now as a backend developer and find it very boring as it's basically gluing together various API's, trouble shooting tedious bugs, then getting it running on a server.  Do you think I should make the switch over?  I need to get a job in NY state when I graduate.  My interests are robotics, computer architecture, computer security, embedded systems, financial tech, and machine learning.  I've heard things such as most of the computer engineering jobs are now in China.  I've also heard the whole you can get cs jobs as a CE major, but if I'm going to get a cs job I don't see why I wouldn't just do cs.  Any input will be greatly appreciated.  This choice is killing me :(

Also just another quick add on, the CE department is part of the electrical department at my university.  So the only cs courses I'm required to take in addition the the ones mentioned above for CE are operating systems and advanced unix/c programming.  I could probably do a cs minor to take algorithms and databases as well.  

Edit:  sorry I've been answering on my other account, I didn't even realize I was doing this.  But thank you to everyone, you guys really gave me some great advice. "

68dqpz,2,2017-04-30,Should I keep pursuing an offer close to another internship's start date?,PhilKnightCosplayer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/68dqpz/should_i_keep_pursuing_an_offer_close_to_another/,"I'm currently a CS sophomore. A national lab recently sent me an offer letter for a summer internship contingent on a successful background check and drug test. The background check takes 4-6 weeks, and from their site that lets you check up on the status of the background check, I'm currently waiting on high school verification. However, I've already accepted another offer with a medium-sized company in Atlanta, whose start date is in mid-May, and I don't know if my background check will complete before then.

My preference would be the national lab internship, since the stuff I'd be working on is more to my interests. However, I don't want to renege on my original position at this point, and then be left with no internship for this summer should my background check fall through for some reason.

So here is my question:

* Should I just take my original internship if a background check for the national lab position doesn't come in before the original internship's start date? or
* Should I renege on my original internship now, and hope the background check comes through?"

I had an internship at a nuclear powerplant in the operations department over the summer. So far my job search has not been going well, a couple interviews here and there but nothing has gone through. I'm starting to get a bit discouraged because this field seems to be so specialized that no one wants to take a chance on me if its not a direct nuclear job. So my question is, what are some good places/fields I could apply to that arent directly nuclear vut still have a chance of getting with my degree? I want a nuclear job but theres so few openings I feel that I could spend my time sending out more applications and I wouldnt be opposed to a non nuclear engineering job. I really just want to start working. Thanks!"

I'll mostly be doing testing and maintaining code. After months of applying this was my best offer.

I also applied and got a full scholarship for a CS Masters with a 35k yearly stipend. I'll have to work with the government for 2 years in the cybersecurity field after graduation.

Which is the better opportunity? I'd like my career to be more in line with software development but I'm not sure how many roles in cybersecurity there are for programming vs networking or pen testing. Also cybersecurity is very in demand so I am tempted to continue school.

The scholarship requires me to be a full time student so I'll only be able to focus on my courses. But I am guaranteed paid summer internships with government agencies as long as my grades stay up.

68gwi0,16,2017-04-30,"SO is 1 year out since graduating, still unemployed",Comtn14000,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/68gwi0/so_is_1_year_out_since_graduating_still_unemployed/,"Hi everyone,

So my SO just turned 23 this month and graduated in May of 2016 with a degree in polisci. He graduated with a solid GPA (3.6) from a pretty good state university in NY, but didn't do internships because he had to work to help pay for his education. He has 2 years of administrative experience from working at his university library and a myriad more in retail.

We live together in CO, and are living off of my income. I make $11.50 an hour and am working full time, and with tips I net about $1700 a month, which leads me to break even after paying everything. He initially had just started his first full time job when we first moved in together, but quit because he hated it and thought he'd be able to find another job quickly. This was in mid November. 

I try to help him as much as I can. I recently got my job within the last two months so we were struggling before then, which is why I do not mind it all being on me right now because it was on him and his savings previously. I helped him write a strong cover letter detailing his experience and desirable traits, and I have his resume and cover letter files so I apply to jobs for him often. I feel that he has somewhat given up though because of how difficult job searching has been, as he has been led on by hiring managers and never received calls back after interviews. 

I do not blame him for his situation and know that degrees don't hold as well of a standing in this economy as they used to, but I am beginning to worry. He isn't getting calls back for the entry level administrative type jobs I apply to for him, and he understandably doesn't want to do retail jobs anymore. He just wants to get a basic at least $15 or $16/hr job doing office work so that he can get the experience he needs to find something relevant to his major. 

This makes me apprehensive because not only is he low in spirits because of his situation, but also because the plan was for the both of us to work full time and both be able to save up money and be stable. I had a different upbringing than him and do not have the support of my family so I could not go to college right away after high school and need to provide everything for myself. I still need to buy myself a car and build up a bank account, and would like to start attending, at the least, a community college by next spring (side note: I am younger than him). 

I guess what I am asking is, what is the best way to help my SO find an entry level job that could serve as a stepping stone towards doing something with his polisci degree? Also, is there anything else I can do to help him in his search? Should I get a second job in the meantime? Any advice is greatly appreciated, and I thank each and every one of you that takes the time to read this and provide some insight.

My goal is to get a job, preferably remote, during my first year into college so that way I can pay it off (tuition's going to cost $10-12k for the college I'm aiming for + I plan on living with parents). Also, balancing school and work shouldn't be too much of an issue.
