cw7xk,7,2010-08-01,A recent development,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cw7xk/a_recent_development/,"I've been searching for some answers to cut to the core of my dysthymia.  I decided to start reading some of the entries from my journal, which I started writing when I was 18 (I'm 24 now). I realized that back then, I was wrestling with a lot of the same issues that I am now. I didn't know what to do with my life, I didn't know why I was sad and upset all the time (though I understand it more now), and I had an extremely low level of self-esteem/confidence. I started to put the pieces together and I realized that, for the better part of my life, I've been going through the motions, and I never really asked myself ""what do you want to be when you grow up?"". I simply never had an answer. I was asked that a few years ago when I was at a stupid orientation for the second time at Starbucks, the guy was asking everyone ""what did you want to be when you were growing up?"" and I was the only one that stopped and said ""I don't know... I never had an answer"" and he made some stupid quip about how it's ""always good to dream"". I never put much thought to that. When I graduated college almost 2 years ago I was so depressed, and now I realize it was because I hated my major, and I did it because everyone said I was ""good at it"" and ""I could make a lot of money"". I really tried hard to like it. I tried a few jobs and an internship related to my major, and I just got fired from the one I had because my boss said I didn't like my job enough. I look at all my friends who have jobs that they like, they work hard and party after, and all I can think about is how I wasted a whole day at work and now I have to catch up on the things I like to do, not get totally wasted and celebrate. 

What this triggers in me is really negative, suicidal thoughts. Thoughts that I will never figure out what I want in life, and that all of these ""interests"" (music, audio engineering, film, photography, art in general, skating, social issues, whatever) are just hobbies that I will never be that great at, and that I could never possibly be able to survive on. The major that I chose (Info Systems) completely destroyed my love for science, because it reduced it to a service industry, just like my job right now, delivering pizzas. I worked with computers my whole life, but don't think I ever thought to myself ""I want to be a Database Admin/System Admin/Project Manager/Programmer when I grow up""...and yet I wasted 4 1/2 years learning how to do that. I moped around for the last 18 months wondering what happened to my life.  I think a lot of it goes back to depression, because a lot of times, I can't tell what makes me happy anymore.. nothing does, not even the things I like doing, so how can I decide on one thing to do? I wonder what if I chose to do one of these things, and then I wake up in 5 years and wonder why I'm doing this all over again? What the fuck is the point? I don't even know where to begin now. I feel like I was robbed of the past 10 years of my life because of depression and now I have to start all over again, with no direction, no support, no one to relate to. Everyone is off reaping the benefits of a life of hard work, traveling, working jobs they love, getting married, and I feel like I'm 14 all over again. Has anyone else gone through this? Can anyone tell me what to do? I almost don't even care anymore. I feel like just dying at like 32 or something, so I can at least live out my 20's and give up when it's over. It's incredibly short sighted, but that's the story of my life I guess."

I am a graduate student about to finish my masters in structural engineering. The US-school I have attended is well known for its petroleum and offshore oil-industry links. I have internship experience in the offshore oil industry, and I'm currently seeking a full-time position for after my December graduation.

Anyway, I'm conducting a broad search, and I'm not limiting myself to domestic positions. I know Norway has a large offshore oil industry and may need qualified technical people. I am fluent in only English, but I could certainly learn another language. I'm interested in Norway because it seems to be strong in the offshore oil industry, and I do have a fair amount of ancestors from Norway (though this was several generations ago, too far back to have an impact on immigration.)

Basically I'm wondering if anyone has any experience on this. Does anyone know anything about the Norwegian offshore oil industry? Is there a need for technical people from abroad? How does one go about finding such a position?

This is a crosspost with r/Norway. I'm also wondering about similar technical positions in Germany and other Northern European countries."

I'm super excited about many of these changes, but I'm afraid I'm going to not handle it well.

I went to high school with this guy, never really talked to him then, then we ended up going to the same college. We have a lot of the same friends and soon we become friends. He's a pretty typical geek - into video games, building computers, and doing web start-ups. So he did have some experience with start-ups and he and a buddy of his started up a web design firm. I ""applied"" to be an ""intern"" at this company and I use this term loosely. So I talk to his buddy and he said he has a project for me. To essentially make a hot or not site. His partner (lets call him Chuck) offers to help me out and I being a proud person, decline and just start coding away in php. The deadline comes, and I'm not finished and I meet up with Chuck and give him what I have and apologize for not finishing. My friend (lets call him Alex) calls me a couple days later - bitches me out on the phone saying things like ""I knew we should have never hired you (btw I was never paid nor offered anything) and we lost a big contract because of you and you really disappointed us and don't ever bother talking to me again"" - I never said anything to him (nor saw him again) since then. A couple of weeks ago while I was back home with the parents, he apparently came over with his brother after hanging out with my roommate. My roommate allows him into my room and he starts to mess with my computer (thankfully I'm running OS X and have a bunch of extra security installed and he isn't as smart as he thinks and wasn't able to do much more then log into the guest account) but it still really pissed me off. You'd think my roommate would stand up for my privacy and not let other people into my room. 

Everytime I see something about him on facebook or someone mentions him - I feel guilty for letting a friend down (when really that much responsibility shouldn't have been put on an ""intern"") and angry that he is a douche for yelling at me w/o letting me respond and then messing with my computer later.

The money does not align with the demands and I'm just over the advertising industry - it's not remotely what I thought it would be like when I was in college.  I probably would have benefited from doing an internship, oh well.  

That said, I have noticed a lot of demand for programmers of a wide range of languages and disciplines and some pretty phenomenal pay scales.  I wouldn't think of doing this strictly for the money, but it's an impressive increase over what I'm used to seeing for the typical advertising job.  So, my thought is to go back to school and learn programming.

My questions are,

Do you think the trend in more and more employers seeking programming professionals will continue?  I imagine it can only increase as people spend more and more time on their computers...

What would be a good approach to the educational aspect?  I was thinking something like a post-baccalaureate certificate, but I am thinking that wouldn't be taken seriously by employers?  This leads to a full-on masters in CompSci or something of the like, right?

Clearly I need a bit of direction, haha, and I'm hoping you programming wizards of Reddit can give me a bit of it.  Thanks!!"

**UPDATE (6 months)**: First of all, thank you for all the help you provided. It helped me tremendously to start. 

Now, fast-forward 6 months later. The company has trusted me with the training of 3 interns. I'm starting their last week and it's going well for me. 

At first, I shook off the initial stress of the first month after training and it was gruesome. Job is very stressful but rewarding. I think I found a place where I can grow professionally, as well as personally. If an opening comes up, I may be already promoted. Yeah!"

Should I graduate faster to make up for lost time or should I enjoy my 4 years of college?

Majority atheists, a culture thats chill with a healthy gaming habit. I'm trying to convince my girlfriend (we live together in an apartment in Washington) and she's having none of it so far. We've got two cats, but she says house cats are so rare they have petting zoos for them... :/

Don't mind learning another language and getting reintroduced into another culture. And it's tough to find a place that's more expensive to live than Downtown Seattle. Are there any reasons NOT to live in Japan?

Edit: A bit more about myself because I guess I didn't give enough details. Yes, I don't mind spending 2 years learning Japanese. Life's too short without trying something new. Both me and the girlfriend are white. I'm about to graduate in 2 years with a mathematics/computer algorithms degree.

I have a ton of documented professional experience with PHP, Javascript, modern CSS and HTML.  Much of my work is freelance; however, I have two formal positions that are relevant to my major, one of which I held for over a year, and another in which I am still working.

I have informal experience in Java, and have several games that I co-wrote several years ago (a Mario / Donkey Kong 2D platformer with working AI enemies, and a Pacman clone with original artwork and working AI).

I also am shit-deep in finance work, which is a hobby at this point, but I may want to make something out of it in the future.  I invest in companies using a growth and value investing paradigm, and I am interested in long term growth with debt or equity, or special situation opportunities (bankrupcies, recapitalization, etc).  At this stage, I am reading much more than I am analyzing companies (I started at the beginning of the summer and have gotten through about 11 books).

In addition, I also have a nice amount of experience in UI design (focus is on websites, esp given my stated background above).  I do not have a lot of recent work available, but I do have some.

I have moderate experience in Python, and I would consider myself a seasoned beginner with C++ (I have a lot of experience with C-like syntax and behavior, so it was very easy for me to pick up the basics of the language very quickly).

I would like to secure an internship for next summer.  I learn quickly and I like to be challenged on an intellectual level.  Ideally, I would like to land an internship at somewhere like Google or Yahoo, maybe even Facebook (moreover, a Silicon Valley company).  My lack of experience in Python, C++ may hurt me, but in eight months I am confident I can become much better in those sectors.

The obvious most important first step to obtaining such an internship is to have a kick-ass resume.  Typography and presentation are important, and from what I can see, LaTex will help me better achieve such a goal much more effectively.  Further, the content is also important, what adjectives should I use?  Is my experience more important, or my educational information (e.g. which should be at the top, which should be at the bottom?)?  Should I include anything related to my new found hobbies with finance?  Should I include some of my freelance work?  How many pages should my resume be (one seems like it is the Euro-American standard for most sectors)?  Could I ever score an internship in the finance world being self educated (e.g. an Engineering Degree)?

From my (somewhat limited) experience, I've noticed that the vast majority of my colleagues (myself included) have some kind of entitlement where they/we rationalize only 'working' for only 2-3 hours a day.

Sure, at the end of the day you're being paid to do a job and as long as you do that job and meet utilization, why would you or your manager care?  I can somewhat understand and agree with that, but why is this characteristic so dominant in IT?

When I worked at the bank, the ibanking analysts who just spent 50-100k on their MBA worked 14 hours a day 7 days a week. every. single. week.  And when I say 'worked', I mean actually working, probably rather menial tasks like making powerpoints or discount cash flows, but nonetheless, working.  People who work food/retail get 15 minute breaks every 4 hours.  Plumbers work 40 hours a week, not including travel time.  Yet, I can get away with working 3 hours a day and 'investigating' the other 5 hours.. in between foosball and 2 hour lunches of course.

It's not like there isn't other stuff available after my high-focus coding tasks are done and sure, sometimes shit can hit the fan and you have to spend a night in the server room, but every job has moments like that.  

Lets face it, the perks are incredible.. almost absolute freedom to work how and where you want, as long as things get 'done', laid back work environment... usually with an assortment of foosball, table tennis and other games and high compensation.  

Is there really any wonder why there's that whole lazy IT workers stigma and so much outsourcing?"

At the end of high school we found ourselves drawn to each other and through a month or more of intense flirtation we found ourselves falling in love.  At the end of the summer she had plans to be in Virginia and I in Germany.  We had planned to not be together- that our relationship was an end of high school experiment.  But it wasn't so.  We stayed together- the separation was painful and we deeply missed each other.

She was sexually harassed at school.  The aftermath tore my heart out but we lived through it.  Then through the next few years we lived through starry nights and early mornings.  We were different but we were the same.  She was my love, my best friend, and my alter ego.  Of course there were fights and differences.  But we always found a way through and around.

This summer she went to California.  An internship.  Partly because of Virginia I was worried.  But I was supportive.  A few hours ago she said that she needed to talk and that she didn't think we were going to make it.

There is no definite conclusion on where we are.  We may not be together anymore.  Everything may be fine and I may be blowing everything out of proportion.

The thing is my heart is in my throat.  If we break up I don't know if I'd make it.  I've never thought I'd be the kind of person to say that.  I've been there for friends during hard times and never really understood.  But it's irrational and crazy but I'm just not sure.

I'm just not sure...

I'm not this kind of guy.  I feel a bit silly posting through the tunnel of the internet but this is embarrassing.  I'm not the kind of guy to feel like this, I'm not the kind of guy that wonders if life is worth it.

Literally, a SMALL company, it's just the owner (my boss) and myself. We also have an intern who comes in once a week (he's the son of one of our clients).

I'm getting to the point where I hate my job. Not because of the job itself, but because of my boss. He's a dick. He's pretentious and at times speaks to me like a child. 

For example, he'll start giving me instructions on what to do, so I start jotting them down. Whenever he's not clear on something and I ask him to explain, he'll respond, ""OK. GO....INTO...THE....SERVER...ROOM...GOT THAT?"" And I don't know how to respond when he talks to me like that.

Or sometimes he'll give me clear instructions, but assume I know something that I don't. For example, ""There's a new Dexis x-ray sensor that needs to be installed. Call Dexis support and ask for 'Imaging Support' for instructions."" Ok, I call them, they give me instructions. I follow them and install x-ray perfectly. Call him back to tell him I'm done, and then he says, ""They don't use Dexis software, they use Dentrix."" So I have to start all over again because he forgot to mention that small piece of information and he gets upset over it.

I'm getting fed up with him, but I can't tell if I'm just overreacting or he's really just an asshole. He recently told me he wants to get more business, so he told me to start a ""Marketing Campaign"". I was truly stumped with what I was supposed to do really. I understand that it's just us 2 and I occasionally have to do mundane things around the office (vacuuming and throwing out garbage) which is fine, but sometimes he'll ask me to call a big company and ask stupid questions because I feel like he doesn't want to call himself. Also, he says he only takes clients who are referred from our existing clients (which I've noticed have ties to his family).

He also doesn't understand why people hate Internet Explorer (he thinks we're just rebels who wanna hate collectively on Microsoft), and continues to recommend it to clients who are careless with their web browsing. He also makes me call him every hour to give him an update on what I'm doing, which is infuriating when I'm trying to work on something and I have to step aside and call him so he can ask me 100 questions on the process.

I asked our CEO his thoughts on Net Neutrality after running in to him in the halls one day, and he didn't have a chance to respond right then, but he wrote me this eMail a few days later...

&gt; I am not a total expert in this area.  However, telecom companies are spending billions on their infrastructure.  Over-regulation will surely impede their investments to the detriment of all.  The balance is to allow providers the ability to manage content in such a way to maximize utilization and quality of service.  However, this intervention cannot be allowed to enable anti-competitive behavior, or stifle innovation.

&gt; Privacy regulation is inevitable.  There is already some regulation in the area of Medical records (HiPPAA), credit cards (PCI), and financial services.  I would expect us to add API’s to allow applications to manage security, privacy, and quality of service.  However, I do not see us in a position of making those decisions on behalf of our clients.

&gt; Google is a mix of inferred knowledge (derived from their search traffic) and voluntary knowledge like the on-line medical records.  Exploitation of either of these are unacceptable and any use of the former is intolerable.  

&gt; Have a great finish to your college career.

He also mentioned that he meets with a group of CEO's each month (all in the Silicon Valley), and they share their views on the Economy/Government. The majority of them believe that we're quickly heading in to a double-dip recession, and that Government spending/taxation is killing the corporations of the United States. His final words of advice to the interns, was:

&gt; If you're going to start a corporation, don't do it in the United States.

d50u9,6,2010-08-24,"I need your advice, fellow engineers.  2 job offers and I need to pick one. ",jdv25,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/d50u9/i_need_your_advice_fellow_engineers_2_job_offers/,"I just graduated in May and was searching for full time jobs for several months.  I have had an internship in manufacturing for 4 years and my current internship is where I received the first job offer. 

The first job offer is in manufacturing.  It is with a fairly large (5,000-10,000 employee) company.  It would be a production engineer role.  The pay would be really good and job security great.  However, I want to get into design.  That is where the second job offer (probably) is from.  It is from a design firm that has been doing very well, has their hand in many different industries and needs a new Mechanical Engineer.  It is exactly what I think I want to do.  However, the pay would not be near as good and the job security working in the smaller firm would also not be as good. 

Any thoughts?  should I sell my dreams for a lot more money and job security or screw it and go with the job I want?

Edit:  Thank you everybody for your responses.  I am taking the night to think about it.  I have until Thursday morning to decide.  Every one of you has given me something to think about.  I am truly grateful for the internet strangers. :) I will continue to check this and send out responses to questions that you may have for me. 

Edit 2: I met with the smaller firm again today.  I got a really weird vibe from the entire experience.  Further, there were some dishonesty issues. They flipped my initial responsibilities from design engineering to a project management and manufacturing role, they were not clear on compensation reviews, not clear on vacation expectations, etc.  

I am going to tell the the first/larger employer that I will take their job.  This was based on my 5 and 10 year goals, the culture, the available resources, and a variety of other things.  If any of you have any questions regarding this, feel free to ask!

Thank you all very much for your thoughtful advice.  It was a tough couple of days for me and many of you gave me things to think about. "
d5fkj,2,2010-08-25,I'm a junior in computer engineering. What should I do with my life?,LtArson,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d5fkj/im_a_junior_in_computer_engineering_what_should_i/,"Hey guys. I'm a junior in Computer Engineering at a top 10-ish private university in good-ol' US of A, and I don't know what I want to do after I graduate, but I need to figure it out pretty soon.

I'm taking a heavily software-oriented track in computer engineering, and I'm very good at it and I find it really interesting. The only problem is that I don't enjoy actually doing software development or computer engineering, I just love learning about it. I couldn't picture myself being a software developer at all, and judging from my summer internship I wouldn't enjoy it. Some of my friends were recently hired as software developers for Google and Microsft and Disney but that's not something I can picture myself doing.

There's two things I'm considering, at this point, that I think I WOULD like to do.

I'd like to be a lawyer, but I'm not really sure that's a good idea - I mean, there are a lot of lawyers in this country as-is, and even if I'd like being a lawyer I wouldn't like being an unemployed guy with a JD and a bunch of student loans. Do you guys think that's a bad idea?

I'd also like managing other software developers, I think. I don't know what a job title for something like this would be, though. Product manager? Project manager? Team lead? And I'm not sure what sort of classes I could take that would benefit from something like this, or even if companies will hire new graduates for these positions - I've already taken a software project management course, but I'm not sure if there are any other sorts of classes that would work out for this. I have a decent amount of management experience. I'm working on a web startup with some people I met through a class (planning to push out a beta release in a few weeks), and I have an administrative role in the university's student-run IT department (we employ 40-50 students during the year, and me and a few other people are responsible for hiring, firing, performance reviews, raises, pretty much everything in the day-to-day operations).

I guess what it comes down to is that I like the ""solving problems"" aspect of programming, in the sense that I like to look at a problem and say ""okay, we'd go about solving it this way"", and I tend to be pretty good at that, but I don't like actually solving it (that is to say, writing the code that implements a solution I've laid out). So is there any kind of job that would let me do that?"
