Since graduating, I have been unemployed for 6 months now (""long-term unemployment""), and these have been the worst 6 months of my life, easily. I have no idea how other people do this for much longer than me. Almost half of all unemployed people have been unemployed for 6 months or more, some much longer than this. I feel a deep sympathy for anyone who has had to do this for a long time. 

I hate constantly whoring myself out. I hate pretending to be interested in things I am not actually interested in. I hate having to compromise on what I do because what I am good at isn't hiring. I hate going to bed and waking up late because I don't care anymore. I spend almost every day inside, and on the computer, because if I'm not looking for jobs I feel worthless. I've been gaining weight, I've got more acne than I have had since high school, and I am constantly, oppressively unoccupied. 

It is hard to relate to my friends anymore, because they all have jobs. I can't understand them any more than they can understand me. And probably 4-5 times a week, I find myself in a position of having to explain to others that I currently do not have a job...the sting and anguish of having to admit this is shameful. My girlfriend is still in school, and I visit her often, but I feel like a hopeless hanger-on, the pathetic guy who visits all the time because he has nothing better to do. I hate going to events during the daytime and getting the stare that says ""why are you here?"" 

I am living with my parents, which is awkward for over 9,000 reasons. And my father is retired, so my day is often spent listening to him tell me about the importance of working for a living and how I should move out. 

I have had numerous disastrous interviews for technical jobs that I was not qualified for, and I have moved down the ladder to attempting to secure an internship. So far, still no luck...and most internships require you to be pursuing a degree anyway. I would go for a writing job, if they existed, but I've got to rely on my coding skills now, ironically skills which I learned in college for the express purpose of not being unemployed after graduation. 

I am questioning my abilities, my mind, and my self worth. I have not been happy for a long time now, or anything close to it. I want out of this goddamned prison so I can show the world that I can get things done, that I am at least somewhat competent in something. Right now I am suffering under painful stagnation, boredom, and depression. 

How do you get through your days? Has anyone here managed to find happiness without work? Is this possible?

Small background: Finished my Master last year after 7 years of studying. Have been working 
since then as Web-Developer in an awesome local company (part time) with great benefits. 
I am using part of my spare time to do smaller, paid projects which I have been doing all along 
during my studies. Although webdev wasn't my expected path,
I thoroughly enjoy it since it also crosses with many disciplines I grew fond of, like design,
usability, accessibility, ux, interaction design, and so on. But I'm also interested 
in a vast majority of other areas in CS, despite not having had enough practice in the past few years.
While having one of the more prestigious master degrees in CS you can get around here
I am by no means a superstar nor feel that I'm particular above anyone. I still think I'm a good
programmer with an open mind to learn new things. I have been doing C++ for most of my life and also a few things in other languages.

---

Anyway, I'm not here to ask ""what should I do"" (might do that in a later post, heh) but I have a 
few questions regarding working in the US which might eliminates a few possibilities for me.
I plan on going to the US in december for two weeks and I may want to take the opportunity to look around
the job market then and maybe even visit a few companies spontaneously.

How are working conditions in this field? I often read about health insurance issues and not many
vacation days. Is that the case for the majority of companies in CS as well? Or are there exceptions
in companies where the non-superstar can work as well? What about the _internet_ ones like flickr,
twitter, foursquare, etc?

What are the chances I can land a job in an area I haven't made a mark for myself already for years 
elsewhere? Would the entry salary be ""good enough""? Or would I even need to do an internship first? 
For example, Android development. I have been doing several projects with the SDK but haven't yet
released or finished any apps.

What about part-time jobs; 80%? Do they exist?

Contract-work/freelance possibilities? Is it swamped with freelancers?


My ideal destination would be a large city such as NY, for example."

Of course I said yes, but I told her to give me a week to decide for sure. 

How do I negotiate things like salary, benefits, etc? Is it appropriate to ask for a bit more money for a person in my position?

Note: This is for an entry level IT job and I have some experience in the field during college. Coming out of college I will have roughly $25k in student loans.

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for the advice. Today at my current internship I was offered a full-time job after graduation. This would result in a very small pay difference from the above job offer, would be much less stressful, and offers about the same benefits. I have decided to ask the HR Manager of the original job offer for a deadline extension to evaluate things further. Though this has nothing to do with negotiating, it definitely makes things interesting for me. "

One of the first questions was how to determine if an integer is even or odd. Without hesitation I said ""mod the number on 2 and if the remainder is 1 then its odd, otherwise it is even."" He then asked if there was a more efficient way to do this, I finally worked out that you could AND the number on 1, and if the result is 1 then it is odd.


I ended up not getting the position, but in an effort toward continuous self improvement I went in search of other interesting properties of bitwise operators. Here are some I found or knew previously:

* Left shift can multiply by powers of 2
* Right shift can divide by powers of 2 (remainder is stripped)
* You can determine the value of bit n by ANDing the number on 2^n
* NOTing a signed int flips the sign and subtracts 1;
* NOTing an unsigned int is the equivalent of subtracting that number from the largest possible value.


Are there any other properties of bitwise operators that are interesting?"

e5app,4,2010-11-12,I'm a Computer Science student who's 6 months in to a corporate internship that's leaving me bored and uninspired...,pmstc,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/e5app/im_a_computer_science_student_whos_6_months_in_to/,"Preface: I don't expect Reddit to make any life changing decisions for me, and I do realize that most people my age are at a similar crossroads.
I was just hoping to find some insight/advice from others in the field of Computer Science.

I'm a 21 year old student, currently taking the semester off to continue working my summer internship as an applications developer at a major corporation. For the most part, I'd say the experience has been positive. I've learned A LOT of important things that are not taught in school, and I think it's made me a better programmer and given me a leg up over a lot of other CS students.

However, recently I have found it very difficult to be motivated to do work. Usually the feeling that I get after programming something awesome (you know what I'm talking about) is rewarding enough to keep me going, but the stuff I have been doing has just been plain not interesting to me and it doesn't feel rewarding at all. Between all of the red tape and the increasingly boring material, I find myself on reddit a good bit of the day (far too much, and I feel extremely guilty about it, which makes my job even worse)

I have been pretty much given an offer to return for the summer and to come on board full time after I graduate, spring '12. I feel like the fact that I already have a job locked down means I'm obligated to take it, what with the economy being in the shitter. There are pros, I already have a 401k, I'm getting paid pretty decently well, I'd have pretty good job security, the company is stable and theres a lot of room to move around within the company.

The cons are what bothers me. I do not like the city I live in, and I don't know many people here. I'm afraid of being trapped here with no other opportunities. I would love to take some time off after school just to be creative and do some independent development for fun, but I really feel like it would be stupid to turn down their offer and lose that valuable experience on my resume (I know it's tough for CS students straight out of college.) 

I just feel like this isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life. I do want to do something programming related, just not so structured. I've always wanted to try my hands at coding video games (like every other CS student in the world) but I've never had the time to really focus on it. I dabbled in it towards the end of the summer but I had to go a few weeks without working on it, other things started to fill my time and I lost my motivation.

I've also toyed around with the idea of starting a gaming bar, which I think is the best idea ever, but would probably lose money and end up being a massive fail. I still like to think about it. It's not so much that I think I will ever actually end up doing this, but I daydream about it sometimes. Then again, I tend to be a ""grass is always greener"" kind of guy.

Maybe I'm just being immature. Are there any redditors who manage to make a living off of self-employment/freelance programming? How does that work out for you? What do you do? Am I retarded for wanting to try this with no real resume experience when I have an offer for a stable job?

I have a year and a half to figure things out, and who knows maybe I'll even send out some applications to graduate school (but I dislike the school system and feel like I might be able to learn more on my own), but I have been thinking about it recently because everyone's asking me if I'm coming back and I don't know what to say.

tl;dr: In an internship w/ ""the man"", don't really like it but can get a full time job from them. Is turning this down in hopes of finding something that interests me more a bad idea?"
e5hb1,3,2010-11-13,Just graduated - What should I do now?,CluelessGraduate,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e5hb1/just_graduated_what_should_i_do_now/,"Hi reddit, I'm a long time lurker and first time poster.

Just wanted to add in some background info: 
I'm from Melbourne, Australia and have just graduated from highschool. There is about a month's wait until we find out what Australian Tertiary Admission Rank - ATAR (basically what you rank amongst your peers). 
I am aiming for an ATAR of 90.00 in hopes of getting into Biomedicine in university. The subjects I took are chemistry, biology, mathematical methods (middle difficulty), further maths (easiest), English and Religion/Society (I am not religious btw). 
I have finished my last exam two days ago and am completely free for 4 to 4 and 1/2 months with nothing planned.

During this break I plan to both gain new experiences and earn to bit of money to help support my parents. I have been thinking over the past few months on how I would achieve this during the break. Currently I have two ideas:

1) Start a small 'business' - Basically I was thinking of selling personalized products off www.artscow.com. I really enjoy photoshop despite not taking any artistic subjects in my senior years of highschool. I've made a few things off artscow such as a watch which generates a lot of complements. 
This sparked the idea of doing something like this as no one I've met has ever known about artscow and seem intrigued by these products. It's almost Christmas and I was thinking of firstly advertising online, then door-to-door and dropping flyers off.
I would collect images and take notes of anything the customer would want done to the image and what kind of product, etc. Then show them the finalised design and have artscow deliver to my house, remove all artscow logos,etc and then deliver the items myself.

Personally I really like this idea and would think it'd be fun - but I'm not so sure about the success or the probably a hundred other factors I have not taken into consideration. But there's a few things that are putting me off this idea including how much to charge for certain items vs profit, the fact that I have no business or any other experience and that shipping takes two weeks and it's only around five until Christmas yet I have not started any advertising, audience or anything.


2) Get a job - I've posted a job wanted online and have responded to several ads. I don't exactly have a preference but one particular type of job that sparked my interest is fund raising - which surprisingly gets paid $17/hour. 
However of the two that have responded, I have been rejected because there was a requirement of 18 years old age - I am 17 until the start of university and the other has not responded after I emailed them my mobile. Also I do not have my driver's license which rules out certain jobs. I have some experience in volunteer tutoring in mathematics for younger students, St. Vincent de Paul society at school and helping run retreats for the junior students also volunteer.

So basically I'm not sure what to do with my time. I don't want to waste it like many of my other peers by going out and partying for the whole holiday. I would greatly appreciate any words of wisdom you, the reddit community could offer. Particularly those who have gone through this and could share their experiences which I presume would be 95% of the community.

Also I have applied for a scholarship in uni who also provide an internship program for next year's summer holiday. They contacted me twice yesterday after I sent in my application the day prior. It really shocked me that they would contact me so soon and found out who the number was via google.
However, the first time they called I was sleeping so I missed it. I then contacted them but no one was there so I left a message. The second time, I accidentally hit the wrong button before I could pick up. When I tried calling again, I was directed to the answering machine. I think I've already left a bad impression on them. What can I say to excuse?
Also if I am called to an interview, how can I prepare for this?

Cheers,
CluelessGraduate"

what do?",exemcee,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/e75te/boss_laid_off_went_from_intern_to_only_it/,"**tl;dr Hired on as a part-time intern with only two people in dept--my boss the system admin and me. He got laid off, and I'm out of my depth.**

Some backstory: My cousin is an engineering co-op at a college we both go to, and he got a job at a shingle plant nearby. He mentioned one day that they were having some kind of database issues, so me being unemployeed and needing some money wrote up a little PHP interface in a few hours and gave them a demo and offered to set it up and everything for some money. Instead they gave me an internship, which was really nice of them.

So I show up, and it's a Windows house. No big deal: I grew up with two Linux guys in the family, but I've been using Windows for years. All of the customer-oriented stuff is second-hand after years of figuring it out on my own. I got put to work clearing out the help ticket backlog, imaging computers, cleaning up AD, that sort of thing. My long-term project was migrating Access databases to the intranet with ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL. Took awhile to get the hang of new languages, but I was trucking along.

Now, a few months later, my boss gets laid off. Our company used to be two companies, one bought the other out. The plant I'm at used to be one of the smaller companies, who had local IT divisions. The bigger company did all of their admin stuff from corporate. So, when it comes time to make cuts, the system admin was the first to go.

My boss's boss made a strong case against it, and I think he was right. We just don't have the infrastructure for management from somewhere half the damn country away. Their compromise was letting them keep me, a full-time college student (with a non-technical major) to handle things if shit hits the fan.

I have no idea what I'm doing. I kind of know how networking works on the non-physical side, but looking at the boxes in the room downstairs makes my vision go a bit fuzzy. I keep getting confirmation e-mails that tape backups were successful but I've searched both server rooms and I'm damned if I can find the rack. I don't know how to lay cable, or what it means.

**My request, then, is this.** I have no idea in which ways shit can hit the fan, and afterwards, how to clean it up. Desktop support I can handle, other things corporate will do, but if a server goes down we lose thousands of dollars a minute and it's all on me. I'll go in, power cycle the thing, then admit defeat. What emergency situations do I need to know how to handle? What are some resources that I can use to learn how to handle them?

**UPDATE**: After I went through every bit of documentation my boss left and talking to managers, I feel much less fucked about the whole situation. At least the people at the plant don't have huge expectations and let me keep a very reasonable schedule around my classes, even though I'm not sure what corporate thinks about my situation because apparently they hate returning phone calls and e-mail.

I really appreciate everyone's advice, and it was a huge part it making me feel less like the world was about to end and a lot more confident that I could salvage the situation before something critical happened. From the previous sysadmin's lack of documentation (seriously, the ""network diagram"" was 5 clipart pics with the labels ""server"" and ""plant 1"",""plant 2"") I assume that he had way less responsibility than I assumed and that the corporate office takes care of most of the important stuff.

Thanks again! I'm working on setting up a linux box that I can feel the system out with. (I had mentioned it last month but my old boss told me that IIS doesn't work well with non-Windows machines, which after a bit of research I think is a load of shit.)"

I'm doing an internship in Toronto, and moved into a house for 4 months. The landlord lives upstairs, and I was told I was going to have to share a large room with someone. When I moved in, turns out I was going to be sharing a room with her son. 

Now, for our rental agreement, it was just an email outlining that I would be living there for 4 months, and what was to be expected in the house (cleaning etc.).

Anyways, her son and I became really good friends, and loved playing video games. The thing is the landlord thinks playing video games is ruining her sons future, and they would argue and scream about it all the time. I thought it was just limited to them.

Today, they had another screamfest, and she shut the internet off (this is supposed to be included in the rent, shes shut it off before until her son convinces her to turn it back on.) I had a report due at work the next day, so I went and told her to turn the internet back on and discipline her son another way. She said she needs a few minutes to think about it, and when she comes back, she tells us that both of us have 2 weeks to leave, we are being evicted. When asked why, she says ""Her son is causing her undue stress, and because of that, I am also causing her undue stress (because I play video games with him)."" 

I have no idea what to do?! I don't even know where I would do. I only have 1.5 months left before I go back home. I've always paid rent on time, and have never directly bothered the landlord. 

Please guys help. "

I just finished an internship over the summer writing in-house code for the IT department of a company, but that experience is making me rethink my commitment to this field. The dress code was business casual (button downs and khakis mostly. I didn't mind that part, just using it as a way to describe the type of environment), and I spent everyday sitting in a cubicle cranking out ASP.NET code for the various web apps they wanted to create for their users. In short, I found myself thinking: ""Is this really what I would be signing on for if they hired me full time?""

It sounds dumb, and I'm sure a lot of people would think: ""You're a computer science major... what the hell did you think your job was going to be like?"", but if my internship was an acuurate portrayal of work life, then  I guess it's just a far cry from what I imagined. (Not that I had an accurate idea of it in the first place.)

 I guess endless hours spent with my friends cranking out C code for the projects I had in my Operating Systems class, or our software engineering projects just painted a different picture than what I was introduced to over the summer.

Are there any fun computer science jobs a new graduate can apply for, or are they all stuffy and boring like my internship?!"

Don't ever stop.  I hate asking for help but I know of nowhere else to go.  This is quite the story and I appreciate those who will take the time to read it.

My dad killed himself when I was 10.  Because of this, my mother went bat-shit insane for a good year or so and I was forced to raise my brother (who was 5) by myself.  Granted, my mom would still be at home and work and whatnot, but she was never really there.  We ate pizza 5 times a week, and when we weren't at home, we would rely on either my meager cooking skills (which is one of the reasons I love cooking now) or on my friends' parents, who were really the ones who made sure we were ok every night.  I've never really thanked anyone properly, but I know they know we're eternally grateful.  

I'm now 24.  I tried grad school after getting my BS in Bio (done with the classes, needed to write my thesis but lost complete interest due to my advisor being a complete airhead and not knowing anything about anything), which was a fail.  Let a girl ruin my life this past summer and, along with having to be hospitalized due to being suicidal (which I recognized and made someone take me) and kidney stone complications that lasted half a year, I lost everything.  I had to file bankruptcy due to losing my internship that paid quite well and bills were due.  Moved back in with my parents and now I get to listen to my mom ask me every day if I'm ""going to get all this taken care of.""  I keep telling her there's nothing I can do until I have my meeting with my creditors (which is tomorrow, btw, and I know this was the trigger for my episode tonight) but it's like she doesn't listen.  I can't talk to anyone else about my problems due to trust issues stemming from my childhood.  I tried a therapist, who never really tried to connect with me, so I stopped going.  I tried talking to my other family about it, but it's like no one really understands what is going on in my head.  I don't even understand, but for me, going to a therapist is like watching someone come clean your ""messy room"" and put all your stuff in unfamiliar places - I am the only one who knows where everything in my mind goes.  It may look messed up to everyone else but I know why I think the way I think.  I try to get others to understand what's really going on, but the few times I've opened up to by best friends...I just get stares in the way of ""whoa wtf are you talking about why would you think like this"".  

Three of my family members have killed themselves.  My father.  My dad's mom.  My dad's brother.  Why do I feel like this cycle doesn't end with me?  Why am I letting all the stress of the bullshit that's happened affect me in this way?  Everyone thinks I'm bulletproof because that's how I make myself appear.  I can help everyone but myself.  I don't know why I can't, but I tell myself until I'm blue in the face to follow my own advice.  I never do, even when I know it's what could help.  I stress out over stupid shit due to an innate fear of losing everything (learned behaviors are a bitch) and that was just reinforced this past summer.  I have no idea what I'm going to be doing in the next couple months.  Since I dropped out of grad school in July, I've done nothing but clean.  Trying to get my life back in order.  Throwing out all the shit I don't need or want.  Too bad it's not that easy with your mind.  I would love to be able to forget this past year ever happened.  It's done nothing but destroy me when everyone else thinks it's made me stronger.  I feel like I'm the anchor for my family and have been since my dad died.  I never had a childhood and just want to do nothing for a while, since I was never given that opportunity, but since I'm an ""adult"", I have to conform and ""find my calling"".  Too bad my calling won't make me a fucking dime and isn't respected by anyone in my family (for the record, it's Magic.  My mind just loves the way that game is played, I love playing it, and I'm ranked nationally...but it won't pay the bills).  I'm selling whatever I can just to make it by with my mom and step-dad supporting me in whatever way they can, but I hate, hate, HATE, being a leech.  Most of my extended family abused the hell out of welfare and the generosity of my family when I was younger and I made a promise to never, ever do that, no matter how bad things got.  

I love my family but I feel like I can't be honest with them about anything.  This includes my cousin sexually abusing me when I was 6, as it would tear us apart.  When I do talk to them, my mom demands I go to the hospital for ""thinking this way"" and won't back off for months.  I can't take that stress.  She complains when I'm at home, then calls every day when I'm not, ""just to make sure you're ok"".  I can't take it much longer.  I haven't killed myself because she's already lost a son to brittle bone disease and a husband to suicide.  I can't put her through that; the thought of her going through the loss of yet another son is worse than hell for me.   But I just can't do this anymore.

I rambled, which I apologize for, but that's how my mind works.  It won't shut off, even when I'm blazed out of my mind on the highest quality of green.  SSRI's make me completely numb and I'd rather feel like shit than nothing.  General CNS depressants that should help calm me down do so, but only for minutes at a time, when they are 
""supposed"" to work for at least 3 hours, therefore I've either built a tolerance to them or they just don't work.  Alcohol helps, but since alcoholism runs on both sides of my family, I'm conscious of my intake.  Talking is the best therapy for me...the problem is, I can't talk to anyone here since they have preconceived notions about what is going to ""happen"" whenever I try to talk out my thoughts.  My anxiety is crippling me and I'm already balding due to it... no one in my family started losing their hair until their 50's.  

The stress of this is killing me.  I actually just watched a Nat'l Geo docu on stress today...I know I need to control it.  I just don't know how.  I worry about everything, even shit I can't control, and it makes me feel like a failure.  Why can't I just not give a shit and do what I want for a change?  Every time I try, someone always has some comment that hits me in my soul and sends me back to square one.  I'm a genuinely caring person and would take a bullet for anyone I know, no matter how shittily they've treated me.  I've tried suiting up and going to the gym, but exercise does nothing for me.  I can't run or walk, since my hobbit feet don't allow me to go further (farther?) than half a mile before cramping up to the point it puts me in tears.  I'm no ""fat neckbeard"" (I HATE this term btw), but I've tried for years to lose the weight I need to (I'm 5'10 and 220) but I can't get below 210, so I know diabetes is on the horizon (another thing that runs rampant in my family), and it kills me that I've failed again.

If you're still reading, thank you.  I'll end this rambling with the following.  Eminem is the only other person I know that would know what it's like to be trapped in this sort of mind.  You want to know how my relationship with said-ex who ruined my life was?  Listen to ""Love the Way You Lie Part 2"".  That was it to a T.  You want to know who I am at my soul?  Listen to Recovery as a story, not a CD.  Welcome to my life.  I'm really just looking for another Redditor to talk to...I can't promise I'll be of much help to myself, but to anyone else out there who is going through anything, I'm here if you want to talk.  I want to help.  I just don't know how to help myself."
e893m,9,2010-11-18,When to start learning different language(s)?,DriderProg,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/e893m/when_to_start_learning_different_languages/,"I read Peter Norvig's [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html), and he recommends (as I've heard many others do) learning multiple languages which focus on different paradigms (functional, oop etc).  However, I'm not sure at what point in my learning I should start this branching out to other languages.


**Background:**
I've been learning programming on my own over the past year or so from books and lecture videos and have used several programming languages in connection with them (some C++, Python, C but with little depth beyond syntax).


I settled on C# to try to gain 'deeper' knowledge with a single language, and feel pretty comfortable with approaching the simple problems I try: completed 20 problems on project euler so far, made console window tic-tac-toe to practice using classes/error handling, etc.  Generally I feel pretty comfortable in C# with being able to look up what I need to not get stuck when making small programs.


However, C# seems to be absurdly deep with all the .NET framework stuff that doesn't seem relevant to me at the moment.  I'm not sure if I should just dive in to all the available libraries and such for C#.NET or if that's beyond 'learning the language' and I should just learn that stuff as needed if a project comes up.


For some added context, I recently graduated with an engineering degree in Civil, but I'm very interested in software development and so I'm trying to learn all I can to become a good enough programmer to one day get an internship or perhaps return to school for a formal cs degree.


**My Question:**
I was thinking of branching out by learning some Lisp or Haskell but at the same time I feel like I barely scratched the surface of C#.  Should I stick with C# and just keep learning as I make programs to do various things using the libraries/.NET stuff, or should I try a completely different language now that I have a novice-level experience with simple objected-oriented programming?


Any input is appreciated, thanks for reading!"

e8mtd,28,2010-11-19,My experience obtaining Italian citizenship through jure sanguinis.,mindtehgap,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/e8mtd/my_experience_obtaining_italian_citizenship/,"I just discovered this subreddit, and posted a response to a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/dg5w0/dual_italian_citizenship_anyone_got_it_any/) that was several months old about Italian citizenship via jure sanguinis.  The OP of that thread asked me to post it in a new thread so more people would see it, so here it is.

My qualifications for Italian citizenship were:

* Great Grandfather, born in Italy in 1896.
* Grandmother, born in US in 1925.
* Mother, born in US in 1957.
* Me, born in US in 1977.

If you can trace your lineage unbroken back to your Italian ancestor, there are 2 main things that could disqualify you. First, understand that the Italian ancestor renounces Italian citizenship when he gets US citizenship. So only his children born before then have inherited his Italian citizenship. I was lucky, because my grandmother was the oldest of 5 children and was the only one born before my g-grandfather became a US citizen. A poster in the other thread said that they renounce their Italian citizenship when they apply for US citizenship, but this is not the case. Over a period of several years my g-grandfather applied, then had my grandmother, and then actually was granted US citizenship. His declaration of intent to become a US citizen says that he intends to renounce his Italian citizenship, but it is not actually done and official until US citizenship is granted. This makes sense, because otherwise a person would become stateless in the meantime, and possibly forever if US citizenship was denied.

The other possible problem is that women were not able to pass their Italian citizenship to their children until 1948. Again, this did not affect me because my mother ""inherited"" the right to citizenship from my grandmother due to being born in 1957.

The cost to gather the documents will depend on your specific situation. I paid nowhere near the $1000 cost mentioned by the OP of the previous thread. If you don't know your family's complete history and have to pay a researcher to dig it up, then of course that will increase the costs. The only costs I paid were for the official copies of documents, apostilles (more on that below), and then the final fee for my passport. How much this costs you will depend mainly on where your family documents are located, since every courthouse/government agency has different fees. I think the most expensive document for me was the apostilled copy of my marriage certificate from the US Virgin Islands, which was $25.

How long it takes for you to gather these documents will also depend on your situation. I live in Harrisburg PA, which is the state capital, so that made a lot of documents easy for me to get. And my great grandparents lived in a little town less than 100 miles away, so documents from there were not difficult either. Here is the list of what I had to track down, and where I got them from:

* Great grandfather's birth certificate: I wrote to the commune in Italy where he was born (Isca Sullo Ionio) and requested this. Surprisingly I received it in only a month or so. I used a form letter on the web that was already written in Italian to request this.
**EDIT**: here is the link to the form letter: [http://www.circolocalabrese.org/resources/letters/index.asp](http://www.circolocalabrese.org/resources/letters/index.asp)
* Great grandparent's marriage certificate: Northumberland Pennsylvania county courthouse. This was only an hour drive for me.
* Great grandfather's US citizenship/naturalization record: This was also in the Northumberland county courthouse, although from everything I have read, these are usually found through the former US Immigration and Naturalization Services which has now been absorbed into Homeland Security. I don't know if the location of these records has to do with when it was filed, or what.
* Birth certificates for me, my wife, my mother, and my grandmother, as well as death certificates for my great-grandfather and grandmother: All of these came from the PA Department of Health. Since I live in Harrisburg, I could just walk into the office and request them.
* Marriage certificate for my grandparents and parents: These were in the Dauphin county courthouse, also in Harrisburg.
* My marriage certificate: Via snail-mail from the USVI.

OK, once I had all these documents, I had to get apostilles for them. The best description I can give you for an apostille is that it is a certification from a head of state that guarantees to a foreign country that a document is authentic. Documents from Italy do not need an apostille. I requested that my marriage certificate from the USVI be sent with an apostille. And since all the other documents were from Pennsylvania, they were apostilled by the PA Department of State. Again, this was very easy for me since I live in the capital.

Now that I had everything needed, I had to present them at the Italian consulate for my location. For me, this is Philadelphia.  For some people, this presents a huge delay because I have read that some of them are backed up so much that appointments are not available for a year or two. For Philadelphia, they did not even take appointments - you just show up during their public opening hours and present the docs at a window. BTW, the hours that the Philadelphia consulate was open to the public: 9am until noon, Monday, Wednesday and Friday - The European work-ethic stereotypes hold true ;) Another hassle for some people is that the consulate they need to use is very far away. Philadelphia, for instance, has jurisdiction for as far south as North Carolina. Thankfully I can take the train to Philadelphia in less than 2 hours.  You are required to use the consulate that has jurisdiction for your location.  Even if you are willing to go to a different consulate that has a shorter wait time, you are not allowed. 

The man at the consulate went through all my paperwork, and once he decided it was all in order I filled out an AIRE - Anagrafe degli Italiani Residenti all'Estero. It's a registry of Italian citizens that are living abroad, and I chose to have it filed in the commune that my great-grandfather is from. I guess you could choose to have it filed anywhere in Italy, but I'm not sure. You are supposed to update this whenever you move, get married, divorced, have a child, etc.  A few months later I got a letter telling me that they have sent my documents to Italy, and I was now able to vote, etc.  About a year later I paid the fee and got an Italian passport, and successfully used it in the EU line at Heathrow immigration when I went to England.

Some random thoughts about the whole process:

* Drawbacks? None so far, although I almost certainly would not be able to get security clearance if I wanted to have a job with the federal government. I weighed the likelihood of that, versus the fact that the law could be changed in Italy at some point in the future and I would miss out (IIRC, this offer of citizenship was only made into law in 1992). I decided that it would be better to get it now. My sister had an internship with the NSA in college that required clearance, and they did ask a few questions about me. But she did get the clearance in the end, it just took a little longer.

* Most consulates require any documents not from Italy to be translated into Italian, and I believe some require you to use translators from their official list. This will certainly add time/expense to the process. When I applied, Philadelphia was not one of these consulates, although I have read that they do require this now. Which brings me to my next observation:

* The entire process for this seemed to be very inconsistent, depending on the consulate and even who is working when you submit your documents. As I said previously, not all consulates required translations. I have read that some consulates will want birth and death certificates of the non-Italian spouses, and others do not. Also, the man working at the consulate decided right then and there that my documents were acceptable for citizenship. They don't send them to Rome for an ""official"" decision or anything like that. I was just surprised that something like obtaining citizenship in a country could have so many inconsistencies and variations in the process. I would have expected it to be much more rigid and much less dependent on the whims of a particular office or staff member.

If anyone has any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.

Let me tell me about myself. I appear to be on track to graduate on time in may 2012. I'll have a ba in economics and a minor in computer science. My gpa isn't the greatest, just short of a 3.0, I'm working harder this semester and hopefully I'll have a 3.1 and try to find an internship for the summer. I don't have much job experience except working as a cashier at a supermarket in the summers and a job at the university's calling center where I asked alumni to donate money. I only worked 1 semester there and wasn't that bad since I managed to raise like 5,000. 

The thing is I don't know crap about economics. I got mostly B +/- in all my economics classes but I really don't feel like I learned anything useful. But I love computers and technology. The reason why I didn't major in cs when I started is because I despise programming and I was under the impression all cs jobs would be outsourced when I graduated. So I decided to minor in cs last semester and I still hate programming. I wished I could double major in cs now but time and money will only let me get the minor. I honestly would love to work with computers but I'm not sure if I could even get a job since I only have a minor. And with my average gpa in economics I feel like I can't get a job in that field either. Is it possible for me to get into the computer science field? I think I have a pretty good set of computer skills. I taught myself the basics of linux and unix troubleshooting and configuring stuff. And a whole bunch of general self taught computer skills. Ideally I would love to be the it/server/network guy or whatever its called. Is that attainable? I know I would have to start at the bottom and hopefully work my way up. But I don't want to be stuck there helping people run an antivirus or something. 

I live in nyc if that helps.

Has anyone else been through this?,vocationalcrisis,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ebed9/i_have_grown_tired_of_my_major_and_dont_know_what/,"When I enrolled in one of the best Computer Science colleges in the country two years ago, I was certain I had made the right choice. I'd always - since I was four or five, anyway - been enamored with computers and programming, and was very introspective and logic-oriented by nature. I couldn't see myself doing anything else in life. For the first three semesters I had decent grades (averaging 7.5/10), loved the subject and soon enough got a good internship working with a teacher I liked.

Come this semester. I've been learning to talk to people, have been going out more, drinking and occasionally smoking weed, trying out lots of new hobbies. And the last thing I want to do now is sit in front of a computer and code every single day. I can't stand learning about processor architectures and data structures. I've unsubscribed from all of the many CS blogs and forums I used to follow religiously, and often get annoyed at my friends' talk of this or that programming language or library or whatever it is. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy coding every now and then and wouldn't easily let go of my Linux box, but I'm becoming more and more certain that this is not what I want to do every day of my life.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do if not this. I enjoy writing and sometimes think that'd be an ideal career, but our Languages course (what's equivalent to English) places heavy emphasis on local literature, which I generally loathe, and it's hard to make a living as a writer. Other Humanities seem either dull (History) or unprofitable (Philosophy). I dislike hard maths and EE. Plus, there are several advantages to graduating in Computer Science, the most notorious being, for me, the ability to get a job quickly anywhere in the world (I'm considering emigrating after college).

I'm confused and unsure about what to do. My school doesn't have minors, though we can with a bit of luck get a spot in a class from another course. Furthermore, even if I decide to change my course, I wouldn't be able to do that until 2012. Has anyone been through something similar? My dad changed majors twice and ended up graduating in a course he didn't like and working on a job he hated until he died. I'm afraid of ending up like that. Any advice, opinions or ideas are welcome.

Thanks."

ed2xa,3,2010-11-28,Anybody heard of someone going schizophrenic from a single acid trip?,term1nallychill,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ed2xa/anybody_heard_of_someone_going_schizophrenic_from/,"Just went home for Thanksgiving, found out that my friend had come home early from a semester abroad in Prague because he had gone crazy and tried to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. Eventually he confided in me that after he dropped acid mid August, he started experiencing super powers, and he believed he had achieved Nirvana and become a prophet. He had a period of 4 weeks where he lived a perfect life and used his super powers (mainly ability to make the ""correct"" decision in daily scenarios) to live the happiest part of his life thus far. 

His visions or sixth sense would communicate to him through objects or paths in life that would ""shimmer"" or ""glow"" brighter than other objects, for example one path of a fork would shimmer and therefore would be the right one to take, or he would think about saying two things and one thought would ""shimmer"" in his head, and it would be the appropriate thing to say in that social situation. 

Anyway, after this 4 week period of nirvana, my friend was ""tested"" by his powers: there were two ATMs (in prague, now). One with a long line, and one with no line. The ATM with the long line was shimmering, but my friend chose the one with no line out of impatience. From this point on, he claims his powers abandoned him and changed/not to be trusted. He says that his powers changed from telling the future into being able to tell when people were being dishonest to him. He then began obsessed with the idea that his landlord was ripping him off (being dishonest). His investigations for proof to back up his hunch led to him and his roommates all being evicted, and losing a lot of money. 

At this point, he was in Prague, more or less broke, and everybody he knew was mad at him (landlords, roommates). He felt he had abused his powers and taken them for granted, failed at his purpose. This is when he jumped off a bridge. He survived and a woman took him to a mental hospital, his parents went to Prague to bring him back. 

He's been seeing a psychiatrist and says he's being forced to take a lot of medication (didn't say what type), but that he still believes he can fix his situation, by following the last true vision he had, which was to be in Barcelona two nights ago to find this girl he barely knew (""the love of his life"") and then everything would be okay again. 

Hanging out with him two nights ago, trying to tell him things would be okay and that he could live without super powers, and he freaks out, begs me to borrow a grand, and drives off. My friend and I follow him home, see his parents throw him into the car and drive him somewhere very fast.

Found out today from his mom he's in a voluntary mental facility where they can monitor his medication. 

Pretty worried about him, he's my best friend, been so for like 13 years now (we're 20). Is there any coming back from an incident like this? I know that there hasn't been a lot of research on acid, but some internet research shows that similar stories are not unheard of. 

My friend was super charismatic, extremely intelligent, and shaping up to be a really successful person in general (was making a lot of money at a banking internship up in Boston, doing well at school, varsity athlete at his university, etc). Anybody have any advice? 

Also relevant, I saw him before school started (before he left for Prague) but after he dropped acid. He told me he dropped and that it was an amazing experience during which he ""philosophized about life intensely"" and helped him figure out how to live a better life. This past week he admitted that he already believed he had powers at that point, and was just too afraid to tell anybody because they would think he was crazy. Also this was during the period of time where he was listening to his powers and everything was going perfectly. 

**TL;DR Best friend dropped acid and believed he was a prophet with superpowers. Went abroad, attempted suicide and is now diagnosed with schizophrenia in voluntary a mental institution.**"

Any suggestions would be great!
