7gqyqv,2,2017-11-30,Met a foreign girl but can’t tell if I’m going crazy,unsurethrowaway1926,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7gqyqv/met_a_foreign_girl_but_cant_tell_if_im_going_crazy/,"About a month ago I matched with a Japanese girl on Tinder.  I’m learning Japanese myself, and she’s an exchange student here learning English.  We hit it off on tinder pretty well with a mix of English and Japanese, and agreed to meet up some time.

Couldn’t really get a day planned to meet, until a few days later where she out of the blue asked if I could get lunch with her and her friends.  I obliged and it was a ton of fun, after I dropped them off she and I talked about next time and sent all kinds of smiles and winks over text.  Next time ends up being a week later and we go to the mall together and just do some shopping and eating at the food court.  It was ridiculously fun, I loved and enjoyed every second of it.  We get back to her place and talk in the car for a while and she tells me before she leaves that next time we should go back to the place we went for lunch, it was really good.  We text again after all flirtatiously and she says she’s looking forward to next time and so am I and so forth, super cute stuff.

This was two weeks ago.

We were trying to get something going before thanksgiving as I was going away for a week, but it didn’t pan out last minute.  We texted off and on about random stuff while I was away, and on my last day, I shot her a text saying when I get back, we should do something, what day works for you? No response, so the following day at the airport for hours bored out of my mind I sent her a snapchat message asking if she got that text.

“Yup”

Won’t lie it stung, but I said:

“Okay, let me know if you’re still interested then...”

“Interested in what?”

“Going to (restaurant) or pizza or whatever we decided last time lol”

“Can you take me to (restaurant)?”

“Absolutely, when?”

“I’m not sure...
Depends on hw”

“Okay that’s fine, just let me know whenever you can
I’d love to go again with you some time :) it was really fun”

“Oh really? I’m glad :)
I’d love to go again too !”

And that’s where we’re at folks.  I’m feeling really conflicted on the issue and the signals she’s sending me.  Even though it was only two “dates”, I could really tell how much I enjoyed them more than anything else I’ve done in the past year.  I’m just having a really hard time between wondering where she stands and reconciling that between a language barrier (if there is one, but the above texts are all English) or if she’s just really hard to text.  In person we’re talkative and chatty and really happy, and when we don’t text about planning something we’re also as happy and flirtatious.  She’s a college student and of course has a lot of homework, as am  I (though an intern this semester, so homework doesn’t exist), so I completely understand prioritizing that. Am I just being crazy and overreacting? I really don’t want to let her go, I don’t know where this will go, but I don’t want it to end here.  After meeting her I managed to end an extremely long MMO addiction because I really truly felt that this was better worth my time, but now that I have so much free time I think my sanity is fading.  All my good friends are from high school and not anywhere nearby (though we still group chat almost daily), and my coworkers are 40+ older guys who aren’t quite the “hang out” type.  Looking back I now see how much that game was my life; I think I’m better off for having left it, but I also really don’t know where to go from here.  "
7grl5v,2,2017-11-30,Unhappy with new job. Not sure if I should move on or suck it up.,ireallylovalot,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7grl5v/unhappy_with_new_job_not_sure_if_i_should_move_on/,"So here's the deal:

I graduated in December with a BS in cell and molecular biology with a few high-quality internships under my belt. Right out of school I took a contract scientist position at a major pharma company. I loved the people and the work, but the pay was subpar for the industry, there were no benefits, and the position had to be renewed every six months, so it wasn't incredibly stable depending on business needs.  
  
In August I landed a permanent, relatively well-paying lab technician position with another company. The upsides: Good pay and benefits, flexible work schedule, large and established company. The downsides: The work is pretty simple and doesn't seem very stimulating and it seems like I'm set up for a possibly very slow career growth. Unknown to me before I accepted, the lab has an unwritten policy of training people on one technique and keeping them on that one technique day after day for years before taking on additional responsibility. I was told by coworkers that I should expect to be a technician for at least 4-5 years because nobody wants to ""set me up to fail,"" even though I've done much more challenging work in previous roles within more heavily regulated work environments.  
  
It does seem like my boss at the new gig is willing to put me on a bit of a fast-track, though. She keeps saying that she has plans for me and that she'd like me to be able to move on to the next technique sometime early next year. Coworkers have told me that I shouldn't put too much stock in what she says. She's also expressed concern over me leaving as it can take up to a year to hire the right person and a lot of people are already over-worked in the lab as it is.  
  
My partner says I should suck it up and stay with this job. He's absolutely not open to moving (we live in his hometown), so I would have to find something in commutable distance. I have an interview next week for a position that would pay 10k more and offer more challenging work. The problem is that the company doesn't seem like it's in the best shape and it's ~75 miles away, though it's pretty much all highway with minimal traffic.  
  
Not sure if I should just stick with the job I have, opt for a longer commute for a better position, or keep my eyes out for jobs closer to home. I feel like the longer I stay a technician and not learn new skills, the more I dim my chances at landing more interesting work down the road. Also, I'm afraid that if I take a new job too soon, I'll look like I'm unreliable.  
  
Thanks for any insight and sorry if that was a bit long. "

Recommendations: 1 strong, 2 medium, 1 strong from industry internship manager

Summers: Internship at big 4 tech company (no research).

Statement of purpose: Pretty strong, with help from others.

Fellowships: Didn't apply in time for NSF (are there other good ones to apply for that it's not too late for?).



Do I even have a shot at top 4 (or more specifically, CMU)? How do I look for other programs (top 5-15)? Is there anything else I can do? Thanks everyone."

However, the title of the internship is Software Engineer in Test. I would be doing mostly Automation Testing, and developing tools to be used internally by product facing developers.
I am a junior, and am concerned this position will pigeonhole me in that sort of QA engineer role for next year, where as I want my first full time position to be product facing SWE. It seems like the automation team gets their fair share of input when it comes to product architecture meetings with their corresponding external facing dev team, but I am still concerned I will not be taken seriously by Big N / Unicorns next year when it comes time for the FT job search(I made it to the final round for a few and got interviews from many of them, just didn't do enough interview prep this time around). Am I right to be concerned about this or should take whatever I can get? I have a few offers from very small firms where I go to university, for regular SWE internships, but this is the only offer from a very well known company that I was able to receive. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

Problem is the city is in a small town and far from home. Ive read reviews of the company on glassdoor and employees say a big con is that there isnt much to do in this city. Another big issue is that I have an interview in two weeks for a company that is an hour away from home and in a much bigger city. 

My dilemma is I have a job offer on the table for a company that seems cool, the pay is great, and they will supply housing during the duration of the internship. I'd much rather work for the company that is closer to home and in a bigger city that I really would like to live in, but I dont have the interview for that position for two more weeks and the company that extended me an offer wants me to make a decision within two weeks. Both jobs seem really interesting to me but I dont know what to do, I would like to accept the job offer that is already on the table but I fear that I will have to tell them I no longer want the position after already accepting the offer.

7gse46,2116,2017-11-30,My friend has been living in an alternate reality for the past seven years. This is what he told me.,Mr_Outlaw_,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7gse46/my_friend_has_been_living_in_an_alternate_reality/,"In order for me to tell you about this, you’re going to need to know a bit about Clint Rockwell first. 

Now, I’ve known him for around eight years. He was always… strange to say the least. But not in the sense that it made him an outcast. The opposite, actually. I guess strange wasn’t the right word. Let’s call him *exceptional*.  If I were to give you a quick run-down of his life, it’d look something like this:

Straight A’s from primary to post-secondary. Full rides to Ivy leagues. Internship offers out the ass after just his undergraduate year. Astonishingly charismatic and handsome. It was to the point where nobody even seemed to be bitter towards him. Not jealous either. They just admired him. 

But despite all the parties he was invited to, all the attempts at friendship, all the girls that threw themselves at him… he chose to be a loner. In fact, I was one of the only people he talked to. Couldn’t tell you why he chose me as an acquaintance. He just did. And let me tell you, I was about as average as average gets, set for a life of mundanity. 

It all started in seventh grade. I just failed a geometry test. To be fair, I didn’t really study for it… but whatever. Clint was sitting right by me. I saw him take one disaffected glance at his paper before putting it down. He got 100, of course. I guess he saw me staring, because he looked down at my paper and chuckled. It was slightly embarrassing, of course. But instead of hurling an insult, he asked me if I had wanted come over after school and study. Maybe play some video games. I agreed. That’s when I started to get a glimpse into his ideals. 

You see, he was never satisfied with anything. I remember our conversations regarding what we wanted to do in the future. I had all the generic answers. Buy a Lamborghini, a big house in Hollywood, marry Megan Fox. Yeah, I was that asshole. But Clint... he wanted something different. He had bigger aspirations. 

“Adventure” He told me. 

“Going somewhere uncharted. Discovering something new, you know? Something that nobody’s seen.” 

At that time, I didn’t know what he meant. 

“What, like Jupiter or some shit?” I asked him. He just chuckled. “Maybe. Something like that.” At that time, I couldn’t fathom why he would want to go into space. “Nothing’s up there.” I told him. “What’s the point?” He just gave me an amused look. But it wasn’t one of contentious superiority. He wasn’t like that. He knew that I couldn’t have understood, but he didn’t fault me for it.

“Well, think about it. People’s lives have become lackluster.” He went on. “When we have all the comforts in the world, everything turns into structure. Routine. Nothing new. Our destiny decided by the time we’re out of college. Who the hell wants to get caught up in the rat race and just chase monotony day-to-day? That’s the worst possible outcome. Look, that’s why we watch movies and read books. Escapism. Looking for stories that are infinitely more satisfying than the one we’re living in. I mean, what do we *really* have to look forward to?” 

He talked a lot like this. But it didn't sound suicidal… it was something else.  This guy beyond was driven, I could see it. But to be honest, I couldn’t tell you what he did in the long hours he spent in his room alone. He never talked about it. By the time he went off to CalTech and I went to Penn state, we started drifting apart. In fact, after the first year of his master’s degree, he stopped talking to me completely. Stopped talking to anybody, actually. When he didn’t go home for spring break, his folks called the cops. Apparently, he’d stopped going to class as well. They looked for him, but there were no traces. It was a cold case going nowhere. However, I do remember the last time we had communicated. He’d sent me a Facebook message. This is all that it said: 

“Do you want to be part of something? It’s a project I’m working on. I can explain more later.” 

I’d sent him a message asking about specifics, but he never responded. That was the last I’d heard of him for about seven years. That was before he knocked on my door in the middle of the night some hours ago. 

I wasn’t going to open up at first. These kinds of stories never end well. However, that’s when I heard my name being called by a distantly familiar voice. I couldn’t believe my ears. I stared through the peephole at what looked a homeless man. He had dirty, tattered clothes, a mass of a beard, and a generally unkempt appearance. But I recognized those eyes instantly. I recognized that spark. It was Clint. I opened up and greeted him in disbelief.
 
But before I could pelt him with questions, he stopped me:

“Look, don’t freak out. I’ll explain everything. Maybe let me shower first, though.” He flashed his award winning smile at me, though his pearly whites weren't what they used to be. “It’s really good to see you, by the way.”

That’s when I got a closer look at his frame. He was bigger than I'd remembered. Bulkier. Looked like he put on ten pounds of muscle. His model-like face was now weather-beaten and covered in scars. He also smelled of sweat and grime. This was absolutely insane, to say the least. After he washed up and settled into a couch, he laid it all out. I'm going to tell you what he told me verbatim. 

Apparently during the latter half of his undergraduate year, he was approached by his Physics professor –  Joel Rust, a somewhat eccentric 42 year old. But, he was supposedly brilliant. Rust had chosen Clint specifically to partake in what he called a ""Research project"". He laughed when he told me this. ""We had to call it that."" He said. “If they knew what we were really doing, the funding would have been gone."" 

There were 14 other people involved in this. Two theoretical physicists, three cosmologists, two young thrill-seekers, two ex-Navy SEALS, a discharged US soldier, an archaeologist, a retired MMA fighter, a disgraced entrepreneur and a suicidal drifter Rust found trying to jump off a bridge. It was a strange group, for sure.
 
""But we all shared similar ideals."" He explained. ""For one reason or another, we were all looking to get away from this world. Looking for another frontier."" 

Apparently, while on vacation, Rust had discovered something peculiar off a remote coast on the south islands in New Zealand. Something over the Cook Strait. Rust explained that he'd been seeing some kind of strange, thick fog that hung under the clouds.

""We didn't know what he meant by that."" Clint stated. ""He never really explained it."" For years, he'd spend his summers over there and observe it himself. He'd then spend every second of his free time analyzing his observations. Eventually, he'd enlisted the help of some cosmologists and other physicists. 

Clint looked at me. It seemed as if he was having trouble holding in a huge grin. ""You know what the theory they came to was?"" I shook my head. 

""It was a passage to somewhere else. A different universe, so to speak."" 

This floored me. I was skeptical for about a second. But then I thought about who I was talking to. And how strange this whole situation was. I just kept listening. I asked him how they'd figured that out. 

""You want the details?"" He replied. I thought about. *No, not really.* Science was never my strong point. Anyhow, he told me how Rust had started conducting experiments. He'd fly a drone into the fog whenever a storm was brewing. Those were the only times where it was visible. He'd estimated that after it disappeared, there would be about a three minute window where he could control it. After that, it was gone forever. ""That's why we needed the funding."" Clint explained. ""This shit was expensive."" 

The culmination of all these experiments and all this research was supposed to be a trip into the fog, just to see what they would find. That's when Rust started forming the team. It took a while, but he eventually gathered together people he deemed would be fit for something like this, along with the other researchers involved. 

""He said that he chose me because of an essay I wrote for class. The topic was about what the universe meant to us as individuals."" Clint said. ""I guess it spoke to him. I’m sure he had other reasons as well.” He smirked to himself. 

Now, while the ex-military and thrill-seekers were all in good shape, Rust and the researchers weren’t. 

“Nobody knew what to expect, really. That’s why we had to train. Cardio, strength, agility, the works. Nobody wanted to lag behind.” Clint elaborated. 

After about three years, they deemed themselves ready to go. The big day was finally there. On a warm spring day in California and a particularly choppy one on the south islands, Rust, Clint and the rest of the team piled into a private plane owned by the entrepreneur. They brought with them months worth’s of rations, weapons, first aid kits and research equipment. Parachutes as well – just in case. Everything you could think of.  Funnily enough, the drifter was the only person who knew how to pilot. 

I remember thinking that this was batshit. “Wait.” I asked him. “So you guys were just going through with this? Was nobody scared of what could happen?”

He just chuckled. “So, we have a bunch of insane researchers, soldiers scarred by combat, thrill seekers, a suicidal guy, don’t even get me started on myself, and you think we gave a shit? No, I guess we weren’t.” 

As it turns out, they figured out what Rust was talking about when they got close to the thing. Apparently the fog was dark grey, almost black. It was maybe 100 meters below the clouds and it was massive. The strangest part was that it didn’t move at all, and you could clearly tell where it began and where it ended. 

Everybody braced themselves upon entering. They were suddenly submerged into darkness. Clint said that he could see the silhouette of anticipation on everybody’s faces from the faint cabin lights. After three minutes, the plane starts malfunctioning. Here’s the fucked up part: Rust never actually told anybody about the drone experiments until afterwards. So when this happened everybody started freaking out. Nobody was expecting it. But soon after, a wave of light filled the plane. What they saw out the windows was incomprehensible:

A dark, foreboding landscape. Heavy rain pounded the windows while a cacophony of violent lightning bolts struck around them. To make matters worse, the plane was headed down, into a black ocean beneath. As they got closer, they could tell that there was definitely movement in the water. Large movements. And they weren’t just waves. Luckily for them, the plane was also on trajectory for a land mass up ahead. Nobody asked any questions. They just stuffed their bags with weapons, rations, and water before hastily strapping on their parachutes. 

It was at this point where they realized military training would’ve come in handy. Right then, it was every man for themselves. Once the plane was nearly over the island, everybody started jumping out. A good portion of the team didn’t get so lucky. Other than Rust, only one of the researchers survived. Two of them couldn’t open their parachutes in time, one landed in the water, where he was quickly *consume*d by something, and one got struck by lightning on the way down. The entrepreneur and one of the ex-SEALS also didn’t make it, both landing rough on the rocky shoreline. The team was suddenly down to 10. They watched as the plane spiraled out of control into the murky sea. The fog was also still visible in the distance, just hanging there. 

After they re-grouped, they just sat in silence for a while. Nobody knew what to think. Rust’s theory looked to be right, it seemed. The island itself was pretty similar to tropical ones you would find here on earth. Except for the trees as tall as apartment complexes, and the fact that the sky was always cloudy. They’d later find out that this place had a name - “Dusk Blue”. Another peculiar thing was that the lightning never seemed to strike land. Only the ocean. Good news for them. They started making their way into the jungle in front of them. With nowhere else to go, this is all they could do. Amongst them, they’d managed to take six pistols, four machetes, an assault rifle, and a shotgun. No reserve ammunition, though. They’d also concluded that they had about five days of food and water for all of them. 

As they made their way across the land, some creepy, unexplainable shit started happening. The MMA fighter – they called him Duke, went to go piss in some bushes at one point. About thirty seconds later, he ran back to the group, freaked out and hyperventilating. Everybody tried asking him what had happened. That’s when they looked at the clearing he had come from. Duke was standing right there, with a blank expression plastered on his face. But he was also with them. Then, out of nowhere, his copy began sprinting backwards into the woods at a torrid pace. Another occurrence took place when they came across what looked like a void just floating in the air in front of them. It was literally a door-sized black shape that was devoid of anything. One of the thrill-seekers – Jeff, stuck his hand into it for a few seconds before pulling it back. He could still move it, but it’d become completely numb. It stayed that way. 

Apparently, one night they woke up to the sound of shells blasting in the air. Lauren – the archaeologist, was shooting at something just a few meters away from where they were sleeping. Clint said it was hard to describe. Something along the lines of a massive spider-human hybrid. The shotgun didn’t affect it. It just crawled away. 

“God, this sounds like a fucking nightmare. Is this what you wanted?” I asked him. I was sincerely curious. 

“I mean… yeah. This is exactly what I needed.” His words sounded genuine. I guess it didn’t matter that I couldn’t understand him… he understood himself. He went on. Three days pass and they’re still in the jungle. They didn't know where they were heading, but nobody wanted to admit that. Rust and the cosmologist continuously record their observations while everybody else is getting antsy. They were running out of food. The other thrill seeker - Clint forgot his name, was starting to go delirious. They’d seen a small creature that vaguely resembled a chicken and he’d tried attacking it with a machete. Unfortunately, his throat was instantly slit upon making contact with it. Nobody went near any wildlife after that. It looked like hunting for food was now out of the question. Urgency was setting in. At night they’d start hearing horrific, unrecognizable sounds all around them. One time, they woke up to see a pale humanoid creature with no facial features sitting cross-legged just a few meters away. Suddenly the skin on its head peeled back to reveal a singular monstrous-sized eye. It only needed to blink one more time before everybody got the hell out of there. They’d also come across a strange hole in the ground at one point. It was about the size of a basketball. The other ex-SEAL, name also forgotten - walked up to it to take a look. 

Cautiously, he peered into it. About a minute passes and he still hadn’t moved. People started shouting at him just to leave it, but he'd ignored everything. They tried prying him away, but he didn’t budge. He just stayed crouched, eyes blankly transfixed on the hole. After about 10 minutes they left him. 

Things were reaching a tipping point once the fifth day came. They were starving, sleep-deprived and paranoid. With only four MRE’s left for the 8 of them, they needed to conserve energy. However, every time they stopped to rest, they’d hear footsteps behind them. They’d look for the source, but there was nothing visible to be found. The steps would just get louder and louder. Eventually, they’d caught up. Clint said that they could hear something running quick circles around them before he started to feel light-headed. The last thing that he remembered hearing before passing out was a barrage of shouts coming from somewhere in front of them. None of them voices that he’d recognized. 

He awoke sometime later, lying on a stiff mattress in a small wood cabin. His head was pounding and his face was covered in dried blood when he touched it. He looked around the room, nearly jumping out of his skin when he saw somebody sharpening some kind of weapon in the corner. But he did look to be human, resembling a Mediterranean man. Upon seeing Clint wake, he'd got up and introduced himself as “Slade”. He also spoke English, albeit it was in a strange accent that Clint said he’d never heard before. 

Now, Clint was no small guy at 6’1, but Slade still towered over him. He’d explained that he was essentially a guard protecting a walled civilization called “Ferro Locus”, where Clint currently was. He described how he and the rest of the team had come into contact with what the locals referred to as “Stalkers”. They’d eventually managed to fend them off, bringing Clint and the rest to safety. They were happy to let them stay, as long as they did fair share of work. 

He further explained the island that they were on. As it turns out, Dusk Blue was actually one of the few places in that world that had a semblance of order and society. While most of it was still extremely hostile, there were protected settlements set up all around, where people could live in relative peace. However, the main attraction was at the center – a massive self-governing city-state known as “Paradise X”. While settlements like Ferro Locus could be compared to small towns in the old west, Paradise X was more comparable to a modern day metropolis. 

He went on to explain a strange trend in births on the island in which around 1 in 1000 children were born with enhanced levels of strength, speed, and nearly impenetrable skin. Officials from Paradise X would come around to settlements every now and then in order to recruit these children into the security force set to protect their borders. In exchange, their families would be allowed citizenship and a place to live within the city. Of course, everybody was after this. This resulted in a lot of questionable moral decisions when it came to children. 

Clint then asked about all the stuff that had happened before they were rescued. All the weird shit. Apparently Slade just sighed and told him not to worry about it. He didn’t have the answers either. That stuff’s always been there, and it was better not to think about it. He told him to simply stay inside the settlement and not cause any trouble. The punishment for disorderly conduct was exile. 

I was still trying to wrap my head around any of this when Clint started yawning. He told me that he was tired and that we could talk in the morning. I tried to get him to stay up and tell me more, but his eyes were already half-way closed. “I’ve gone through some messed-up shit, man. Just let me rest for a bit. Don’t worry, I got more to tell you. Spent seven years over there for Christ’s sake.” He said drowsily. “Yeah, fine. You can take the guest room.” I told him. After feeding him some left-over spaghetti, I led him up there. I had to ask him one more thing before he passed out, though. “What about your folks? How the hell are you gonna explain this to them?”

He paused for a second before speaking. “Uh… couldn’t if I tried. They’re gone, man.” To be honest, the lack of emotion in his voice disturbed me a bit. “Oh shit. I’m… I’m sorry” was all I could utter out. He just let out a forced chuckle and said “What are you sorry for? You didn’t do anything” Before disappearing into the bedroom. That’s when I really thought about what had just happened. If Clint’s been telling me the truth … then that’s *horrifying* to think about. I guess I’ll write another update when he wakes up.

It seems to be like a year-long internship for new grads with a possible full-time offer at the end of the program. It also pays a bit less and seems to involve more focus on training / rotations.

According to the site, the program starts in either March, July, or September and spans twelve months with up to two rotations. I'm curious in regards to their interview timeline and deadlines, since it already seems a bit late in the process."

- both programs are accredited engineering programs at my university.   

- both programs involve 16 months internship.  

- At this point in time I am able to switch programs with no additional costs (all my courses are transferable).  

**What I think: **  

- computer engineering degrees can work software engineering Jobs, but not vice versa. (Most of the time CE deals with more hardware focused jobs).   

- however, I like the courses for software much more than those for computer.  

- under degree requirements, most companies list ""computer science/engineering and other related majors"" which I worry will reduce the chances of my resume being looked at if I list software as my degree.  

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you."

My work is appreciated just as much as their’s in college and we are ranked at the same place. however, my friend lacks basic presentation skills where I ace ahead of them.
We both applied to a lot of companies and I got called in for more interviews than them, currently I have 1 offer standing in front of me while I’m waiting to hear from the other 2 places I recently went for an interview. I am someone who is also of a very helping nature so initially wherever I applied, I shared it with my friend as well because they needed companies to apply to but the same response from their side was never there and I don’t think it’s even wrong.

Anyways my friend had an interview today at a very good company they didn’t share the name/info with me about and they got the job, though I am very happy for them, I am somewhat jealous because I feel like they didn’t exactly deserve it.. (not that I do or anything) but a part of me suddenly shut down when I received a phone call from them saying “I GOT THE JOB” and I have been feeling very weird and rather stiff since then. I did sincerely congratulate them but a part of me feels sad because I have no certain yes from any places except one which is just a mediocre company and not the best to work in (last minute resort).

I know what I’m feeling right now is sheer jealously but how do I cope with it.. it’s killing me somewhat knowing they got it so easily and that too at a good company. I am unsure about my feelings right now.."

I know in general how the language works with the fundamentals, but don't have any practical experience or in depth knowledge using it.

7gvj4c,315,2017-12-01,"Finished a bachelor's degree in CS, looking for information about software architecture.",MrTimscampi,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7gvj4c/finished_a_bachelors_degree_in_cs_looking_for/,"I recently finished a bachelor's degree in computer science, but an area sorely missing from my courses was software architecture (We didn't really spend much time at all on planning and design, unfortunately).

I know about the main design patterns, but I have no clue about how to *properly* build large software.

I feel like this is an important skill to have for a young developer, so I'm looking for books focusing on how to handle larger projects, how to organize code, which architecture patterns exist, etc.

Assignments usually didn't care much for code organization, passed using a few imposed design patterns for some stuff. As a result, my software is usually a bit chaotic.  

During an internship at a factory for a major aircraft tire company, I just basically adopted their architecture after studying one of their projects for a day or two (It had Java EE concepts I was not familiar with, due to being more of a Python developer). It was a 3-layer design, with models, business logic and views (I understood it as kind of a modified MVC), which generally worked, but I still don't see how or why I'd apply that compared to another architecture.

While I can grasp some stuff instinctively, like splitting the software into smaller modules, I fail to see when to apply it versus something else (I've often seen open source projects organized in a very different way) and what that something else would even be.

My more complex designs usually amount to a combination of design patterns and I'd like to go beyond the obvious and really learn about architecture to apply it in my work, especially as I'm going to enter the workforce after I complete an Android project in January.

Any book/article recommendation on how to write more complex software, which architectures exist and what patterns exist for architecture/how to choose them would be welcome.

**tl;dr:** Did a bachelor's degree in CS, have no idea how to organize bigger projects, which architectures to choose or even which architecture patterns exist. I am going to enter the workforce soon and would like books/articles to learn all about that (For example, how to organize a project that would have plugins ? Why use a multilayered architecture ? That kind of stuff.)

Thank you."

Before getting the interview, they asked for a resume and any project links/github account. Presumably, they looked at both before giving me an interview. Anyway, I get to the place and things seem like they're going okay. I get this feeling that maybe I'm underqualified for the job but regardless, I'm feeling okay because the interview itself can serve as wise experience for future interviews. I soon learn that the interviewer hasn't even looked at my account and most likely, very briefly skimmed my resume. He starts asking me questions of whether I know this language or if I have experience with databses, etc, etc, and it's very clear that I really am underqualified for this job. At this point, I start thinking why on earth this guy would even give me an interview in the first place - my skillset clearly doesn't match what he has in mind despite the job description matching my skillset. I continue along with the interview and this is when I can feel myself becoming overwhelmed with humiliation. He pulls out his phone and starts texting or going on fb or something while I'm talking. He doesn't even look up once and just sort of says ""mhm"". I forgot to mention there was a second guy interviewing me too, who throughout the interview was giving me snide looks and actually snickering offhandedly when I said I didn't have experience with x language, etc. 

This experience was so horrible. Maybe I'm just very sensitive or something but I still haven't forgotten about that interview and ever since then, I can't get myself to seriously apply to any CS internships bc now i have this notion that I really am not good for the field and can't offer anything worthwhile. 

Sorry, this has come off more as a vent post. 

Any of you ever been in the same boat as me? How'd you overcome it?"

My dilemma is whether or not to work an internship during the spring semester or to turn it down and keep focusing on school only.  A little background, I am majoring in Human Resource Management and I have already worked two HR internships while in school.  When I work during school, my grades slip.  I have less time to do stuff and it feels as if my time is always spent worrying about everything.  When I don't work, my grades do well.  I have more time to spend with my friends and girlfriend and I have way more time to actually focus on my studies, rather than mindlessly rushing through assignments, exam prep, etc. and not really learning the material in the way I'd like.  This particular internship is with a leading technology company and they want me to work 24-30 hours a week.  This semester I will be taking 15 credit hours and it all just makes me nervous.  Money is not something I have to worry about at this time, fortunately.  I live at home and am blessed with wonderful parents who take care of me.  On my own, I have close to $10,000 saved up and the only bills I have are a cell phone bill and gym membership, which will be expiring this coming March.  So my question is, what should I do in this situation?  Take the internship, which will be my third, work through the semester and risk my grades dropping or do I turn down the internship, which could be great experience added on to what I have, focus on school and make sure my grades stay up?  I would greatly appreciate any input/advice!"
7gx0qd,30,2017-12-01,The Thanksgiving Miracle,Monechetti,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7gx0qd/the_thanksgiving_miracle/,"For the last, well forever, my mother and I have been going to my uncle's house in rural Missouri for Thanksgiving. It's about an hour drive from our home, and when my grandparents were alive, they came too.

My uncle and I share a mutual ""eh"" feeling about people, so he built his house on a gravel road that came off a county highway on 8 acres of ""nobody-in-sight"" pristine beauty, and I love it. It was his ultimate refuge, surrounded in forest with a meandering stream behind the house where I'd find turtles and he'd get worms and grubs to go fishing. You could see basically every star in existence at night because there was no light pollution, and we could run around as kids with no fear of kidnappers or getting hit by a car.

Which is why, when i was 10 and some random dickass built a GIANT stupid house DIRECTLY across the street from my uncle and aunt, the result was a negative vibe in my uncle's butthole chakra. To say he was pissed would be an understatement, and the guy across the street - Gerald - was a giant douche. His house was enormous, and he was always flaunting his new car, his hot new girlfriend, something. And then he started in on Thanksgiving.

You see, every year since I was 12, he would come sauntering over to my uncle's house, knock on the door right before lunch and invite himself in. My aunt is significantly more tactful than my uncle, who only ever answered Gerald in curt, 1-or-2 word responses. Then Gerald would bring up ""going around the table and saying what we were thankful for"", essentially so he could brag about how well he was doing. ""Got 2 new snowmobiles this year so I can take this model I'm dating out and show her what a real midwest snowfall is!"" Or ""just found out my bank account has basically tripled in the last three months, so I can easily afford a gold-plated shark tank"" or whatever. Not only was he a braggart, but he'd also rub my uncle Jim's nose in the fact that he had so much more than they did. He just always did this, and Jesus it was awful, but the guy had no family and I think my aunt felt sorry for him, dickbag though he may be.

So a few weeks ago, as we piled my family into the minivan to drive to my aunt and uncle's, my wife and I joked about what nonsense Gerald would have this year. ""Maybe he's got a dinosaur"", she sneered as she buckled her belt. I checked the kids' carseats and got in, ""nah, he's probably got a goddamn dinosaur theme park planned out"". My wife chuckled, and we drove, and we arrived. The kids ran in and hugged my aunt and uncle, and then ran down to the creek bed. ""Hey, guys, if it starts to rain, come in - that creek could flood quick"" i shouted after them. The forecast hadn't called for rain, but it had gotten very dark and cloudy quickly after we'd left the interstate, so I didn't want to take any chances.

My uncle slapped my back and gave me a hug, and I smiled and asked if he'd heard from Gerald today. ""Shhh,"" he said, laughing, ""let's not say his name too loudly or he'll show up early. Actually,"" his face kind of scrunched up, thinking, ""he's been shuttering his windows and packing his car this morning - he told Darcie that he was taking a trip, so we might not see him at all"". I couldn't complain about this, so we went into the living room to have a drink and talk.

Around noon, when we'd seen nor heard from Gerald, my aunt came in and shrugged, inviting us to the table for dinner. We sat down, did the customary ""thankful for blank"" speech, and right as my uncle carved up the turkey, there was a knock on the door. ""I'll get it!"" my son shouted and ran to the door, with me in tow. I expected Gerald, but there was a young guy in a white button-up, black slacks, black glasses, no coat, and a clipboard. ""You must be,"" he squinted down at his clipboard, ""Gerry? I'm here to inform you that the contract expiry date is today, November 23rd, 2017, so if you'll come with me, we can,"" but I interrupted him. 

""Sorry, I'm not Gerald, my name is Mike, but Gerry lives across the street."" I looked past the kid and into the driveway - didn't see a car, so I'm not sure how he got there or where he expected Gerald to go with him, but it didn't seem to matter, because the kid clearly didn't believe me.

""Sir, I can assure you that I was told this always happens, and that you were told the date. You maybe got an email about it?"" he pointed to the phone in my pocket. I rolled my eyes, ""I'm not Gerald, bud - he lives in the ONLY OTHER HOUSE ON THIS STREET"" and I pointed across the no-longer-gravel-but-still-shitty road, but again, he frowned and didn't even look in the direction I was pointing. 

""Sir, please don't make this hard for me - it's my first day."" His face took on a pleading look, but I just shrugged. ""The guy you want lives across the street. Now, please excuse me while I eat my weight in bird with bread in its asshole"" and I shut the door. My son beamed up at me. ""Don't repeat what I just said to your mother."" He shook his head and ran back to the dining room, and I followed, but not before looking outside at the porch again, where I saw the guy on the phone, looking kind of frantic, checking the house number, etc.

We started eating, and I noticed through the back sliding glass door that it had gotten even more ominous looking outside. I thought about the nerdy guy and how he didn't even have a coat on - what an idiot. Snow storms could be kind of terrible out here in the winter, so much so that I mentioned to my wife that I should move the car from the slightly inclined driveway it was on to more level ground. She agreed so I went outside and noticed the kid was gone. ""Good"", I said out loud, assuming he finally got it straight and went to bug Gerald. The wind picked up as I got out of the van, nearly pushing the door shut on my ankle and the clouds grew darker still.

I jogged inside, grabbed my glass of wine, and sat back down to mess up some cranberry sauce. The first few ""tink, tinks"" of something hitting the windows made me look up. Lovely, hail, I thought but then I noticed the hail was moving. I went to the window and looked down on the deck. ""What is it, honey"", my wife asked. I wasn't certain, but I mumbled ""it's not...hail...bugs?"" I turned around, ""they're beetles"". And they were - hundreds of thousands of beetles hitting every window but not splatting, and then swarming the ground outside. My kids were understandably freaked out and interested at the same time, and the adults exchanged glances of worry, tempered by alcohol.

We continued eating and then another knock on the door pierced the silence of Thanksgiving dinner and the persistent drumming of beetles raining down. I got up and the knocking grew more insistent. I pulled the door open and there was the kid again, looking smug but agitated, clipboard at his side. ""Ready to go, Gerry?"" he asked. I sneered and closed the door on his face. I could hear him sigh and get back on the phone, and when I sat down, the beetles stopped. ""Well that's nice"", I said. My kids, uncle, and aunt were looking out the window, though, fixated on the treeline, and my wife looked worried.

""What's going on?"" I asked. The trees were moving in such a way that I assumed the wind had picked up tremendously. I too put my nose against the glass and observed, and my aunt opened the window next to my seat. We all listened to what wasn't silence, but certainly wasn't wind; my uncle stepped out onto the deck, avoiding beetles as he could and turned around to us, his face pale. ""There's no wind - the trees are shaking. Like, shaking in the ground, vibrating"". The sky grew darker and as my uncle lifted his eyebrow in a ""wtf"" look to all of us, the creek bed where my kids had been playing barely two hours before yawned open, the sound something like thunder and falling rocks. Dark shapes swarmed around the seven food long fissure and I grabbed my uncle and pulled him inside.

Just then, as the swarming darkness coalesced into vaguely-humanoid shapes and began to ascend the hill to the house, the knocking at the front door started up again.

""Gerry, you need to honor the contract. Come with me now!"" the kid shouted, kind of squeaky, but with a fresh tone of menace that wasn't there before. The trees began shaking more violently, the shapes getting nearer, and house filled with tortured whispers. My kids were screaming, crying, and my uncle - hunter he is - ran into his den, unlocked his gun safe, and grabbed several for us. The knocking continued, and from down in the basement, a sound like a sledgehammer hitting a sheet of tin started up, adding another level of terror to the cacophony that surrounded us. ""GERALD, GERALD, GERALD"", I kept hearing from the front until my uncle, eye-twitching, just snapped. He loaded up his shotgun, gruffly walked to the front door, swung it open, and knocked the guy down, gun aimed under his chin.

""I am NOT Gerald Skinner. Gerald FUCKING Skinner lives across the street at one-two-six Clark road. This is one-two,"" he turned around to his address, where the nine had inverted to a six from a loose nail. He stood up, slapped his hand on the six, turned it around, and looked back at the guy. ""One-two-nine. This is one-two-nine, asshole."" 

What color was left in the man's face drained and he scrambled to get his phone out, shakily making a call and running down the driveway frantically. Maybe thirty seconds later, everything stopped - the beetles were gone, the trees were still, and the creek looked normal. The sky was still dark, but it was almost winter, so whatever.

We all kind of exhaled at the same time, as if we'd been collectively holding a breath for the last five minutes, and we sat down wherever our legs gave out in the living room. I held my son and my wife held our daughter and my aunt was sobbing. My uncle still looked pissed, even more-so when after just a few minute's reprieve, there was another knock at the door.

I opened it, expecting the nerdy fellow again, but was instead greeted by a kind-looking old man in an impeccably tailored suit. He smiled a smile that was huge and fake and cheesy and yet conveyed absolute sincerity at the same time.

""Good day - sorry about that unfortunate interruption to your Thanksgiving dinner. Interns, haha,"" he said, kind of elbowing my ribs gently. I laughed and nodded, as if I had to deal with interns daily. ""We were looking for Mr. Skinner and, well, you know how these things happen, little mix-ups, haha."" He turned away from me and clasped his hands behind his back, gazing across the street at Gerald's house.

""Why do you want that guy, anyway? He's kind of a prick."" I said. The man chuckled but his face became quite serious.

""Hmm, Mr. Skinner signed a contract with our company twenty years ago on Thanksgiving day. We thought, after we'd incorrectly identified this house as his, that he was simply trying to get out of our deal."" He tapped his foot to a rhythm that I couldn't hear. He was odd, this little old man, and then he continued. ""They almost always try to get out of the contract, but none have ever been as insistent as you were, and that coupled with the new guy, it's all just been a mess, so again, we apologize for the inconvenience."" He sort of looked back at us and we all just murmured something like ""no worries"". I looked across the street and saw Gerald frantically shouting at the intern, whose frustration I could FEEL all the way on our porch. 

We watched as Gerald ran inside and the intern made a phone call. Dark shapes popped up in the harvested corn fields all around Gerald's house, moving slowly towards his porch. I could see the corners of the old man's mouth move up, indicating a smile that I knew I probably didn't want to see. The windows and tires of Gerald's new Hummer exploded outward and we could hear him scream and scream.

""So, uh, can we like, go in and eat?"" I asked. I don't know WHY I asked, but it felt like I should probably. 

""Oh, oh yes, of course."" he said, gesturing us away. ""You'll miss the beetles though."" We all shook our heads that it was fine and we went inside to be thankful that our house was where it was and not in the Dali-esque landscape across the road. As I closed the door, I heard the old man say to himself ""I do love the beetles""."

And we're one of the top engineering schools in the country and always moving up, so I'm going to have great opportunities when I graduate.

Tech is hard, Tech is fun, overall Tech is great. Agree?"

I've had some bites from good companies with coding challenges, but I usually bomb those. There will always be one question I can't solve. The exception was Goldman Sachs where I got to the superday, but then I bombed an insanely easy question in Python because I second questioned myself on something that should have been trivial.

Thing is, I've been doing leetcode (~40 questions, more attempted) and CTCI and haven't really seen much improvement since I started. I can usually solve those problems, but it takes me hours, and I'm not seeing a speedup which is what I need.

Worse, I'm worried I'm out of time in general. I'm in a two year post-bacc program, this is the last year I can apply for summer internships before I graduate. We're getting, what, midway into summer internship application season? Most of the big companies are getting close to done, and my city doesn't have a big tech sector for internships (Nashville) so I'm not sure smaller internships are a possibility. I'm currently unemployed and doing temp work to pay the bills, so I've got full time work, plus part time school, plus a job hunt and an internship hunt, which leaves me with very little time to do things like leetcode or projects. I know people in my program who already landed multiple internships offers at big companies, some even already landed full jobs, and meanwhile I'm getting concerned that I'm going to graduate with nothing more than a degree and a good GPA, leaving me in a spot not much better than where I am now where most employers don't bother looking because I have no professional coding experience."

Hello everyone, I am a CS major with an internship where I am doing web development, basic stuff, Laravel/PHP, MySql, Javascript. 

I am interested in data science/analytics, and I had the idea to try to implement it at my internship (for one I can get paid while I learn about it and see if I like it, and also will look good on my resume :) )

So far, we don't really have anything like that here, we have a team that does some SEO, Google Analytics type stuff, but I have overheard them talking about ""data visualization, data science, data analytics"". 

I want to try to get in on that...but I have no idea where to start? Should I look into programs like Tableau? I am completely new to all of this (hence why I am grouping data science/analytics/visualization together, not sure on the major differences between them)

Does anyone have any advice on how I could get started that would provide value for my company? The company I work for has many locations, we provide sales/services for people, so we have sales data, franchising data, etc.

Thanks!

I have joined an engineering group and been invited into a society. I now have a couple internships under my belt and about to move to another one. When I tell my male peers about this, I have been told that I am SO lucky to be a girl and especially a minority girl. The next statement was, ""You don't know how hard it is to be a white male in engineering nowadays"". Apparently the only reason why I get opportunities is because I am a minority girl. It is not because I have applied to every internship in my city, or that the last few years I have focused on building a spanking resume.
What is crazy to me, a few years ago women were overlooked for STEM jobs because we were women, but now apparently we get STEM jobs because we are women. 
What is it?
Seriously white males out there.. 
Are you having a hard time in engineering nowadays?

To give a little context, I’m in my second year of a CS degree in university and I’ve never had an internship before.

Few days later, the company contact me and say that they want us to meet.  I say that I would be glad to and they answer me with the project I would work on and tell me to look it up before the meeting.  Since it’s an open source project, I clone it on my computer, look it up, read a bit of the documentation and all.  So far so good.

The thing is, during the meeting, I realize that the ones working at the company (they’re 2) don’t have any CS background.  They basically told me that I was there to do thing that they weren’t able to.  I thought that it was fine, but they proceed to tell me that they would like me to add some functionalities to the said project.  

The thing is that I don’t know if I can do it!  The project is pretty huge and I’ve never worked on something that big before nor did I ever worked on something similar.  And most of all, since they don’t know a whole lot about CS, I can’t ask them for any help.  That’s what scares me the most.

Am I right to be scare?  Should I accept their offer or wait for another internship?

I guess my question is: I do plan to do more internships for the rest of my upcoming summers until I graduate. Financially, should I plan for future ones to pay less or more than I am making this year? 

I really could care less about my salary (or making money at all from the internships I do) BUT I dont want to miss money I could take advantage of in future years. I also dont want to scare potentially great companies away from taking me on as an intern should I mention my previous salary to them in negotiations.

I was hoping I could get some advice. I'm a CS junior going in to my senior year next year and I'm caught in between a decision between interning for two companies.

The first company is a Fortune 10, hundred or so billion dollar healthcare company. I interned with them last summer, and it was ""less than thrilling"". It wasn't very software development-y (I wrote Python scripts and a ton of SQL queries). The offers people I interned with received were in the range of 70k+ so it's a bit above average for software developers (in the city MidWest). Their rate of pay for interns is around $23.50 an hour.

The second company is lesser-known but still a 3-4 billion dollar company that is pretty much entirely ""tech-based"". I assume interning with them would expose me to a lot more programming, which I'm hoping to do more of. Their rate of pay is $24 an hour plus a $1.4k post-tax ""sign on"" bonus.

I've already accepted the first company's offer (because they sent me the return offer for next summer long ago) but I assume I can just tell them I cancelled (though there might be some repercussions). I'm also assuming that at this point in time, I can't negotiate the pay with them. In reality, I plan on applying to a bunch more internships (I'd really love to get into the fintech industry, it's very huge here), but as of right now I have 2 weeks to make a decision on the second company's offer. My logic is that I probably have a much better chance of getting hired with the first company after the internship but it's not a guarantee. Although in the long run I don't plan on staying very long with either company I choose between the two.

Some Background:
From the 2nd-10th grade I lived in Arizona. As such, I grew up wanting to go to the University of Arizona (UA). After 10th grade,  I moved to Washington (for parental employment reasons), and for the first time I was forced to consider other institutions. Very quickly it became obvious that the UW was the best choice, academically. Come senior year, I ended up applying to and getting accepted into both.

I really want to work in a field related to space, mainly Aerospace Engineering or Astronomy/Astrophysics, so I ended up going to UA (CS Major) because it's the official partner of NASA and because majority of my friends were there, but due to an unfortunate series of events, I was ostracized by all but 1. 

Now it feels like I was always just lying to myself about the potential benefits of attending for NASA reasons and it was always just because I wanted to be with my ""friends"". I'm realizing that besides the partnership with NASA, UA is academically a weaker school, and UW may have been a better option for CS if I can't get a programming job related to space, in terms of education and potential internships.

To boil it down to a question: Did I throw away the opportunity to go to one of the most prestigious Universities in the world by choosing friends over academics? 

I know that UA is still a great institution, but even my professor who used to teach at and attended UW thinks that it's a better school."

In order to receive said recommendation, I had to sign a contract with them. 

I need help interpreting part of that contract as my goal is to not break my contract (I will have to pay the program $12,500 if I do) but avoid doing a rural clerkship.

The part of the contract in question essentially says that **application** to my campus's rural clerkship program is mandatory but simply applying does not guarantee the applicant a spot in the rural clerkship program. However, if the application is approved, participation in the rural clerkship is mandatory under the contract. **(I can provide the exact language of the contract if needed, but I'm just trying to broad stroke this for simplicity)** 

So where I stand now is this: **my application has successfully been submitted** but I told the rural clerkship director that I was not interested in the program since I want to do my clerkships at our campus hospitals (more urban-setting) due to previous internship experience in a rural hospital. **The rural clerkship program has arranged an interview time for me regardless.** Depending on how the interview goes will depend on whether or not I'm accepted to the rural clerkship program, but I am worried that since I have expressed my disinterest in the rural clerkship that the program might try and strong-arm me into participating with the threat of breaking my contract. I also would like to avoid going to the interview, acting disinterested as hell, and wasting everyone's time as I believe this would be extremely unprofessional behavior.

**My main questions are these:** 

1) Would the interview be considered part of the application process?

2) Would declining/skipping the interview, therefore essentially removing myself from consideration for the rural clerkship program, break my contract?

Any help with this would be appreciated. As I mentioned before, breaking my contract would cost me $12,500 which is money I most certainly do not have and really don't want to have to take our more loans for.

This is my first time posting, though Ive admired redditers from afar for a while. Bummer its under this kind of circumstance.
Little background on me that might be important: Im a social worker, a full time student (masters trying to become a therapist), an intern at a hospital/cancer center, &amp; I drive for a food company (never been in an accident while working). Im noting this because i think it shows I not only care &amp; work for my community and people, but I have a lot of experience driving both are important to knowing me in reference to my accident.

To make a long story short. I was behind a woman at a red light, we were both making a turn (legally). I saw that she had started turning right and pulling past the cross walk, so I looked to my left to see if traffic was clear for me as well. It was, and as i was looking back I also started turning (assuming she had turned already) but she must have stopped so I hit her. It took her ten minutes about of standing around on the phone to decide and she decided to file a report. Ironically we crashed right by another police officer who was helping some homeless man. He saw nothing but he helped us call the city PD. City PD comes out and informs us that we crashed right where their jurisdiction meets another so we waited for them to come out. Because of some weird strict jurisdiction laws and us literally crashing over their mile marker of where one department meets another it took 2 1/2 hours for the report to get started/finished. In that time frame she was walking around, completely okay. Didn't call an ambulance it wasn't even asked of her because out of the 6 cops there (so many due to the jurisdiction bs) no one even bother to ask. Because it was nothing.  When the cop finally came over after finishing the report he gave me a ticket for not having my insurance card on me (I couldn't find it because I was super distraught, I of course found it after I left) and she was ticked for driving with an expired tag. The cop told us after giving us the tickets that he didn't believe I caused the damage to her bumper which really if anything maybe looked a bit off kilter (but even that is hard to see). He explained that because there is a perfect square outline on my car of where I hit her hitch (which sticks out further than the rest of any part of her car) &amp; because the hitch is not attached to the bumper there is no way I could have caused that ""damage"". Also this outline is on the far right front bumper (passenger side) which backs up my claim that she was turning. Had she had just been sitting facing forward that mark would be centered on my car.

Today I ended up talking to my insurance company today finally (this all happened on Thanksgiving) who told me not only is she claiming neck &amp; back injury but she's going to get an attorney and sue me. 

I am freaking out. Im a 23 y/o with lots of student debt and no money. I have never dealt with anything of this nature before &amp; my car is under my fathers name. He is letting me use it as an fully covered/insured driver while Im down in Florida paying for school. 
As I mentioned I am broke. My parents are broke. I am really aware of how much they do for me and it terrifies me to think that this could financially burden them. I haven't stopped crying. I keep imagining that I'll have to pay her some crazy sum and I'll be in debt the rest of my life or really ruin my parents in some fashion (clearly nothing like this has happened to me before so I don't even know if that's logical).

I thought this was a MINOR accident. Now I can't stop thinking about how my life is fucked. That this is going to ruin the rest of a really hard year (best friend passing away, crushing school debt, being distant from my family while im doing schooling, and being diagnosed with an immune disease) I need advice please? Anything I am so desperate and distraught. I can feel it in my bones that this is a scam. But here in Florida scams are just how people make their money.

Last question, teachers od tomorrow claims you can get a paid student teaching internship as a conditional teacher (or something like that).  Is being paid for student teaching realistic or a fantasy?  

Thanks for any advice, most appreciated."

I finally have a first draft and I really need to hear how it is, and what I can do to make it better.

[Here is are screenshots.](https://imgur.com/a/gWd6b)

And here a copy/paste:

&gt; With this letter of intent, I confirm my interest in #PROGRAM#  at the University of #UNIVERSITY#. Currently, I am in my final year of the University of Canada’s Honors Computer Science program, where my involvement in a breadth of research projects and seminars has confirmed my desire and ability to perform research at the graduate level.  My primary research interests are in the areas of Representation and Multimodal Learning.  
&gt; 
&gt; Throughout my undergraduate career, I have held a number of industry internship placements which often prompted my research questions. During my summer placements at Provincial Health Company, I saw the energy impact of large datacenters and questioned how much of that cost could be contributed to the convenience of virtualization. I worked alongside Dr. Associate Prof and two Masters students with a project that investigated the energy impact of using Docker virtualization. My contributions were in prior work, experimental design, setup, and execution. We demonstrated that Docker consumes significantly more energy than bare metal as well as application specific reasons for the overhead. The resulting paper is under submission with the Journal of Systems and Software and available as a preprint on arXiv.
&gt; 
&gt; After being asked to consult on a networking project for a student residence, I started to regularly attend Dr. Prof Prof’s high performance computing group which has recently been focusing on high throughout data transfers. My perseverance to build up domain knowledge in an area where I had not taken formal courses paid off in not only gaining the ability to discuss academic networking research at a graduate level, but also a nomination by Dr. Prof for the Something Family Blah scholarship based on academic achievement and focus on theoretical computing. In more recent months the group has transitioned to machine learning topics as a possible solution to congestion control.
&gt; 
&gt; My undergraduate studies at the University of Canada initially began in Biochemistry and then soon transferred to computer science. Recently I have merged these two disciplines through a research project under the supervision of Dr. Prof Prof#2. Previous work in the discipline has found success in applying Latent Dirichlet allocation to cancer genomic datasets, such as breast cancer. This semester I have been investigating methods of combining datasets from different origins. In January, I will begin an independent study with the group to apply topic modelling across datasets for multiple cancer types. 
&gt; 
&gt; My current research interest is inspired by talks hosted by the Local AI Group’s AI Seminar, experimenting with feature construction as described in Richard Sutton’s Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, and AI/ML coursework on pathfinding, text clustering &amp; classification, deep neural nets, and MCTS. The challenge of developing an unsupervised method of learning a shared representation from multiple raw data types for prediction problems is particularly appealing. 
&gt; 
&gt; *** customize for the school by prof, course, etc.***
&gt; 
&gt; After graduation from my Master’s, I intend to pursue a career in software engineering with a focus on Machine Learning. As my industry experience usually inspires my research, the ideal position would allow for me to continue to contribute and stay current with academia while simultaneously solving current problems through the application of existing techniques. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; 
&gt; Me Me

Sorry if this gets posted often; I searched and didn't find many posts that were too similar to my situation.


I'm a fourth year physics/economics double major at a pretty good school (especially for physics), but will be staying a fifth year to complete both degrees. While both subjects are really cool, I've known for a while that I don't want to work directly with either for my career. In the past year or so, I've gotten really interested in programming/SWE, so I’m considering applying to some SWE internships for this summer. I've tried my hand at programming some simple things in the past: small Python programs like a calorie intake calculator, and a bunch of C++ exercises from Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup, which have all been really fun. I love the logical thinking and problem solving that goes into writing good programs, making useful things, and the challenge; but none of the courses I've taken thus far in college have required any programming, and I don't have any ""big"" projects under my belt. Whatever I know, I’ve taught myself. (I'd be willing to switch my major this late if the university would let me, but there's a unit cap, and I'm not sure I could afford it.)


Finals are coming up soon, but I plan to spend a lot of time over winter break studying, doing Leetcode/Hackerrank exercises, reading CTCI, and possibly working on some kind of project--and will do it all regardless--but I’m afraid it won’t be enough to land any position in the summer. My main goal is to learn, but I’m not sure I’ll be able to contribute enough for any company to consider taking me on, or that I'll know enough to pass any interviews (let alone get my resume through). I am slightly optimistic because I hear interns go through a lot of training anyway, but without any formal CS background or substantial experience, do I stand a chance? Is it even worthwhile to apply?


I'd greatly appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance. :)"

24 year old male, recently laid off from both of my cooking jobs--which I hated anyway. 

I have about 3-5 months work experience as a cable technician/installer (independent contractor, no real training at all) in 2016. It's basically undocumented and I have no real references, but I did it. 

I also did some data entry/acquisition/correction at UPS in 2013. 

The rest and most recent is all line cooking.

I have an associates degree, it is an AA designed to transfer into a business degree. 

I want to start on a networking career. Maybe eventually getting into $omething $ecurity related. But even saying that now, I *barely* know what it actually means. I know I need to start with the basics. 

My first course of action is to study for the CCENT. I figure if I truly LEARN the CCENT/CCNA I can niche down from there. As I learn more, I will be able to find the areas that interest me. I plan to use the Odom official cert guide along with CBT nuggets/all the other free resources. 

****MAIN QUESTION****

Would it be beneficial for me to go back to my community college and get a ""A.A.S. Computer &amp; Network Support Technology"" while I prep for my first certs? 

Or should I bite the student loan bullet and go back to 4 year for an Information Systems degree focused in the ""Network/Security Analyst"" ""focus area"" from my state school? 

I estimate I will end up with around $20K debt if I go that route.
Using my pell grants for a second associate's if possible may work out to be free or even put a refund in my pocket.

I know that for HR screens the bachelors would be better. But I also know that truly understanding the CCNA material and getting any type of hands on experience is more valuable than a bachelors without those things. 

I figure if I get back into my community college, I can network with the professors and students/have access to a bigger and better lab than I could build on my own.......

Not really looking at it for the power of the degree but more for the actual learning and networking opportunity. And it would be something ""IT related"" for my resume (Which needs a serious makeover).

But maybe my time/money would be better invested in a decent ""home lab"" and self study? 

Maybe I ""have"" to get the bachelors? I just really don't want to go in to debt....but a huge part of me feels like if I'm going to spend two years in a structured college environment for a piece of paper that really only means as much as I make of it, might as well get the one that looks better at first glance.

I'm from a small town with a serious lack of opportunity, but I think there are some jobs in the field immediately near me. 

Also, I'm just 3 hours from DC, 4.5 from NYC.....Annapolis, Baltimore, the whole VA....I wouldn't mind relocating...

I worry that if I don't go back into one of the schools, it will be hard for me to find an internship or field experience...Hard to get that entry level job with just an unrelated associates and certs.

I worry that if I go to community again, it's pointless because I could have spent that two years towards a bachelors...

and I'm worried that if I go back to the 4 year, it's not a great school/program will be weak/I'll be under a massive load of debt and still no job or that I could get the job with self study/more certs.....

Sorry I kind of went on some tangents there....Any advice will be helpful. The only thing I can think to do for RIGHT NOW is keep studying the CCENT material and look for ANY kind of related job I can possibly get in to.

I don't have much time to type this. These events transpired over the course of the last year, and I'm making an effort to chronicle them, given the situation I am in now. I'm sorry for the length, I will have to split this into several parts.
____________________________________________________________________________

It was my third year of University, somewhere near the end of the first semester. I took the three steps down going out the front door of the coffee house I worked at and sighed heavily, my breath condensing as it left my mouth. I was sleep deprived and exhausted. It was only 5:00pm but the sky was already getting darker - not that it was bright before, it had been a suffocating grey all day. We had seen the first snow of the season earlier in the morning and I came unprepared, wearing shoes that did nothing to keep the snow out. I headed off to my apartment, my feet freezing in my shoes.

It was during these walks that my thoughts wandered. Though I tried to avoid it, they always came back to my situation. I had no friends. I never would've predicted I'd end up in this situation, not during my first year. I met a great variety of people from clubs, my dorm, random study groups... thinking about it now, they were never more than acquaintances really. I didn't interact with anyone at work. I didn't like them, could not relate to them, and didn't want to. Frankly enough they didn't like me either. Once I overheard my coworker saying she thought I was rude and a little frightening. My isolation had altered my state of mind. I was no longer sad or lonely. I drifted mentally, in a trance-like state most of the time. I think I craved human interaction on some level, but my behavior certainly didn't reflect that. I became cynical. The interaction I craved started to seem like a lie. I gave up as far as my social life was concerned. At first I would blame it on my unattractively high weight but I slowly shed that as I felt less and less like eating. *Fat loner to regular loner, nice.*

Academically I was fine, I guess. My GPA was a little above average but nothing really impressive. I couldn't land any fulfilling jobs or internships, relegated to being a part time minimum wage waiter. 

I wasn't helpless or frustrated anymore. I accepted my mostly mediocre, slightly above average destined career. Though I didn't interact with people much I saw old friends and family when I went back home for the holidays, and that would have to be enough for me.

It was dark already as I approached my apartment building. The stairs up to the entrance were on my left, and as I got closer the glow of the neon ""OPEN"" sign at the end of the block made me briefly considered going a little further down to the corner store, before I decided against it and turned to go inside. 

I yawned as I got to the top of the stairs and winced as the condensing breath got in my eye. I unlocked the door to the building. The heaters flushed warmth through my body as I entered, going up one floor using the staircase to the right. The white halogen lights were sterile and somehow sickening at the same time. I liked my building. It was a really old building but it was renovated about a half decade ago, giving it a lazy charm somewhere in between old and dusty, and new and polished. 

I lived in the apartment closest to the staircase so I rarely ran into anyone on my way in, but today as I opened the door to leave the stairs, I was stopped by a man in a suit an tie.

He looked to be somewhere in his mid-thirties. He was clean shaven and clear skinned. His hair looked like it was recently trimmed, and was combed neatly to one side. His suit was well-tailored and charcoal black, a shade darker than his thin, trendy dark grey tie. I smiled ironically without realizing it. This guy looked like me if I gave a shit, and I didn't have the energy to feel bad. He was even an inch or two taller than me in his polished, slightly raised shoes. 

""Good evening, sir."" - He started, in a formal yet friendly tone.

He started to put away his phone. The case had a small minimalist grey and white globe, with text underneath that read ""Milwaukee Project"". I only remember because I thought it looked so sleek and nice.

I half nodded at him, and fished my keys out of my jacket pocket, moving past him to unlock my door. 

""Can I ask you for some help?"" 

I stopped and half turned to face him. ""Sure.""

""I'm here to visit my friend and I'm not 100% sure which apartment she lives in, and my phone's dead.""

He paused briefly.

""Okay?"" 

""Well her name is Leah.""

I recognized that name, and it must have been apparent to him because he continued:

""Leah Foreman, you know her?""
___________________________________________________________________________

About a week after I had moved in, I checked my mail for the first time. I lost my credit card and waited until I'd moved in to have a replacement sent to the new place. As I was unlocking my mail box I heard some footsteps coming from the hallways of the first floor. I stopped for a second and turned around to see... well I won't say the most beautiful person I've ever seen - that's not true. She was the most attractive, but not because of her looks. She had a very gentle disposition. She was pretty, but the way she looked around and blinked slowly and the way she moved her small figure was what made her appealing. She glanced at me for a quick moment and moved to check her mailbox, her winter coat ruffling as it shifted against her body. It was a tight, thick form fitting elegant black pea-coat, which she wore with a pair of skinny denim jeans and black, high heel boots. Her loose purple beanie stood in contrast to the rest of what she was wearing. Her shoulder-length brown hair poked out from under it.

She spoke before locking her mailbox and turning to me. I realized I had been staring at her with my hand limply hanging onto the mailbox.

""Hey"" oh god that voice.

""Hi"" I looked back into my mailbox, took out the junk mail - no credit card - and started to lock it.

""Are you new here?""

""Yeah, I moved in last week, do you live here?"". *Fucking retard of course she lives here she's checking the damn mail*

""Yeah"" she giggled. ""I'm Leah, I live on the second floor"".

""Me too, actually""

""Yeah I know""

""Did you 'deduce' it from my mailbox?""

She smiled slightly. ""Yeah"". We paused for a moment, before we both started to turn away from each other.

""See you around!"" she called out, leaving the building.

""See ya! Oh yeah wait, my name is-"" I turned around but she was gone.
___________________________________________________________________________

""Sir?""

I looked at him again.

""Do you know where she lives?""

""213. Apartment 213"" *At least I think so* I thought. That's the number I thought I remembered seeing on her mailbox.

""Are you sure? I don't think there is a 213 here""

""Yeah the building is split into two parts, you have to take the stairs on your left when you enter the building.""

""Well thank you very much."" He smiled an obviously polite but courteous smile and left to go down the stairs.
___________________________________________________________________________

I woke up on my couch. It was pitch black. I felt for my phone in my pocket and unlocked it.

""1:00am""

*Well fuck, there goes my sleeping schedule*

I sat up and threw my legs off the couch, smacking them against the coffee table I didn't realize was so close to the couch. I switched the lamp on the side table on and the apartment was now dimly lit. The couch faced the TV, mounted on the wall near the apartment door. My bedroom door was still closed to the right - I came in and crashed immediately it seemed. I stood up and streched, stumbling breifly as I went to the kitchen on the left and gulped down a glass of water. My apartment was spotless and neat as always. The sight comforted me, but as usual, I thought ""for whom?"". I forgot about it and sat down again, turning the TV on.

I found a bit of comfort in the low, dull noise of some news anchors discussing whatever was going on earlier in the day, and started to remember coming home. I thought back to my breif encounter with the man outside.

*Did I say 213?*. Thinking back, it was most definitely not 213. I wasn't sure what it was but I knew I had seen Leah in the hallway outside my apartment, so she definitely does not live in the other half of the building. *Probably a good thing that I got it wrong, don't know who he is. 206, was it?*

Not remembering what time it was, I got up and headed to the door. I thought I should tell her that someone had asked me wh- well, it was an excuse to talk to her.

As I walked down the hallway I started to realize that it was past midnight. I started to turn around but stopped when I saw that the door to her apartment was open. I hesitated briefly before I continued down the hallway and turned towards the doorway.

""Hello? Leah?""

I stood there for a few seconds. I thought about turning around and going back but something made me want to try again.

""Helloooo?""

I sighed and started to turn around.

""Hello?"" A soft, familiar voice came from somewhere near the back of the apartment. It was set up similarly to my apartment, but the window was in the kitchen on the back wall.

""Leah? Are you okay? Do you know your apartment door is open?""

She emerged from the door to her bedroom on the left. 

She had her hair tied up in a pony tail, wearing grey sweatpants and a black tank top. I tried to ignore how amazing she looked but I couldn't help but stand there for a few seconds in a silence that she broke.

""Yeah- umm never mind that."" She walked across the living room towards the kitchen on the right and opened a drawer. It was then that I noticed she had been holding something tightly in her clenched fist. She obviously didn't want me to see it, and she put it near the back of the drawer as she slid it closed. 

She turned around and stood looking at me silently. A moment passed and she smiled faintly, which I took as a good sign.

""What's keeping you up?"" I asked, trying to start some conversation with her.

""Umm..."". She paused and thought for a moment. *Yeah you're not gonna tell me*. Whatever she was about to say was not going to be the truth ""I actually just woke up. I took a nap when I came home and I can't sleep now"".

""Hey, me too! I didn't get much sleep yesterday and just crashed when I came home from work""

She looked down and began: ""care for a late lunch?"" She looked up at me with her head still down and that look sent a wave of happiness through me ""it's not much, it's a leftover pizza.""

""Oh yes please, I'm starving.""

""Great! Have a seat."" She gestured towards a birch wood table pushed up against the wall of the kitchen under the window. I closed the door behind me, took my shoes off and went to sit at the table, with the window to my right. Some lovely red roses were planted in three identical light brown flower pots at the edge of the table next to the window. She opened the fridge in the opposite side of the kitchen and took the pizza out. The fridge was covered in neatly arranged, shiny vintage fridge magnets. She took the pizza out of its box, opened the oven and slid the pizza onto the oven rack.

""No microwave, I'm afraid"" She said, switching the oven on. ""We'll have to wait a little longer, hope you've got some time to chat.""

""That's alright"" *That's fucking perfect*.

""So what do you do?"" She asked, sitting down at the table across from me.

""Well I'm a waiter at The Brown Mug but it's a temporary thing, I'm studying Biomedical Engineering.""

""Wow you're cool"" she said, ironically.

""Yeah, that's what all the cool kids do.""

She laughed and played around with a coin she was holding.

""What do you do?""

""Well I'm in Law School actually-""

""Oh wow, impressive.""

""-yeah I actually really enjoy it, it's a lot of work but-""

A loud clap shot through the air outside.

The window shattered. Her head was gone - well, not so much gone as all over the table. Brain matter dripped off the table and onto the ground. What was left of her slumped over, spilling blood and the insides of her head all over the table, then onto the tile floor and into the living room as she fell over, soaking liquid into the rug. My face, torso and hands were covered in fine glass and my cheek had a small shard embedded in it. Blood dripped down my cheek onto the table.

I got light headed and thought I would vomit. I couldn't process what was happening. Everything went black, and the last thing I remember is the side of my head slamming into the cold tile floor. 
____________________________________________________________________________


I woke up with the sun beaming pain through my eyelids. I groaned and opened my eyes to see the man from earlier standing over me. 

""Well he's awake now.""

7ha3ll,10,2017-12-03,My SIL has zero concept of basic courtesy.,lizbunbun,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/7ha3ll/my_sil_has_zero_concept_of_basic_courtesy/,"SIL’s family had a very nice home-stay girl from China living with them for many years.  This teenage girl’s family paid them for room and board and general guardianship.  I understand she became like family to them, but she isn’t family. 

As nice as this girl is, she was very presumptuous whenever they brought her to my house, like she wasn’t a guest but actually lived there.  Just a little too comfortable and invasive into our stuff, our pantry, being a slob, like my SIL had taught her “North-American” manners personally (SIL is pretty bad about being very nosy, never asking permission just doing, asking very blunt and rude questions, very little concern for others unless it’s mega-obvious she’s done damage).  Also irritating because whereas SIL’s family was being PAID to host her, we ‘re expected to simply welcome her in like their own child.  

It has come up in the past that I don’t want to be expected to host their home-stay high schoolers.  They’re not family, I don’t know or trust them, I’m not getting paid like SIL is to look after them. 

Years later this girl/now-lady still lives in the province, getting a degree, now on an internship in my city.  SIL still keeps in touch with her.  

I meet this lady on the bus one day and out end up talking to her, finding out we work in adjacent buildings, so we meet for coffee to catch up.  Out of courtesy and generosity of spirit, I mention our extended family’s Christmas is at my house this year.  And I offer an invitation for her to come for dinner that night.  She says SIL ALREADY INVITED HER - they’ve made plans to go to church and then come to my tiny house for dinner after.  Then she asks why it’s at my house, because it’s so small (rude!!!)

FFS, SIL should have asked first about bringing her before extending an invitation.  Basic courtesy.  SIL hasn’t even talked plans with US for Christmas yet - we don’t know when they’re coming, if they’re staying overnight.  But she’s already invited someone to my house without passing it by us first.  Not the first time I’ve gotten irritated with her for assuming “mi casa es su casa” should be taken literally and applied to that of relatives as well.

My house IS rather small, it will be full of overnight family guests and their dogs, my husband is away on shift during the days (which is why we’re hosting), I’m pregnant and have a teething toddler.  I am already stressed enough about Christmas as-is, would have been pretty irritated to see this lady simply turn up if I didn’t ok the invite personally."

7hcmyc,10,2017-12-03,How to get a job in Software Engineering.,OneWithTheMushroom,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7hcmyc/how_to_get_a_job_in_software_engineering/,"Hello /r/cscareerquestions.

I've followed this reddit for several years as I went through my undergraduate degree and then transitioned to full-time in software development. Over and over I see the same patterns mentioned here that are not accurate to the current industry. And its destructive to the community of aspiring software developers who are mislead into believing a lot of generalizations that don't accurately portray the industry. So I'll put some advice out there for those who want to read. Feel free to be skeptical as these are just my observations of the industry.

Background:
(Mods, I can verify this information upon request).
I am a mid-senior level Java Developer in Austin, TX with most of my work with web services and back-end architecture and development in JavaEE7. I graduated cum laude from a non-elite state university in Florida, which is known for really bad computer science programs. I currently work for a startup as a Java Developer and am pursuing an MBA. Anyway, enough about me. This post is about you.

&gt; Question: Do I need to take data science, machine learning, AI, or other crazy classes to get a job in software development?

Answer: Let's rephrase this question. Do you want a job as a software developer in those fields? If not, then take them only if you're interested in the subject.

&gt; Question: Computer Science isn't really relevant towards the day-to-day work of software development. What should I do to help gain experience?

Answer: Take courses in school that teach software engineering or design. Learn object oriented programming, design patterns, and software architecture patterns. If your university offers classes that teach these concepts, don't hesitate to take them. I sacrificed taking Artificial Intelligence for a course on Object Oriented Design Patterns. Everyone looked at me like I was an idiot. It was the best course I took in my undergrad. 

&gt; Question: Should I get a masters in Computer Science?

Answer: Let's restate the question. Do you need a masters to get a job? Maybe you want to work with really new stuff like data science and machine learning. If so, a master may not hurt as you can take classes and do research on whatever speciality you want. In the mean time, a bachelors in CS is perfectly acceptable for opportunities for most regions in the United States.
Also, a masters should be something you *want* to do. Furthering your education is something you have to consciously want. Fortunately in software development, most places don't make it a strict requirement for a masters. So in the mean time, you're all free to graduate without worry for job opportunities.

&gt; Question: Do I need an internship?

Answer: No, you don't need an internship. I have several friends from undergrad doing very well and never left school with any development background. However, try to get them if you can! Target your junior and senior years in computer science for internships. It's okay if you do only one! I had a friend who completed 4 internships and has turned out the same as my other successful friends with no internships. The number doesn't matter. The experience does.

&gt; Question: I'm a freshman or sophmore and not ready for an internship / I can't find an internship. What do I do to get experience so that I can succeed in finding full time work when I graduate?

Answer: I have seen several of my friends in this position. Easy answer is to work on side projects. Pick some technology stack that you'd like to learn (i.e., MEAN Stack - MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, and NodeJS is hot right now) and make a project out of it. Web-based projects or apps are nice as they can be easily presented during an interview. It can be any project really. If you're stuck on ideas, try making a small scale social network. **It doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to showcase that you learned some skills in software development.**

&gt; Question: Should I get github?

Answer: Github, gitlab, bitbucket, it's all the same. It's never bad to host your non-academic projects. If you're familiar with version control systems, then yes use github or whatever service you prefer to show off projects and be sure to have that information on your resume.

&gt; Question: You mention experience matters. Do I need to target internships for a Big N company?

Answer: It doesn't matter where you work. What matters is what experience that you gain from them. Maybe you got an internship with Snap Inc. Awesome! First question you'd get asked in an interview is what did you do. Maybe you were like my friend at &lt;Insert Big N company&gt; who documented APIs. Does that experience directly help you on learning software development? If so, awesome! The goal is to gain experience in the field you want to target. The name is irrelevant. That being said, it's better to be a big fish in a small pond than a small fish in a large one. I have worked full time for a big fortune 500 enterprise and found the experience gained was minuscule compared to the startups and small companies I have worked for.

&gt; Question: I always hear of technical interviews requiring algorithm questions. Do I need to know them?

Answer: This answer highly depends on (1) the companies you are interviewing for and (2) the region in which you are targeting these opportunities. Here in Austin, some companies require algorithm interviews in person while others do not. My friends in San Fransisco and Seattle are only finding interviews with algorithm questions. Do you need to know them? Yes, unfortunately many companies require this as a ""measure"" of experience. While it's a topic of debate which causes a lot of contention, it's important to focus on algorithms WHILE continuing to focus on software development experience and technologies.

&gt; Question: What should be on my resume?

Answer: Most great resumes I've seen have (1) work experience, (2) projects, (3) education, (4) contact information. A typical format for a job opportunity or project would consist of maybe 2-4 bullets of technical things you've done and a last bullet of technologies used. Remember, **don't make your resume a job description. Make these bullets about what you DID.**

Ex:
* Developed REST web service APIs for an accounting system.
* Wrote back-end code leveraging Java 8 features including streams and lambdas.
* Utilized test-driven development through utilizing JUnit unit testing.
* JavaEE 7, Java 8, JUnit, &lt;insert other technologies&gt;

Summary:
If you want a job when you graduate, focus on getting yourself there. Build your resume, write projects or go for internships, and take classes that help you go towards your goal for a career. Hopefully this helps some of you aspiring engineers. Feel free to ask questions and I'll answer them.

I work at the Linux Teachers Lab of my college and in the Students Centers Federation, also I have European Passport so I think entering to the US will not be such a huge deal.

So I've been applying for positions in HR as well as admin jobs that have some responsibilities that those in HR have, just to gain those skills like payroll. However, my problem is that I didn't study HR in college, I actually had a focus in computer information systems. It was actually an internship that changed my interest so I've been trying to get into a position like it. 

However, I'm currently in a data entry position through a temp agency because I had been unemployed for a few months and the itch to work became unbearable. One reason why I went with this agency is because they also have positions in HR and I find that it would be an easy in for me than applying as a stand alone candidate. But like most agencies they haven't been completely straight forward with me and I can't change assignments all of a sudden so I'm on the job hunt again. 

Anyways, any general critique on my resume is appreciated! 

https://imgur.com/a/DtLsN

Questions:

1. Should I remove my college focus? (i.e. computer information systems) I still studied some HR materials through my business degree.

2. Should I not mention that I'm with a temp agency on my resume at least?

* 20(M), born US citizen, English first language (no second language), more than halfway through computer science degree course which includes paid internships as part of the degree program, I will graduate with at least 2 years of work experience as a software developer

Current living situation: 

* Stable for now, future uncertain. The pay from my internships is enough to live off and pay tuition with a few thousand to spare every year under optimal conditions (i.e no high cost emergencies and no trips or frivolous spending). I expect to graduate early 2020. For right now, family has my back in case of emergencies.

Reasons: 

* Weather, proximity to long distance friends, safety nets. Yes, current political climate is a factor but only amplifies an already existing desire to leave, and ties into the safety nets and uncertain future point. My family is encountering significant expenses that are manageable for now and the near future but will be a problem if my (single) mother loses her very long held job soon, which due to her specific employment situation is a question of 'when' rather than 'if,' and 'when' could very well be soon (the place of employment may not really exist sometime within a few months to a few years from now). We could be forced onto the individual market for health insurance (which would increase financial burden) and I obviously may lose the ability to rely on family for emergencies that I'm not yet able to afford with a significant portion of my income going to tuition. 

So bottom line is, I'm a CS major living semi independently (on my own paying for rent/groceries/gas/etc. but not for my own insurances and similar safety net expenses) with a relatively solid track to a career after graduation, facing potential future instability in my living situation regarding finances and safety nets, which amplifies my desire to move somewhere I can rest a bit more easily once I'm able to secure a more long term career post graduation, and the Toronto Canada area fits the bill for many personal preferences of mine for a place to live, both in government and geographical location.

Filling out the relevant questionnaires I've found that Express Entry is likely possible for me. So my main question is how can I plan and prepare for this over the long term, from now to graduation and even years afterward still where I am? The obvious steps are saving money and later on seeking a potential place of employment in the area, but what beyond that can I do, or what can aid in these tasks, to start planning the move and setting aside preparations?"

1)    Using Oracle VM VirtualBox, build a minimal install of Ubuntu server 16.04. This means that you should not be using a Graphical User Interface (GUI), everything MUST be done through command line only

2)    Using the ""NAT"" network interface is probably the best way to ensure that your project will work regardless of what network it is connected to (I.e at home vs on campus.) Even though you may be given a DHCP IP address initially, you MUST CONFIGURE A STATIC,  PRIVATE IP ADDRESS  AFTER INSTALLATION

3)    Immediately after installation is complete, set up a basic IPtables firewall to allow SSH, loopback, and HTTP connections

4)    You will need to use PuTTy (or your preferred SSH client) to configure your server. The VirtualBox console interface should be used only for the initial installation, networking, and SSH setup, so you should be exclusively using the SSH window from this point onward

5)    Create three groups titled “grad”, “ugrad”, and “staff”

6)    Grant your staff group Super User (sudo) privileges

7)    Create three users and assign the first to have “grad” as the primary group, the second to have “ugrad” as the primary group, and the third to have “staff” as the primary group

8)    Create three directories: /grad, /ugrad, and /everyone

9)    You will need to configure permissions correctly so that users in the grad and ugrad groups are the only ones who can write to their respective directories. Anyone should be able to write to the /everyone directory, but they should not be able to delete files belonging to other users

10)   Using a package manager or by compiling from source, install a LAMP stack

11)   Create a MySQL database and write a very simple website in PHP that interacts with your MySQL database in some way. Reading information, adding information, etc.

12)   Your Apache installation will be used to host the website, which should be viewable through a web browser on your host computer.This will demonstrate that your compiled programs are working correctly

13)   Be able to explain the steps you took to accomplish these tasks and what you learned from this project. You will also need to complete this project in such a way that you can show us the results in person, such as on a laptop or on a desktop computer that can be remotely accessed

7hfb19,22,2017-12-04,Depressed After Failing To Find A Job,HelloVoidMyOldFriend,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7hfb19/depressed_after_failing_to_find_a_job/,"So I am a senior undergrad computer science major and I've basically been unable to make any real headway into the market. Every year of college after freshman year, I applied to places to intern only to get turned down and had to find other ways to fill the summer. At first I attributed this to bad luck and lack of experience since I was an underclassman. I am now at the end of my first semester of senior and I am pretty disheartened, I got my first real interview this past summer and I botched it pretty hard. That ended being the norm for the next 6 months, radio silence or interviews so bad I was rejected. I friend gave me some advice and a website that I could go and schedule practice interviews, and I feel I have gotten better but still no success. Now that the year is closing out and a lot of companies are done hiring, I don't really know what to do from here and the depression is mounting. 
  
**TL:DR** College senior unable to find a job and trying to figure out how to deal with the frustration and disappointment.

**Edit:** So a lot of the responses seem that feel from my responses I am completely ruling out positions anywhere that isn't a big city or only with some specific company type, let me be clear in saying I am **NOT** ruling anyplace out based on company type or anything of the sort out of the gate. Whether they are a contractor, consultant, corporate, government or anything else I will give it a shot. I just try to make sure the workplace is a good fit because I don't want to end up in a place that I may not be all that welcome but that just means I'm just not trying in a place like Harrison, Arkansas not that I've ruled out the whole south or something crazy like that. Finally since a lot of people want to see it here is a link to my resume, with a caveat, I still have community service, coursework, and a student job attached to it until I can make some time to make some serious headway into a real side project and/or get some relevant job experience http://www46.zippyshare.com/v/8R01joDT/file.html. 

**Edit(1):** I plan on removing the community service and included a rather small project that I worked on earlier in the year."

A lot of people I know are really jealous of this and wish they could have done it. I have had some incredible experiences because of it, but it has left me with a problem that I don't think many other college students have faced, and that is the issue with maintaining relationships (friends, more than friends, etc.).

Every summer we had high school students work for us in a kind of paid internship program, though in reality the student workers mostly performed grunt labor that the regular techs didn't want to do. This particular story takes place on a sunny July day. A pack of 4 student workers are set up at a long makeshift workbench imaging new workstations all day - I'll admit it wasn't the most exciting job - and I'm nearby to keep an eye on them and help if needed. They should all know how to plug in keyboard, mouse, monitor, and network - I mean it's not like they can plug into the wrong port, right?


Me: ::Spider sense tingling:: Check on students to find them all huddled around one system, removing hardware.

&gt;Me: Hey, what's going on?

&gt;Stu: This computer is bad, we think it needs a new motherboard.


Not entirely unheard of, but unusual that we receive a DOA product.


&gt;Me: That's weird, what makes you think it's the motherboard?

&gt;Stu: One of the USB ports doesn't work. We've tried a keyboard and a mouse in this port and neither work, but they work in all the other USB ports.

&gt;Me: Ok, that's decent troubleshooting, I can follow your logic. Let me take a look....Well there's your problem, that's not a USB port. You have the mouse plugged into the ethernet port.


That's the day that I stopped believing any monkey could plug in a computer because the cables can really only fit into their own ports. I was also surprised that I hadn't ever run into this before, I had no idea a standard USB was the same width as RJ45.


TLDR: USB devices don't work if you plug them into an ethernet port.

I will be graduating this December from a private college in NJ with a 2.9 GPA.  I have had one internship developing web applications using PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQL.  I just started my second internship this past week in cyber security.  So far while here, though, I feel as if there is nothing to do.  At my first internship I was always working and always had something to do.   So far here I have just been studying a lot and trying to teach myself about cyber security the best that I can.  

I actually don't know what I really want to ask on here.  I guess i want to understand more about what the cyber security field is like and what you do on a day to day basis in that field.  I really do not know what I want to do yet and that has been what is killing me.  I feel as if the CS field is so broad that I have only just seen a little bit of what is out there.  Not sure if that was a problem for anyone else, but it certainly has stressed me out over the past few months.  "

Moving back home to the Twin Cities area in MN afterwards.

I have not been very proactive about my future career. I fully admit to it. I had several professors tell me having projects completed were as good as internships so I never tried to get any, always wanted to work on projects instead. However, I either spent time at my day job, or working on school work, and I only have one completed app to show for it.

I also had it in my head to wait until I graduated to apply anywhere. According to many of my friends, this was not the way to go. Now, I'm not naïve enough to believe I'll find a job immediately. I know it'll take time. I need to complete my resume, and actually start applying.

What can I do to prepare for the real world? I'm great with Java, and pretty good with C, and have basic experience with perl and C++.

I've recently heard of LeetCode from this sub and will probably sign up for premium there. I do think I am prepared to move somewhere else, but would much prefer the area around home. People who respond, what would you do if you were in my position?

7hk5jw,1,2017-12-04,Aerospace Grad Programs Abroad,SecondVariety13,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/7hk5jw/aerospace_grad_programs_abroad/,"Hey everyone, long post ahead, I was just looking for some general advice regarding aerospace master's degrees in Europe (although I'm open to other places as well).

Background: I'm a US citizen, received my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from a pretty good state school here (3.275 GPA). I have over a years experience at Boeing (internship + full-time). A few of my interests are orbital mechanics, FEM and rocket propulsion. 

My main reasons for wanting to study abroad as opposed to here in the US are as follows: 1) Cultural Experience - I spent a year in Spain and would enjoy the opportunity to again be immersed in a new culture and learn a language. 2) Cost - Tuition is significantly cheaper in some countries, of course I have to account for living costs. 3) Future Opportunities - I know this can be difficult as a US citizen, but I'd like to have the option to live and work in Europe in the future.

Concerns: Recognition of a foreign degree in the US and job opportunities. If I seek employment in the US after graduation, will a foreign degree significantly hurt my chances? Will I have job opportunities in the EU as a US citizen after graduation?

I've looked into aerospace programs at a few schools in Italy: Sapienza and Politecnico di Milano. I like the courses offered and they seem to have good reputations. I've also looked at a few in Spain as I'd love to continue learning the language and hopefully become fluent: UPC in Barcelona and Carlos III in Madrid. Unfortunately, Spain doesn't have the best reputation regarding engineering but I don't know how much this matters for job prospects. I've considered some non-aerospace programs in Germany (mechanical and comp. mech.) such as TUM as well. Note that all the programs I'm considering are fully taught in English.

I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed at the moment just with the amount of options and the uncertainty over the best path to take. I've taken the GRE and have a former professor and manager ready to write letters of rec. so I'm ready to start applying. I'd really appreciate any kind of advice you guys can give. Thanks!"

7hl737,2,2017-12-04,"On the precipice of an international move for personal reasons and I don't know what to do. Currently unfulfilled in career as electrical engineer, which I don't feel matches the skills.",stormy2587,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/7hl737/on_the_precipice_of_an_international_move_for/,"I'm in my mid-twenties and about to move from the USA to montreal, quebec, canada. The reason for this is I'm in a long term relationship and my girlfriend lives there and is waiting on a permanent residency application to be processed (She is neither a citizen of the US or canada). I have about 6 months to go before the move, which has filled me with anxiety mostly because it means leaving my job and attempting to find one in a market where I don't speak the main language fluently and don't have any sort of legal status beyond the 6 month tourist visa you automatically get with a US passport. The silver lining is that I have a master's degree in semiconductor device physics and BS in physics, which at least checks a lot of good boxes when it will come to applying for permanent residency down the road. 

The catch is that I find my current job as an electrical engineer working for a company that designs RAM soul crushing. I sit at a computer all day editing programs and text files to simulate the functions of some facet of a RAM and see if it works in the manner described by a customer. Most of my coworkers are eyeing retirement and its a small company that I don't know how much of a future there is in/for.

When I was in graduate school, I loved working in the lab with my team on whatever project was meant to teach us new concepts. It was a really interesting field where we would typically have to plan out the steps of fabricating integrated circuitry and then we would execute it. It really checked a lot of boxes in terms of what I enjoy. I got to work with others discussing ideas and working toward a common goal and i got to work with my hands as much as I was working on a computer or in a notebook. 

I never imagined the first job I would have utilizing this degree would be entirely about computer simulation and programming. I didn't even have a background in programming at all when I applied/accepted the job (I'm self taught since then), but it seemed like a good opportunity. Further, I accepted the job first as a graduate internship which I needed to finish my master's degree in the program I was in, and was later offered to stay on full time, which I thought that once I understood the job better than it would probably become more interesting. Further it allowed me to stay close to my girlfriend.  Two years have passed and I just don't see a future in this line of work. At least not one where I'm happy. My work environment pleasant enough, but I really just don't enjoy what I do. 

I feel stuck.  Realistically I don't have enough of a background in material science or chemistry to work in a laboratory using my degree, I see that now. 

A couple other things I've pursued since undergrad: 

 * I worked on a diversified farm for six months. This farm used horses as its primary means of power for things like tilling the fields and sowing seeds. I enjoyed the farm and the people I worked with but I didn't see myself as having any kind of future there beyond wanting to own a decent plot of land some day and toying around with farming. 
 * I worked as a supervisor in a grocery store.  It was physically demanding (stocking shelves), which I sort of liked, but super boring. I did have to coordinate a small team but it wasn't earth shattering stuff. 

Here are some things I love doing:

 * **Solving puzzles:** I love doing crosswords and solving puzzles. Its honestly the main reason I pursued degrees in physics. Solving physics problems was immensely satisfying to me.
 * **Collaboration with peers:** The only thing I like more than solving physics problems was doing so with other people. I'm definitely an extrovert. I'm really energized by human interaction. 
 * **Working with my hands:** Immediate after undergrad I worked for half a year on a diversified farm. While facets of the job were under stimulating. I really enjoyed physical labors all day. I also stay very physically 
 * **Animals:** One of the reason I liked working on the farm was dealing with sheep, horses, chickens, etc. Plus I had cats and dogs growing up. Having animals in my life has always been important. 
 * **making things:** one example is that my chief hobby these days is cooking. I spend a lot of time thinking about cooking and trying to learn new things about it. It definitely fills a similar role as what I did in graduate school. Executing a good recipe basically comes down to planning a process and then executing it much like in semiconductor device fabrication. Plus I get to eat it when I'm done. :) And I love eating.
 * **learning new things/experience new things:** I love learning and experience new things. I am currently *trying* to learn french. In grad school I learned how to play 5 sports to basic proficiency in a year because I could and it was a good way to get out of the lab. 

So anyway I feel like basically none of what I currently do in my job has anything to do with what I love to do or see myself doing. I feel like my interests have lead me astray my entire adult life and landed me in a job I sought to avoid. If you had asked 18 year old me if the word engineer would be anywhere in my job title, He would have said no. And yet here I am. 

I apologize this is a wall of text and at the very least it was cathartic just to right this all down. I'm definitely most worried about having to settle for this career especially moving to a country where it will be hard enough getting a job as a foreigner. If anyone has any advice on how to move forward or paths I should look into I would be most appreciative. 

Tl;dr: I have a MS in applied physics, but it seems like all the jobs involve sitting in front of a computer all day, rather than any of the things the education in that field seemed to promise in school. Like working with peers to solve problems or lab work to produce interesting devices. I'm about to move abroad from the US and anxious about what to do with my life. "

Due to a college strike I was able to drop the semester for a refund and no academic penalty (I was failing the semester previously). Right now I have a month and half of essentially free time.

Currently I have zero side projects, and nothing to show on Github. I have no prior experience other than a Data entry clerk job I had for a month this summer where I was typing in records, no programming or SQL or anything (Should this even be on a resume?). My college program also does not cover any math so I have very limited math ability. I never even learned calculus in highschool. So far I've gained ""functional"" knowledge of C++, Linux, Javascript, and HTML/CSS.

Right now Im working on a food web app similar to Myfitnesspal using the USDA ndb api with Express, NodeJs, React, MongoDB. This stack in particular is used in one of my future classes so I thought it would be better to learn it now. I was also thinking about doing an algorithms course similar to MIT's Open Courseware Intro to Algorithms course.

My goal is to get an internship or some work experience during the summer (May - August). I would need to apply around March/April though and probably won't have the time to work on anything other than school work during that time. What should I focus on right now that can maximize my employability?"

I've been and still am applying to mostly software development internships for this summer. I've had several interviews but no offers, still waiting on the response of a recent one.

My conundrum is that I prefer software development but feel my degree will limit me straight out of college. I've thought about just crunching the hell out of the next year, self-teaching outside of class a bunch. Another avenue I've considered is a master's in CS as opposed to switching majors as I'm hesitant to put myself so far back in school. 

Most of my knowledge is in C# and SQL, I'm self-teaching HTML/CSS/JS but wouldn't call myself proficient by any means. I've found however that, even compared to CS sophomore students, my knowledge of conceptual or interview-type questions is exceedingly limited.

In an ideal world I would've just done CS as my undergrad but I had ended up leaning more towards the business school when I entered university after juco. 

I guess the point of all this is advice from others: just go ahead and graduate and try and find a dev job with my degree or attempt to get a masters to help boost my resume? I've read time and again that a CS degree isn't required but I also know that it helps speed the process up. Any MIS -&gt; dev route people have input? "

The truth is that I am not too fond of the area I went to college (the college itself is great, just not so much the city and well... the whole state). I of course have the sort of ""naive"" dream of moving west to somewhere like Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Cali, etc. That being said, how realistic is this in the IT sector? If I move, will it be impossible to nab an entry-level job? How hard is it to land an out-of-state job in general, especially as a new grad with nothing but a few years of internship experience? Also, if you are someone who has experienced a move similar to this, how much money should be saved in order to keep myself afloat?

I'm not hoping for a particularly high paying or prestigious job, but ideally, I would like something that's not dead end and at least requires a bachelor's degree.

My top choices would be financial analyst or operations analyst which I truly believe that I'm qualified for, but it will be hard to get employers to give me a chance when they have so many more traditional candidates.

Long story short: I developed a mental block thinking that I would forever be unemployable because I was so bad at interviews that I sounded like I was practically mentally retarded despite having an IQ of 140+

Anyway, the point is, I've pretty much never worked beyond internship and part-time jobs that I had in college.

To make matters worse, I also have no network because I've made no effort to keep in contact with anyone I knew professionally since I stopped my job search in 2011. And I have nobody to put down as a professional reference if I'm even lucky enough to make it to that point in an application process.

At the time, I found my own solution, and that was to become a professional poker player.

I feel like I would just look all-around shady to prospective employers. I haven't worked, I appear to not know anyone, and I claim to have been doing something for the past 6 years of my life that not only sounds a little sketchy but they have no way of verifying. I’m really fairly clean, but I look so sketchy on paper. The main thing I’m guilty of is being socially inept. I’m mildly on the autism spectrum and have social anxiety which have been the main causes of sounding stupid in interviews and failure to network.


How would I go about:

Step 1: Even getting interviews with no connections

Step 2: Hoping this round of interviews goes better than the first round in 2011

Step 3: When they ask for references, what do I say or provide?"

My Bachelor's degree is computer science related and I've been getting into web development since my second University year. I believe I am efficient with HTML, CSS, JavaScript ( Mostly jQuery ), Node.js ( Using Express), PHP, MySQL &amp; Ajax. In the near future I'll begin learning Sass and Laravel. 


Putting aside all the small and random stuff I have done whilst learning these technologies, I have created 2 ( relatively time consuming ) projects for myself. The first one was a media sharing website written using HTML, CSS, JavaScript ( jQuery ), PHP ( Recently I remade it using Node.js ), MySQL &amp; Ajax that allowed the user to:


* Register
* Login
* Logout
* Edit profile page
* Upload a single image
* Upload several images that would be grouped in an album
* Apply tags to the images &amp; albums he uploads
* Upvote &amp; downvote images and albums ( only once, afterwards the user can change from upvote to downvote if he wants to )
* Access all images &amp; albums that share specific tags
* Add comments
* Delete images and albums uploaded by himself


The are users who have admin permission and are able to:


* Delete other users' images ,albums &amp; comments
* Add new tag categories


The second one on which I am currently working, takes a video game's API and displays all kind of information about users &amp; champions like stats, leader boards , win ratio of users and champions and more game related stuff.


Now I have 2/3 of the school year before I graduate and I still have time to learn and expand my knowledge and portfolio but frankly, I am really curious what would be expected of me on my first job, even if it is an internship. For all I know, my way of coding could be extremely different compared to a experienced web developer. Also what would be expected of me on the interview? Will they ask me questions about the languages/technologies or will they just give me a small coding task? On top of it all, I am going to try my luck in UK or Ireland but I fear that because I would be a foreigner, I would be the last resort of the recruiters. Any insight will be extremely helpful.

Any help or advice is much appreciated.

I'm currently an undergraduate senior. A little under a year ago, I applied for a job (*not* an internship) with a government agency that requires a Top Secret Security Clearance. Before starting the process, I had received a ""conditional offer of employment"", detailing salary/bonus/benefits/etc. conditional on passing the clearance. The investigation is still ongoing.

This being my senior year, I wound up applying for a *lot* of jobs, and I'm about to pull the trigger on an offer that I received from a different company. This company doesn't (as far as a know) do business with the government in a way that would require a security clearance of any kind.

Obviously, I could still fail the clearance process. Outside of that though, What I am now worried about are the legal ramifications if I either

* A) Cancel the clearance process midway
* B) Don't cancel the clearance, end up passing, but I work for a company that doesn't use the clearance in any way

In situation A, I'm worried that I would be ""on the hook"" for any fees the agency incurred in paying for the clearance up to this point.

In situation B, I'm worried that I would be on the hook for the cost of the entire clearance, since I'm no longer going to be working for the sponsoring agency. I'm also curious if the clearance would be void by not working a job that required a clearance at all.

I've looked over the original paperwork that I signed (the conditional offer of employment), and I don't see any language that suggests I would ever be on the hook for the costs of the clearance. However, the situation still makes me a bit uneasy, and I'd like to be sure before I plan my next steps."

I only went into the field because a couple of graduate logic courses taught me that I'm pretty good at that and software development is one of the very few fields in the United States now that pays well and does not require expensive and/or lengthy graduate education.  It also helps that the financial rewards in the field even for those who are less than elite performers are quite good.
     Growing up and in college, I was very interested in both science and policy, and started out in college trying to become a life scientist.  Unfortunately I found out that chemistry is not my strong-suit at all and was very put off of going into the field by the number of graduate students and postdocs I worked with who could not find jobs in science and the number of even professors I met who were constantly fighting to not have their labs defunded.  I eventually switched my major because I had been taking philosophy courses for fun and was only a few credits away from a major in it at the time.  I still find science interesting but would like to have a more secure career than the life sciences offer these days.  Other than that, I have never really explored my interest in policy and am wondering how someone with my varied and irrelevant experience might become involved in the field?  
     Back to the title of my post, it seems that I am good but not great at many things.  My undergraduate GPA is around a 3.2 or so which keeps me out of the running for medical schools or elite law schools that seem to be the best springboards to scientific research and policy careers, and my quantitative skills are definitely better than average but probably less than what it would take to do research in a math-intensive field.  Just an example that I think reflects my skills in the area, although the math on the test is much simpler than that needed in quantitative graduate school programs, I scored in the 87th percentile on the math section of the GRE.  Again, an otherwise good score for a humanities or generalist student but not enough for competitive engineering or computer science programs.  In short, I feel that I am a very good generalist with skills in a lot of areas but not good enough at any particular specialty to make an interesting career of it, and I am wondering if anyone can recommend a less obvious career that fits my interests that I might want to check out?  I definitely appreciate anyone who reads through this long post."

In fact, math has plagued me since 1st grade when I first started to struggle with it. Sophomore year of college, I had to take calculus to complete my degree with honors. I struggled. Hard. I failed most quizzes and almost every test, despite trying my best and battling severe anxiety over it daily. I failed the class. It was my first time failing at anything in my life. I cried for weeks when I saw that F on my transcript. I was completely convinced that my life was OVER. 

I had two choices. Drop out of the honors college and never take another math class again, or enroll in calculus again (with the same scary professor!). I came so close to sending that e-mail to the dean, asking to drop honors. I just couldn't do it though. I knew I had to try again. So I took the class. It was still so difficult. I studied my old tests, went to tutoring weekly, and cultivated a personal relationship with the professor so she knew who I was, my goals in life, and how hard I was trying. 

I passed calculus that semester with a C, and I cried tears of joy. I turned my failure into a success by writing about it for an application for a prestigious internship, which I was awarded. I had to speak about it in front of a panel of 8 interviewers. It was terrifying, but I was confident and proud of myself for refusing to give up. 

I started graduate school this year. I'm here with a full tuition waiver and couldn't be happier. 

I was one of you once, asking just how screwed over my life would be once my final grade came in as an F. It doesn't have to ruin you at all, but can turn into a valuable learning experience if you know how to turn it around. "

I will be needing the LORs in January, and as per the guidelines, only 2 letters are needed. Currently, I have 3 prospect recommenders: my university professor, internship supervisor 1 (project-based internship), and internship supervisor 2 (research-based internship). Both internships that I have mentioned is from the same organization, just 2 different projects.

My university professor and I have a good relationship. He is also my undergraduate thesis advisor. I am absolutely certain that he will be giving me a good recommendation letter.

For my 1st internship supervisor, we also have a good relationship. I started my internship with her last September till February. I provide support (administrative, documentation, etc) to her in our project in the country. I am also certain that she will be giving me a good recommendation letter.

I just started my internship with my 2nd supervisor just this last week of October and will last till February and we live in different countries, so apparently our relationship as intern-supervisor is relatively short. Most of the things that we are currently doing is data collection. However, I am quite certain that my supervisor is okay with the work that I am doing. The scope of our research is worldwide. 

All of them are experienced in their respective fields. I am particularly sure that my internship supervisors are both exposed to the international scene. 

Who do you think should I ask for LORs?

Thank you!"

I've never really stuck with anything or been good at anything my whole life. Nothing ever seemed to hold my interest for that long. Even as a kid I remember getting my parents to sign me up for things, then quitting after a year or two as I became too lazy to go to it. 

I did poorly in high school and at the end of it I had no ideas for what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I ended up going to the college in town for a year with no real interest in my program, essentially just going because I felt like that was what I had to do now that I was done high school. I got kinda depressed in second semester, did poorly, and then didn't go back the next year.

Anyways, I ended up moving out to a city for a few years and found a random job there. I lived there for a few years before I wanted to go to school again. I did some online courses, got into some schools, and went to the best one I guess. Had to move again.

First year went really well. I was actually interested in my program, and for the first time in my life I felt proud of something I had done. Now I'm in my third semester and this one has been terrible. I can never seem to concentrate on my work. I spent hours today just trying to read this one lecture for a final that's coming up. I put programs on my browser and my phone to stop me from getting distracted on them but even then I just stare out the window or get up and walk around my room after reading one paragraph. Idk what's wrong with me. I guess I've always been like this. I feel I had this problem a lot in first year but things weren't quite as hard and I managed to push through.

I'm so lazy, I've always been like this. Some days my alarm goes off and I take over an hour to get out of bed. I had a job last summer that I was gonna keep through the year but I quit a few weeks into the semester because I wanted to keep up with school and do some other things at my school that were related to my field (ya, my mom pays my tuition too). Then I quit those too, and I'm still not keeping up. 

It feels like no matter how little work I give myself, I can never finish it.

My program's hard, but I actually like the material for once. I just feel like I'm wasting my time and my parents' money, even though they like there I am. I have to start going for internships this year and I'm incredibly socially anxious and not confident in my abilities that employers are looking for at all.

At this point in my life, I just feel like a failure. I'm 24, I can't pay for my own school, which is going poorly now, I'm lazy and have never finished anything. If I quit now, I really have no idea what I would do with my life."

7hz17o,11,2017-12-06,I had to be that outgoing guy these past few days and I felt like I've learnt so much.,smilebrighter,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/7hz17o/i_had_to_be_that_outgoing_guy_these_past_few_days/,"Long time lurker; first time poster. Been popping in and out of this sub for quite a few years now but only recently begun to open up. Here's my experience:

**Some background about myself**

I was that guy in high school - that geeky guy in a corner that doesn't really participate much and probably too quiet for most people to care about. While studying for finals, I realised how much of a waste high school has been for me considering that I barely broadened my social circle at all from my all boys middle school. Pretty much the stereotypical Redditor - heck all I needed was a fedora. 

**What happened**

After finals I signed up for a three week short internship (along with 2 other friends) with a local government board. It was basically a short 3 week programme for high school students in my country to experience work in this particular industry. Prior to joining I told myself that I didn't want to stick to my friends and instead just work with whatever I have, which sort of helped my situation. 

On the first day, we got split into several groups separate from each other such that we wouldn't know anyone at all. This was for just three days as part of the orientation. Knowing that this grouping really didn't matter, I approached a bunch that seemed just as lost as I was and introduced myself. I'd admit it - it was difficult and probably really awkward as I stumbled a bit, even on my own name! We formed a group of 5 since everyone else seemed to be in their own conversations and sat down. After the standard round of names and schools, I remembered something that worked really for a friend and basically confessed to sucking at names - just to get everyone to repeat theirs and hopefully make a better impression. 

At breakfast, we got to interact again and here's where I think I really succeeded. After getting our food, we sat down together and ate in silence for a few seconds before I realised that this needed to change or we'll be pretty much awkward forever. Maybe it's my groupmates that were just really shy, maybe it was some newfound courage, but I begun the conversation once again and we got somewhere. I asked them about their backgrounds and what they did as extracurriculars, keeping in mind to rope in everyone especially when it started to become a one-on-one conversation. Unfortunately I wasn't the best at this so it did get awkward at times but I tried to play it off by pausing to get drinks or the like. Overall this brunch was one of the least awkward ones I've had with a group of strangers so I suppose it'd count as a win in my book.

At lunch we had a similar experience but it was slightly better as we realised we had a bit more in common than we originally thought. It was nothing especially eventful but it helped to set the stage for the following day since we already had a precedent of eating as a group. 

Day two, we had two new girls join our group, new to everyone except the only girl in our group prior to day two. It was initially difficult because I really wanted to just talk with the existing guys since the girls were talking on their own, but I eventually just reminded myself that everyone in the group already had a pretty good impression of me as the outgoing guy and I really had nothing to lose, so I initiated a conversation with them once again. Perhaps this wasn't very well executed considering that I eventually reverted to talking to the guys before breakfast, but I didn't want to let this go just yet. 

At breakfast, the two new girls sat away from us while their friend (the only girl in our group on day 1) was still getting food. As the other 3 guys sat down with me, I commented that the next few days was going to be rather awkward which got me some chuckles and a few nods. It gave me the confidence to jokingly ask the last girl to invite her friends over - which she actually did! Breakfast was much better than the initial interactions as I tried to get them comfortable with everyone. Wasn't as successful as the first day but I suppose it'd take some experience to really nail it. I'm happy with the results though, since we've pretty much broke that awkward interactions. 

The following day and other meals were less eventful so I won't be writing about them here but they certainly weren't anywhere as awkward as the initial ones. Talking to some of them individually, I realised that they really appreciated my initial attempts to get to know everyone despite the few fumbles. 

**To sum up, I've learnt the following:**

1. Just do it. Really. In the past few years, months especially, I realised that I didn't take on a lot of new challenges simply because I was afraid of the unknown. I didn't want to put myself out there. What if I fail? This experience has taught me that failure really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things; people would much rather remember the good things you've gone instead. Furthermore, if there was any doubt in that decision to approach or talk to someone, that must mean that there must be certain merits to that decision after all, so why not try something new? After all, insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different outcomes, right?

2. Admittingly some of my courage came from the past experiences and expectations of myself during the initial interactions, so I suppose the lesson here is not to lose that momentum. I didn't deliberately break it between the first two days, but it was certainly a bit of a struggle as I convinced myself to be that outgoing guy once again for the group. Point here being that going forward, I should try as much as I can to capitalise on what I already have achieved. 

3. Even where I didn't have much to begin with, going in with the right state of mind certainly helped, especially on the first day. Mentally preparing myself to talk to strangers definitely helped to calm some of the nerves I would otherwise have had, giving me a bit of confidence. This was also probably why I didn't care as well on day two before breakfast as the girls joining us was entirely unexpected. It took me a while to adapt but it did prove to be an amazing learning experience for which I'm thankful for."

I did not like the vibe much when I visited Apple and I haven't been to Google so I can't say how their culture is, but I feel like I would like the culture at Google more.

The Google program is really appealing because of the rotational and learning aspect and even if I don't get converted, it wouldn't be too hard to get other SWE offers elsewhere with that experience.

7i1l7t,49,2017-12-06,Advice: How I Became a Software Developer,theadammorganshow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7i1l7t/advice_how_i_became_a_software_developer/,"Around four years ago I quit my well-paying job as a data analyst to begin my career as a software developer. I've shared a lot of advice with junior developers and college students about navigating through the industry and finally decided to condense the information into one post (and [video](https://youtu.be/u6Egm0bIP7k)).

First, some background about me:

* BS in Management Information Systems, University of Alabama
* First job out of college was **not** in tech
* No previous experience in software development

Considering my background - I don't have a CS degree from a university like Georgia Tech, Stanford, etc. - I thought my perspective on getting into the industry would be valuable to those who are in the process of breaking into the industry. I'll be as transparent as possible and I'm open to any further clarifying questions.

**Foot in the door**

I admittedly had an easy entrance into the industry although it didn't last for long. When I was in college doing internship interviews, I had one interview at The Home Depot as a software developer intern which I ended up turning down. It wasn't until about two years later after my senior year of college and a year into my first job out of college that I decided I wanted to do software development.

Thankfully I was on good terms with the people who interviewed me at the time. I reached out to them on LinkedIn and asked if they were still interested. They were receptive, flew me in for an interview, and not long after I accepted an offer switching industries less than a year into my first job post-college.

It didn't take long for me to realize I hated it there. A lot. After just a few months I walked in one day and told my manager I quit. I'll admit, I was a bit cocky at the time thinking my degree and my resume with one job of a few months at this company would be an easy ticket into my next job. Given the labor market, I expected to be unemployed for 2-3 weeks at most. Wrong. I spent the next **three months** unemployed.

**Lesson: It's easier to find a job when you're already employed and this is even more true earlier on in your career. After your first job out of college, your degree loses a lot of its value. Think of it like a new car the second you drive it off the lot.**

**Learning how to sell**

After three months of unemployment, I was starting to freak out. Life was stressful as hell at the time and I was starting to get desperate. I got turned down for a few jobs I knew I could do so something had to change.

I had an interview at Autotrader as a UI developer. My technical interview wasn't going as well as I wanted it to and not long into the interview, they decided to wrap it up early. At least I think they did. They had five sheets of questions and we barely got through two.

In a move of desperation, I went into full selling mode. I said, ""Look, I realize I don't know everything right now but you're not going to find someone as hardworking as me. Call any of my references, call past employers, call teachers from high school and college who worked closely with me and tell them you're in a room with me and you're not sure whether or not to hire me. I *guarantee* you, they will tell you not to let me out of the room without signing. They'll tell you I'm someone who works their ass off and gets results."" I was as honest as I could possibly be with them. They listened, didn't say much afterwards, and we wrapped up the interview as usual.

A few hours later, I got a call saying I got the job offer.

**Lesson: Selling yourself in interviews is uncomfortable as hell but you have to get used to it if you want results.**

**Knowing your worth**

A few jobs later I was working at a digital agency that hired me on to do AngularJS work. They sold the job as very laid back, low stress, with a sole focus on AngularJS work - exactly what I was looking for at the time.

My first day on the job they tell me I have a meeting that night from 7-9pm. This continued week after week and not longer after I was working 70-80 hour weeks. I was the sole UI developer at this company responsible for delivering multiple projects to big name clients. They had no other resource at the time to fill this need other than me.

Fed up with this lie during my interview process, I showed up to work one day and called the recruiter who coordinated the role. I said, ""I want a raise of $X by the end of the day today or I'm walking."" After some questioning to ensure I wasn't joking and that I was serious about leaving that day if I didn't get my raise, she scrambled to make some phone calls.

A few hours later, it was confirmed I got my raise.

**Lesson: Know your worth and stand up for yourself. If you've been lied to, do something about it with whatever leverage you have.**

**Analyze employment from the employer's POV**

While I was at this digital agency, I was contacted about a job opportunity with a dev shop who had an immediate need for someone with my skillset to be the team lead for a big project they were working on.

I went in for an interview which was straightforward and more conversational than anything. During the interview they continued to address that they wanted me to lead the team and they'd need an answer very soon because of how quickly they needed to fill the position. A meeting was days away and the project was huge for them.

I quickly realized my negotiating power in the relationship:

* Urgent need with a meeting days away
* They wanted me to lead the team meaning my skills were better than the existing team
* The magnitude of the project - both from their POV and the client's

Later that day when the recruiter called me to discuss money, I decided to shoot high. *Really high*. Like, double my current income high. I told him my price and immediately he told me it was impossible. For a nice round number let's say I asked for $20/hr to double what I was currently making: $10/hr. He responded saying $10/hr was the most they could do. I thanked him for his time and said I wasn't interested at that price and I had work to do.

A while later, he calls back saying they can do $12/hr. I reply that my target is $20 and I'm not budging. He continues to tell me $20 is completely unrealistic, well above what anyone is making in town and that I need to meet in the middle. I decline again.

He calls again saying he can do $15/hr. Again, I tell him it's short of my target.

He calls a third time saying $18/hr but that's the most they can do and at this point they're losing money. I decline again. This is easily the most negotiating I've ever done and it was *extremely* uncomfortable.

At this point I figure they've moved on. 10 minutes later I get another call saying they'll do $20/hr, meeting me at my initial price which meant that in **one day I doubled my income**.

**Lesson: Negotiation is tough and there's a reason people don't like to do it. Learn to live with that discomfort or accept that you'll never get paid what you believe you're worth.**

Another red flag for me is that it requires a bunch of bussiness courses (I think the current department policy is to support enterprenuership so I am not sure how applicable they will be if you are working for a company). So is it worth considering it or is my gut feeling is correct that I will be more likely to get a job in software dev or architecture if I put in the time into fundamentals and algorythms (+ some internships)?

7i24qz,5,2017-12-06,Life Lessons: Why Did I Get Rejected?,TonberryBleu,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/7i24qz/life_lessons_why_did_i_get_rejected/,"For any reader here that is an experienced editor, copywriter, etc., feel free to correct me at any point during this post if I am blatantly wrong or presumptuous.  I am trying to break into this field based off of my passion of proofreading and nitpicking, but there is obviously a whole world of technical and bureaucratic knowledge I do not know of.

So I applied to a healthcare-based publication as an editorial assistant.  I have about 2 years of editing experience: a few months as an intern at an old magazine called Guideposts, a year at a jewelry manufacturer, and almost a year currently at a financial services company.  By editing, I mainly refer to editing documents, emails, proposals, powerpoints, and proofreading other correspondence.  Nothing glossy like editing a NY Times article, but stuff that I enjoy doing nonetheless.

The editorial assistant position is an entry-level position in NY that starts at $40,000 a year.  That's a few grand less than I currently make.  Either way, I get invited to an interview because the opportunity still sounds exciting, because while I do editing at my current job, it is on top of other office management work that burns me out.  This opportunity would allow me to focus on one or two strengths and develop them.

The interview goes pretty well.  Everyone is friendly, and I'm given more detail about the position.  It's 9-6, but hours sometime stretch after work and over weekends.  A little concerning, but understandable.  All work is done AMA style, which I am not super comfortable with but can and willing to learn.

After the first round of interviews, I receive feedback that the team liked me and from there, I would need to take a proofing test.  As per the course for an editing job.

These are the instructions given to me:

**Please proofread the “Proofreading Live Layout” file against the “Proofreading Backup” file.  Mark up any errors in the Live Layout file either by hand using a red pen or with Adobe Acrobat comment tools.**

This leads me to believe that the assignment is about checking for discrepancies.  Where ""Proofreading Backup"" is the correct, finalized version, and ""Proofreading Live Layout"" is the document that I am checking for errors.  Hence, ""proofreading 'A' against 'B.'""

Here is the proofreading backup file:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17w4Vt86N3j0_1wQZmNEdApSy9R1l-AUWMm8VjN31Ato/edit?usp=sharing

Here is the proofreading live layout file:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zXx5joMXt4yfBdBOheupZ6INuNKScXC5OYck_0ANGE/edit?usp=sharing

Because I did not have a printer at home, I simply made a list of discrepancies, here below:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19WkmpR12bblH3jdHNHyFQJcezdWqqvTobT2ErPPZGxw/edit?usp=sharing

About four days later, I get a message saying:
**""My apologies for the delay. Although the team thought that you could be a good fit, the proofing test results were not where we would have liked them to be. I wish you all the best in your search and appreciate the time that you gave to us.""**

While I am thankful for the response (it's way better than no response), I still cannot help but feel unfairly shafted by the reason behind the rejection.  This is not to say I did perfectly on the proofing, but rather, I am confused as to what level of proofing expertise is needed for an entry-level job such as this.  
I genuinely feel that I did a pretty good job scouring the document for discrepancies.

This is where I'd love those of you with more experience here on Reddit to come in.  If I am overconfident in what I am saying, feel free to tell me.  If there are mistakes or other errors I missed, please say so as well.  If I misunderstood the directions, that would be great to know.  I feel dejected and slightly angry, but at the end of the day, I am hoping to learn from my experiences and finally get that dream job.

Thank you.    "

I am currently an undergrad at a top 100 university studying computer engineering, and I've received internship offers from both GM (General Motors) and GE (General Electric- Aviation). I have interned with GE twice (Aviation), and I realized that I just don't have a passion for airplanes. I worked well and was highly productive but I don't think I am the right fit for full-time employment after graduating. My childhood was surrounded by cars. Learning about cars was the culture at my household at a young age. There is nothing wrong with GE as a company, I just don't have a passion for airplanes. On a subjective level, it seems as though GM would be a better fit for me. 

Can anyone compare the two with objective viewpoints? Maybe if you worked at both companies by chance. I am open to all opinions, so WHAT do y'all think?

The base salary for GS is slightly higher than CS. 

I actually enjoyed (!) CS interview process a lot. They asked very interesting Tech questions, challenging algorithms problems, and scalability issues; whereas in GS I literally got asked to reverse a linked list and to swap two numbers without using a temp variable (-_-!). 

I don't want to stay in Banking for too long. I am interested in landing an internship in one of the Big 4 next year, However, I am from a no name school, so I knew I had to gradually climb the ""prestige"" ladder, adding more important names to my resume (I got auto rejected at all Big 4 Prior to interview because of Uni and Company Names I worked in) . Having said that, I feel like GS has a more prestigious name and would be very useful to at least get me an interview next year.

The amount of pressure I feel for having to graduate in four years and the amount of depression I feel for feeling like a failure because I'm not gonna be able to do that.

With my Computer Science major, the school only offers one to two open courses for the next semester. Because of this compared to the amount of CS majors at the school, the class fills up instantly, before I'm even allowed to register. So now I just can't progress. For a whole semester. I have to wait until the semester after to take the class because of how short-staffed the school is. Yet it's my fucking fault that I'm so behind that I can't get my 4 year degree in 4 years? 

I have a friend who was looking into the student debt statistics at my school, and he managed to find out that less than 20% of students here actually graduate in 4 years. Most students can't even make it to get their bachelors ""on time,"" even when my school emphasizes on finishing in four. This same friend has the same situation. They're forcing him to do so much, and they fucked him so hard as a transfer, that he can't graduate until maybe 5 and a half years!

I can't take these courses because you literally don't give me a chance to. This is already disregarding the fact that I'm a 40-minute commuter and I'd have to stay at the school from dawn to dusk to be able to do most of these classes. 

I can't finish in four years. Sorry, dad. I can't. But I can't directly tell you that, because every time I do you blame it on my hobby, my video games. The one thing I do to keep me sane when you and the school are constantly fucking me up the ass. I only really play online with friends and it doesn't get in the way. But you never fucking understand that. You think I just want to be lazy, even though I got a seasonal job as an intern over the summer and I was commended by not only my boss but the god damn CIO for having such a good work ethic.

I have a strong feeling that I am not going to like this job because it sounds quite boring and repetitive along with the overtime requirement. I accepted it because it was the only offer I had and I wanted to gain some professional experience but I know it's not something I want to do long term. 

So my start date is coming up next month and I tell my company (which is in retail) about my intention to take another job elsewhere and they counter with offering me a promotion in a managerial role which pays more than what  PWC is offering. The position is similar to my current position (which I like) and I wouldn't have to relocate which is also attractive to me.  They told me they'll give me a couple days to think about it. 

The part I'm conflicted about is I feel like neither of these jobs will help me get to where I want to go. I want to work more closely to the markets and investments which is why I'm sitting for level 1 in hopes of getting something entry level. 

I know PWC is a big name when it comes to accounting but will that experience bring any skills or learning experiences that will help my land other opportunities that are more entwined with what I want to do?

I plan on attending college for a BA in Computer Science (the college I want to go to doesn't offer a security degree, plus I have been told that having knowledge of the basics, and a background in programming with the degree, as well as being skilled in security is highly valuable). While I am attending college, I plan to continue to earn certifications (that my work will pay for) to build my security knowledge alongside the basics/programming. 

After finishing my BA, I would like to continue into a masters program focusing on Security. Not sure what exactly, but I have lots of time before I get to that point. 

My question is one... is my current plan for the time being a good plan for success? and two... what would you suggest for certification exams to take? I currently am working on finishing up my studying for the CompTIA A+ 902 that I plan to take in January. After that, I will earn the Net+ and Sec+ certs to get the base three certs from CompTIA. Not sure the best route to go after that.

I'm hoping with all of the people I have talked to, and your responses combined with my boss and my instructor, I will be able to get a pretty firm plan set in place for what to aim for.


Thank you in advance!!"
7ia4e5,1,2017-12-07,Negotiating internship salary given 2 offers?,rainkissedlove,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ia4e5/negotiating_internship_salary_given_2_offers/,"Hi, I'm a junior at an Ivy League school with a great CS program and have 2 offers at the moment. Company A is a well known company, offering a 12 week internship with a very small intern class. Company B is not very well known with an 11 week internship and a larger intern class but the stipend is in the ballpark of a Microsoft intern's stipend. Both intern benefits are basically the same. I definitely want to accept Company A's offer because in the long run, I think I will learn more, enjoy the work environment more, and if I get a return offer (which is likely since the intern class is so small), the employee benefits are better, but the stipend they're offering is about $6000 less than Company B. So even though Company B's internship is 1 week less, I would still be making $6k more than Company A for the summer.
I know interns are not really in a power position to negotiate salaries but due to financial reasons (one of which being having to live in a high CoL area for 3 mo. for this internship though I'm from a very low CoL area), $6k or anything in between would make a big difference for me. 
Currently, Company A and Company B are both aware that I have multiple offers but I haven't yet reached out to Company A. And regardless of whether I negotiate or not, I will most likely still accept Company A's offer.
Would it be reasonable to try to negotiate my internship stipend with Company A and if so, what would be the best way to approach this? Thanks!  "

I am at a crossroads. I am debating whether or not to accept a spring co-op position at NASA's GRC. I am currently a sophomore at OSU majoring in Aerospace Engineering. I know that this is an amazing opportunity that doesn't come along too often, but I am also a little skeptical about taking a break from school for over a semester. Taking this co-op would set my graduation back by 1 year as most courses in my major are only offered once a year, but it would also give me the opportunity of a lifetime. 
I am also in a tricky financial situation as I am getting Ohio residency this year so I will have to be financially independent while working there.
Does anyone have any advice on the matter or even better experience with an internship at NASA? I would love to hear your opinion and whether or not you think I should accept this position.

Thanks"

There is a super class called Employee, and subclasses such as BoardMember, Engineer, Intern, etc.

 I am attempting to get the Payroll class to work, but I keep getting a NullPointerException error and I am 96% sure it is due to the getEmployees() method and constructor that I have set up for the specific class. I see that I declare the employees array below the constructor, but don't initialize it. I think that't why it's null, but I was told that I should leave it as is?

I watched some youtube videos and read some things on StackOverflow, but I'm still not clear on what is going on. I was wondering if I am misunderstanding the use of getters/setters? 

For clarity, the main populates the Employee[] with data from a text file. Int x is the size of the array passed in from the main.

I have yet to land an internship, I had 2 face-to-face interviews, 3 phone interviews, and maybe 2 video interviews.

I don't have any experience in I.T. besides the courses I've taken in college with includes computer networking, intro to Linux, C++, Java, and Web devolopment.

I currently started to look into certifications to help me land a help desk  job while in school. I think the A+ should help me land an help desk job. What do you guys think?

Was wondering if I can land an help desk job without the A+, or would I be better off getting it.

Have not decided on a career path because I don't have any experience in any fields.

But I really enjoyed my web development and networking courses.

Any tips on landing an internship, should I start applying for some out of state internships again? I stopped  because I can't afford to relocate my self, and the internships that offer that type of stuff is really competitive and I haven't had any luck with landing one of those so I just apply in state.


Thanks for reading. Any advice is would be much appreciated.

7ib9yq,2,2017-12-07,Should I quit my job and focus on school?,Annasyara,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7ib9yq/should_i_quit_my_job_and_focus_on_school/,"I'm not sure how often this question is asked, but I could really use some help deciding what to do. 

First off, I moved out of my parents house in July. Since then I've been taking classes full time out at a community college and have been working full time at a car dealership. I like what I do, I like my coworkers, and I overall enjoy the job. However, since I've started sometime in August, I feel that it's been nothing but constant change. They're always changing my job title and what I'm supposed to be doing and how I'm supposed to do it. They even change the hours and the pay structure. This is really distracting for someone trying to focus on school when their job is always changing as often as it is. 

When I went to register for next semesters classes, I realized I only have two classes left until I'm done with my generals. I went to look into what times I could take, and realized that if I tried to take both of them I wouldn't be able to put in 33 hours a week at my job like I'm supposed to. The class times are just all over the week and in the middle of the shift which would make it impossible for me to keep working at my job. I also thought to myself ""why should I put off my schooling for who knows how long because of a job who will have me replaced in two weeks?""

I considered for a second just taking some electives and pushing the two classes off until next year, but I ended up talking to my mom and she said I really need to focus on school. Right now I have a C in history which is quite devastating to someone who's always been an A student. The thing is, I know I can do so much better. I'm just completely exhausted working all the time and never have an hour to sit down and really focus on my homework. I have so much more potential than I've been able to show my professors. 

My job is also planning on moving to a performance based pay plan, which is all fine and dandy if we're doing well. I could make up to $20/hr or I could make as little at $6/hr. The problem is we're trying to compete with last years numbers when we had an entire time of 20 people, not 3, like we do now. It's impossible for us to reach those numbers so I have a feeling I will be making less than minimum wage the majority of the time and for how stressful the job is, it's truly not worth it. 

Another thing is, the amount of money I make depends completely on other people. If I work hard and do my part but my coworker doesn't, my pay suffers. If no one wants to come check out a car or decides not to show up, I don't make any money. It makes me very uneasy to know that my paycheck isn't in my own hands. 

So, as I explained all of this to my mom, she told me that I should just quit my job and focus on school. I was rather taken aback by this because how would I be able to afford anything? Well, she pulled up the account with my college fund in it. I knew there was a decent chunk of money in there, but I didn't expect there to be as much as there is. Let's just say that it is enough to buy a dinky house or an amazing luxury car. 

She told me that it is perfectly acceptable for me to use some of that money for living expenses in addition to my tuition. She said that she can pull a certain amount of money out every month for me to use while I'm focusing on my schoolwork. Granted, it is less than I am making right now - but still a good amount that I could easily live off of as long as I'm careful and budget things. 

Now, I'm a bit sad at the thought of leaving my current job - but as I said, my time is worth more than $6 an hour when I'm working my booty off. The biggest concern I have is feeling bored, without a purpose, and my friend circle judging me. 

I don't know if school will keep me occupied enough to feel fulfilled. Also, my dad passed away two years ago when I was 16. He left me a hefty sum of money that helps me pay my rent and car payment right now. My friends all judge me and call me a trust fund baby and think I'm spoiled rotten because of my current situation. It really sucks because I'd take my dad over the money in a heartbeat, but I wasn't given the choice. So I'm doing what I can right now to make my life easier like the money was intended to and I'm judged for it. So I'm worried they'll judge me more if I don't work at all. However, they're already judging me so I kind of think ""what do I have to lose?""

Just thinking about not having to work and go to school full time lifts a huge weight off of my shoulders. I can't stop thinking about how much time I'll have. I 'll finally be able to clean my room, go through all the boxes from when I moved out, get a hair cut, and spend more time with my animals. 

I guess I'm just scared to take the leap. I have considered quitting and focusing on school for the first month and then seeing how I feel, possibly getting an easy part time job or even start being a date night babysitter or a pet watcher to bring in some fun money. I've also considered doing an internship for the field I'm planning on working in. I just don't know if this will be the best idea since I will have a job history where I stayed for 1 year, 2 years, 6 months, and 5 months and I worry it will make me seem less reliable because of the short terms. What do you guys think?

TL;DR - I've been burning myself out by going to school full time as well as putting 35+ hours into my job every week. I'm not focusing on school like I should, and my mom showed me my college fund (which is huge) and said it can help pay for my living expenses and to just quit my job. My friends already call my a trust fund baby and think everything is handed to me even though I feel that my family and I have worked hard for what we have. I love the idea of being able to take care of myself and my animals emotionally and physically and showing my true potential in school, I'm just scared and don't know what the right choice is. "

We built it and presented it, but since it's a bank we were told after our presentation that it would be very unlikely they would be able to actually implement it. I gained the experience from using the tools to build it, but nothing I couldn't have learned online.

At my second internship with Householdish Web Name But Not Big-N Company **A**, I completed tickets and did, what I felt like was 'real' work. I got to push lines of code to running applications. I thought I gained much better experience and I was much more motivated to complete work.

Now I have an offer from a Big-(6?) company **B**, but from what I've heard, they do intern projects. About half, from those I've talked to on here, actually reach prod. So I don't know if I should take the return internship offer from the company A, or take the similar offer from B. B would probably open a tiny bit more doors, but not give as much real experience. Which would you choose?

What are your thoughts / experiences with intern projects? Was my first experience at Big Bank just a poor one?

[Final Chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7j54mh/you_better_not_cry_final_chapter/)

“Please, you’ve been there, you know how it is. You can help me.”

It was 5:30 in the morning. I had barely slept for three hours. I was too exhausted to have this conversation with my sister. 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Sarah.”

She huffed, which was annoying, but at least she sounded a bit more like her old self. “Come on! You told me so! The night before Santa took me. You told me you’d been to the North Pole. ‘It’s a cold, dark, terrible place.’ You knew. You tried to warn me and I didn’t listen. I believe you now.”

I sighed. “Sarah, I made all of that up to scare you. I’ve never been to the North Pole. I’ve never been anywhere north of Maine! Now just stop this. You’re alive and that’s all that matters. And now we can–“

“We can what? Pretend it never happened? Maybe you can, but I can’t. That boy I told you about. The one Santa beat to death for dropping the doll house. His name was Micah. He was my friend. He was kind to me and gave me his crackers when I was feeling too weak to move. When I was too sick to feed the deer, he’d do it for me, even though he was frightened of them.” She shook her head. “I have to go back.”

“Why, Sarah?! So Santa can kill you too?”

I was on the verge of screaming now. I still couldn’t believe my mother hadn’t gotten up. 

“To help the others! Like Salvatore helped me. So that Micah didn’t die for nothing.”

“No. You’re crazy, Sarah. I’m going to wake mom up. She’ll be so relieved to see you and–“

Sarah gripped my arm between her bony fingers and squeezed. “If you do that, I’ll be gone before she can make it out of bed.” 

I took a breath. I realized I would have to tell her everything. 

“Alright, Sarah. I’ll tell you. I was at the North Pole before. Okay? I was seven years old when I was taken. You were just a baby. I was there for around six months.  Understand that, back then, the Snow Lady was known to be a *death sentence*. The fact that living with her is now considered to be a *reward* makes it clear how deranged and evil the Claus’s have become. I know you’re sad about your friend. You don’t want him to have died for nothing. I get that. I feel the same way. Except the person *I* don’t want to have died for nothing is my father. Your father. He died to save me from that place. I don’t remember how it happened anymore. I just know that he died. And he didn’t have a freakish giant reindeer to save him.”

Sarah’s lips began to tremble and I could tell she was starting to break. “What else do you remember?”

I shook my head. “Not much at all. Mom forced me to go get treatment. She said it was the only way I would ever be normal. The only way I could forget. She sent me to different doctors. Finally they decided to attach me to a large machine that sent electric shocks through my body. It worked mostly. All of the details of my experience at the North Pole are gone, along with many childhood memories. Most of the experience feels like a dream now. Like a nightmare that’s only frightening for a few moments after you wake up. I managed to wake up, though, Sarah. And I’m not going back there.”

Sarah’s sad, pensive expression hardened into one of determination and resolve. “If you won’t help me, I’ll go back alone.” With that she hoisted herself on my bed and began to climb through the window. 

I wanted desperately to call out for my mother. To close my eyes and pretend that none of this was real. But I knew that if I did, I would lose Sarah again — possibly forever. 

“Wait, Sarah. If we’re going, we may as well be warm.” 
 
We dressed ourselves quickly in layers of puffy coats, thick sweaters, boots, hats, and gloves. We worried mom would wake up if we walked through the hall, so Sarah had to wear my clothes. They drowned her, but they were much better than the rags she arrived in. Somehow we  managed to climb out of the window, leap toward Salvatore’s back and mount him. Sarah sat in front —  gripping onto his the thick fur in his neck for dear life. I hung on behind her, wondering if we’d fall to our deaths before we even made it out of New Hampshire. Sarah seemed unafraid though. She just leaned her body forward, whispered something in Salvatore’s ear, and we were off. 

I don’t know how long we flew for. Time loses all meaning when you’re floating among the stars. Before I knew it, we had made a rough landing among a thicket of pine trees and tumbled off Salvatore’s back into the snow. 

Sarah warned me to be quiet as we crawled forward to observe. 

The North Pole was different than I remembered it. The first thing that stuck out to me was a large steel pen. The pen housed the “huskies”, as Sarah called them. Most of the dogs were at least three times the size of full grown wolf. They howled and barked from their steel pen, showing flashes of sharp teeth that shone as white as the snow beneath them. 

My eyes widened. 

“Sarah...Those...things...those things are not huskies. I don’t know what those are.” 

Sarah shrugged. “Santa called them huskies.”

“And...and you told me before that  you and the other kids slept outside at night with these things? All cuddled up to them?” Sarah nodded and I shuddered. “Those definitely weren’t around when I was last here. At least I don’t remember them.”

Sarah frowned. “It was either lay with them or freeze to death. They aren’t so bad, really. You just can’t sleep with your face too close to their heads.”

“Why not?” I asked. I don’t know why I asked. I was sure I knew the answer. 

Sarah shrugged. “They don’t like it. They don’t like anything touching their faces. Nora made that mistake. Mrs. Claus managed to stop the bleeding eventually but the damage was done. She wasn’t able to save Nora’s nose  — so it just became an odd, scarred, hollow place in the middle of her face. Santa started to tease Nora after that: Noseless Nora, he’d say. He forced all of us to call her that too. We felt sorry for her, but there wasn’t much that we could do. She was the prettiest girl here before. Not that being pretty means much here. After the biting incident, Nora was so ashamed that she tore strips from her burlap dress and hung herself from that tree branch.” 

Sarah pointed to a pine off in the distance. “By the time anyone found her, she was frozen solid in mid-air. The tears on her face made little icicles.” Sarah used her finger to make a crying motion on her own face. 

I looked off and saw the tree, but also perceived something far more disturbing coming into view. An obese man with a long white beard was sitting atop an enormous wooden sleigh. At first, that was all I could see. I wondered what was pulling his weight since all of the reindeer, except Salvatore, were in a separate pen. 

“Santa.” I said quietly. “What’s he doing, Sarah?” I asked. 

She sighed. “I forgot to tell you. Most of the reindeer have gotten hard to manage, so....”

Sarah’s voice faded out of my perception. I shook my head and blinked rapidly. Somehow I expected it all to disappear when I opened my eyes. But it was all too real. Santa had attached two dozen children to harnesses. They were crawling through the snow on bare hands and knees, yanking the sled slowly but steadily behind them. Not infrequently, they would cry out as Santa brought his long bull whip down across their backs with a horrifying *crack*. 

I managed to refocus enough to hear  Sarah continued: “Santa needs something else to pull the sleigh now. That’s what the huskies were supposed to be for, but it didn’t work out. They’re more than strong enough to pull it but they’re stubborn. They won’t tolerate being whipped, for example. The reindeer were perfect for the job. They’ve been trained and bred to be that way for centuries. They used to be loyal creatures before Santa began to starve them.”

“Why would he starve the reindeer?” I asked. 

“Well, they’re herbivores by nature. So the only way he can get them to eat the children that the Snow Lady rejects is to keep them hungry. I used to try to feed them a fair amount, but Santa would always force me to dump at least half of what was in my bucket. So they never had quite enough.”

“I don’t understand, Sarah. Maybe I once knew...back when I was here...but I’ve forgotten....”

“Forgotten what?” 

“Well, why does Santa feel the need to rid of the older children? They’re bigger and stronger. They could work harder. Why not keep them? Let them grow up and become adult laborers.”

Sarah looked at me, and, suddenly I didn’t feel so old anymore. Even though I was sixteen and she was barely nine, I could look in her eyes and tell she had outgrown me years ago. You know how when you tease little siblings, and, in their innocence, they warn you that one day they’ll be older than you? I began to think Sarah was older than me now. 

She sighed again. “They can’t let the kids to grow up because teenagers rebel. Children too, but it’s different. Kids are taught to obey from infancy. It comes naturally to them. Mrs. Claus always says all that keeps this place from going up in flames is the obedience of children.”

I paused. “But...you’re still a child, Sarah. So what’s different about you?”

Sarah didn’t say anything. I’m not sure she knew the answer. 
 
I winced as I heard the whip crack more. “Agh! Why is he beating them still? They clearly can’t move any faster!”

Sarah shook her head solemnly. “He doesn’t want them to move faster.”

“Then what does he want?” I asked, perhaps a bit too loudly. 

Sarah’s mouth formed a grim line. “He wants them to fly.”

I shivered some more as Sarah reached under the coat she was wearing and fished something out. It was a small, tin whistle. The kind they used to put in Cracker Jack boxes. She took a long, deep breath and blew into it. 

Santa looked around, apparently confused, but it was too late. In moments, a skinny  little boy had scurried from the mansion with a large key and unlocked the husky cage. The huge growling beasts  raced out. They saw Santa with his whip and, I would guess, it brought back some memories of their own training sessions with the jolly old man. 

They snarled and snapped their teeth as Santa tried desperately to get them under control. It was little use. One of the dogs went completely berserk and ran head first into the reindeer enclosure, freeing them as well. 

The ensuing chaos allowed my sister and I enough time to run over to the kids who had been pulling the sleigh and free them from their harnesses. My sister and I ran behind them as they joined the others inside to deal with Mrs. Claus.  

It all seemed to happen with lightening speed. I’m not sure why my sister thought she needed me. Those kids had clearly been organizing. Mrs. Claus was in the kitchen as usual. Before I knew it, the children had hogtied her with a long green striped ribbon, stuffed a big   Christmas ball ornament in her mouth, and sealed it over with heavy-duty packing tape muffle her screams.

I watched in a mixture of admiration and horror as they shoved Mrs. Claus’s head deep into her own blender and turned it on. The flesh from her face spewed everywhere, painting  the ceiling and countertops a festive amalgamation of white and red. 

Mr. Claus proved more difficult to subdue. He eventually gave up on gathering the huskies and reindeer and stormed into the mansion. He swung his whip around like a madman, howling and spitting and promising to skin us all alive.  

But when he finally arrived in the kitchen and saw what happened to Mrs. Claus, he broke. He fell to his knees and screamed up at the ceiling so loudly that, for a moment, it drowned out all of the commotion outside. 

Sarah, never one to waste an opportunity, had snuck up behind him with a large, cast iron baking pan raised high above her head. Just as she was reading to bring it crashing down upon Santa’s skull, he turned suddenly and seized her by the neck. 

“Ah. I remember you. You’re the little girl who stole my reindeer.”

Sarah dropped the pan, coughing and gasping as Santa stood up with his hand still gripping her throat. 

“Don’t worry”, he said. “I’m not angry about Salvatore. He flew for you. Didn’t he? I just want to know how you made him do that...You see...He hasn’t  flown for me in *months.* I almost missed last Christmas because of Salvatore. Almost missed it entirely. How did you make him fly for you, Sarah? HUH? TELL ME. HOW DID YOU MAKE HIM FLY?!”

Sarah panted and opened her mouth. At that moment, I watched as Santa slightly loosened his grip on her neck so that she could speak fairly. 

She coughed and heaved. “I...w-was...kind...to him.” 

Apparently that was the wrong answer. Santa let out a deep and terrifying growl and lifted Sarah high above his head, now squeezing her neck with both hands. 

I raced over, and pounded his enormous stomach with my fists, screaming at him to let go of my sister. 

But Santa was nearly nine feet tall and had to weigh nearly 700 pounds. One swift kick of his giant boot to my stomach was enough to send me sprawling backwards and onto the floor in a heap of agony and shame. 

Santa paused for a moment, finally looking at me. “Oh.” He laughed. “I remember *you*, boy. Yes. And I remember your father too. You look like him now. You didn’t before, but you do now. Your father was one of my best interns at your age. He caused so much hell for me when he left that I swore off teenagers after him. He was gone for years. I had no idea he had a family until he came back here...looking for you.”

“You murdered him...” I spat. Suddenly, I remembered. I steadied my voice as best I could. “It was nighttime. We were running and you ran him down with your sleigh. Your reindeer trampled him to death.”

Santa smiled, flashing sharp rotted yellow and brown stained teeth. “That’s right! And I would have killed you too. But you were so small and skinny, you slipped right between the runners. But, life has a way of giving us second chances. When I’m done with your sister, I’ll finish what I started!”

Sarah was turning blue. I tried to stand. Each time I died, the searing pain throughout my abdomen forced me back down. I noticed the rest of the children just standing around  looking on. 

“Help her!” I hissed. But they seemed mesmerized. It was as if they couldn’t move. All of the bravado they possessed before had vanished as soon as their plan went awry. I wondered vaguely if they might be under a spell. 

But then I realized that I was not in a room amongst warriors or soldiers. These were children. And when I looked in their eyes I saw raw, cold fear. They  couldn’t move anymore than I could with my broken rib. 

Sarah had been kicking her legs before. But now her little body had begun gone limp. She closed her eyes and I wailed in horror.  

That’s when I noticed a little red-headed girl grabbing a chair. She stood on it and used it to propel herself so she could stand up on the countertop. Santa wasn't paying attention when she let out a wild screech, leapt onto his back, and threw a long metal slinky  around his neck. 

Santa thrashed and tried to throw her the little girl off, but, tiny as she was, she held tight. That’s when the other children began to move. The little boy who had freed the wolves retrieved a  stack of long metal pokers that the Claus’s used to stir the coal. He and several other children took up arms. 

Those without pokers used various kitchen utensils - knives, spatulas, pots, and rolling pins to beat and slice at the old man’s legs. Those *with* the pokers took turns stabbing and thrashing at Santa’s bloated stomach until his intestines spilled out on the kitchen floor. Finally, the old man collapsed. 

It seemed to be over until a small dark-haired boy with thick glasses suddenly picked up the whip Mr. Claus had dropped when he entered the kitchen. The boy had been one of the children attached to the harness when Sarah and I had arrived. He took a firm hold of the whip, swung it over his head, and used it to beat Santa’s corpse. He continued the assault, sobbing and shrieking manically until another little boy managed to calm him down.  

When the mayhem finally subsided, everyone paused for a moment. The silence was promptly broken when one little girl let out a triumphant yell. With that, everyone began to jump and cheer, their blood-splattered faces lighting up in smiles and laughter. 

All of the children...except Sarah. 

I crawled to where she was laying on the ground. I shook her gently by the shoulders. 

“Sarah? Sarah! We won! We’ve done it! We can go home now Sarah. We  can go find Salvatore and get out of here!”

She didn’t move. I began to panic. I shook her more roughly.  

“Sarah! Sarah wake up! Wake up now, Sarah!”

Suddenly, the kids scrambled. We could hear the chandelier breaking in the living room and the loud boom of sky-high book shelves tumbling over. 

Salvatore. His antler smashed through the door way leaving the room a mess of rubble and carnage. The children had all huddled in the furthest corner of the kitchen. I shared their terror but I couldn’t leave my sister. 

Salvatore moved slowly toward us, antlers piercing and dragging through the ceiling. If it hurt, he didn’t show it. 

He seemed to perceive Sarah although I couldn’t quite tell if he ever looked down. All I know is that he suddenly raised his enormous black hoof and brought it down hard on Sarah’s chest. 

I screamed and tried to lift it off of her. But even if all of the bones in my chest had been in tact, I might as well have been trying yank one of the pine trees out of the ground by its roots. 

I began to cry like an infant knowing my sister had sacrificed her life trying to cleanse this god-forsaken place. I cried for my sister. I cried for Nora. For little Micah. For my father. And for me. 

As I racked my body with sobs, I suddenly heard a choking gasp. 

Sarah. She had breathed. Then, without a sound, Salvatore lifted his foot and walked back outside just as he had come in. 
 
I hugged my sister as tightly as my aching body would allow. 

“It’s over, Sarah”, I whispered. “The Claus’s are dead. We can go home now.”

Sarah shook her head, chest heaving.  “No it isn’t,” she rasped. “Not yet.”

“It is over, Sarah. What are you talking about?” I asked, finally letting her go. 

She looked me in my eyes. I noticed they had lost their light again. “We can’t leave,” she said firmly. “Not yet. Not until we pay a visit to the Snow Lady.”"

I am in my 2nd year of university and I have just learned my first language, C++. I am wondering how difficult would it be for me to find an internship when I am competing with people who have had years of experience and a great portfolio under their belt. 


Since I have just started to learn around 2 months ago, I don't have any great projects to add to my portfolio, nor do I know where to start or what kind of projects/code I SHOULD be including in my portfolio. I have no prior experience to programming and I am afraid that I won't be able to find a place that would accept me since I am a beginner. Do internships expect you to be a programming god or will they teach you along the way? How can I start building my portfolio and where should I host the code that I have written? I know that some people build websites for themselves? I don't expect to be interning for Apple or anything, but I'm not sure if even startups would want me. I am located in Los Angeles, CA, btw. Also, are there any tips/websites I can use to help practice my coding/learn more languages?"

I have physics and the labs already completed. Including the upcoming spring semester I'll only have 3 semesters left. If I go for the BA, I'd only have to do 2 CS classes each for the fall and spring of my senior year. But if I go for the BS I'd have to do 3 CS classes each for fall and spring. Is if even worth it? I've heard that three programming heavy classes is a nightmare. Also, I don't want to potentially kill my gpa. But no matter what I read on the age-old argument of BA vs BS, I still find myself looking down at a BA in a STEM major. I also want to go to grad school eventually, and am worried this hurts my chances. I'm probably being stupid but can someone give me some advice?

7igfop,3,2017-12-08,About to start Junior year after academic hiatus looking for tips,knew_already,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7igfop/about_to_start_junior_year_after_academic_hiatus/,"I will start to finish my BS in Information Systems (Network/Security Analyst focus) next month.

I'm 23 and have an associates degree, but wasn't always planning to do IT.

I would like to eventually be into networking/cloud/security. What things should I start to study now, what should I do to prepare to land an internship and entry level job after college?

I started studying for the A+, and being that I've always been comfortable with computers, I think I can pass that by mid February. 

I also have the official cert guide library for the CCENT/CCNA exams. I will start that after A+

I know I need to start looking for internships/experience.

I'm having trouble finding relevant companies/internships in my area--hopefully I can meet with someone from the school to discuss that. 

I would like to eventually work in the DC/VA area because I see a lot of open jobs there and it's not far from where I am now. 

Should I just keep studying, looking for experience through college network, work on things at home, and save money to be ready to move when I receive an offer? 

I'm just stressed because I'm 23 so I'm getting a late start and I always want to plan ahead so I have some goal to focus on or at least an idea of what I'd like to achieve. 

With studying for A+/CCNA and a full time course load plus trying to find some part time work, my hands will be full..I also know I should start learning something like Python or SQL...maybe practice with Linux...There's so many things it's easy to get overloaded...

Any tips will help. For now I have planned 

1. Study for A+ (Pass by Feb 2018)
2. Study for CCENT (Pass by May 2018)
3. Pick a programming language and study (Python, Perl, SQL etc)
4. Work on building a portfolio or documentation on personal projects I build (websites, at home labs, etc)

5. Improve resume and look for jobs/internships

And of course maintain great grades in all my courses"

Thank you
7iid3j,3,2017-12-08,I started therapy and it sucks so instead I'm going to dump random thoughts on the internet.,Mickey-ge,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7iid3j/i_started_therapy_and_it_sucks_so_instead_im/,"The past few years have been a compounding of failing classes and emotional meltdowns that finally pursued me to seek professional help. There's a lot of scattered details that truly build up to the shitpile that I've found myself in, but to be brief last May my roommate walked in my bedroom to find me sitting on the floor, sobbing. Now in the moment of her going ""Put on your shoes, wash your face, and let's get up"" I realized I may not be coping very well. 

So, I decided to go seek medical advice for why I felt the way I did. I wrote a two-page list of every symptom that could possibly be bothering me. I mean it ranged from my history of self-harm, high stress from school, lack of sleep, to my diet. I remember sitting in the chair at my GP's office and being able to hear and physically feel my heartbeat. Whenever she looked at my blood pressure, her reaction was ""huh, is your BP normally this high?"" I mumbled a no, but I desperately wanted her to acknowledge how I was an anxious mess about to unravel at the seams. 

I told her I wanted to talk about how I was dealing with stress, but I immediately started bawling. Luckily, I had two pages of notes that I could read from, otherwise, I would have sat there making awful noises trying to vacuum the boogers back into my nose. I talked about how stressful my program was and I knew I wasn't dealing well with the stress, but also I was having thoughts of self-harm resurface, I cried for hours on end every night, and generally hated my life.

Her response was that my feelings were normal for a college student, but if I wanted I should seek counseling at my school's health services. I left her office and sobbed in my car, but at least I had a little comfort in being ""normal."" The semester ended and things were bearable again. 

I've always had moments of sadness, for as long as I can remember. I've always thought I was kind of normal in that sense, just no one talked about it when they were sad, but I also have always thought something was wrong with me. Whenever this semester began to become too much, I started daydreaming about crashing my car and I had an inexplicable urge to start sleeping on my floor. Although the main difference that bothered me was that I had stopped caring. I use to stay up crying endlessly over my work, but this semester I just said fuck it and went to bed. 

When I realized I felt like I was drowning, I didn't hesitate to call health services. I was bawling whenever I was on the phone and between answering the receptionist's questions I was muting the phone to try to mask my sniffling. The only available appointment was three weeks away. I didn't have a choice except to wait.

Although, three weeks feels like three years when you're in the midst of a mental break if that's even what was happening. I researched everything. I was scouring the internet for anything that explained why I felt that way I do. 

I was truly grasping at straws with this research but I looked into anything and everything. Vitamin intake, sleeping patterns, depression, biploarism, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, diabetes, thoughts of death, urges to sleep on the floor... I ruled out some issues and raised questions of others. I started using apps to track my daily moods, water intake, sleeping pattern, and menstrual symptoms. 

Finally, it was time for my appointment, they had already prepared me saying that this was an intake appointment and would mostly be discussing my history, rather than treatment. The appointment started with one of those emotional screenings of ""rate from 1 to 5 how much this statement applies to you.""

On the screening, it asked a question if I thought about ending my own life. Now, I'm not suicidal. I have no urges to end my life. Although, sometimes I daydream about dying so it seemed appropriate to rate this a 2. Now, this set off a suidical alarm, because whenever I finally meet with the doctor we focused on creating a ""suicide prevention plan.""  

I explained multiple times that I have no desire to end my life, I have never been suicidal, and I only marked the screening because sometimes I have thoughts of passive thoughts that cross my mind of dying, like crashing my car or something. She said it was procedure and I understand why it would be necessary if I was suicidal. I let it go. I let the appointment be about my nonexistent suicide prevention plan. 

We did briefly discuss my history of self-harm (I use to burn myself in middle school) and how my dad has chronic depression. We touched on how I was in a borderline verbally abusive relationship, but once I realized the situation I left the relationship. We talked about how intensive my degree program is. I have three mandatory internships and my classes have multiple ""critical assignments"" that can cause me to automatically fail a course. We didn't talk extensively about any of this and she kept checking her watch since most of the hour we had spent crafting my prevention plan.  

I've never been diagnosed with a mental health issue and even though I'll sometimes use the words depression or anxiety to describe my emotions I'm not self-diagnosing. According to this doctor it ""sounded like"" I've been dealing with recurring depression. This wasn't an official diagnosis, but it was more comforting than being told I'm an average college student. She also mentioned that I should consider medication for managing my emotions.  

She said she would review my case and within a week I would be assigned a therapist that best fit my needs. I met with this therapist today. 

Of course, we did a follow up to my suicide prevention plan, but I made a point to mark ""1"" on the screening this time. After she asked me the wildly broad question ""why are you here?"" I broke down crying. I have no idea how to formulate an answer to that question, nor do I feel comfortable enough to spill every detail to this woman. I told ""I have no idea how to answer that question. I feel like I've been trying to cope unsuccessfully by myself for a while."" Then we started talking about my classes, my job, my plans for winter break, anything that wasn't why I was there. My time was up and she ended with reminding me that we wouldn't be able to meet again until January, but in the meantime, I should open up to my friends with ""something simple."" Which is a ridiculous notion, because how do I lead of with a simple version of ""oh and by the way, I have no fucking idea whats wrong with me but I'm pretty certain I'm in the middle of some kind of mental health crisis.""  

Although that was all hypothetical conversation because in reality I just said ""mhm"" and scheduled an appointment for January. Again, I entered a doctors office seeking help, was told to cope a little better, and left to sob uncontrollably in my car. I cried all the way home and laid in bed to cry some more. 

If anything, I felt like going to that therapy session was a step in the wrong direction. I didn't speak at all about my concerns, which I have plenty of. Instead, I let the doctor coo over my tears and say ""you need to cope better with stress."" The thing is I have so many concerns about my mental health and the only one I know how to verbalize is stress. It's easy to say school stresses me out, it's hard to admit that sometimes I feel so numb that sleeping on the floor makes me feel more like a whole person.

Anyway, that was a dumb of a lot of random thoughts that most likely aren't written coherently. I'll go to therapy again next month and see if that helps, but in the meantime, it's back to searching the internet and ""coping better."" "

7iljhp,3,2017-12-09,Do young people generally not want anything to do with their parents?,ixfd64,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/7iljhp/do_young_people_generally_not_want_anything_to_do/,"I'm a 32-year-old guy who is trying to find more social opportunities. Though my parents frequently have get-together with family friends, most of them are in their 60s and older. I don't have anything against old people, but there's a noticeable generation gap. Because I grew up in the U.S. and most of our family friends are from Taiwan, there's also a culture gap. They don't watch the same movies or TV shows, read the same books or play video games. It can be awkward when nobody else gets my jokes or references. I know there are always universal topics like food, travel and current events, but those get old fast. The reason I like to hang out with them is that my mother makes some of the best food in the world. But I digress.

So one thing I want to do is connect with more young people, starting with those in our circle of friends. However, most people my age don't seem to want anything to do with their parents. For instance:

1. I sometimes attend a family friend's film club with my parents. I'm usually the youngest one there by far. There are usually no other young people even when we watch a popular movie. Though one member does occasionally bring her daughter, I've only seen her a handful of times. Another member once brought her son, but that was only because we watched *Inside Out* and he was a Pixar animator. I've tried to get other young people to join but have had no success so far.

2. The same family friend has two daughters around my age. One of them still lives at home, but neither seem interested in our activities, even when we do ""fun"" things like field trips. I rarely see them outside their annual Thanksgiving gatherings. From what I've been told, they don't even go on vacations with their parents very often. I've asked them what they thought of their father's movie club, but both said they don't often watch movies.

3. Another family friend in the same circle has a son and a daughter, the former of whom is closer to my age. Again, neither seem interested in our activities, even after I told their mother that I'd love to meet them.

4. A third family has three adult children - two daughters and a son - who are all a few years older than me. The son still lives with his parents but is seldom home. Outside of birthday celebrations for their mother, I've seen him exactly once.

5. One of my co-workers has a daughter who was an intern before I joined. Several other co-workers were good friends with her and have asked whether she would be interested in visiting us. Her mother said she wanted to bring her daughter over too, but that her daughter wanted to meet with friends first. To the best of my knowledge, she has never visited following her internship.

6. Yet another family friend once ran a book club that my parents often attended. Though the club was fairly large, the only other young person I've seen was the extremely extroverted son of one of the members.

All of this suggests that young people don't like to hang out with older people. So my questions are:

1. Do young people typically not want anything to do with their parents?

2. As someone who likes spending time with my parents, am I the odd one out?

3. Other young people in their 20s and 30s: do you feel there is a generation gap when you interact with older folks?

4. What are some good ""universal"" topics that work well with people of any age?"

Which probably gonna work out, but I also don't want to reject my first internship option just in case I fail the assignment for the other one.

They definitely not going to wait until Friday because like I said, they are waiting for documents this Monday. Should I ask them to give me more time to think because of the other options or just take the first one and forget about other better options but not clear yet? I never did internship before and don't know if they going to like that I consider other options after they already invited me to their company?

In general, how internship is impactful for my IT career? If I do it at much better company, will it change a lot or is it just a small detail on my resume?

I've worked as a student employee for about 1.5 years at the college I transferred from. When I got to the college I transferred to, I found an on campus job doing entry level help desk, office assistant work, answering phones, resolving tickets. I left that position and am a student assistant at another university, but the position is considered temporary. 

Previous jobs include: Chipotle, Subway, Staples, 7-11, and a bus boy. I do not include these jobs on my resume, BUT they taught me a lot about customer service and being respectful.

I'm hard working and although my grades have not always been the best, I try to make up for academics in work ethic. My question to an employer would be: Is this ""experience"" annoying or over the top and makes me look like a try hard? Would you not want to interview candidates like me for being so eager to work and get IT work? The last question is: should I chill out where I am for now and concentrate on school, or should I keep pursuing even MORE? If so, what? 

I've been trying really hard over the past three years to get IT work, and I know it's hard to find a job now a days. I want to be prepared. Additionally, I know it is extremely competitive.

7iosas,3,2017-12-09,Need some advice on what to do about Multivariable Calculus,joeytman,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/7iosas/need_some_advice_on_what_to_do_about/,"What's up guys, hope all your dead weeks are going well

I'm a sophomore, declared L&amp;S CS major and Logic minor. I'm a huge fan of math, but got extremely burnt out on calculus after high school and decided to pass on taking 53, opting to go straight to 54 since it didn't seem like I'd need it. I'd heard from friends that I could self-teach all the 53 concepts I'd need for CS189, but as time went on, I started to feel like I was missing out massively by not knowing multivariable calculus. So, this semester, I enrolled in 53, and fuck, the first week was so dreadfully dull and I had plenty of other classes I was in that were worthwhile, so I dropped it. 

Now, I'm enrolled in 16 units for next semester, none of which are 53, but I'm starting to wonder if I'm making a huge mistake. I've always been a math dude, I love structured thinking and proofs, and all of these upper division math courses look *incredible*. I also know that as I go more into theory with CS, multivariable gets a bit more relevant, but more importantly, deep understanding of more challenging and abstract mathematical concepts starts to become relevant, and most of the classes I could take that could give me that have 53 as a prereq. And, most importantly, on some innate level I just feel like it's *wrong* for me to have not taken multivariable. Everyone from home knows me as a math kid, and I'd hate to go on in life and stop being able to talk to people about math because I was too lazy to spend a semester doing something I didn't want to do.

So, my question is this: what do?

 - I could drop some classes next semester, but I like my schedule a lot (CS170, CS161, ESPM50AC, PHIL143) and I don't really want to do that.

 - I could try to teach myself multivariable calculus over winter break, but I have a project I'm trying to work on that matters a lot to me, so I don't think I'll have time. Plus, I'm just a lazy fuck when nothing forces me to work, so it's not gonna happen.

 - I could take multivar at a community college over the summer, I guess, which is the option I'm leaning towards the most. However, I get the sense that that'd feel shitty in comparison, like I'm losing something by not taking advantage of the opportunity for education I'm provided by being privileged enough to be a student here.

 - I could try to find a summer job/internship in berkeley doing CS stuff so I could stay up here and take classes. That's probably the best option, but also relies on me getting an internship, and as a sophomore with a relatively weak resume, I don't think I'd land anything phenomenal yet, and I don't have the connections here in the bay area to be able to pull me up.

 - I could wait until I study abroad junior year in the spring and take it there, since I doubt I'll have great CS options wherever I go and will need classes to take. However, then I'll only have two semesters to take classes that build off that afterwards, so that doesn't seem like a great call.

 - Finally, I could just say fuck it and not learn multivariable calc. There are plenty of classes I can take within my major to fill the rest of my time at Cal, and who knows what I'm doing after school. 

Anyways, please let me know what you guys think is the right call. I'm stressing big-time about this and would really appreciate the help. Thanks!"
7ipf22,20,2017-12-09,I've been actually getting stuff done by changing my needs to wants.,SirDanilus,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7ipf22/ive_been_actually_getting_stuff_done_by_changing/,"So I want to share this thing I've been trying out after I saw it in a video. It's just an altered version of goal visualization but I've been having such success with it that it's amazing.

As the title says, it's shifting needs (inactionable desire) to wants (actionable desire) [just using arbitrary words that make sense in my head here]. And the want you should change it to is one that you are TRULY INTERESTED in. Let me give an example:

I am in college and need to study for my exams. However, the thought of failing and desire to pass just doesn't do it for me. So I shift the angle and change it into a desire to understand certain concepts that I need in the internship I'm doing. I LOVE to learn and understand concept so suddenly I'm INCREDIBLY interested in my study whereas before I would STRUGGLE! 

One of the subjects I'm doing is Statistics.. I've failed it for about 4 years now. So I shift it.. I'm not studying it to pass my exams anymore but to understand the statistical conclusion in scientific papers which I WANT to understand. 

I have wanted to get fitter for a while now but I just can't muster the strength to do it. So I shift it.. it's not about getting fit but to raise money for a charity that I volunteer in by doing a fun run marathon. I don't particularly care about my health but one of CORE BELIEFS is helping others in need (and the charity is an ADHD charity too so doubly rewarding).

Ever since I've started doing this I have actually been studying and exercising! It's not even that I am doing it better than before because before I just wasn't doing it.

And this is quite a cheat method for us with ADHD compared to others because when we like something truly, we tend to hyperfocus and obsess over it. I have spent hours after hours trying to understand how things work reading articles. I'm just readjusting that desire to things that I can use in the immediate future.

tl;dr, relate things back to your TRUE INTERESTS and you will find that doing anything becomes multiple times easier."

7iq6z6,5,2017-12-09,Former Code School Teacher: Don't Waste Your Money,supergregmeme,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7iq6z6/former_code_school_teacher_dont_waste_your_money/,"First of all, congrats just being on Reddit.  Your chance of success for learning programming just shot up twenty percentage points.  

This is mostly a story for people who don't go on sites like Reddit to learn.  Yes, I understand how difficult it can seem to navigate the maze of computers, but there is a way you can wire up the basic instruction set and understand what's going on in any computer.  

There is a lot of theory that you need a grounding in to navigate computer software.  I understand that there are ways to 4-hour-work-week your way to anything, but coding unfortunately (in my experience) is not one of them.  Don't delude yourself.  

You need to study a lot.  There are people that utilize the MIT courses that are online.  Do that, and look for programming problems to do on Free Code Camp and Exercism.io.  Understand the general coursework required for an undergraduate degree in Computer Science.  Decide exactly WHY you aren't getting an undergraduate degree.  I initially dropped out of school because I wanted to build games and accredited schools didn't cover that topic (I later finished, unrelated).  If an undergraduate degree is too much time, okay.  If you think you can learn enough programming in a 16 week course to match an undergraduate degree, you're wrong.

You should treat yourself like an undergraduate student.  There are the Hackathon Hackers groups on Facebook that are a resource.  There's multiple Slack Channels.  There's IRC.

If you happened to already have a successful career doing something else STEM-related, your chances of success improve.  If you are a technical writer or a lawyer, your chances improve.

-===-

Here are a couple of reasons that it's a poor idea to think you should be able to produce an app at the end of a code school course.  First of all, the instruction set of a computer is meticulously boring.  Every person on the planet who knows the instruction set well and can navigate it in an operating system and over a networked environment has it *in their incentive* to make you pay for that complexity.  This is how Amazon and Microsoft and all the others market their cloud services.  You're simply not going to win and you are buying into a casino-style system.  I know because I live it every day.  By the time you get past square one in building your app, you'll learn there are 100 other vendors/solutions/technologies some link online has told you you need to get where you want to go.  I see so many code school students wind up in this trap.

Second, in a code school course, someone like myself is getting paid about 20% of your tuition for 16 to 24 weeks.  It's a paygrade that is suitable for a PhD candidate to do part-time.  Then again, PhD's would rather get paid that same amount to intern at a big company since that provides them better job security at the end.  If teaching is for those who can't do, it's a fantastic way to get exposure to other ways of looking at code, and it helps re-inspire when you're facing burnout.  It's an interesting way to tell a next employer that you can handle more responsibility, even though being a teacher pays about 50% of what being a dev manager pays.  The money isn't such that any instructor wants to be your friend.  The TA's almost always are hired back after graduating themselves because they couldn't find a job and really showed dedication.  You're going to get some 1:1 attention, but you are usually paying for a class and not private tutoring.  Your instructor will box you in with other similar students to save time.

Third, and most important is that code is vast.  Code runs applications in every industry and every creative problem out there today.  The only consistency is in the nuts and bolts of how operating systems work and how networks work.  There are ways to instruct a code school class to all build the same app, but usually that's too complex when you're starting out.  Managing everyone from those who can't write a loop to those who don't yet understand how little they know is a challenge.  Teaching usually happens to the lowest common denominator.  Simply put, an instructor is not going to be there to build your portfolio for you.  Don't expect your super specific question about library X that you found Googling StackOverflow questions to get the instructor's attention unless the instructor already happened to be a user of that technology.  Your instructor is there to help guide you, but ultimately code is about reading docs yourself and testing code yourself.

-===-

Those three reasons above should be items you have a grounded awareness of before spending so much money on tuition.  Usually in the background a code school has someone vetting incoming applicants, and they have someone coordinating the community and talking to employers.  In practice, it's for-profit education and they accept everyone with two arms and fingers unless the instructor is reached out to and asked.  Even with vetting, it's surprising that applicants exaggerate confidence and the recruiting staff goes along with it, so sometimes the instructor isn't reached out to when they should be.

Tuition-wise: I don't understand where the other 80% of tuition goes to in a typical program.  Real estate costs?  State fees?  My initial impression of code schools was that they were defrauding students.  After teaching, my impression sticks.

At the end, what you're paying for is the camaraderie with your fellow class mates.  The instructor is just a background figure guiding you and making sure you don't mess up and don't waste your time.  Their job is to give you a framework to think in and to give you the questions to ask.  I've seen a couple of code school instructors that think teaching people to build apps makes sense, however, I've also seen just as many code school instructors without formal Computer Science backgrounds who say that.  I've interviewed with some of those instructors and when I ask them the hard questions, I don't sense there's any defined method for how they make it all work.  In engineering land, that's no good.

All of the above are valid expectations out of a code school, and personally having been self-taught mostly, a mentor, and then an instructor it's not worth the $10,000 or $20,000 most code schools charge.  My college credential was worth the tuition because society seems to recognize accredited credentials.  Employers do hire code school graduates more nowadays.  Just be clear with yourself if that's your real motivation for being in code school.

I still think about my students regularly.  I'll never really forgive myself for participating in that fraud.  I think I gave everybody in my class a fair shake for what I was getting paid but for their tuition I think they deserved better.  I received barely any help, so I truly don't know where the other 80% went except for classroom space and equipment costs.

I'll try to repay it by putting some resources I came up with for the class for free.  In retrospect I shouldn't have tried to create a curriculum simultaneous to the course, but you live and learn.  Students had a hard enough time with Free Code Camp and Exercism, but then again you should 1,000% be super comfortable with those before paying any money for a code school.  Ask on a resource like Reddit if you're stuck, you don't need to pay for help with Free Code Camp.. it's free.

EDIT: If you do a code school program, immersion is the only way to succeed.  Part-time will not work."

So I am required to get a job for 6 months or more before I can continue on to the 4th year.


I have been looking for and applying to jobs for over a year but no luck. First I was told that what I learned in the university was not enough and I did not simply have the knowledge required for the job.


So I decided  to go full-time learning and I spent months working 8-hours a day, just practicing programming. Taking online courses, making my own projects. After that I finally started getting more interview offers and more positive responses during the interviews. I know a lot of things now (for entry-level positions at least) and I often would correctly answer almost all or all questions I would be asked. However, I was already rejected a dream internship twice simply because they would expect me to possibly stay for a full-time junior position after the internship. However I would like to return to the university to at least finish my bachelor's degree.


Now I can't find any positions that would offer the opportunity to return to the university afterwards. I can RARELY find entry level jobs, graduate jobs, junior jobs, or internships. And if I do, they simply want someone who stays for longer.


What am I supposed to do? This has been going on for over a year. I am incredibly frustrated at this point. I can't carry on with the university, I can't get a job. How does one find a work placement without a mental breakdown along the way?"

I'm in my third year of undergrad, and I've been planning to jump to grad or law school afterwards since I was a freshman. I've also been planning to take the scenic route to graduation and take five years to finish, mostly because I entered at age 17 and didn't want to leave young. 

Prior to this semester, I had a 3.6 GPA. I've already taken the GRE, and I got 170VR/162QR/5.0AW. I've done one research-focused internship, which led to a report published by a state agency, and I plan to get more research experience in the next years. I'm a political science major and have been taking classes also in history and religious studies, one of which will become a second major and the other a minor (great deal of overlap, so I haven't chosen quite yet). I'm leaning towards applying to programs in the latter area, but I'm certain I would do well and enjoy political science too. 

All looked well, but this semester *destroyed* me. I withdrew (non-punitive at my school) from two classes, and I think (from discussions with the professors) I'll end up with one failed grade, an A, and a B. 

The long and the short of what happened is that my estranged and abusive parents decided that they did not like being estranged and spent months harassing me, even sending people to follow me. This honestly really messed me up, and I was afraid of leaving my apartment for weeks at a time. I was probably being stupid, but trauma isn't exactly rational. It only ended when I recently got a lawyer and threatened to take them to court if I weren't left alone. I don't know if these circumstances are extenuating or if admissions committees will be sympathetic, but that's why I'm asking here. 

Anyway, I think I can get back up on the horse and do well the rest of my undergrad, and I recognize that I might be wrongly worried about this. Any help or insight as to what my prospects are now that you all may be able to provide would be really appreciated, thank you! "

I'm feeling kind of lost in regards to my job search and was wondering if anyone could provide some advice for a fellow cs person.

I've been applying to jobs for 3 months and I'm having a very difficult time finding entry-level jobs that need Java in the Portland, OR area. They're all either Java with 5+ years of experience or Entry-level with C/C++, js, python, etc. I understand it's not a big techy city but I'm honestly having a hard time just finding a job posting for a Java entry level (perhaps I've already applied to those available so my perception might be a bit skewed.) I've been practicing for technical interviews for those months and although I've had a couple of interviews with hr I've never gotten to any technical interviews. The rest of the applications are mostly ignored.

I moved here last year from NYC so most of my network isn't really viable here. I honestly thought I'd be getting more calls from companies since I've had multiple internships at a big financial firm in NYC and a B.S in cs with 3.6 GPA(Not the best but not the worst). 

Perhaps I need the help of a recruiter? How does one even get in touch with one around a specific area? Should I think about applying to jobs in Seattle? Should I get into a boot-camp and get experience in those ""hotter"" or more desirable languages and hope  they help me connect to the right people for a job? Should I go back to school and get my Master's?

I feel like I'm currently so out of reach for a job in software dev and thinking I made a mistake focusing mostly developing in Java instead of picking another language back then."

So i'm getting my second bachelors in CS. However, the issue is that because I have a degree already, I was exempted from all non-CS major classes. I had a 3.3 before this semester but I had an injury and missed a lot of class time. 

I'm only gonna have 4 classes completed at the end of this semester (since I'm exempted from all gen-eds and stuff) so now my gpa is gonna drop to like a 2.2-2.4 because I'll most likely end up with a C- (1.7) in calc 2 and a Cish in my CS class

What should I do? I was planning to apply to internships this winter break and just leaving my GPA off, but will they ask for it? And when they find out its so low, won't that be bad? I can try to explain I've only taken 4 classes and 2 I just did really bad on because of a medical reason.

My previous bachelors degree (which I completed literally last year, i'm doing 2 degrees back to back, but the 2nd degree is at a different institution) was a degree in biology and I had a 3.4 gpa. Maybe I can show that to them as well if they ask?

i didn't join any clubs at my highschool, we barely had any aside from sports. I didn't take the initiative to actually start any so that is my fault.




I have no work experience what so ever, i wasted my high school summers playing runescape. i'm retarded. i should have worked at a fast food store or grocery store or something.



i have no skills other than some basic coding in python that i learned in high school and university.  the only thing i have that has impressed anyone is that i can type 160 words per minute and my gpa is 3.7 but i don't think companies will care as i have 0 skills.




what is it that i can do to maybe try and improve my resume, in the next 8 months so i can do an internship. Should i just spend my next summer working a job maybe and working on a coding side project? i'm sort of lost and worried.

I am currently studying AS level in United Arab Emirates with Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science and Maths, and i am quite confident that ill get A* for them
&gt; *GCSE with 4 A*s, 3 As 1 B 1C - A*s are maths, ict, double science ( I also studied further maths by myself without teacher but got a C)*
&gt; *im not sure should i take as further maths or a level maths now cuz i finish both syllabus but my dad wont pay for the fees except normal maths cuz i messed up lol - if further/a level maths would increase my chance maybe?*

I have been researching about community college entry requirements and they ask for only proves of language proficiency and equivalent of high school diploma, I am not sure if AS level equals to it as i only know AP = A level (if thats correct)

I would love to know if there's any chances of being accepted to any good community college in US &amp; ( I want to study CS as my major) with my current status referenced above, as I would love to live and study in US - I love californiaaaa~~ :) or i should just continue to finish A Level - but then my parents would force me to study here or go back to hong kong lol

I also represents my school and won quite a lot of national and inter-school competitions related to CS and entrepreneurship in UAE and has been worked as an intern in a UAE bank's digital proposition department and knows programming (if that hopefully increases my chances of applying as a major in computer science)

I really hope someone can help me to know if any chances to get in cuz im kinda sick of this place and doesnt want to go back to Hong Kong :)
 
**btw would i have a better chance if i do SAT or ACT** - *but i hate english so much lol*

&gt; You may wonder why I dont just study A Level and go to uni without applying to community college, cuz my parents are not gonna pay for that lol and im from hong kong so i dont think i can apply any scholarships without great competitions ( apparently i have to graduate with hk diploma to apply to most scholarships but let me know if you have any information that helps :)"

My problem isn’t as pressing as some people on here, I don’t want to kill myself, I used to be like that but becoming Christian killed that desire pretty quick. 

I don’t know why the idea of women turning into certain things turns me on, it frankly used to scare me as a kid a lot, but it does. I’m in high school right now and I’m going to look into getting an internship at my local church and I think we all know how some Christians would react to if something like that got out. 

I’ve only told one person, which is a doctor (either a psychiatrist or psychologist I get them confused, the one you talk to for advice) and frankly it hasn’t worked. I don’t really feel comfortable talking to people I know, and frankly there isn’t much point because most my friends are porn addicts too. Should I work out more to satisfy my sexual urges? 

If anyone has advice I would be very thankful. Hopefully I posted this on the right account.

I was playing with opengl and rendering programming couple years ago, when i was in high school. I really liked development of my own rendering engine, though gamedev seemed to me a bit boring. Anyway, in that time I didn’t have good enough math basics. I was living in a country that didn’t have any large gamedev companies. So I switched to web development, because it was giving me much more opportunities (say freelance jobs). Later my family moved to US. Currently I am junior in one of US universities. I am doing relatively well in my classes, my high school programming experience really helps. Living in US allows me to apply for an internship in many large gamedev companies. However, I don’t have as much knowledge in rendering as I have in web development. So I am asking your advice here: should I start learning system programming (c++, rust) and rendering or it’s better to continue improving my web development skills and leave rendering as hobby?
There are also some factors that I didn’t mention, For example web has much wider set of languages and I love learning new programming languages especially functional. Game and rendering development in particular are mostly done for windows and I don’t really like windows. linux seems to me much more interesting and comfortable platform. Besides this, rendering programming requires much more math knowledge than web. Also there is another factor, which is probably the most important for me — it’s winter already and I want to get a summer internship. Say i will go through entire opengl red book (is this still the best source of knowledge for opengl?) and Stroustrup’s “programming in c++” book in a month. Simultaneously I will need to write something interesting in gamedev field that I can show on my resume, again i’ll have at most one month, before all the internship vacancies close. Do you think it will be still possible to get game engine programming internship during spring?

So do you think it’s worth diving into gamedev considering disadvantages mentioned above?

Not sure when I'll have time, but I wanted to drop this advice for now: If you don't have a summer internship yet, apply to the Department Of Energy's [Community College Internship](https://science.energy.gov/wdts/cci/) program. The program accepts interns year-round, but the deadline to apply for summer is in one month (**January 12th**).

To apply, you'll need 2 Letters of Recommendation and a personal statement so get started. The program is paid and provides housing (or a housing stipend).

&gt; The Community College Internship (CCI) program seeks to encourage community college students to enter technical careers relevant to the DOE mission by providing technical training experiences at the DOE laboratories. Selected students participate as interns appointed at one of 15 participating DOE laboratories.

It can be pretty hard finding internships as a CC student, so the opportunity to spend your summer interning at some of the most prestigious laboratories in the world is a good one. 

Edit: If you're a student at a 4 year university but also interested, there's an equivalent program for you called [**SULI**](https://science.energy.gov/wdts/suli/), also due Jan 12th."

The company I had interviewed with Tuesday said they'd like to have me come tour the facility and check the place out. Great! I agreed to it and had a tour scheduled for this Wednesday, actually. 


Now the other company I had interviewed with Thursday was cool as well, they reached out the next day to me and even offered me a position for Spring. I was honestly shocked because I haven't had an intern or co-op yet and here I am getting next day responses. Regardless I told them that I had another company I was still considering and would get back to them about accepting the offer by the end of week. 


Now I'm a bit worried because I don't want to put them off for too long and run the chance or them retracting the offer.  They originally had told me they wanted me for Fall when I interviewed, but when calling on Friday said they'd like to take me on in the Spring. This really caught me off guard and I guess I'm just a bit paranoid about taking so long to make a decision. 


The tour of the plant on Wednesday in no way guarantees me a job either, so basically my question is; should I take the offer I already have and run with it, telling the other company I have already received and accepted an offer, or should I at least tour the facility this Wednesday and make a decision by the end of the week, if I'm offered a job?

My school has a very good reputation for CS program, and a lot of people in that program will get very decent coop experience. I am worried if i stay in Mech Eng, I won't have good coop experience.

Reasons why I would like to stay:

1. I don't necessarily dislike Mech

2. I like making physical applications like cars and washing machine

3. I can graduate on time and work as a full time developer

Reasons why I would like to transfer:

1. CS gives me systemmatic eduction coverage on CS theory and that gives me a more solid understanding of CS contents

2. CS has better job prospect

3. I like programming

I would appreciate any advise.

My current options are:

1. Stay in Mech and do a master degree in CS

2. Transfer to CS (start over) and minor in business

I recently accepted an internship at Workday on their App Dev team. I understand that this will be working with an in house language called Xpresso. Is it really a big career killer if I take this on as a junior? 

Also, since I've already had two internships in the past at startups, I thought Workday would be a great opportunity, as I always wanted to be able to live in intern housing and be a part of a large intern ""class"". 

I wanted to ask about how the internship experience is? Did you guys like it? Dislike it? Not just limited to work but also how the housing worked, the intern events, etc. 

Any insight from past interns would be great :) thanks everyone! "

With that said I don't have much of a plan for the future. What kind of career paths in oil and energy have you seen that seem satisfying (not boring, interesting projects) + fat pay ($200,000 +). I understand that's a very small percentage, contractor position and rare. I've also heard of engineers earning $300000, unfortunately I have no way of discussing anything with them. 


What kind of specialty skill sets are earning this and heat can kind of skills would one have to capitalize on? What kind of work should I be looking to do? Ideally I want to be earning this within 5-7 years of full time employment. I'm quite okay being out side of technical role, but I assume I must learn it inside and out before a managing role. 



With all that said, it is far fetched and unlikely. This is why I would like to have some discussion now as to see if it's viable. Will I burn out in the process? Is this just management? Please do share your experiences.

7j7q2z,1,2017-12-11,AirWatch question from Paranoid in Pittsburgh,BigRattle,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/7j7q2z/airwatch_question_from_paranoid_in_pittsburgh/,"

This question has been asked before on Reddit without a satisfactory answer.

What data can my admins and employer see on my personal iPhone if I’ve installed AirWatch? I use it so I can have access to my Exchange Outlook email. 

Is the answer “it depends?”

Note, I’m not doing anything illegal or immoral on my phone but I’m interested/ concerned about my personal privacy. I want to keep a wall between my personal life and corporate life. I know of course I don’t have to install AirWatch but I do it for convenience and out of a sense of responsibility/conscientiousness so I can monitor and answer corporate email when I’m on vacation and on weekends.

I have been on AirWatch forums, I have read my corporate privacy policy, I have asked my help desk. I’ve gotten only vague assurances of privacy and the need to wipe my device if needed. (They once wiped out hundreds of devices when they meant to wipe out only one fired employee’s device, resulting in many angry employees.)

There is no way to turn off location services for AirWatch, the app is not even listed under settings&gt;privacy&gt;location services.

One of my reasons for my “paranoia” is that my manager has a personal animus towards me. She makes comments about me when I’m on vacation as if I’m only person that takes time off. Everyone gets the same number of vacation days. But others abuse it by taking their vacation days and then “working from home” and being awol. She only has a problem w me and my “extravagant vacations.” I’m using FF mikes and staying in hostels, not that it matters. I have co-workers who have literally taken weeks off more than me. Anyway, I’m worried about the company knowing I’m logging on to a hostel WiFi (in another country) during my vacation days. Yes I know this a weird concern, but when  I put in for vacation days, I just tell them I need some off, and don’t mention I’ll be in say Bolivia. Self-care, goddamnit :) She’s incredibly powerful in the company and has gotten people 2 levels above her fired, using her connections to HR. She’s hooked up with interns and finance vps, ginned up expense reports, yet manages to stay above it all due to her chess skills. It’s widely acknowledged that raises depend not on performance but her personal feeling towards you. Joan Collins and Machiavelli rolled into one. I don’t care about all of that, just want to live my life.

Secondly, corporate says they can’t actually see outgoing data outside of corporate email. Is this true? Can they see the other email accounts/addresses I use on this phone? 

Here’s a quote I got from CIO magazine, “For more complicated processes, admins can remotely control the device from their own computer screen. (Pay attention to the privacy laws in effect in your own employees’ country of origin)”

That’s pretty scary. I think the answer is they can see whatever they want to see.  But I wanted to see if I could get an answer from someone who actually administers AirWatch...

Thanks for reading."

 Im only 22 years old and i just dont know what i want to do with my life. I graduated highschool in 2014 and right from high school i started college. I was majoring in Fashion Merchandising despite my dad not wanting me to go to school for that. I thought i would stick with it until the end because its all i ever wanted to do, but 2 colleges later and massive loan debt later i realize it was probably a stupid decision.

From there i went into a depression because i had no job, quit school and during the midst of all that my dog died. I did soon find a job as a cleaner and started to feel a bit better because at least i had a job. But i slowly slipped back into depression, probably because i felt like a failure and that i would never make any money because i quit school. The only thing that helped me was making youtube makeup videos.

Even though i had a job my parents and myself included were disappointed i had quit school. So reluctantly i applied to a school and randomly picked a major. I chose paralegal studies. I went to class the first semester and loved it! I thought i had finally found what i was supposed to do in life. However the next semester my grades started to slip and i found myself loosing interest in the subject. My mind kept going back to Youtube and makeup. At one point i had made the decision that i was going to quit school again because i just wasnt happy. I was going to school 6 hours a day then working the rest of the day. My grades were horrible and i wasnt doing what i truly wanted to be doing. Also i was slipping back into depression and having anxiety. But when i told my mom she got mad and dissapointed that i wanted to quit school to become an esthetican and make youtube videos.I also told her i was depressed but she just doesnt get it. She managed to talk me into trying school out for one more semester (this semester). 

I went back to school with a better attitude, i really tried, i even managed to get an internship. I really didnt want to take the internship because i would have School, then the internship, and then my job, i would be coming home late and would have no time for anything else, but i took the internship because i was pressured by my parents. Well a week later they wanted to hire me. I was so happy and i started to enjoy the job and school a little more. But my depression came back and i started messing up in school again, partly because i really just dont want to be there. I really want to quit school but i dont think my job will keep me. Ive told my boss i havent been doing great in school and im failing but she just doesnt get it. I told her i was thinking of quiting due to the pressures i face at home (both parents are disabled and i help take care of them) and that i could come work full time but she tells me no dont quit your so close to finishing. She doesnt get that i might have to be there a whole extra semester and im not happy( i dont want to tell her about my depression and anxiety, i feel like she would think im crazy). But i have tried to tell her im not doing great and i have metioned the idea of just working full time but she hears what she wants to hear. I know they want to keep me ive become part of the family there but i just cant force myself to do something(school) if its making me miserable. Also the job ive loved so much im now starting to resent because i cannot be honest with them about school. Its gotten to the point where ive stopped going to class but they think im still going. Its getting close to the time where i would sign up for next semester but i dont want to. I just want to work full time but im really not sure what would happen if i told her that . I dont want to lose my job , i quit my last job for them and any other job i get my pay would decrease rapidly and i dont know how i could go back to low pay. Also because my true passion is making youtube videos i feel like eventually ill get tired of this job too.

 Sometimes i feel like the only reason im in school or in this field is because when others ask what i do for a living im no longer embarrassed to tell them and because the money is good. But is all of this worth being sad and depressed over, or am i being a baby and need to suck it up and just live my life depressed like everyone else working a boring 9-5. I feel like ive been sucked into the pressures of society and i dont know how to get out and live for myself any more. Any advice, kind words, or thoughts? Sorry if this is a bit long but i had to let this out some where, its been laying heavy on my mind for a while now.

Sincerely a lost woman."

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLAqTJtmfC4

It's more than just the high pay that's the perk. Your managers don't treat you like a stupid drone that needs to be monitored every step of the way. This simply doesn't happen in other professions that are lower paying, like firms that have that coffee intern that works for free just for the 'experience'. The power dynamic is different in those professions. It's sort of scary to think how bosses can get away with treating you like shit if there happens to be much more of us (supply) or if there happens to be less demand in our industry. For now though, the scales are tipped to our favor but it's a good thing to not take this for granted."

This is about 5 years ago. This depression caused me to be unable to go out of the house for most of the time and let to a crippling dept. Before this I had always been working (started age 12), worked as consultant, sales agent at a young age with big clients.

After about 1 year of the worst of the depression I started landing some sales jobs, but was unsuccessful keeping those. The depression made it clear to me that especially sales jobs, cause me to take a lot of the stress of work back home. So I decided to not take sales jobs any more.

3 years after the start of the depression I landed a job at Subway, no more sales, no more stress. Quickly worked my way up to manager of that store, but was looking for more.

Than I got an offer to work at a start up, as an intern, but it would be great to put on my resume. In the beginning it was more meant to be a marketing intern, but quickly realised that what was needed in the company was a sales guy, so I filled that position. While still working at Subway. Eventually I quit Subway and the start up was able to offer me a salary which was in no way enough to pay back loans, or even do fun stuff, but it was great for my resume.

Now I have been working here for 9 months but unfortunately due to changes in the company, it will be selling through partners so my positions isn't needed any more, I will be let go on the first of January.

I have been thinking of learning java to actually have a skill which is needed, since there is a lot of demand for developers in my country. 

But in the meantime I need to make money. I need some advice on how to get started learning java, but also if there are some ways to start making money with java, even with limited knowledge. 

I have checked for programs which will teach you java which linking you to a company where you can work after 3 months of training. But unfortunately this program has stopped.

In the upcoming January semester, I will be taking courses required for the degree, but they are not very core courses (statistics, math, etc...) to programming.


That being said, I wanted to ask what I should really be focusing on to secure an internship for the summer.


My background:

 - I have completed a first year programming course in C.

 - I have completed two intro CS courses in python on Edx (MITx 6.00.1x, 6.00.2x)

 - I am currently working on a data structures and algorithms using lecture slides available through school course webpage.

 - I have had a mechanical engineering internship


With this all said, I am wondering what I should focus on next semester in order to try to secure an internship for the summer. (What kind of projects, languages, course material)
I would ideally like to start applying around February or March, which is pretty late but I don't know if I can have an okay resume before then.
I would appreciate any advice!

Thank you.

Made a new account for this post and future related posts. Looking for some advice. 

I graduated college almost 5 years ago with a B.B.A. in Marketing after changing my major from Recording Industry. I considered switching to Accounting but it wasn’t for me. I took a Computer Science class and at the time I just remember it was painful learning C+, the language that was taught in the course. I do feel that my time at school was wasted at my own fault for choosing a generic major and not pursuing an internship. After college I ended up in retail which is where I have been for the past 5 years. Its not as horrible as everyone makes it out to be but obviously no one wants to do this forever. Realistically after 5 years if there is nothing I have a passion for, I need to find something that I can at least tolerate.

While I was in school I did somewhat enjoy the Statistics class I took although I will admit the professor did not make it difficult for us. Whether that is a good or bad thing I do not know. Either way, I’ve started to look into becoming a Data Analyst. 

In the past year I’ve learned basic SQL through reading the “OCA: Oracle Database 12c Administrator Certified Associate Study Guide“ by Wiley, brushed up on statistics through “Statistics“ by Freedman, and have been learning Python through the “Think Python” tutorial I found on r/python. I can honestly say that learning Python on my own has been more beneficial and enjoyable than learning C+ in a class environment. The hard part is making the time for it. 

My big underlying question; what should I do to go on a path to becoming a Data Analyst?. I think employers will gloss over me if I just say I read some books. I’m interested in an entry level Analyst role and not a Data Scientist role to be clear. 

Should I pursue a second Bachelors degree in Statistics/Applied Mathematics or a Masters in Statistics? Is going into a Statistics Master’s program possible with my background? Should I even bother with another degree? I’ve looked into an Information Systems Master’s program but I’m assuming Statistics would set me up better in the long run for a Data Analyst position. Are certifications a better route?

I’m ready to get out of retail/sales but I am just not sure what the best route for someone in my position to take for what I am looking to do. I don’t know if it is the right path but at least it is a path. I have read a lot of threads on here asking similar questions but I am curious what you all will say with my particular background.

Thanks for any help. "

I am an international student in the Computer Science department and just got an opportunity for an internship. Since I am an international student, I need the CPT authorization but my university is giving me so much trouble to send the application. They first said I needed to take an internship class, which I can't take because it asks for a specific GPA and a pre requisite course. Those two things I don't have. Our career center offers an internship course for departments that don't have internship classes, but they have declined my application for that class since my department already has a class for it. I explained the situation and they told me that if I can't do it through my department, then tough luck. Am I really going to lose an opportunity I busted my ass for? What are my options?

The good news is that due to my previous undergrad experience I dont need to be a full time student to graduate from this semester on out. So i can take 2-3 classes a semester and graduate in two years.

My course load next semester wont be so intense as it was this semester. I did some cool projects this semester (an AI, android app, a JavaFX app, some C projects too), but everyone here will have similar projects since they're all from classes.

7jcxmv,0,2017-12-12,Is my goal of becoming an infectious disease epidemiologist be unrealistic?,Bowmanette35,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/7jcxmv/is_my_goal_of_becoming_an_infectious_disease/,"Before I go in to detail about my worries, I thought a little history might be helpful:


Summary of my academic history:
* B.S. in Biological Sciences- Left university 2 classes short of graduation. Applied for A.A. the semester before I left. Left after Spring 2011
* Paralegal Certification: Quit with 1 semester left.
* Considered Nursing and Physical Therapy Assistant Programs

Current:
* A.S. Degree in Biotechnology: Spring 2018 will be my last semester and then I graduate.


I was an idiot for leaving without finishing my degree and my rationale for it was even more idiotic. I decided to take the A.S. program so that I could brush up on my skills and regain some confidence. I also wanted to actually finish something, and wanted to show myself and any potential school that I was/am committed and capable of achieving good grades, and being a responsible student.

I have recently reached out to my original university to inquire about the necessary steps to complete the degree and if I am granted my request, I will be able to take the remaining courses at a university closer to home. 

Assuming I get my B.S., what are my chances of even getting accepted into a master's program? I have a wonderful professor/advisor who has reignited my passion for this and continues to encourage me. I am currently working on an independent research project involving antibiotics. Before graduation, I will have presented my research at 2 different conferences. I also have an internship next semester. I don't know how much weight those carry with graduate programs though.

I would hope a prospective employer would care more about my performance in grad school than undergrad, but is it unrealistic to think I will even accepted into a decent graduate program? I would love to some day work for the CDC, or some other agency fighting viral outbreaks globally but I don't want to be unrealistic in my goals either.

**tl;dr: I made some stupid decisions in the past, how much will that hinder me in the future?**

I'm in love with research and have undergraduate research experience. My current plan is to go for a PhD, but the tax reform may change that plan. I'm willing to be broke while getting a PhD, but I'm not willing to go into another 50k+ debt of loans to get it.

I'm currently a junior. What should I be doing to maximize my chances of a decent job out of school if the PhD becomes non-option for me? I know about the general textbooks like Cracking the Coding Interview and whatnot.

I'm supposed to be happy. This is where it  begins to pay off. All those years getting paid dick as an intern, taking classes to get my part of a degree, suffering through public speaking extracurricular activities to which I owe my ability to fake a winning personality.

I don't care though. It's just more work. I'd much rather just die, so I didn't have to deal with any of it. Life sucks and surviving is difficult. I don't want to do it anymore. I haven't had a real friend in the past 4 years. I've never been anything besides single. I'm just an awkward, insecure piece of shit once you get past the happy face I wear in public, so none of that is suprising.

I'm done swallowing pills that make me numb at best. I'm done listening to therapists tell me about coping. I'm tired of fucking coping with everything! For once I wish I could just be happy.

Hoping for a little advice here. 

A bit about myself:

* I'm 23
* Have just been fired from my graduate job at a start-up
* Worked there from July 2016 (intern for ~2 months, part time 4 months and full time 8 months with some time off)
* Worked as a 'Digital Marketing Manager' 
* Was the only person in marketing, surrounded by engineers. 
* Responsible from everything from SEO to email marketing, social media, web design (with the help of dev team), video production and event coordination. Basically wearing many hats and not being good at any of them.
* Was fired for performance issues (poor attention to detail, poor time to execution, lack of ability to self-manage) as well as making a couple of mistakes that got under the skin of the boss. 
* Graduated with a degree in commerce (major marketing)

I come to reddit because I would like some input in addition to seeing the pro's about this stuff. 

I think I have fallen victim to the sunk-cost fallacy. Started an economics degree, moved to marketing because I didn't want to lose the 1.5 year progress into the degree I had already made. I was able to explain away to myself why I chose what I chose, but already knew (whilst studying) that I didn't enjoy a lot of it. 

I enjoyed making videos and wireframing websites but detested many of my other roles **especially** 'social media management'. 

I know that Marketings purpose is to get customers down the sales funnel. Sales makes me uncomfortable and I **know** I don't want to work in sales. 

I have considered career paths in totally different areas. Recently was looking at studying speech pathology or something in the health sciences. 

I have **two questions**

**1**. Does anyone have a shared experience of dealing with the 'what to do next' after being fired? 

*AND*

**2**. How do you consolidate the question of 'Do I dislike my job because of the environment' or 'because I hate the tasks involved'. BONUS points if in similar field!

Clearly I have to weigh up the opportunity cost here and decide for myself but any advice is appreciated. 

Thanks!

**TL;DR** - Got fired, can't tell if I hate my job or the environment I was in

7jke01,176,2017-12-13,Organizational Antipattern #323: The Labor Saving Intern,Newbosterone,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7jke01/organizational_antipattern_323_the_labor_saving/,"An antipattern is a commonly occurring solution to a problem that generates decidedly negative consequences. In an organization, an antipattern can be the result of a manager or developer not knowing any better, but it often results from someone ""solving"" a problem in a way that works for their concern, but is suboptimal (!) to the organization as a whole.

Today's Antipattern:  The Labor Saving Intern

Our company has a pretty good ~~bureaucracy~~ culture for talent development.  Part of that is providing lots of (paid) opportunities to review a candidate before hiring.  It's rare to get an IT job without a contracting stint of at least a few months.  In addition, we hire quite a few recent IT grads and  rotate them through several areas to give them exposure to various jobs before they commit to a permanent position.  Since their salary is paid by another organization, they're ""free""!   

Managers ""bid"" for these interns.  They come up with small set of tasks that cover 30 - 90 days, and interns read the descriptions and rank their preferences.  It's a great introduction to the real world, since the Manager's sales pitch is usually ""We do X. You'll be exposed to sexy technologies A, B, and C.  You'll work with happy smiling people and have lots of fun!""  and omit ""while filling in spreadsheets and gathering pointless data 40 hours a week"".

Sorry for the long intro.  Here's the Amusing Anecdote:

A fresh round of interns has started.  After a week or two of on-the-job training (here's the restroom, here's the trouble ticket system, here's the timecard system), they were unleashed.  Immediately, there's a flood of confused, incomplete trouble tickets.

One intern was asked to review the CMDB (configuration management database).  I've seen 4 tickets today for missing data - ""what application runs on host XYZ?"" ""Please list cpu, memory, disk for these 12 hosts"".  I IM the requestor - ""Can't you get this info?""  ""Oh, no, we're not allowed to login to the boxes.  Besides, those are Linux, I don't know that"".

Next ticket - ""We need to run a DR test on application Y123.  Can we do this tomorrow after lunch?""  Um, No.  Y123 is in production, and generates about $1MM worth of revenue *a day*.  The maintenance window is 2 - 8 AM third Sunday of the month, except we're in a change freeze until February.  And a DR test requires business approval, and support engineers from networking, clustering, storage, OS, database, and application support - for 2 or three applications.

TL;DR - Managers use labor-saving interns to create more work for other departments.

7jl50g,5,2017-12-13,"My dad took a 20k loan to help my younger brother with college, and I think my brother needs to be cutoff in order to grow up. Advice?",EasternOrchardist,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7jl50g/my_dad_took_a_20k_loan_to_help_my_younger_brother/,"So my brother is now 23 and he is still in college trying to obtain his undergrad degree. He started out as Chemical Engineering, but now he is saying he just wants a BA in Chemistry.

My parents are immigrants and have worked extremely hard. They never deny my siblings and I anything, but in return, comes responsibility, respect and promise that we will do our best make good decisions in life. My dad went through chemo 3 years ago, and he is doing a lot better in comparison, but he has aged a lot. My dad makes about 90k a year, he lives in a small ass house in the middle of no where Texas, where his monthly house payment is $300. For the past 4-5 year my dad has been helping us 4 kids get through college. (He hasn't paid full tuition, but he helps when we need it). For example, I moved to San Francisco for a job, and he helped with a deposit. So my dad does his best to help in important matters and I am so grateful for that.

So the deal with my younger brother: He is extremely intelligent, good looking, but he lacks confidence and seems like he isn't self-motivated, disciplined or hard working. My parents have been really proud that he is pursuing a Chemical Engineering degree, because they want him to get  ahead start and live comfortably and independently post graduation. Being able to start at 60-80k, rather than starting at 30-50 k with a liberal arts degree. My brother is smart, and he has the passion for environmental policy issues, but the issue is that he isn't freaking doing anything. Like absolutely nothing.

Let me tell you a little bit more about what I mean. So in the last year, he start the Spring '2017 semester dropping out of a great college, and going to a community college. I supported him and we kept this secret from my dad because we didn't want him to be upset about it. I thought that this might be good for my brother to take some easier general classes, and think a little bit more about what he wanted to do. I honestly don't know what he was doing, but from what I could see he was wayyyy more focused on dating girls, trying to find ""the one"". He was also smoking A LOT OF POT and going out ALOT. 

After one semester, he transfers back to his college, but decides that he is no longer going to be an engineering student.

He doesn't have a job, he isn't doing an internship anywhere, and he wasn't studying and pursuing a degree that will make his like 1- times easier. 

He has a really negative and cynical view that all engineers are one way, and that you are stuck being like them. His perception of the world is extremely cynical and he doesn't take control of his life. It is so frustrating because  in my opinion, how I view life/work is that I see it as that I have everything in front of me, I just find the opportunities that excite me and make moves towards them. You can do anything you want in life. Absolutely anything. 

So basically this is what the issue is: My dad took out a 20k loan to last my brother 2 years of college (pay rent, tuition, etc). My dad did this thinking that my brother is pursuing an Engineering degree, so my dad wanted to help relieve some stress. My brother instead, was at community college, he was buy a lot of weed each week, he was taking girls out on dates (really shitty girls), he was going out to parties and bars. When he went back to his regular University, he dropped engineering and decided to pursue a liberal arts degree. He talks shit about my dad, says my dad doesn't help any of us kids like other parents do. He isn't respectful or caring or understanding that my dad went through serious health issues and now he working so hard to help my brother. 

Today, my dad texted me saying he wants to transfer more money to my brother, and this was a wake up call for me. Like what? Didn't you already give him 20k? It shouldn't be gone by now at all. He hasn't even had the money for 9 months. MOST KIDS DO NOT HAVE PARENTS THAT DO THIS SHIT FOR THEIR 23 YEAR OLD KIDS. 

He is is a privileged  kid, acting like he has hard problems, and not working hard. Yes, I know he has a good heart inside, but I feel like my parents need to cut him off financially for him to grow up. 

What do you think is a good solution?

* Age: 19

* Education: Will be graduating in 2021 with a degree in Mathematics

* Job history: Teaching experience in Mathematics (1 year), law internship (1 month)

* Language skills: English (fluent), Mandarin (conversationally fluent), French (aiming to take the A1 test ASAP)

* Criminal convictions: None

* Willing to consider alternatives: In the EU, yes.

* Permanent. I'm looking to eventually gain citizenship and settle down. I am not looking to return to Singapore at all.

I'm finishing up my first year at university, and I'm currently looking into transferring to France or the US to continue my Bachelors degree. No matter where I go, I will be graduating in 2021.

If I decided to transfer to France, assuming I get in, I'll graduate with a double degree in Maths and Computer Science. I fully intend to study French to some degree of fluency. 

If I transfer to the US, I'll graduate either with a degree in Statistics, Business Analytics, or a double degree in Maths and Computer Science. (I currently have a guaranteed spot to study Finance in a decently ranked school, but will be applying elsewhere as well)

My fail safe is to remain in Singapore and graduate with a degree in Mathematics, with a concentration in Business Analytics or Statistics. I have a job offer to continue teaching Maths when I graduate.

Ultimately, I don't want to remain here. I've been trying to get out since 2015, but due to family reasons, I'm still here. Singapore is a great country, but I'm not happy here. I don't enjoy the high-stress work environment, and the weather makes me miserable. 

I'm looking for advice on how to best go about getting citizenship in the UK/EU/US, with UK being my primary preference. Opinions on transferring/not transferring are welcome as well.

Thanks in advance for your help."

They are, as follows:

***Minerva, MIT, Brown, Claremont McKenna, Harvey Mudd, UC Berkeley, USC, Vanderbilt, Northeastern, UNC CH, Georgia Tech, UT Austin, UT Dallas, Penn State***

**Demographics:**

White male; Russian immigrant/first generation American student; Dallas, TX; $100k income bracket.

**Major:**

Finance or economics, with interest in some sort of computer science/engineering program.

**Academics:**

GPA UW 3.6, GPA W 4.2, ACT 35 (36E, 36M, 33R, 35S, 10Essay), SAT 1510 (730RW, 780M). 800 on the SAT ML2 exam, 720 on the SAT USH exam. National AP Scholar with nine APs taken so far. My school does not rank.

**Senior Year Courses:**

AP English Lit, Solid State Electronics Dual Credit, Ind. Study Thesis Class, AP Calculus BC, AP U.S. Government, AP Macroeconomics, AP Chemistry, AP Physics E&amp;M, Ind. Study Computer Science.

**EC’s:**

* Run my own donation-based [walking tour agency in Dallas.](https://dalwalk.com) I am the sole person involved with it and thus have created everything for it, from flyers/videos/other promotional material to an active blog.

* Founder/president of the first entrepreneurship club at my school.

* Co-president/competition lead of school's Junior World Affairs Council - sort of a social studies program that culminates in a national trivia competition.

* Presentation lead at school's robotics team. As the team advanced to state competitions, I would create websites and PowerPoints and coach a dedicated group of presenters. The judges, even at state, would often describe the sites as some of the best they had ever seen.

* Dedicated musician with an [acoustic solo project](http://nazaruk.bandcamp.com) and a [garage rock band.](http://instagram.com/theboojisband) I play guitar, bass, and piano, and I sing/write most of the lyrics for the band as well. I have become acquainted with several musicians, promoters, and producers in the Dallas scene, and my band is set to record and release a full-length LP next year.

* Summer internship with Ambit Energy. I applied to a rigorous internship program offered by the City of Dallas and had to go through several interviews and offers before eventually picking an IT position there. I self-taught myself SQL, a language I had no prior experience in, in a week and even earned a novice certification in it. From June to August this year, I used it to help an experienced DBA team migrate data to updated servers.

* Work at my parents' small lighting/retailing business. My work is unpaid, but I have gained enough experience from performing financial tasks for my mother (who was once an auditor at Ernst &amp; Young) to develop a relatively solid base in finance and microeconomics.

* Editor and regular contributor at school's newspaper.

* Regular volunteer at various cultural initiatives/establishments in my city, from art museums to independent K-12 teaching programs. I'm also active with the entrepreneurial culture of Dallas, having participated in several business meetups and ""hackathons"" in the city.

* Quite active with sports: been into boxing and muay thai since the age of 9, as well as dirt-biking since 8 or so. I also took up weightlifting just recently and hope to pursue it in college in addition to tennis.

**Essays:**

* Common App: 9/10. I wrote this essay about a relative who was poisoned by the Russian Mafia after attempting to start a fair banking system in Armenia, yet somehow survived with substantial damage to his condition. I talked about how realizing his condition made me understand that justice does not come as a definite equal but rather varies by individual. In retrospect, it's a very well written, intelligent essay, but I could have made it flow just a tad more.

* Supplement 1: 10/10. My personal favorite, this one had a powerful hook and a snarky yet clever discussion of the ""contradictions"" that make up my life. I submitted it to several of my top choices.

* Supplement 2: 8/10. Just a recount of the funny story of how my band came to be. I submitted this one as part of several ""activity""-related prompts.

**Recommendations:**

* 10/10 English teacher

* 8-9/10 Pre-AP/AP computer science teacher

* 10/10 Boss at summer internship

* 8-9/10 Counselor

**Extra info:**

I am particularly looking at schools in the Northeast and in the West Coast, for I feel that those two regions are the best for entrepreneurship and development in the country. I've moved around my whole life, so I wouldn't be too comfortable staying in Texas; even after college and grad school, I'd like to move somewhere totally different for a fresh start. A lot of people recommend Stanford, but I personally don't see a chance there after a Harvard deferral.

Essentially, I'm looking for the university that would give me the freedom to experiment with a wealth of resources (ideally in the form of a powerful liberal arts education) and thus develop the ""world entrepreneur"" in me."

So I'm a senior CS major graduating next year in September from a decent private university in a medium CoL city on the east coast. The reason I graduate in September is because my last quarter is part time with one 3 credit course so I decided to do a 6 month co-op (April to September) before graduating (I'm an international student so this way I stay 3 months longer but it allows me to use up all my CPT working days). 
Anyways, I got a few interviews for 6 month internships, however,  I've recently started wondering if I should do 2 3 month internships again because my last 3 months I would be free to travel anywhere in the country and can hopefully get my foot in the door in cities like NYC and SF through an internship. 

So here are my questions:

1) Should I stick to the 6 month internships in my city and keep trying to find a job outside?

2) Should I continue looking for 2 3 month internships? If yes, how do I find spring internships because they are rare to come across online (I haven't found any)? Also, am I too late to apply for these internships?"

Network+ I'm planning before January ends, and I'm still torn if I should do Security 501 or 401. I might or might not do CASP CompTIA in favor of CISSP (I have a book) and then CEH.

But CPT+ coming early next year (~Feb-April 2018) looks fun. Might try that.

See you at the top of the mountain, I'm in this to try to get a good Cybersecurity job out of Uni when I graduate summer 2019.

If you're hiring interns with Japanese University  (and California, US education history for Secondary and Primary, and US citizenship) background in Summer 2018 around Tokyo (anytime after mid-may I can start work, with considerations to my school courses) or Silicon Valley (probs around my summer break in August?), please hit me up so I can get a job easier when I graduate.

I knew it had to do with JVMs but I couldn't explain it in detail. Needless to say it didnt pan out. Well now I need to shotgun my resume, I am Canadian and open to working anywhere in Canada.

It piqued my interest and often lead me to conversations with the techs about how they got there.

I believe my computer knowledge is above average. I built my own computers as a teenager, always fix my own problems and often that of friends and family, and stay pretty current in general. In high school, I studied in a Cisco pilot program to earn a CCNA. It wasn't as well supported as we were told, so I never got to intern or take the exam, but I did learn a lot about networking. I planned runs and made my own cable for a mock network, programmed the router, and most importantly enjoyed it a lot. I was not as mature then as I am now, so I took an easier career path that has hit a dead end.

I'm currently in my seconds quarter of sophomore year and I've reached a dilemma.  
  I'm majoring in Finance and minoring in CS

The only thing I like about Finance is stocks and that one day I would like to run a business, however, I like programming a lot too. I enjoy machine learning and other AI stuff but I understand it's very hard to get a job within those field without a PhD and probably not with a CS minor.  Switching majors would probably force me to stay an extra year which I won't be able to afford.  
  
This leads me to my job problem. I don't want to get a Finance only internship because It's not what I want to do. I can't get any machine learning internships because I'm not a CS major. And Finance/ML jobs(like Quant) usually require a minimum Junior with 3.5 GPA which I currently don't have(but I believe I can get to it). 
  
I feel like it's hard for me to convince someone that I have studied machine learning for a while and have learned a lot because they just look at academics. I'm considering doing some Kaggle stuff.   
  
What do you guys think I should do?"

All of it!,Conspicuous_Urn,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7jvdjv/the_internet_is_gone_all_of_it/,"Years ago, I was working as a student intern at the fourth-best public  university in that particular state, working at the hell desk of our internal IT department. Sometimes we were stuck in the ""call center"", answering phone calls from prospective students, nosy parents, arrogant professors, and...professors emeriti. Free use of the Help Desk was granted to any emeritus who wanted to contact us with their modern marvels of technical impossibilities.


Today's lucky caller was an elderly woman, I would guess in her mid 80's. After confirming her university ID we got right down to the grim reality of her present condition.

&amp;nbsp;


Define variables:

EP=""Emerita Professor""

Me=""Me""

&amp;nbsp;


$EP: ""The internet is gone!""

$Me: ""What do you mean by 'gone'? Are you unable to connect to the internet in your home? Is this on your computer or on a device like an iPad or phone?""

$EP: ""I'm calling you on my phone! The internet is GONE from my computer! All of it! I try to go there, and it's not there!""

$Me: ""So just to confirm, you're opening up a web browser and the page is blank?""

$EP: ""GONE!""

We did some quick troubleshooting - I figured out she was on Windows, probably XP, and the internet seemed ok -- I guided her to the WiFi icon and she described a normal situation there. As we're doing this I find an old ticket from her and see that she had called us many times before, and some of those calls required remote assistance. She must have the [totally licensed] software that we used for assistance installed. I managed to (I'm not sure how) get her to launch that and tell me the right code, etc.

I get access to her system, and I'm greeted by a cleaner desktop than I'm expecting. Sure, there are an unnecessary number of icons and pictures on the desktop, but it's really not *that* bad. 
 

$Me: ""Ok, so just go ahead and go to the internet like normal.""

$EP: ""You see, I click this icon.."" [clicks on Mozilla Firefox] ""...and the internet is gone. All of it.""

Mozilla loads up Google. 

$Me: ""...""

$EP: ""See? It's all gone.""

$Me: ""What would you normally do here?""

$EP: ""Go to the internet...but it's not here."" Her cursor moves up to the top of the bar where bookmarks would normally be.

$Me: ""Has anything changed with your computer recently?""

$EP: ""Yes, my nephew put the new internet on here. But as I said, it doesn't work!""

Gears start turning. New internet means new web browser, most likely.

$Me: ""Did you used to have bookmar--links up there that you would click?""

$EP: ""YES! The internet!""

$Me: ""What did they say?""

$EP: ""The internet one was called 'Yahoo'.""
 

&amp;nbsp;


I created her bookmark, right then and there. She proceeded to type in the name of the university, click the fifth link that Yahoo brought up, and follow various breadcrumb links until she got to the email login.
 
I could not, no matter how I tried, convince her that she could type into the address bar and go places. She was (and as far as I know, still is) convinced that the only way the internet worked was through that one bookmark. I even tried to add a bookmark for her university email, but she *did not trust it*. Yahoo for life."

But that's the position I'm finding myself in. It's big team (20+ devs) with a lot of projects (12+) and an absolutely incredible amount of technical debt. Our processes (think branching, release, review, etc.) are either poorly defined or nonexistent. 

When I said to my manager in our 1-on-1 recently that the team lacked technical leadership and that most of our problems were stemming from that he said, ""Why not you?""

I said, ""Because I'm not qualified.""  He said, ""That sounds like an opportunity to grow.""

Should I accept? And if so, what is the best way I can really prepare and focus on improving to fulfill the role as best I can?

&amp;nbsp;

Incomplete degree - 2.5 years of a CS degree completed, mostly with Java. Got hired on full-time after an internship and haven't gone back to school since.

&amp;nbsp;

2 years of software engineering experience - almost entirely working with legacy code in an ancient procedural language, along tiny bit of .NET experience just before I left this position.

&amp;nbsp;

1 year of QA experience - paying the bills after moving across the country to Oregon. No coding. 

&amp;nbsp;

Misc - Looking into designing an iOS application independently, have been working on a simple game in Unity using C#. Outside of coding, I'm sort of a jack of all trades with writing, art, music, athletics, which can help me fit in well at a lot of companies.

&amp;nbsp;

So, I have some of the raw skills, but I think I'll likely need to do a lot of refining. What would any of you recommend that I study specifically, and what tools have helped you prepare for interviews for competitive positions? What type of personal project would stand out? Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated! Hoping the answer isn't as simple as, ""finish your degree""."

For the first decade of my life, I lived in ignorance and bliss. My mom kept me in a bubble, my original school had me take one test a year, but come middle school I had to switch states and I was thrown into a preparatory school where one of the first questions I was asked was how many continents I've been to. In my new 6th grade we had an assessment every day. If you weren't funny, social hierarchy was dictated by your grades. Of course I was made fun of. First I was ""democrat"" then I was ""too nice"" then I was ""naive"" then I was ""weird/creep/homo"". By 8th grade I reached a low, so after those two years I decided to be myself. I was the class clown, probably the most talked about individual throughout the year. In 9th grade my class moved to the high school campus and the attention was now meaningless, but I connected with my physics teacher. I was always a curious individual but it was him that gave me the only thing that's ever interested me. Stupidly enough I wasn't interested in my career, I was interested in astronomy, so I didn't study. Sophomore year, I felt happy for the first time since I moved. I built an astronomy group with my freshman teacher, spending my free time educating myself on the universe. I felt enlightened.

I got glasses over that summer.

I was chasing the happiness I felt before I moved schools, so I took an astronomy course at Northwestern, right outside my hometown of Chicago. It was Chicago that felt foreign to me. The towering skyscrapers were oppressive, but at Northwestern I felt at home. At Northwestern, I found out that you could make a career out of my passion. I found myself. Regardless of where I went, I knew what I wanted to do in life. I planned on trying in school upon return.

Junior year came and I asked my counsellor if I could get into NU. She said I'd be mathematically impossible to get my GPA up to the average that they accepted from my school. I didn't even know how GPA was calculated, but I was a stubborn fucker. It's funny, people didn't take me seriously until I wore the glasses. I filled my classes with APs instead of honors. I was at the top of my classes with my fellow overachievers. Girls approached me. I had intimate connections with 5 of my teachers. Instead of a joke, I was a genius. Others didn't know why I was stressing about getting accepted with ""how smart I was""... If only I was judged for one year of my life instead of three.

Then she sat next to me in history class, lighting up the room around her with her smile in a two meter radius. I didn't think anyone that happy could be smart. Plus, she was a senior, I'm a junior, what are the chances that she's applying near Chicago?

She dropped a pen and I rushed to pick it up and give it to her. Didn't even think twice. I realized I was in love, but it was the worst mistake of my life. Like most feelings, I kept it to myself. It was too pathetic to share. I wanted to say hi to her every day but I didn't even want to be friends. I wanted to talk about my interest of astronomy with her but I rationalized she was the type to watch Netflix, go on social media, and do nothing else with her life. I rationalized that the conversation would be one-sided. I was wrong, though. She talked more in history class than I did, so she wasn't stupid. But, everyone has flaws. Plus, probably not applying to areas near me.

She started sitting near me during our shared free period.

In Psychology class we talked about Maslow's Hierarchy. I argued that you didn't need to be loved to achieve self-actualization. Really it was displacement.

On my birthday, she was wearing a UChicago sweater, and I forgot it was my birthday. I mentioned the city and she instantly told me to apply, but I cut the conversation short after briefly mentioning NU. It was February, I rationalized. She's graduating soon, I rationalized, so I should be responsible. Relationships are stupid anyway.

Then she hosted a TedTalk. She revealed that she joined her ballet group many years late and was verbally attacked by her peers for not making the decision to drop out of high school. That she was selfish. That she was indecisive. Her schedule was get out of school 3 PM and get home at 10:30 PM. Other ballet dancers went from 7 AM to 10:30 PM, but this girl still surpassed them all.

I liked her even more. I got her a personalized gift 3 days before her graduation, including a letter of appreciation. The gift was for me. I wanted the closure and then never talk again, but she started talking to me, pressing conversations against my face. Since then, a day hasn't gone by that I haven't thought about her. I doubt she liked me as much as I liked her, but at the minimum she liked that I liked her. We philosophized. ""Everything happens for a reason"" that was her philosophy. The next day she gives me a letter and a gift. I moved her to tears, she said. Those last 3 days were amazing and I regretted every day I didn't talk to her, but I wanted it to end. I wasn't a confident applicant. But she pressed on, she wanted to hear my piano. She invited me to her ballet performance, and then her gala where I was the life of an adult party.

We texted over the summer.

Freshman year I was denied science research. The same teacher who denied me found me at the end of Junior year and saw how much I matured, so she gave me a selective internship. ""Everything happens for a reason.""

I get an A in a Chemistry course at Northwestern.

""Everything happens for a reason."" I think about this. If I did better in middle school I wouldn't have been placed in physics regulars and I wouldn't have met my physics teacher.

Senior year, I'm anxiety ridden.

First day of school. I know my free periods. I wanted to talk to my 3 favorite teachers once every week, starting with my music teacher 1st period. ""Hi piano guy!"" Some freshman.

""Who are you?""

""...I'm Her sister. You don't remember me from the gala?""

""OH, shoot, hi!""

I say hi to music teacher before 1st, and the Sister has music 1st period. We both have French 3rd, so I see her every day. I say hi to freshman year physics teacher 6th period and the Sister has him 7th. It makes it hard to forget about Her. Maybe everything does happen for a reason.

I start associating Her with Northwestern.

School's a joke. I barely study and I maintain As in APs. If only I figured out how easy it was back in Freshman year.

I had a 33 in the ACT, and I asked the world to give me more time to study for the next one. The world gave me Hurricane Irma. My family evacuates to Chicago, and the girl's family coincidentally evacuates to Chicago the same day. We went to the French market. I wanted to talk about my feelings but she brought her younger siblings. Maybe that was on purpose, but I'll never know.

35 composite. Everything happens for a reason.

I didn't want to talk to her after that. I'm not a confident applicant.

NU Representative comes. I ask if they see quarter grades for senior year. I was convinced it was my only shot. He asks the school counsellor in the back if they send them in time. Counsellor says yes. I believed it.

November 1st.

Everyone's telling me I'm getting in. I doubted it. I visit my counsellor regularly to maintain my realism, studying the NU scatter plot. Statistics don't lie. I fall beneath the GPA but above the ACT mark. One day I ask my counsellor about the senior grades. The other counsellor lied. She says earlys don't see them unless universities request them. I call the university, and they don't request grades. No more expectations meant no more anxiety. I accepted failure.

That same day, a Nobody comes walking into our history class and starts conversing with our teacher. We're watching a movie. I don't notice him.

""Hey,"" History Teacher says, ""/u/thesneakingninja's also applying to Northwestern.""

The Cocktail Party effect kicks in and I finally notice him. I saw this Nobody wearing a Northwestern shirt, and in that moment I believed in god. Why the hell is this guy visiting our school, specifically this 9th period history class, the day I finally give up? How the hell aren't I not supposed to find meaning through randomness?

I have a high ACT. I have great extracurriculars. I am passionate about my career and I look like I am too. I have high demonstrated interest. My essay is amazing. My interview went well. I talk with my counsellor frequently–recommendation should be great. I eat lunch with my teachers and we philosophize. They love me, so those recommendations should be superb. My step-father did his residency there–I have legacy. The physics program isn't even that good. Only Freshman and Sophomore years are holding me back. My hope returns, and so does my anxiety. Maybe it was meant to be! All these coincidences must mean something!

I finally text her. It's been over two months. I ask if she's visiting school. She says she's back in the state and she asks for my schedule, so maybe she wants to see me too.

December 14th. ""Everything happens for a reason.""

What a fucking lie."

1. Insurance software company I currently intern at doing sysadmin work with minor dev projects. Position would be about what i'm doing now, more responsibility with big IT projects and also part of internal apps team. Location is where I currently live, town I went to college in. 55k

2. Construction company I work at, doing remote dev work with a friend. Position would be their primary sysadmin guy as they just moved away from contracting out that work and want to internalize it, along with continuing the dev work i've been doing which is web-based applications for mostly internal use but show heavy interest in expanding this to create software for the construction industry. Location is city ~45 min from here, close to where I grew up and I have lots of family and friends nearby. 48k

3. Large company that makes KVM boxes and other stuff for server rooms, would be a firmware developer so writing code that interacts directly with hardware, not something I've done much of. Location is ~3 hours north, don't know anyone and have no family nearby. 65k

Background: Heavy IT experience, little professional development work. I like the web stuff I've been doing at #2, but am interested in pretty much all areas of development as I want to be well-rounded. 

Until today, I had planned on taking offer #2 because #3 hadn't offered yet. Benefits are similar across companies, slight advantage to #1. 

I think #2 is the work that I want to do, it's essentially a company that has a solid foundation in construction trying to make a move to something new, which is risky I know. Feels like a startup but with a bit more stability. They don't feel comfortable offering more than 48 to a new grad, but have opportunities twice a year for review to move up. I think this proposes the best opportunity for building something from the ground up and being on top of something new. But I do have loans to pay back (27k, so not the worst) and I don't want to end up in a poorer financial situation than I could have been in.

I know at #1 there will be times I will get bored, I don't want that. #3 seems like a good company but definitely a lack of growth opportunity, i'd give myself max 3 years there. The main worry I have is that if #2 doesn't pay off like I hope it will, is it easy to bounce back from that into a job that pays at least as much as the ones I have offered here?

I know now is the time to take risks, but I don't want to ruin my future because of it. I appreciate all feedback, obviously have been and will continue to discuss this with my parents and friends but wanted some professional opinions.

Thanks everyone!"
7k2w82,3,2017-12-15,Consolidated host matching tips,DittoMystery,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7k2w82/consolidated_host_matching_tips/,"From what I've been seeing, a lot of people in the Google internship host matching process aren't getting interviews for the same few reasons, so here's some tips to help you get matched!

* **Use the full 2000 character limit.** Don't just list your skills or preferences in a single line. Go in depth! Explain your passions and why you would be a good fit for a specific team or project. Hosts can also search by keyword which is another reason to use the full limit. A major problem is that someone may be a good fit for a project, but they don't fill out the questionnaire correctly so their perfect match is unable to find them.

* **Add location preferences.** Even if you're open to working anywhere, these can still be filtered through by hosts so it actually helps rather than hurts.

* **Neither be too open or too specific; find middle-ground.** This one can be tricky, but what I recommend is at the top of your questionnaire say you're open to everything then list 5-6 projects you think you'd be a good fit for then have a paragraph about each. Don't just list one discipline and say you only want to work in AI/Machine learning and nothing else. These fields are extremely competitive and most want a candidate with previous experience in those fields.

* **Lastly, it's okay to reject a project you aren't interested in.** If you're a Google fanboy and would love any boring testing project then by all means accept your first match, but a lot of people I knew rejected their first host and got a project that fit much better only a few weeks later!"
7k2z1j,46,2017-12-15,Does college REALLY teach you that much more than self-teaching or bootcamps?,ddddddddddk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7k2z1j/does_college_really_teach_you_that_much_more_than/,"I'm graduating with my CS degree tomorrow, and I'm sitting around thinking back on what I've learned and how useful my education is. Two things really stand out to me:

1. Of all the practical skills I'm going to use at my job, I learned almost all of them by either doing an internship or practicing coding by myself

2. Of what skills and information I did learn in class, you probably could've condensed it to 6 months or a year and taught it to me the day after my high school graduation. This would be the programming courses, the software engineering principles courses, data structures and algorithms. This would not include the electrical engineering requirements, most of the math, or any of the ancillary requirements.

I certainly don't regret college; I really enjoyed being here and I think I made the right call from a career perspective. In terms of social and emotional maturity, the past few years have absolutely changed and improved me as a person. But it's just baffling to me that employers, almost all of whom hold CS degrees themselves, see this as an irreplaceable learning experience for their candidates. The actual process of earning a degree really didn't do all that much for me in terms of ability, just employability. 

I went to school on scholarship, so I didn't have to pay for it, but I just don't see the $100,000+ price tag of a typical degree as even remotely worth it. I'd be furious looking back if I had paid that for what I received. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills to watch people still go through this whole song and dance and spend hundreds of thousands for a piece of paper that doesn't really mean much. 

What are your thoughts on your time in college? Is there some intrinsic value to it that I'm missing? Did it make you a much better software engineer than you would've otherwise been with self-teaching a subset of the skills it taught you?"

My experience with my AP CSP so far has been positive. While the development side of my coursework is fun, i cant picture myself writing code for the rest of my life.
    Because of some personal family experience i found myself drawn to law enforcement for the longest time. No matter what my current career plans were i always kept law enforcement in the back of my mind. And in looking at the type of work done by Computer forensic examiners, i can get past the fact that they look at some truly disturbing material from time to time by looling at the demand for both forensic and cybersecurity specialists. 
    I know that demand shouldnt be the only factor in deciding future job prospects. i am also aware that a degree is also not a ""golden ticket"" into a cushy salary. But in looking at the coursework for both degrees i found that an IT degree deals with the processing, organization, and security of data while CS deals with the development and improvement of code. based on these factors it seems like the IT degree would be a little better for this field (computer forensics). I could be looking at both degrees completely wrong, but this is the overall idea i got from looking at the classes and jobs typically associated with the degree paths.
    my university's IT program offers plenty of room for one or more minors which i plan to fill with a minor in Statistics. i am also in close contact with a Raytheon engineer that is able to get me an internship as an IT specialist. i have no real problems with aquiring a security clearance at the moment and plan to keep it that way. I hope to use this degree and experience to get into AFOSI and then hopefully with another agency such as the FBI.

The first language I learned was C/C++ and then some others (but never Python or Java)  thanks to my classes. However, most internships in my area seem to ask for Python mainly. Very rare do any ask for C/C++ and even Java is rare.

Now in an ideal world I would like to first pick up Java, Kotlin and Swift and get to work on making my own mobile apps. However I also really want to land an internship before I graduate which requires me to pick up Python not only to work there but for an easier time to solve interview/whiteboard questions with. 

So the question being...what route is best now? 

1 . Learn Python.


PROS
- Easier time with interview questions
- More options/chances for internships
- Handy language to learn
- Will help in the class I'm taking next, Algorithms

CONS
- Would have to pause my passion to work on mobile

2 . Learn Java.


PROS
- Get to work on mobile apps
- Maybe get to build an awesome project to put on my resume for when I graduate
- Handy language to learn

CONS
- Relatively the same level of difficulty as C++ with interview questions
- Lack of internships asking for Java, possibly not getting any before I graduate

Stuck at a crossroad here, any thoughts are appreciated.

Do I need to know ALL these languages and technologies for the Intern position?

And its for Summer '18 so when the latest I can apply? Can I apply in late Jan - early Feb?

Is it ok if I don't know the specified framework but instead something else? Eg: Instead of Angularjs, I am familiar with React

I really want my application to stand out so any Resume / Application Process / Interview tips would be much appreciated.

While I've had several interviews, I'm having trouble getting over the gap that comes from a lack of prior experience(My college's degree did not come with chances at an internship as/instead of classes, so I just worked my part time job throughout). I took some advice I saw on this sub to try to sell myself competitively; offer to take a decreased starting salary, compared to what the company is asking for, to cover the lack of prior work experience as a cost-effective buy, but I was curious if there was anything else I could be doing and saying in my cover letters and communications to better sell myself as a good choice?"

Any Advice?",deceiver101,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7k6y0m/graduating_in_spring_and_i_feel_like_ive_learned/,"To begin, I have no real passion for C.S. I am interested in it and enjoy coding and problem solving, but my passion is with writing. I double majored with a BA in CS and a BA in creative writing (a specialized English degree), so I would have a practical degree that I enjoyed for work and another to pursue my passion.

I'm wondering in terms of jobs if I have a chance because I feel as if I haven't learned anything practical as of yet. I learned the material and understand the application, but I feel that I lack the practical know how/experience for a workplace setting. 

In terms of courses, this is what I have taken so far and will be taking:

*a year (2 semesters) of Intro courses using Java.

*a semester of  basic mathematics but applied in a C.S. context. (I have also taken various other mathematics courses such as  linear algebra and numerical analysis.)

*a year of computer architecture, ranging from Assembly programming to using a simulation of digital circuitry. Also within these courses we learned and used C.

*a semester of  learning and analyzing algorithms and data structures  and coding them into Java. 

*In the spring semester, I will be taking an additional 3 courses: database systems*, data mining, and artificial intelligence.



Over the last 2 summers, I have taken summer classes to stay on track for graduation, so I haven't had time to really pursue a summer internship. I also go to a decent Uni (top 20), but I am assuming that no one cares and doesn't matter  in this field of work (I originally went into the uni for a business degree but didn't like the material). Job experience consists of a year and a half as a I.T. guy for student support (worked with game consoles, projection stuff and macs) and  year of being a professor assistant for a department and helped with basic I.T. things.

Overall, I am wondering if I have the knowledge to pursue an entry level position in some form of a C.S. field. From what I understand, a lot of new grads have the same fear that they go in knowing nothing, so I am curious if I have learned enough to get a job, and I am just suffering from the ""pre-grad panics"", or if there is something that I need to get on top of immediately  and learn something else. 

Any general advice would be helpful. I'm sorry for the long read and possibly a flood of useless info, just feeling a little panicky about Graduation.

For my year/semester off, I had a wild idea--rather than sitting in my room at home, or sitting in my room off-campus in a place I already dislike, why not go to a *different* university and meet people there? 

Maybe I could go to their events, hackathons, student org meetings, etc.? Maybe I could try to get an on-campus or otherwise part-time job to pay for an off-campus apartment? How much do you think I could get away with without being a student? 

I'm aware it's a really weird and possibly dumb idea. I know this kind of thing also depends on the school. We can probably assume this could be a big university.

I did not get even a phone interview. One place even told me it was because they are selective of which schools they hire from. I went to a small school to save money but I wish I had just taken the risk and went to a well known university.

For my previous internships, 1 was at a small local company and the other was a very large and well known non-tech company. This second company is probably the most desirable company that shows up to my career fair. But I feel like I am trapped in mediocrity because of my school. I have offers from non-tech companies and they are good jobs. But I wanted to be working at a company that is well known and has CS as the core of the business, rather than just a support or supplementary role.

7kh3lb,7,2017-12-17,Backing out of an internship offer for a better opportunity.,zues8,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7kh3lb/backing_out_of_an_internship_offer_for_a_better/,"Hello R/Jobs!

About 20 days ago I accepted a summer internship offer from a company that presented a decent opportunity for me and my career goals. I recently had the opportunity to interview at one of the big 4 tech companies, and I decided to do it for the experience. I ended up making their final round and got an internship offer from them a few days later.

This opportunity seems much more beneficial. Although it is a much less technical role than the offer I already accepted, the benefits and the exposure aspect of this new opportunity outway the current one. The company is more well known in comparison, and offer benefits (compensation, housing, transportation coverage etc.)  outway the offer I already accepted by a long shot. The new internship seems like a much more challenging and ultimately rewarding opportunity.


The only problem is that I really enjoyed interviewing with the company that I already accepted. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful, and I am not entirely sure if backing out from an internship offer 20 days after I accepted it is legal or ethical. 

So my questions are.
1) If you were in my position what would you do?
2) If you ever backed out of a job offer acceptance, what was it like? and how would I go about it without burning too many bridges?"

-nothing really special to write about in general  
**Takeaways:**  
I had an interview, which was nice to help my application, but better to learn about the school. My interview for Michigan was great since it was more me asking questions, since the point was to learn about the school, and less for them to learn about me. I would have probably applied to fewer schools (I applied to 7, wrote essays for 10). Visits are great to see the campus feel, get a good physical comparison between colleges, and also just see what college is like. If you can, regardless of if you would go there, try to visit a nearby college town college, a nearby urban setting college, and/or a suburban type college, just to get the feel for what the setting is like. Also, get started thinking about the common app essay now or before April, think about who to ask for recs, and start filling out what you can on the common/coalition app, since it takes a while. It's better to start visiting early on so you can narrow down your list while you have time. Above all, don't get too stressed by the process, and help your friends  
  
Good luck!

Along with my university classes I have done numerous web development projects and have experience with React, so I believe I would be adequately prepared for a frontend internship.

Any suggestions on whether there are companies out there that do take underclassmen, or how else I should spend this summer to progress my career and learn new professional skills?

I learned how to program in college but it was mainly geared toward astro/physics data collection and analysis.
 
Quick summary of some of my college experience:

* Used the Astronomer Language IDL combined with Emacs, Linux shell for image processing and data analysis. (now I love Ubuntu)
* I took an intro class to Python for engineers. Coded a Tetris game for the final project
* Took a Data Structures and Algorithms course for CS Majors. First time using Java, learned it the first week before HW was due
* Spent 8 months writing code in C++ for detector calibration and data analysis during an internship at CERN.

I suffered a pretty bad burnout after graduation. Most physics majors I knew went to grad school but I didn't think I could handle it at the time. I got diagnosed with ADHD shortly after and needed time to recover and develop good habits. Because of this, I have a 2 year gap without any work experience aside from tutoring. 

However, in the past year, I've gotten really serious about getting into the software development industry. I spent a lot of time taking online courses and doing various coding projects to improve my marketable skills. 

* I've been working on various game development projects with Unity Game Engine and C#. I went to Game Jam 2017 and coded a game from scratch by myself in a weekend. 
* I spent the summer learning Android Programming (Android Studio and Xamarin) to work on an app idea. It's still a work in progress, but I'm really proud of how it turned out and have gotten great feedback about it. The biggest learning experience was how to implement different API's and also how to define and structure my classes and functions that are easily improved when new features are added. 
* I took a course called Software Engineering Essentials in which I learned about the software development life cycle, agile &amp; scrum, unit testing, OOP, version control etc. This course was incredibly helpful to learn about the widespread skills and practices used in the industry.
* I took another course called Clean Code. Mainly a class geared toward how best to structure, organize and refactor code. In my experience, most physicists write code that works and nothing beyond that. This course opened my mind and helped me learn to write more readable code.

I've been applying everything I've learned in those online courses to my personal projects in order to develop coding practices that I can hopefully extend to a future software development job. 

A few months ago, I started actively applying for jobs. I got some good feedback from a few tech recruiters, but I was desperate for any job, so I took a QA testing position at a research company. However, the job doesn't involve any programming and is pretty easy. It's been nice making money but I'd rather be doing something more productive for my career. I feel like I progressed more in the 3 months I worked on app development than in the last 3 months working. 

So I've started applying to jobs again but I want to do it right. Currently, my resume is a bit cluttered with both physics and programming related content, but doesn't really highlight either. I want to recreate it so that it will stand out most to potential software engineering employers/recruiters. In my resume and cover letter, how should I best present myself? What should I focus on and what should I exclude?

I know that some employers/hiring managers are looking for very specific criteria and experience. They might not take a 2nd look at my resume if I don't meet their qualifications (don't have a CS degree, X years experience using esoteric program, etc). I've already proven it to myself that I can pick up and learn whatever skills I need to (&lt;= astrophysics) for the job. How do I prove it to a potential employer? Maybe in this regard, certain positions/companies are better than others. Maybe there are certain positions I should be targeting more than others and ignoring some completely?

**TL:DR** Astronomy and Physics grad with coding experience looking to start a career in the software industry. How do I best present myself to potential employers?

I am a senior computer engineer at SDSU. Here in California. During the fall I tried to obtain an internship but failed to do so. Not a single offer. I tried obtaining anything that would get me in the industry to discover what I would like the best. I am not the best coder but I am very interested in verilog an circuit design. I think this happened because I think I am not experienced enough about what goes on in the industry.

I want to redeem myself for next year, yes I will be a super senior, so I want to make a little project that involves what I learned. I want to make a robot that follows me around by detecting a sensor from a few feet. I think I can do this with an Arduino and some UART principles? Anyway, I think I have the knowledge to do this but can anyone direct me on some introductory projects that I could deviate from to do something like this. I do know that aurduino is base of off C code. I am not sure where or how to start. I do know an arduino is a micro controller for embedded device use so I am willing to learn on my own on how to do this.

Anyway, do any of you have recommendations on what type of arduino, hardware I would need? or
Do you guys have any recommendations for projects that would definitely get the attention on recruiters?

I am not a fan of software coding but rather embedded device programming and verilog. I made a sorta working 1-D pong game with verilog and really enjoyed it. I want to make my C more stronger though. 

Any suggestions/recommendations are welcome.

Thanks for your time and attention. "

It was an interesting road, and I've read a lot here along the way, commiserated with some of you and been intimidated by others.

Over a grand total of six years, I've been through academic restriction, summer school, a completely failed semester, a specilisation change from civil to computer systems, taken a paper three times, repeated 4 others and even used a conceded pass in this final semester. I lived at home for the majority of the degree and commuted over an hour each way.

I have been in groups doing everything and others worrying because I'm doing nothing. I did the majority of my final year project implementation in the final few weeks (was actually my best mark) and passed one paper with 50.1%. Countless C-, not a single A over six years. This was an internationally approved engineering degree from the only internationally ranked university in my country.

I signed my contract today for a big four consultancy (the biggest one) doing tech security consulting.

I would advise everyone to make the most of internships and part time jobs in industry. I worked over 20 hours a week on top of full time study in a few industries from the end of my second year, and every employer has asked solely about my industry experience and not my university career, though I cherry pick a few projects to bring up if need be. My new job is where I've been working part time for the past two years.

My other piece of advice is network and talk to people. I never had a study group, or knew many people in my classes (especially as I was split over so many years of papers in the end) but I managed to negotiate an easier business Information System when I predicted a semester would be too time consuming. I had to sell myself to change specialisations. I never would have had the gpa to get into computer systems from the first general year, and especially after bombing civil. Even my conceded pass, or third repeat would not have been approved automatically. I even got a solid job that lasted over a year from a guy I met at a wild party who just happened to be young, but in a managing role at a big international company and put my name forward. 

People are human, be normal and friendly to those who are calling the shots and they will listen and help you out. You may say I could have put this effort into class in the first place, but it's hard and I never got the hang of lecturing. I spent too much time at work, instead of going to office hours and other lectures. But I still made sure I knew everyone running the show, and made my presence known when I could at what I thought was most important.

I have some regrets, but I think I made the right choices in the end. I'm 23, I'm happy where I'm at in an industry I like and after getting that last result, the stress and anxiety just disappeared. I never believed people when they said you'll never think about it in a couple of years, but now I totally see it.

If I can pull it off, you can too everyone!"

**May-June 2014**

Just turned 18 and finished my second year in university in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. I started to think about getting a job because I wanted to have some pocket money. I had a bit of knowledge in HTML and PHP and started applying for some web companies. Eventually got an offer ($300/month which is 2 times higher than average salary in country). The job was mostly dealing with some crappy PHP code mixed with HTML templates.

&amp;nbsp;

**September 2014**

Third year at university started, but I decided to stay at the company and work full-time. At the same time I eventually heard about competitive programming and Codeforces. Back then I didn't even know what linked list or binary search is and what time and space complexity is.

&amp;nbsp;

**October 2014**

Started to have problems at university because I wasn't visiting classes at all. However winning ACM ICPC Kyrgyzstan Subregional saved me, because it was first ever win for our university since this competition was established for our region in 2005.

&amp;nbsp;

**January 2015**

Moved to another web company, this time it was Python+Django related. I didn’t know Python at all, but they hired me for probation period. While I was working there I learned a lot of stuff - patterns, clean code, git, continuous integration, unit-test etc.

&amp;nbsp;

**September 2015**

Found blog from one girl who works at Google MTV where she shared her experience about 2 Google internships she had and gave some advices. So I decided to apply for internship and asked her to refer me.

&amp;nbsp;

**October 2015**

Our team won ACM ICPC Kyrgyzstan Subregional again and this saved my ass at the university one more time.

&amp;nbsp;

**December 2015**

Google internship interviews. I got 2 interviews followed by another one 2 weeks later and got rejected. This was my first ever experience interviewing in English. All the questions were LeetCode-like, but because I was really nervous I failed to come up with decent solution. Also I want to mention that I had my interviews over the phone which was my mistake because connection was quite bad for international calls. I learned this lesson and later I had all of my phone interview over internet connection (Hangouts, Skype, BlueJeans etc).

I also switched jobs and started to work as an outsourcer for some American startup. My salary increased to $700/month.

&amp;nbsp;

**March-May 2016**

Some guy posted link to internship at Yandex (it’s very large Russian company developing lots of products, main one is search engine which is twice more popular than Google in Russia). I applied and got pre-screening ACM ICPC-style coding test followed by 3 interviews. Recruiter said that team I was interviewing with decided to choose another candidate, but because my interview performance was good enough she can try to match me with other teams. After another interview I finally got an offer for internship. The coding test was really hard for me, and out of 4 interviews 2 were LeetCode-style questions and 2 were general questions (databases, parallelism, Python language details etc)

&amp;nbsp;

**June 2016**

Graduated with Bachelors. Moved to Moscow for Yandex internship.

&amp;nbsp;

**September 2016**

Got full-time return offer from Yandex.

Started to grind LeetCode (now I have 400+ problems solved)

Also started to practice interview skills at pramp.com. It's a website where you get paired with someone and you have to interview each other for 1 hour (30 minutes each). You will be given a problem to solve and problem to ask. This helps you to improve your behavioral skills because you can't get this experience from LeetCode.

&amp;nbsp;

**October 2016**

One of my friends applied to Booking.com in Amsterdam and was invited to onsite. He suggested me to apply as well.

&amp;nbsp;

**November 2016**

I passed phone interview with Booking.com and was invited to onsite in Amsterdam. Phone interview was quite easy, it included 2 easy problems from LeetCode.

At the same time recruiter from Google reached to me and asked if I’m interested in SRE position. I agreed to proceed further.

&amp;nbsp;

**December 2016**

Passed 2 phone interviews with Google and was invited to onsite in Dublin. Both interviews were easy, same questions from LeetCode.

&amp;nbsp;

**January 2017**

Got an offer from Booking.com after onsite. Onsite consisted of 3 interviews: coding, system design and behavioral. I did well on coding (it wasn't from LeetCode, but I would say it's like LeetCode Medium), but wasn't sure about my system design and behavioral interviews. What I really liked about Booking.com is that they asked me to wait 15 minutes in meeting room after my last interview and then recruiter came in and said they'll be offering me a job.

&amp;nbsp;

**February 2017**

Applied to Amazon and Bloomberg. Got a link to coding test from Amazon. There were 2 easy LeetCode-like problems. After solving them I was invited to onsite in London.

&amp;nbsp;

**March 2017**

Had an onsite at Google. Hiring committee approved me, but executive committee overturned this decision and rejected me. This was disheartening. The onsite consisted of 4 coding and 1 system design interviews. Also I want to mention that I've never seen any problems asked on my coding interviews. They were not from LeetCode.

I also had first phone interview with Bloomberg. Same as previous experience, two LeetCode easy problems.

&amp;nbsp;

**April 2017**

Second phone interview with Bloomberg. This time it was a video call with 2 engineers supposed to run for 1.5 hours, but I was able to finish tasks in 35-40 minutes. I was invited to onsite in London, but two weeks later I got email from Bloomberg saying that they already filled up all the available positions. This actually also happened to some other guys when they were invited to onsite but later got email like this.

&amp;nbsp;

**May 2017**

Got an [offer](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/6ee484/uk_need_an_advice_about_offer_from_amazon_london/) from Amazon in London after onsite (onsite was delayed because of visa). The onsite consisted of 4 interviews. Each interviewer spent at least half of the time on behavioral part and their leadership principles. Another half was technical, I got some OO-design problem in first interview and 3 LeetCode easy-to-medium problem in other interviews.

Had a choice between Booking.com and Amazon. Decided to go for Booking.com.

&amp;nbsp;

**June 2017**

Started at Booking.com in Amsterdam

&amp;nbsp;

**September-October 2017**

Applied to Palantir and Facebook, both in London.

Passed phone interviews and was invited to onsite with both companies.

Palantir rejected me after onsite saying that I have good technical skills, but I won’t be a good cultural fit for Palantir. Onsite consisted of 2 coding (they had some different questions which are not from LeetCode), 1 system design and 1 behavioral interviews.

1.5 weeks later had an onsite at Facebook. It was 3 coding, 1 behavioral + coding (mixed) and 1 system design interviews. I did well in 2 coding interviews, kinda ok in mixed interview but completely failed one of the coding interviews and system design interview. I was pretty sure they gonna reject me. However recruiter emailed me saying that they want another phone coding interview. I passed it and got an offer.

&amp;nbsp;

**Some notes/advices**

* Grind LeetCode, that's probably most important one. If you solve at least 100 problems from there you will feel much more confident in your interviews. You can also practice on Codeforces/Topcoder.
* Also try to do some practice on pramp.com. You will get some close-to-real-life interview experience and you will also be an interviewer so you can detect some red flags you should avoid as an interviewee, for example when candidate just keeps quiet not explaining his thought process. 
* Try to schedule all of your phone interviews via internet connection (Hangouts, Skype, BlueJeans), because phone connection, especially for international calls, might be bad.
* Degree is probably not required. I got my Dutch work/residence permit and currently in process with UK Tier 2 General visa. Nobody ever asked me about my degree. I'm not saying that you shouldn't get your degree, but my observation is that it's not required to get work permit.
* Competitive programming experience will help you a lot. You can spend 1-2 years practicing competitive programming skills while studying in university. Once you are purple or yellow on Codeforces (I'm still blue btw haha) you can easily pass all the interviews.
* In original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7jqz5r/how_to_have_a_successful_tech_career_as_a_citizen/) this guy who lives in third world country said that EU countries became more strict in visa sponsoring process. I don't think this is actually true. Usually all big companies (like 500+ tech employees) will fully support and pay for your visa and relocation.
* Yandex coding test for internship was actually the hardest stage ever for me (even harder than Google and Facebook onsites). There were 6 problems and 6 hours to solve them. You need to solve at least 5 to pass. Problems included some stuff like Union-find, Convex hull, Segment trees with modification to update on interval, Geometry (I hate it) and Probability."

I'm a CS student in my first year of Master's at a no name state university from the Eastern European Block. 

I made the terrible mistake of getting a full-time shitty job at an Antivirus Company during my Bachelor's so I never got the chance to try an internship at a better company. While the pay was decent for my city, I started feeling I was wasting my time and potential working there. That said, I quit my job after 2 and a half years, after I finished my Bachelor's (August this year).

A few guys from my uni landed internships at Google and Palantir. While I'm in no way as good as them, I know I have the potential if I study enough.

So I got CTCI and started refining my DS and Algo skills in the hope of landing an internship in the US or at least some company in the UK. Next year is my final year of Master's so I think I'll be unable to try again next summer if I fail now.

I need advice in case that happens. So my end goal is to land a job at a Big N company. I think I want in the US, because from what I've heard, the salaries in EU are no where near as good (except for Switzerland). There is an Amazon dev center in my city and It's probably the only challenging place in my city. 

1. Do you guys think, if everything fails, I should get a job at Amazon in my city, while still improving my algo skills, then try to interview for full-time roles at Big N? Are all job experiences at Amazon viewed the same, regardless of location? (for example, vs working at Amazon London).

2. Is there a way to land an internship in my final year of Master's? The guys that I mentioned earlier who worked at Google, did it this summer, after getting their Bachelor's and before starting Master's, how did they manage to do that? Is there a way to promise said company that you're going to enroll when you return?

7km03g,6,2017-12-18,How to approach teacher for extra credit (potentially valid reason?),thanksforhelp123,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/7km03g/how_to_approach_teacher_for_extra_credit/,"Hey,

I'm going to try to keep this as brief as possible.

We are 60% into the course grade-wise (grade 12 mathematics, ends in January). I'm sitting on a sad 81 that I will hopefully be able to, god-willing, bring up to an 83 by the exam (worth 30%). If I ace the exam, which I really plan on doing, I will manage to have an 87-88 as my final grade. I would need a 2-3% boost (earned or otherwise) in order to get a 90+, which is my minimum requirement for my desired program.

I am not a bad student - I do all my homework and I pay attention in class. My grades are as following - 92, 83, 80, 94, 74, 50...

The issue is that this semester has been an unusually tough one for me. I live with just my mom and two siblings - one 5 and the other 12 but moderately autistic. My parents are not divorced but my dad doesn't live with us - he sends us money but it's not enough (not that he makes much). I am basically dad at home. My mom would leave for work at 630 and I would have to be up by then and preparing my siblings for school (breakfast, changing my autistic sibling's diapers, getting them ready etc.) Additionally, I am home by 315 and I cannot do anything work related other than supervise and deal with my brother until my mom is home, around 530. 

Those were the months of September-October. November, unfortunately, we received the news of my mother's cancer diagnosis. It's been such a great hit to me and has honestly fucked me up a lot. I don't want to go into details but it's really been a very stressful month and a half and it's affected my mental health and consequently my schoolwork and extracurriculars. 

Slightly off topic, but I wish to pursue computer science because I am passionate about it. I've completed two paid internships and I am doing research at a fairly large university (computer science). I have a webapp with over 100k visits and I've placed top 100 in the country (Canada) in a computing contest. I would like to somehow let my teacher know this to just show that I'm actually passionate about the field and going to Waterloo would really help me and my career considerably.

Without going into TMI details or making it sound like a sob story, how can I approach my math teacher for extra credit? Would it be better to do so before winter break or after? 

Thank you:)"
7km47g,83,2017-12-18,The best IT geniuses support each other,Dave-ros,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7km47g/the_best_it_geniuses_support_each_other/,"Greetings, TFTS -- I, Dave-ros, have returned to impart another of my anecdotes. Davros may be the grotesque, evil genius who created the Daleks in *Doctor Who*, but despite naming myself in his honour, I certainly can't refer to myself as a ""genius"" -- though I did earn the moniker, briefly, early in my IT career...

&amp;nbsp;

This took place during my first proper IT job: thanks to my agency, having left my office admin job at the London Borough of *(cough)* Ralph &amp; Alice (where I'd been for over eight years), I was placed as a six-week unpaid intern (in order to get some ""experience"" on my CV), at a college in the west of London. So far west, in fact, that it didn't have a London postcode, and took me 90 minutes to commute each way by public transport (on a *good* day).

Naturally, being a n00b, unfamiliar with the role and anxious as hell, I got sent out for all the first-line, customer-facing tasks:

* Replacing printer toner (hey, it's a dirty job);

* Resetting students' passwords (especially at the start of term, when they couldn't read the login details that had been e-mailed to their own addresses), or possibly reading them out from the web interface (yes, we stored them in plaintext!);

* Running a batch file on staff computers (one of which mysteriously didn't recognise the **net** command), in some cases losing staff vital network drives;

* Apologising to angry teachers because we'd run out of space for virtual desktops (the server not having enough memory and/or licences), and none of their students could log in for their classes *right this instant*;

* Helping those who had opened multiple virtual desktops at once (by rapidly clicking the icon), or losing their virtual desktop behind the login window (Alt+Tab)...

I'd also check all the classroom PCs at the start of every day, before sitting in the walk-in clinic for the morning (and then, mercifully, being allowed to sit in the IT department after lunch, away from the peasantry, letting the other intern suffer for a while). I often felt like a dogsbody, unappreciated by my team (just another short-term intern who needs no encouragement), and given all the worst jobs to do so I wouldn't handle anything important...

&amp;nbsp;

Until one quiet morning, when a teammate (hereafter referred to as **$TM**) called me up and sent me to a classroom -- apparently they were getting messages that their Internet connection was being ""hacked""!

I locked the walk-in clinic, ran down the hall, and arrived to discover that, yes, Firefox was warning the teacher that potentially someone was tryting to hack in; Internet Explorer was also giving error messages... and all this simply because they were trying to Google something. Baffled, I called **$TM** (from my own mobile at this point) for guidance, but despite her greater knowledge and experience, she couldn't figure it out -- why would this be happening? What could possibly bring up such a weird error, in a quiet college environment?

I'm sure some of you figured it out *just like that* -- and for me, it was a sudden epiphany (possibly one Terry Pratchett's ""inspiration particles""): I remembered that Google had just recently gone over to **https:** by default... and when I looked at the clock in Windows, yes indeed, it was showing the wrong time -- and the mouse-hovering tooltip gave a date over *four years* in the past!

All the classroom PCs had recently been reimaged, and this one's motherboard battery must have gone flat when it was unpowered, hence the time and date having reverted to the time it rolled off the production line -- and with an SSL connection, a significant time/date mismatch like this causes errors, with Firefox in particular alerting the user to possible attempted hackery. (Apparently h4x0Rz can't tell the time?)

Setting the time and date correctly resolved it at a stroke, and not only was the teacher relieved (perhaps less so the students), but **$TM** actually called me a ""genius""! Finally, I felt like I was part of the team, and that IT was my calling...

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, a day or so later, **$TM** was the genius, and I was the clueless numpty: a lecture hall PC I'd confirmed to be working first thing was now not working at all, claiming its hard drive had no Windows installation, just after a guest lecturer arrived. I called my team in a panic, not able to see what was blatantly right in front of me -- and when **$TM** answered, her first question was simple: is there a USB thumbdrive connected?

Yes, the guest had plugged it in (to copy over a PPT or similar), and then inadvertently rebooted the PC while trying to figure out how to log in (not an unusual occurrence). My fault for not looking for it calmly and rationally, and I'm glad she kept her head and got me out of a tight fix... but hey, who had forgotten to turn off ""boot from USB"" in the BIOS after reimaging the PC? Huh? *Huh?!*"

Hi guys, super new in the IT field. I do not have a lot of experience so I am unsure on what ideas should even be considered.

I am more into security, however, the internship I currently have is for computer networks/ IT admin/ tech.

Well, firstly, we do not have any sort of perimeter on our WiFi so I was thinking a route license to authenticate users when they come in.
Group policies to lock up computers since every single person in my facility just thinks it is just dandy to let people see their personal data [their is already too much on their WORK computers already.]
What can I do to make a better network? I mean it runs pretty great already, I am unsure on what I can do to help."

Additional background information:

* Top 5 undergraduate CS program
* 2 internships.  One of them being at a local defense tech startup.
* 2 small side-projects completed.
* 1 large Android app nearing its completion

After lurking this subreddit and using the search bar, I find that the general consensus is that my GPA will be prioritized less by recruiters if I have interesting side-projects and internship experiences to speak of.  However, being the paranoid type of person, I get the feeling that it will take a significant number of side-projects and open-source contributions before I can show any worth without a 3.0+ GPA.

I don't mind spending the next 6-12 months hacking away at the fun side-project ideas that I've brainstorming for a long while. However, the thought of these efforts only barely bringing me closer to a decently paying software engineering job tears away at me. 

Now, I'm asking for this subreddit to be honest with me.

How much will my current plan improve these chances? What else will it take for me to score job interviews once I start mass-applying soon?  And most importantly, does the idea of ""GPA doesn't matter"" still hold to this day?"

Context about me:

 I've done Andrew Ng's ML course (now I'm currently doing the Deep Learning specialization), and I've got several projects up on github, some of which I've made web apps. Recently I've been adopting more of a bottom-up approach to learning algorithms, where I code up an algorithm from scratch, experiment with different parameters, then apply it to a real-world dataset. 

As for internships, I did apply to a few companies, but haven't heard back...
Admittedly I haven't been super aggressive in applying for internships but most data science postings I've looked at require you to be pursuing a PhD/Masters, and I've got a long while to go before that. 

It's not always easy striking a balance between coursework and projects, but I love what I'm doing. It's a lot of fun when a custom kmeans algorithm you coded up from scratch accurately clusters an unlabelled collection of trump vs hillary tweets.

 But, in terms of internship prospects, seeing as I'm not a Master's/ PhD (yet), I'm beginning to think if I'd be better off delving more into software engineering projects. I mean, ML is fun, but I really *do* want work experience.

I'm free all winter break to get decent at DS&amp;A, read CTCI, etc, and also learn the big data / distributed computing stuff.

I really want to become a data scientist and would appreciate some guidance on the best strategy I should take. I really enjoy statistics, data analysis, computer science and solving real world problems, I know I have the drive and passion to do it However, there is a lot of work to become competent in this field and I want to know what I can do to get ahead.


 
About my background, I am graduating in this upcoming spring semester from the University of Illinois with a bachelors in Engineering Physics. My degree is flexible as it is not pure physics, so I was able to take a couple 400 level stats/probability classes along with a few cs courses, one of which being data structures which is regarded as the school’s flagship course for cs (I am taking it this spring as I just finished all the pre-recs).
I know how to code, but would by no means consider myself an expert. I have been spending a lot of my time trying to sharpen my skills in python but would only call myself intermediate at best. Since I am not a cs major I feel behind in this aspect compared to other students pursuing data science. Any advice on specific areas I should learn would be really helpful.


 
I started a little project over thanksgiving to scrape eBay and get sales data of certain collectible cards, because I noticed there was a lot of arbitrage and I am knowledgeable on the topic. I bought and sold 1 item already and made a ~25% roi, it was cool to me and inspiring to keep building. The program will be designed to scrape eBay’s sold listings page and takes all the relevant data on the item and put it into a multi-dimensional array. From here I want to figure out how to constantly store and update the lists, to have a rolling list so I can have data reaching back further than the 3 months ebay gives you. Then I can find price margins to flip the cards and see how the price moves over time. Since there are literally hundreds of viable cards to trade, this program will really help me sort through all the data and gain valuable knowledge. It is still in its early stages, but it currently can scrape the data from the sold page and put the right data into an array. Now that finals are over I will spend more time progressing it.



This project is the only thing I can use to separate me from the competition. I have no internships in data science and I had a rough first year when I transferred here so my GPA is not the best, although it has risen significantly this last year. once I graduate I think the best thing I can do is to get an internship to get more experience and train up my skills before I think I am qualified enough for a real job. I am going to spend this winter break filling out applications and working on my project and hoping that someone will take me.



I have filled out some apps already and have a coding problem for Akuna’s internship position due this week. I don’t think I am a strong enough canidate to get the position, but I want to attempt the coding challenge for the experience and to learn what areas I need to study more to get up to par in terms of python each test/interview/application teaches me something to make myself a better candidate. 
Anyways, this was very long but helped me to lay everything out. If you happened to take the time to read all this and have any advice as to what I can do to make myself a better internship candidate or advice towards getting a job, I would greatly appreciate it. Also if there are any specific things you think are essential to know in terms of python that will help me in my future, I would love to hear them. 

I also am highly considering going to grad school to get a masters. it would be in computer science, financial engineering or some other related field. I would only explore this option after i take a year off and practice coding, create projects and hopefully intern. If i feel i still am not qualified to get a job i will go on to get my masters or phd in something relevant, but since my grades are not stellar i am not sure what kind of programs i can get into, but i am sure if i work hard on my own i can prove my worth. 


thanks a lot for your time "

I am looking for an internship. I have a good resume because I worked on pretty interesting things in my last job at a startup (Also, I assume so because I got calls from 2 Big Ns and LinkedIn). 

Lately, I failed in 2 technical interviews (1 Big N and LinkedIn). Questions weren't particularly hard, they were easy. But I choked on those easy questions and took some time to come up with an answer. I have been practicing coding on LeetCode every day yet somehow in the interview I am choking on writing a code for easy questions. 

I learned the following things from my interviews. 

1. I am weak at recursion. It takes a lot of time to come up with a recursive solution. 

2. I am good at system design questions (I heavily worked on distributed computing and real-time event/stream processing in my last startup) but nobody seems to ask these types of questions in an internship interview.

3. I can solve questions involving priority queues / hashmaps / treemaps quicker than 1D, 2D arrays and in place swapping. E.g. I can easily come up with a solution to implement LRU cache but I extremely struggle with [move zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description/) types of questions. 

Now I am starting to feel that I am incompetent and have lost major opportunities that life threw at me (since I was fortunate enough to get calls from these companies but blew them). I will be interviewing for one more Big N in January and want to get over this feeling and prepare better. 

Could anyone suggest a prep strategy?

P.S.: I am an international student so I speak with an accent. None of the interviewers asked me to repeat what I was talking during the interview. Thus I guess, an accent is not an issue."

Generally:

* What are you favorite things about UIUC?

* How is the student life (balance between work and social life)?

* Does ""being in the middle of no where"" really affect you as much as everyone says it will (I'm from the suburbs of Silicon Valley, for reference)?

Computer Science:

* How are the professors/lectures/classes/other students?

* Is it difficult to find opportunities outside of academics (internships, research)?

* How do you think UIUC CS has prepared you for anything CS you've encountered?

Thank you!!"
7kpdmq,5,2017-12-18,Trouble With Math In College,AndersonG1711,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7kpdmq/trouble_with_math_in_college/,"Hey guys.

I believe this kind of issue must be pretty common around here, as I have seen other people discussing it while doing some research.

So, background: I'm currently going to my 7th semester of Computer Science. I have been passing most of the technical subjects with ease (programming related, theorethical subjects related to CS, etc.). Our grading system works on a scale of 0 to 10, with 6 being the minimal passing grade - in most classes I get 7 upwards.

But math has been giving me trouble. I came straight out of high school into university. I passed this national test consisting of 180 questions related to general knowledge acquired up to high school (math, geography, chemistry, etc.) and so I have a scholarship issued by the government that covers 100% of my education - except for transportation.

I have had a single internship that ended prematurely due to the company moving to another state. Getting a good job around here has been kind of hard due to my country's current situation too. My parents help me with transportation, which is kind of cheap.

I have had trouble with pre-calculus math classes ever since my second semester, and have failed them a few times. At first I failed because I thought it would be just like high-school math, where I never studied at all and still managed to get an 8.
This semester I took one such class again after taking some semesters as a breather from math - ended up doing bad on an test on the first half of my semester (called GA here, which is worth 33% of the grade), did okay on the second half (called GB, which is worth 66% of the grade), but ended up on probation. The probation's test was insane - I had never thought up until then that a professor made a test to be purposedly awful, however hard it was, but this one was goddamn impossible for anyone but someone majoring in math.

I did take my time, did a lot of simulated exercises, did my homework, attended classes - proof is that I did okay on my GB - I feel like I am progressing, and I still even remember EVERYTHING I studied - but this test was crazy levels of hard, ain't even trying to sugarcoat it.

So, yeah, my situation.

I feel awful, like I have once again failed myself, my family. I understand not having to pay for any of it is a blessing (my scholarship allows me to fail 25% of classes a semester without any repercussions, so, since I took 5 classes this semester, that would be 1 out of 5, which I did fail), but I feel dumb and incapable now...

I have had a great time during my scholarship, I like what I'm studying, I don't have a hard time with CS centered classes at all, but these ""simple"" math classes have been killing my self-esteem...

Lesson learned though: I got a lot of pointers as for how to go about studying during this semester. Too bad it doesn't change the fact that I'll have to go through that class all over again...

Any suggestions? I feel bad about having to tell my parents about my failure once again.

tl;dr: I do great in all classes except math ones, which I have failed. Scholarship ensures I don't have to worry about paying for it again, but I feel like shit."

I just finished my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and I'm currently really on the fence for things. This is extremely last minute in some sense, but also I have a few options I could pursue but I need to move fast. I'm trying to move away from the US because I'm not really enjoying it here. Part of that might be because I don't have a car, which is a huge part of the culture that is easy to overlook, but I also have other gripes with the country which are kind of hard to pinpoint.

I just finished my bachelors at a top 20 (in the US) university with an ok gpa (~3.1) and limited engineering experience since I wasn't able to find internships over the summer (though I did start a design competition team, and we did suprisingly well, so I'm trying to leverage that experience). I am graduating early though so maybe I could use this time to find an internship.

I also just got accepted for a masters in Mechanical Engineering at UNSW in Sydney so that is a good option I think (good school from what I hear, but also the term starts on the 26th of february and I have to get a visa/lodging/flights etc. The issue is that A) it's kinda expensive compared to EU schools (though cheaper than my previous school) and B) it's only mechanical engineering so I'm not really specializing in anything. This is particularly worth noting since I wasn't able to work for a company as an engineering intern.

Also worth noting I'm originally from France (with family in the US) so being closer to home is a decent motivation, but also Australia really made a good impression on me when I got the chance to visit a few years back (also worth noting I was just visiting, even though I was there for a few weeks).

Most jobs I look at require a masters in Europe so I think it would be nice to get one at some point, but I'd have to wait until the fall for most schools in Europe whereas I could get it in Australia and have it recognized back in Europe as well (it's EU recognized if I remember correctly) or I need to find something to do for 6 months and apply to schools then. 

Sorry for the terribly long post. Trying to give all the information I can.

Thanks in advance. I know some really awesome people always have some good advice on this subreddit and it's really awesome of you all to help other people out.

Best

I'm just starting out in an engineering program. I landed a research internship just recently but I don't really have any knowledge or experience, and something that should be easy and is just the first step in the process is proving to be really annoying and difficult.

I have to program a stepper motor controller to move essentially. The motor controller I'm using is a Klinger CC1.2. Reading the manual it seems like it was made decades ago, and was meant to be programmed using a really old computer in BASIC. Not my new Macbook. 

The ports on the back are RS-232-C and GPIB (I wouldn't be able to explain either of these if you asked me). I only have the RS-232-C adapter to USB that might work. I've read through the manual but I don't want to mess anything up, and I have no idea how to get it to talk to my laptop or any other computer. (I have access to Windows and Linux as well if that helps)

I couldn't find anything like drivers or anything like that online. Very few people seem to be using this. I feel very lost and out of my depth. Would anyone be able to point me in the right direction?"

I did so many awesome internships, did sports teams, and humanitarian projects. I was really on top of my game, but I dropped out two years ago (due to finances) and I threw away all of that. Over time I just became sad, and then I just got sadder (I know it's a pathetic reason to get so sad, but it did make me sad). I started to lose contact with all my friends.

It killed me for a long time that I wasn't in school or working, just mooching off my father at home. I was just such a pathetic bum. I couldn't look at myself anymore. I forgot everything I learned in school. All my skills were just decaying away. I was losing everything I built of myself. I just kept getting sadder and sadder and eventually I just gave up on my life. I don't have any more goals or a future. I've lost all of my friends and the only person I really speak to is my therapist, which I've been dragging myself to see (though not last week or this week). Still, nothing changes. Therapy doesn't help and I just keep getting sadder.

I've lost a lot of weight over these two years. Everything is exhausting, even walking. I have to force myself to eat and it takes so much effort to chew and just actually eat food. I've lost a lot of my vision too. Things are getting blurry and I've started to see double vision. My memory is dying off. I can't remember anything anymore. I can't tell if I've eaten today or yesterday. I can't tell the difference between last month or last year. Everything seems in this massive blob of the past. My teeth have started to chip. I think I have an infection in my ear or my jaw. I know I need to get help, but I don't care anymore. I just don't care enough anymore about myself. It all just keeps getting worse and I just keep laying on my bed watching my body decay.

I want to kill myself, but that's not new. I've wanted this for a year at this point, but I just kept waiting and waiting for something. But, I can't keep watching myself like this. I know I won't get better and I can't help myself anymore. I... I don't know. I guess I just wanted to type this out.

Thank you for reading this."

I work for a small MSP in the South Jersey / Philadelphia region. I'm looking for some insight as to what my salary should be.

Background: I have been with the company for 5 years. Started as an intern, and worked my way up to Project management / Project Engineer last year. I am still learning the ins and outs of managing projects on this scale but am doing a pretty good job of it.

Roles and Responsibilities: Server Upgrades/ Migrations, Office 365 migrations, roll outs, network evaluations, client onboarding, etc. Network upgrades such as firewalls, security, VLAN's, switching / routing. Statements of work for these projects, budgeting. 
While acting as PM, I am also an active escalation point for troubleshooting and general support. This includes everything from desktop app support (MS Office, browsers, etc.) all the way to network down, server down, name resolution, VPN, exchange, external DNS, etc.

I've been told by management numerous times that I am a highly valuable asset to the company. I regularly work outside of business hours and on weekends doing projects and support for our 24/7 clients. I have a great rapport with all of my clients, a lot of them only wanting to work with me directly.
I think outside the box, interview new candidates for job openings, I'm included in upper management meetings and ongoing issues / prospects, make suggestions that often improve the way the business runs. 

Now, I am not posting this as a shrine to myself haha. I am looking for some insight as to what my salary should be. I had a conversation with the CEO recently about my performance. He had nothing negative to say and even stated he put's my ranking and opinion above some of the management. He agreed I should definitely be making more money, and is going to research what an asset like myself should be making. He needs to research this because we have not had a similar position in the past. I want to do the same due diligence on my end. 

Like I said, I'm only 5 years in this business and I'm young. I don't know a ton of people in the industry that I have a close enough relationship with to bounce this off of, so I turn to you guys. 

I wanted to make sure I gave my background and all information possible. I wanted to get the opinion of people that work in the field and have similar skill sets and responsibilities, or who have employed a position / person like myself.

Thank you all in advance!


EDIT: Since a lot of people are talking about percentage increases, in my 5 years from my starting salary I have received 20K in raises. The issue is, I started grossly underpaid and still am. The company has had cash flow issues in the past but we are coming out of it which is why I am asking now to be compensated for what I'm worth to the company."

Not sure if I should be focusing on trying to land an internship or immediately move into full time position. Here's my background-

* No prior internships (had a solid unrelated summer job for the past 3 years and didn't seriously start looking at internships until this past summer, I've interviewed for 5ish since then with no luck so far)

* I have 2 solid side/personal projects under my belt, one of which is still ongoing

* Have had work study in my college's web content office for the past 3 years doing a mix of front end, back end, and database work depending on what they need from me at the time

* Ideally would love to bring my skills into the medical device field, but I can't help but feel I'm currently way under qualified at this time for several reasons. Considering trying to start out in the health care technology field to at least be under the same general umbrella, then try to move to medical devices later on after I build up some experience

* I'd generally consider myself an ok to good but not great programmer. I feel like I have better range than expertise (i.e. I have experience with Python, Java, C/C++, PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, My/SQL, as well as some experience across the full development stack, but wouldn't consider myself an expert in any one area). I do recognize that I probably need to sit down and improve my skills with one language no matter if I go the internship or full time route (my spring semester will be pretty light and without any CS classes- none available that I haven't taken already other than a really tough one I don't need- so I plan on doing a lot of personal work to improve my skills). I feel like I have good enough experience in web development to get a full time job in that realm now, but that isn't where I'd ultimately like to end up. Issue is that to get into medical devices/back end, I don't feel like I have nearly as much experience as I do with web dev

* Considering grad school at some point, but don't have the money to start right away. Many of the medical device jobs I've seen want masters at a minimum, so grad school is at least on my radar for an option some time down the road

* Extensive co-curricular involvement in club sports that shows strong leadership (president of our competitive ultimate frisbee team, which is more work than it sounds like)

* I'll have $20,000-30,000 in loans after graduation. Without turning this into a r/personalfinance post, my monthly payments will be about $250 for 10 years to pay them off, but I'd like to pay pretty aggressively to start off while my living expenses are lower, in hopes of not needing the full 10 years to pay things off. That's pushing me to look for full time jobs more as they generally pay better, but I'm not opposed to a paid internship if a good opportunity comes up


Any advice based on the above? I'm not really planning on limiting myself to just internships or just full time deals as I begin this search, but wondering if it sounds like I should prioritize either. Thanks for the tips"

Basically, a third chance college student and I am maintaining a 4.0 GPA.",Too_Lazy_to_delete,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7kuffn/adult_adhd_35_years_old_started_medication_in_jan/,"-  *First, please let me state that I created a new Reddit account for this specific post.  I have a high profile internship coming up this Summer and don't want to make any risks.  Yet, I would like to offer my experience as it may help others on this subreddit.*


-  **School Info**:  I took 18 credit hours last semester in the Spring '17 and 19 credit hours for Fall '17.  I finished both semesters with a 4.0 GPA.  My previous college GPA was terrible, as I didn't even bother withdrawing from the classes and took a few F's.  I am attending a different University (out-of-state) and luckily they do not accept transfer GPAs but will accept transfer credits (this was unknown to me at the time of enrollment).  Also, to stay busy this Winter break I decided to start learning Python Programming.  

-  **Short Summary**: I was smart enough to get by, easily distracted, not applied, and infatuated with novelty experiences.  I was fortunate in that I had good resume building experiences while I was not in school.


-  **What changed?**:  I started medication last Spring (Concerta 20 mg which I later changed to 27 mg).  The meds were profoundly effective for me.  Now, I can easily focus for hours.  

- I am getting older and feel like I am running out of time to professionally develop myself.  This realization basically lit a fire under my ass where I came to the harsh reality that I cannot afford to make any more mistakes or waste time.  

- I am well aware of my previous weaknesses, for example, computer games.  I spent way too much time on this and it would also change my mood.  Since I am a competitive person, I know that I cannot enjoy this activity in moderation so I decided to eliminate it all together.  

- I also make a clear distinction between my learning and leisure environment.  For example,  I only do school work in one part of the house and the rest of the house I can be lazy or do whatever.  

- I also adopted personalized learning strategies.  I use OneNote to take notes so I can study on my Surface or phone.  I write notes according to how I process them, not like some basic table of contents as we were taught.  


- I adhere to a really strict schedule as well.  Since I am a full-time student and am overloading in credit hours, so I treat this like a full-time job essentially.  I do not participate in any activities that do not contribute to my success between the hours of 9 am - 5 pm (loose interpretation as most of my classes are at night). 


In closing, I am rooting for all of you out there.  Just be brutally honest with yourself and become your best self.  "
7kuumg,51,2017-12-19,Follow up on the advice post for you guys!,SellMeAllYourKarma,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7kuumg/follow_up_on_the_advice_post_for_you_guys/,"Hey guys, I posted a few days asking for any specific advice people might want, but I’ve also paid attention to posts I’ve commonly seem here and wanted to address as many things as I could.

I wanted to take a screenshot of my final grades but they aren't all posted yet (3 As so far!). You'll just have to trust me for now, I could always provide proof in like a week though if anyone wants!

I've made these sections:

**Time Management / Procrastination**

**Making Friends**

**Dealing with stress**

**Projects**

**Materials Needed**

**Choosing Your Engineering Field**

**Internships / Research**

**Tests / General Studying Tips**

So if you were looking specifically for something, feel free to just go to that section!

Ok, here we go:


**Time Management / Procrastination**

Alright, this one is probably the most asked question on here. 

* First off, get a calendar. I don’t care if it’s a physical one (planner) or virtual; I use google calendars because I can sync it with both my computer and phone to notify me in advance of things. On the first day of school, put all your assignment due dates on it. Your future self will thank you. 

* I wake up every day and make a physical list of all of the things I want to accomplish that day. Your calendar of due dates will be of great use during this task. It feels good to line things off. 

* Additionally, you can divide your homework up and make it not nearly as overwhelming. Say you’ll do ¼ of it Monday, 1/2 Tuesday because you have more time those days, and another ¼ on Wednesday. Now you’ve seen your material multiple times and are probably pretty familiar with it.

Now what happens when you have your list of everything to do but would rather just play video games? 

* [I refer to this guide from OSU all the time.]( http://success.oregonstate.edu/learning/6-reasons-people-procrastinate) I’ve even written it on my whiteboard as a quick reference. You will see a lot of posts here of people saying “how do I stop procrastinating?” But procrastination is unique to you. So first, you have to find the underlying reasoning behind it. THEN you deal with it respectively. 

* Practice ""front loading your pain."" I actually saw this in a getmotivated post, and it has kind of stuck with me. If you know you have to do something, seriously work on doing it *now*. You KNOW you have to do it at some point. 

* One last thing you can do is find ways to reward yourself. If/then statements. If I complete ____, then I can____. Only problem I’ve found is you’re more likely to half ass an assignment if you are really eyeing that reward. 

* As /u/throwaway134277 said, take one day off a week. I usually do Fridays. Once I get out of class, I do whatever the f I want as long as it’s not school. This gives you something to look forward to all week and keeps you from feeling like you’re always on “go go go mode.”

**Making Friends**

I always see posts like this around this sub. Making friends can be difficult. How do you socialize with people when the only time you see them is when you’re listening to the professor talk? 

* If you are put in the dorms, that is probably a pretty decent way to meet people. I can’t expand too much but just asking if someone wants to grab some food with you is usually super easy. 

* Naturally though, you will be put in group projects. Keep in touch with the people you liked. I've also made friends at office hours for harder classes. It's honestly usually just the initiation of the conversation that makes things hard. A simple, ""hey how is this homework in ____ going for you?"" could start something awesome!

* As a transfer student, it took me a bit but I realized if I sat in the front row every class I was in, I started to see the same people. Do this especially in your core classes. Now not only have you made friends, but they’re in your major (so you’ll be seeing them a lot more), you know they care about doing well because they’re in the front, AND you can start building synergy for group projects. This has worked incredibly well for me to the point I’ve considered getting shirts with our names on them for when we present projects. 

* Another way is to join a club. Anything really. This is also good for your resume. Volunteer to be in a leadership position if you think you can handle it. Plus, it’s kind of easier to make friends if you’re running things (to some degree) because you’re a main point of interaction for the club.

The golden rule is to just ask people questions. Not interview style. Be interested in what they're saying and they will like you, period.

**Dealing with stress**

* Exercise. I work out about 9 times a week. You don’t have to work out this much, but I honestly don’t stress about school very much at all. I could write pages on the benefits of exercise, but that’s not really what this post is about. Just do yourself the favor. 

* We are mostly stressed in this field when things pile up and/or we get overwhelmed. The advice I gave in time management should help you deter stress as well. I do just want to add that you’ll never live a stress-free life. Engineering is stressful; sometimes stress can be good and will help you get through stuff. Just try to notice if you’re constantly being stressed, because that’s not good.

**Projects**
So /u/_Darkstorm_ said, “95% of all group projects end up with you doing two or more people's jobs by the end of the project. True/False? ;)” [which is always a favorite joke of mine](http://i.imgur.com/RaNAvjU.jpg)

* In my possibly unpopular opinion, it’s because we tend to really only notice the ones where we are the one carrying the group. I’ve certainly been there. My last project had 5 people in it and I literally designed, bought, and put everything together. However, for my calc 3 projects, I know I was worthless. I tried my best but I just couldn’t grasp certain things. 

* Do try your best. That’s all anyone (but most importantly, you) can ask of you. If you have a weakness, ask for help. If all else fails, tell your group you can format the project and do all of the annoying non-technical things. Just be proactive about it, please.

* Avoiding work, lying to group partners, and just not putting in a genuine effort to your project will get you hated. I once had a guy put off working on a project with me until the day before it was due. When I reached out he told me ""Sorry, I dropped the class."" Shit happens, put one foot in front of the other.

* You can try talking to professors about issues, but don’t be too surprised if you get told to basically just deal with it. If that is the case, and you genuinely feel like you are the only one contributing, ask to work by yourself. 

TL/DR: Put in your best effort. Don’t be a dbag.

**Materials Needed**

* Computer: I’m not a computer expert. There are /r/SuggestALaptop and /r/suggestapc if you need help catered specifically to you. A lot of people have said they like to have a light laptop for school and a pc for homework. It’s going to be unique to you really. I will say windows is strongly preferred just because programs run a heck of a lot better on them.

* Calculator: Check with your school on calculators. My math tests didn’t allow calculators but my statics test allowed any kind you wanted. Something that can solve matrices would’ve been awesome. I don’t really nerd out too much with my calculators to be honest. I have a TI-83 now but I used a scientific one up until junior year! (some of you might be cringing right now) 

* I just want to add that I had a dual monitor setup this semester and I don’t think I could ever go back. Having all of my equations/excel/music/any program on one screen and my homework on another, just glorious. No more alt-tabbing a hundred times every assignment.

* If your teacher is heavily power point oriented (not as common in engineering but you’ll still see it a few times at least) I did enjoy having a touch screen to write on and follow along with slides. Just don’t go cheap, cough asus transformer chi, or you will be very frustrated.

**Choosing Your Engineering Field**

This is a hard one. I hate it quite frankly. Send people off to college with no life experience and no idea what they want to do. Make them spend ridiculous amounts of money setting up their career possibly for the rest of their lives. Damn you society.

* Do your research. You can check out [O*NET OnLine]( https://www.onetonline.org) to get an idea of tasks/procedures/expected growth of a particular field. Engineering is very broad though, so take everything you see with a grain of salt. You can always switch majors.

* Use your professors as resources. Ask them a ton of questions! Some of them do have real work experience. 

* Be proactive about this stuff because the stronger the reason you have for *why* you want to be a(n) (______) engineer is a stronger reason for you to push through school. Engineering is seriously awesome and I’m so grateful for what it has done for my way of thinking. 

* You can also even reach out to other companies, or even check out /r/askengineers because they have a sticky post usually about asking actual engineers questions. Just try to learn as much as you can. 

I had a decent amount of questions from other environmental engineering students, so I will address those here.

* I picked environmental engineering because I grew up near one of the most polluted lakes in America. I wanted a challenge and I wanted to grow, so I knew I wanted to do engineering but the other disciplines, quite frankly do not interest me very much at all.

* Hardest class I took was environmental organic chemistry. Basically analyzing the structure of different organic compounds to estimate methods of contaminant fate &amp; transport. For instance, a company spills a thousand pounds of MTBE into a river, is it going to stay in the water, volatilize, adsorb to soil, react directly/indirectly with sunlight? Homeworks could be up to 20 pages of straight math. But I felt so accomplished after finishing them. It was both my hardest and favorite class. Really made me feel like I could handle engineering. Well, it also made me feel the opposite!

* I have an internship this summer for remediation work and will most likely be joining the organization once I graduate. I’m hoping my senior design project will be remediation based, but I don’t start it until Spring. 

* As far as the outlook, I think we will be okay. You are correct, growth is still happening but it is not as big as it was a couple years ago. To paraphrase my microbiology teacher, things have to get really shitty before they get better. Rivers and lakes were catching on fire from pollution, and thus the EPA was born. I don’t want to get political, but we will always need clean water and air.  

**Internships / Research**

I don’t know much about research, sorry guys. Feel free to ask and I can include and credit good responses!

* Internships are a pain to get but extremely sought after. A lot of people on here like the shotgun approach of applying to hundreds of online gigs. I’ve done it and it has never once worked for me. “Just apply more” is the advice you’ll see. Personally, I think it’s a waste of time.

* You have to get good with people. I’ve had probably 8 interviews with different companies, and literally every one of them came from a circumstance that wasn’t applying online. 
Go to career fairs, even if you’re a freshman. You probably won’t get an interview (or you might!) but you have to get good at talking with people. 

* Another method you can do, that has worked for me, is reach out to local places. Research them and send an email telling them why you’re interested in them and how you’d like to help them by interning. That has worked for me as well.

**Tests / General Studying Tips**

I can tell you exactly how to get an A in every class of yours. However, it can get exhausting af which is why I won’t be graduating with a perfect 4.0. Okay, here it is:

1.	Read the textbook before class on the section being taught. If you can work through the example problems you are doing amazing. Now when you get to lecture you can ask any clarifying questions and will have a much easier time paying attention/understanding the professor. 

2.	Once a week, review your notes. The [Cornell Note Taking System]( http://lsc.cornell.edu/study-skills/cornell-note-taking-system/) is awesome. Basically you are setting up your notes in an easy to study and INTERACTIVE way. Engineering stuff is a little different than most classes though, because you’re learning to think not just memorize. So I tend to just explain quick concepts, and how/why/assumptions of certain equations.

3.	Go through every homework question on the material you will be tested on. I’ve gotten the best grade in multiple classes on tests because I did this. It’s almost fool-proof. Your professor is a serious dick (unfortunately they do exist) if (s)he’s testing you on material they haven’t previously showed importance to.

4.	CHECK YOUR WORK. I know you don’t want to, but get in the habit of taking a big breath and calming down after you finish the test and then going back through the entire test. I guarantee you will find some stupid mistake you made that you would’ve hated yourself for afterwards. I will say sometimes you might actually be mentally exhausted, to the point that checking your work might be bad. In that case, at the very least, run your calculations through your calculator again.

5.	Try to just look at all the questions on your test before you start. Our brains do better with things we’re familiar with. I promise throughout your schooling you will be stuck on homework questions and randomly when you order a sandwich at subway with extra pickles your brain will yell “HOLY SHIT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO INTEGRATE WITH RESPECT TO X, NOT T!!!” Looking at the questions gives the gears in your brain a little extra time to turn and work them out subconsciously.

6.	Ok one last thing. A lot of students are still in break mode the first third of the semester before tests start. Take advantage of this. Start strong, and it’s easy to start strong because your first homeworks are going to be kind of a joke. So work hard and understand the material well to get above the curve at the beginning!

Things tend to fall apart though, don't they? Try to keep your priorities correct. Look at your syllabus and see what is most important. The reading due tomorrow in your humanities, or the test tomorrow that's worth 25%? I try to figure out what class will be my hardest one, and at least keep up with readings / go to office hours for that class when things get hectic.

**Okay, I just remembered another post I made about lack of confidence. Something I always see on this sub, and I wanted to just put it here for some motivation and because it seemed to help a lot of others:**

First off, you're in school. EVERY SINGLE DAY in school, you're learning something you didn't know. At a job, you're expected to know (to some degree). In school, you're expected to learn. This puts you in a position where you are constantly feeling like you don't get it. THAT'S WHERE YOU SHOULD BE. If you already knew everything, then wtf are you doing here? IT'S OKAY. You have put yourself in a position of not knowing exactly what to do or how to solve certain problems, and you have done it to better yourself. Of course it's going to be anxiety inducing, but I can promise you it's going to be worth it.

Second off, you're ""competing"" with some of the smartest people your country will ever see. I don't know exactly how your schools are set up, but most schools group the first 2 years of general classes together. So, yeah, someone in your calc class might be going on to design the ship that lands the first humans on mars. You aren't riding an easy curve set up by high school stoners that don't give a shit. You have to claw your way into the upper percentile now, because everyone here has stepped forward to become an engineer.
So put in the work and you will do well. If you're stuck on a problem for too long, skip it and ask for help later. Don't let yourself question if engineering is right for you because you couldn't differentiate something. If you work your ass off, it doesn't matter how ""smart"" you are, you will make it and you will become an engineer.

Wow, that took a lot longer than I thought it would. I hope I have helped some people though! Feel free to ask any follow up questions or provide your personal opinions/insights, especially on places I haven't been too knowledgeable!

7kuxme,7,2017-12-19,GPA went below requirement stated in an offer. What are my options?,JPThrowaway246,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/7kuxme/gpa_went_below_requirement_stated_in_an_offer/,"Hey

So I ended up accepting an offer for JP Morgan's Corporate Analyst Development Program internship, which (in the offer letter and verbally confirmed) states that the minimum cumulative GPA for the program is a 3.2.

Unfortunately this semester I loaded up on credits and took some tough classes, and it looks like I am going to end the semester with a 3.15 GPA. 

So far, my options are: 

1: Call HR, be upfront about it, and explain my situation and hope they will be understanding of it. I can offer to take an easy winter class and boost it up, but it will only go to a 3.18.

2: Just submit the transcripts without saying anything and hope they round up, don't check, or don't catch it


I'm basically stuck with this offer since I declined my other offers out of courtesy when I accepted JP. I did not see the 3.2 fine print until it was too late, and now I'm really worried about what might happen. What do you suggest I do?

7kv37v,2,2017-12-19,How to develop research interests?,mynameisteenager,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7kv37v/how_to_develop_research_interests/,"I'm a sophomore studying CS with a focus in machine learning. An internship application I'm filling out requires a short essay on academic and research interests. Thinking about it, I've realized that aside from a general interest in machine learning and AI, I haven't developed any refined interests for the long run. 

What should I be doing to find out my interests? Am I expected to know my interests by now? If I can't think of any, should I look into what research the company is performing and centralize my essay around that?"

I was looking over the offer given to me by the company, and in their offer letter I found the following text:

&gt; As a co-op you will have ""temporary employment"" status. As a temporary employee, you will not receive any of the benefits that regular Company employees receive, including, but not limited to, health insurance, vacation or sick pay, and paid holidays.

I'm not looking for any of the other things, I would never expect those. But at every internship I've ever done before, I was given paid holidays. And I thought that was a legally required thing, if I'm being forced to take the day off.

For example, I don't want to go into work on the 4th of July (and they might not even let me) however I would like to make the money for that day no matter what and would consider going in if allowed. But then I have to miss out on the 4th of July.

I thought it was a legal thing that holidays had to be paid if you are forced to take them off? And I most likely would be if I'm not able to go in to work without non-interns present.

Are they able to do this?"
7kw108,100,2017-12-19,To the freshman who's struggling (academically),concat18,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/7kw108/to_the_freshman_whos_struggling_academically/,"Hi! I just wanted to offer some advice/my story to freshmen who are probably getting some of their grades by now. Please note that this is based on my personal life and I am aware that this is not a one size fits all post. I am also aware that while I did struggle through high anxiety and stress my first year of college, there are students going through difficulties (financial, mental, emotional, etc) that may not find this advice very helpful. 

Given that UT is a competitive school, I know from my own experience that being surrounded by hard working and intelligent people can be intimidating. What was especially hard for me (a former straight A high school student) was getting my first C- and Bs my first semester. 

I ended my first semester with a 2.7 GPA. I was devastated. I felt like I worked so hard and spent the majority of my time studying. Why did it seem like I was working 10x harder in college and still struggling? Now, I have a 3.7 GPA. 

Looking back at it now, here's some things that I did to improve my grades:

1) GPA is just a number.
Please remember this. Your GPA is a number. It shouldn't define yourself. Even though I set my goal to get a higher GPA, I did so knowing that at the end of the day, I was working as hard as I could. If you try your best and that doesn't reflect on your GPA, try not to get frustrated. I know so many intelligent and hardworking people that have low GPAs, despite how hard they work. I know people who are great test takers but don't think outside of the box. Tests don't always capture one's capabilities. 

While I realize this may not apply for students aiming to go to grad school after graduation (like pre-med), please note that employers really do not care much about your GPA. If you have experience in your field, you will be fine. 10 years down the road, you will probably not even remember your GPA 

2) Have a social life.
My biggest mistake freshman semester was not having fun. I always thought that spending time with my friends and going out was time that could be spent salvaging my grades. Don't think like this. The best thing I did for myself was letting myself take a break. I found myself more focused when studying. It also let go of a lot of stress and made my time at UT much more enjoyable. So yes, go out to those spontaneous Voodoo runs at 2 am with your friends.

3) Balancing academics, social life, and sleep.
I remember I used to see pictures on Facebook saying ""You can only have two: social life, high grades, or sleep."" This is so outrageously wrong. You can have all three, but it takes a hell of a long time to find the balance. Don't expect yourself to have the perfect balance your freshman, or even sophomore year. This was something I really struggled with when I started joining orgs, having internships, and maintaining a full class load. It sucks. But the older you get, you (hopefully) start to get the hang of things. Keep working on this balance and remind yourself that it's okay to let one of them slip once in awhile...we are all human :)

4) For the love of God, go to class and ACTIVELY listen.
When I was a freshman, I was great about going to class. However, I didn't actively listen during lectures. What I mean by actively listening is taking notes, not being on your phone, and not spacing out. Listen in class, even though it might be boring. It saves you a lot of time when you're studying.

5) GO TO OFFICE HOURS.
Yes, I know this is such a common advice tip. But I'm going to say it again. Go to office hours. Not only does it clear up any confusion you have, but your professor gets to know you. When you need references and letters of recommendations, these professors will be more than happy to help you out. I have gotten nearly all of my research positions, grade boosters, and recommendations from professors that knew me from office hours. Please go. 

6) Find the root of your problem.
My problem was that I hated going to class. I didn't enjoy the content, my job prospects, the workload, etc. So, I changed my major. Best decision of my life. Don't try to force something that isn't working for you. For me, it was mainly the fact that I did not like my major. 

7) Find a support system.
Whether it's your family or friends, find someone that is always there for you. They will help you when times are hard.

If you are not happy with your first semester, please know this: it is okay to do bad. What is important now is that you evaluate the issues you came across this semester and keep trying next semester. "
7kw3pg,7,2017-12-19,Advice needed: choosing between two offers,engnrg_throwaway,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7kw3pg/advice_needed_choosing_between_two_offers/,"Throwaway for anonymity. 

So I'll cut to the chase: I'm a senior in college, graduating in May, and have two offers that I can't decide between, so I'm turning to fellow engineering students for help. There are obviously other factors that can't be well-quantified at this point (work-life balance, coworkers, etc.) but hopefully the basic descriptions will give some insight. It's also worth noting that both offer 1 and offer 2 are in the same general field of engineering, and the same general location.

***

Offer 1: ""Associate Engineer"" position, which for all intents and purposes is an internship (3 months over the summer) but could potentially become full-time. Well-known, medium-sized company with good name recognition. Pay would be $2600 per pay period, or a bit over $15000 for the whole summer. Great fit with my area of specialization, 100% sure I'd enjoy the work. 


Offer 2: Full-time entry-level engineering position. Company is comparatively small (~200 people) but growing, and seems to be somewhat up-and-coming. $90,000 salary and good benefits (PTO, healthcare, etc). Work would be quite a bit more varied than offer 1 (some stuff I have experience with, some not) but 80-90% certain I'd enjoy it. Glassdoor reviews are mixed but the sample size is quite small. 


I know I'm lucky to be in the position I'm in, and in the long run it's not a life-ending decision one way or another. But I would really appreciate feedback, especially from those who currently work in industry. Which offer would you take, and what factors should I be considering? "

7kwnca,7,2017-12-19,Anyone know of any companies that are hiring Data Analytics graduates in the new year?,temujin64,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/7kwnca/anyone_know_of_any_companies_that_are_hiring_data/,"I'm sick of being modest so I'm going to talk myself up while also being honest.

I did a higher diploma in Data Analytics in Dublin Business. It's an accelerated course. It was six months and was quite comprehensive. It involved attending lectures 9-5 every day and studying late every night; it was intense. Unfortunately many employers assume that you can't learn anything on a course like that but employers who have taken a chance on people with these degrees have typically been very satisfied.

Despite having a less technical background than most of my peers, I was the top of the class and even managed to get over 90% in my advanced analytics course. I was one of only 3 out of a class of 30 to get a placement. I'm doing the placement now for a startup and it's been great but they're being inconsistent about whether or not they'll be able to afford to keep me on after the internship. I was informally offered a job early on with a high starting wage (because ""good talent is hard to come by in Ireland"") but someone higher up contradicted that today by saying that they couldn't be sure if they could afford any new staff.

Regardless of whether they think they can afford me, my bosses love me. They keep on giving me more and more responsibility to the extent that they even sent me abroad to meet a potential client that could be one of the company's biggest and they were delighted with my performance there saying I exceeded their highest hopes. The data scientist representing the client even took the time to praise my presentation in particular. One boss said a document I produced was the highest quality he's ever seen at that company and he's normally very critical of people's work. 

In short, I know I'm great at what I do and I think my soft skills in particular are more strong suit. Sure as a grad I have plenty left to learn from a technical point of view, but with my grades and placement performance I've clearly demonstrated my ability to learn quickly.

The problem is that I can't convince any employers of this. I applied for over 20 grad programmes and they all turned me down because I was told I don't have enough of a technical degree. They said I need to have either a BA or MA, ignoring that my higher diploma is a level 8 degree and higher ranked than a BA since it's a post-grad.

For the one interview I did get, it was me and 20 Smurfit masters students who all had 3+ years experience in the role. It appeared as though they were only on the master's course to get a student visa as a back door into getting a job in Ireland. I don't give a shit about being passed over by a foreigner, but it's a pain getting passed over for one of the few grad jobs around by someone with years of experience.

I think a lot of companies are looking at my CV, seeing my arts background and the Higher Diploma and just assuming that I don't know enough about IT or data analytics. I feel like I've never been given a decent shot.

I'm now 3 and a half year unemployed. I've tried to keep my chin up and use the time to better myself by studying a master's in international relations and the higher diploma in data analytics. I  spent over a year working my ass off in unpaid positions where I rarely took time off and often worked late and on weekends. Most employed people get 20 days a year off, I've never given myself that much time off. If doing your best and working your hardest doesn't pay off that what else can I do?"

7kwynj,1,2017-12-19,Starting university senior year,FF2701,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7kwynj/starting_university_senior_year/,"Greetings and salutations, fellow humans. Hope you are all having great days and your lives are going well.

First, some info about me: I am a 21 years old, african descent, homosexual man. I live in Panama and I currently attend the Technological University of Panama (The best one in the country) and I'm majoring in Food Engineering (Basically, Chemical Engineering, but focused on foods). Being suffering from Major Depression (Severe level of gravity, according to the psychological tests) for 7 years since diagnose.

As the title says, I am going to start my senior year in March and, as you could probably guess, I am quite freaked out about this.

I want to ask for a loan to continue my studies abroad (whether it be a master's or another undergrad, remains to be determined). Besides studying, I would also like to stay in whatever country I go to. This is because, as I mentioned, I am gay and would one day like to get married, have a family, etc. and, sadly, Panama is very... conservative, to put it gently.

With all of that said, I have the following questions:

1) What countries would you recommend to study at? Preferibly, if you know of any countries with Co-Op careers (That means, study and work at the same time as part of the whole program).

2) In what countries would it be easier to get a job and a permanent residence? I know in any country that would be hard, but you get my point.

3) In order to graduate my current university, I have to make a ""graduation test"". This can be a scientific research thesis, an internship in a food industry or taking two post-grad classes for a semester either here or in another country. Which one would you recommend if I aspire to get a scholarship anywhere?

I think that's all. Any other advice, experiences or anything related, is truly welcomed. Also, if you have any further questions or clarification, I would gladly answer any doubts. 

So for now, thank you beforehand and hope you all keep having beautiful days. Bye"

I'm writing to find the way, how to justify my low GPA, since I'm planning to apply for jobs in Canada after graduation. Currently 3-rd year at decent University. CGPA closer to graduation will be approximately ~2.6-2.7. 


I'm really, really struggling with theoretical courses with proofs. My Transcript looking now like kevlar armour after weekly siege. 



However, I do have decent work-experience from a few European companies ( part-time distance work during nights, around 2 years) and work before University: QA stuff for local developing company in my hometown, for around year and half .


3 Internships with different again European companies and few personal projects in Analyzing commodities prices.



What is the best way to wrap-up my resume? I knew that if GPA &lt; 3.0, then better to avoid it, but what about work experience? 



Thanks in advance!"
7kx2sq,2,2017-12-19,What's my best option? Keep looking for a job locally or take an unpaid internship abroad?,nomadicode,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7kx2sq/whats_my_best_option_keep_looking_for_a_job/,"How valuable is a three-month internship and how much would it help in finding a real job afterwards?

After 20 years teaching English in Japan, I decided to make a career change last year and get into web dev. I've always liked to program in my personal time and I've made at least a couple dozen apps/sites/web apps over the years for myself, my students or the public - nothing special or overly complicated but they did what I wanted. Last year, I saw an opportunity with the high demand for web devs, so I quit ESL and completed the FCC Front End Dev Cert. After that, I moved back home to Toronto.

I sent out a bunch of resumes on Indeed but didn't get many calls and the few that did call/interview passed on me. I left the country for a few months and came back last month. Sent out more resumes with the same results as before.

I can't afford to keep going without income much longer, but with my career being ESL in Japan, there aren't a lot of good jobs that I can get easily in Toronto. If I stay here and keep looking for work, I'm going to need to get a crappy job doing whatever to pay the bills while I keep looking for an opening in web dev. This is going to leave me with very little time to learn code and look for a job.

Another option is that I've been offered an internship in the Philippines (3-4 months), and I'm wondering if doing that would help me significantly in getting a job quickly after coming back (or remote, as that would be ideal for me).

The internship is unpaid, but if it makes me a shoe-in for a job when I'm done, I don't care. My real question is simply, how big of an impact would doing the internship have on my job search?

TL;DR Looking for junior dev position. No formal experience but years of hobby programming and FCC Front End Cert. I haven't been getting many calls from employers in Toronto and I have an offer to do an internship in the Philippines for 3 or 4 months. I want to know if I should stay in Toronto and get a crappy job to pay the bills while I keep sending out resumes, or go do the internship and then come back to look for a job. How big a difference will having that internship on my resume make to my job search? Internship is unpaid but I don't care if it makes getting a job a lot easier when I come back.

EDIT: I know some people will say ""never work for free"", and generally speaking, I agree. However, this internship is not the usual case. I really don't believe he's trying to rip me off. At first, he offered to hire me at the local going rate (which is very low because it's a developing country, so it wouldn't make a huge difference to my bottom line anyway). It's only when it became apparent how much of a hassle (and expensive) getting the work visa would be that he changed it to ""internship"". In the few days that I was there, it was obvious that I'm getting more out of it than they are at the moment. And at the end of the day, what really matters to me is whether or not doing that internship (free or paid, doesn't matter) would help significantly in getting a real job afterwards.

EDIT2: If I do the internship, will the fact that it's in the Philippines make a difference to employers? Will they see the experience as less valuable for some reason?"
7kx4oe,13,2017-12-19,Did I make a big mistake?,Pablovansnogger,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7kx4oe/did_i_make_a_big_mistake/,"So I had two offers for the spring and it was kind of a  hard decision in the beginning.  But after considering them more, I choose the one I wanted and thought it would be stupid to turn it down. 

So when I’ve talked to friends and family about my decision, I thought they would be super happy and supportive of my choice, but they haven’t. I mean it’s not all negative and I’m sure the negative things hurt a lot more than the positive things help, but I’m pretty sure it’s around 40:60 for positive and negative respectively. 

All of this has made me start to regret my decision and feel like I made a mistake or something. Also I’m a junior EE who doesn’t entirely know what I want to specialize in. Here’s a detailed list of my pros and cons of each company. 

A big *cough “Southern” utility company
Co-op position 
Pro:
- pay is great
- free housing
- close to my college
- 95% they will give me a full time offer
- benefits are great
- don’t have to worry about finding a future internship 
- very stable company 
Con:
- would rather not commit to doing 3 rotations
- position is definitely electrical, but it’s in the nuclear industry 

NASA
Internship position 
Pro:
- prestige 
- dream of mine
- more relevant to what I want to do 
-work sounds really interesting and enjoyable 
Con:
- unpaid
- location sucks
- 0% in getting employed 
- commute is long
- move across country
- housing is not provided 
-burn bridge with other company 


So I went with NASA and have been getting a lot of negativity, especially since I came home from winter break. I can understand why they might think it was a stupid decision on the money alone, but they’ve been saying other comments too. Like “NASA isn’t what it used to be.” Or “The government has been talking about lowering the budget, NASA could disappear over night.” Or “ I know so many people who work for utility company and love it.”

And it’s just been getting me down. So I just wanted to ask, what do you think about my decision? What would you of done and why? Did I make a big mistake?"

Right now, I'm a junior majoring in Computer Information System. I'm around 2-3 months into my first internship and I'm learning some stuff. 

My parents (although are not in IT), has IT co workers and are pressuring me to decide whether to go to grad school. They said that all the IT people they know have masters, and that even if you don't want to work in managerial part of IT, it's still useful for moving around jobs and a leg up on your resume.

As of what I think? I have no fucking idea. I'm literally 1-2 months into my internship, barely scratching the surface of the field. Only classes relevant to my major I've taken are like programming and database management. 

The reason why he's asking me is due to some sort of financial reasons, he is willing to pay for it but he has to transfer some money to different accounts or something like that.

I'm not even sure if I would get into grad school. I have a 3.4 gpa at the moment (which I'm sure is dropping this semester). 

Can you guys please enlighten me on what should I do? Should I wait till I graduate and get a job? Or should I just go for it?

7kxwgd,1,2017-12-19,i am a MESS,dazed_and_dazed,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/7kxwgd/i_am_a_mess/,"Hello everyone,

This past semester has been an utter mess for me. Actually, I think the problem started when I joined college. Honestly speaking, I've always been a stellar student through high school. And I'm proud of my past academic success - it opened so many paths for me in terms of college options.

Upon joining college, however, things went **hella** downhill. Suddenly, I had tons of free time which I didn't know how to use effectively. I tried investing in planners but honestly, it just wasn't my thing. My grades first semester were quite average, nothing of too much concern. But by the time second semester came along, I was looking at a transcript with 2 C's - something that I frankly wasn't used to seeing.

With the release of final grades for this semester, I feel as if I have hit rock bottom. I earned my first D in a class, a math class (which is my best subject so that was real sad). And I honestly am still processing this fact. 

So many things are scaring me at this point. How can I improve my grades? How do I tell my parents about this? How can I emotionally get over this? Grades are much more important to me that I thought.

Also, I'm stuck in this weird mental limbo. I am a CS major (at a top school) and have managed to secure internships without really ever having to share my grades, largely because I have personal projects and have a decent understanding of data structures? lol...

It's hard for me to mentally...partition??...the importance of grades versus the importance of other aspects of life. I feel like I am beating myself up too much which isn't helping but at the same time...I deserve to beat myself up? I don't know..


tl;dr

As each semester goes on, my grades are getting much worse. As someone who takes grades extremely seriously, this is not mentally sitting well with me. I'm afraid to face my parents and I'm afraid of future semesters.

THANKs ;;

you might know me from my recent [acknowledgments](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7khhs8/class_of_2022_acknowledgments/) post, or my older post about [contacting a professor and AO](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6x7end/contacting_professor_at_top_choice/) at columbia. either way, i promised to make this post before the end of the week due to tons of requests about my stats/essays for columbia, and i definitely wanted to share as much as i could along with some tips for those applying RD as well!

first off, my stats:

&gt; * GPA: 4.0
* Rank: 2/320, Salutatorian
* ACT: 34C (36E, 36M, 35R, 29S)
* SAT II: USH - 760

I was already very academically qualified when it came time to apply to Columbia. Most people on this sub are okay in this field, and instead find trouble in terms of ECs/essays. In terms of this sub (and this sub only), I am basically an average Ivy League applicant. My scores/stats were definitely not enough to get me admitted. Everyone needs a ""thing"" (or a ""spike,"" if you'd like) and mine was politically oriented, with streaks of human rights. Here are some examples:

&gt; * Founder/President of Refugee Resettlement Org
* Internship with NYS government agency dealing with discrimination 
* Volunteer for Bernie Sanders campaign
* Writer for teen political newspaper
* Tutored refugee children
* President of NHS / Quiz Bowl Varsity Captain / Varsity Team Mathletes / Etc

I also put down some other general ECs (things I'd consider hobbies) like writing fiction in my spare time and self-studying languages. I was clearly very focused in a specific area, but I definitely didn't limit myself to only political ECs (as you can see above). Still, others have similar ECs and equally rigorous academic profiles, so what's the defining point? In my opinion, it's 100% the essays. Now that I have stats/ECs out of the way, I'd like to offer some tips on both the Common App and specifically the Columbia supplements. Unfortunately, I will most likely not be releasing these essays in full (or at least not until RD is over) since they're too personalized to even be useful to those reading this post, and posting them would basically be flexing at that point.

&gt; **Common App:**

I wrote my Common App about shaving my head. Depending on how you look at it, it's kind of a lame topic (and I was warned against using it several times), but I believed deeply in this essay. My entire activities list is very political and refugee-centered, so I didn't want to inundate the reader with an essay about my refugee parents. So, I wrote about my hair instead. I detailed the shaving of my head and how it symbolized letting go of my comfort zone, how I learned to take more risks, and how baldness became my ""superpower."" It was essentially an essay about my personality, which I recommend trying if you have a focus like I did and you want to highlight other parts of yourself. Truthfully, the essay was *very* much tailored to Columbia despite it being the general essay that gets sent to every college. I was trying to express my ability to thrive even in uncomfortable environments, which is the central idea of Columbia's interdisciplinary Core. I wrote about sampling both rap and poetry, trying all kinds of new languages, and infused a *lot* of humor into the essay. It was pretty fun to write since it was about a lighter topic like shaving my head, and I think it paid off in the end. 

My first lines: *I never thought I’d become a superhero. But now glancing at the mirror, I looked almost like Thor––that is, if Thor awkwardly wielded a puny razor rather than his mighty hammer.*

My last lines: *Each falling lock is no longer my kryptonite, but rather an opportunity to roll the dice, welcome the unknown, and confront every uncomfortable question that comes my way. Today I thrive in my “discomfort zone,” and it turns out this superpower is more valuable than any bobby-pin.*

My favorite part: *What’s so different about Shakespeare and Snoop Dogg? I delved into classics and maybe-not-so-classics, startled by foreign words like “fo-shizzle” and “forswear.” But this line between rap and poetry began to blur after sampling T.S. Eliot and 2Pac, and, before I knew it, I was spitting hip-hop verses and memorizing rhyming couplets alike.*

&gt; **Columbia's Word Prompts**

Columbia asks you to list words/phrases that describe your ideal college community. Basically, this is your chance to show them how much you love them. I've seen so many ways to approach this prompt that there's truly no wrong way to do it. You can list tons of words phrases, choose a few and explain them, or do something in between. Personally, I chose four words/phrases and expanded on each with a sentence or two. I think this approach is effective because it lets you express coherent ideas about Columbia and why you love them in your sentences. It also allows for a lot of specificity. 

One of my entries: *United by Classics: Ever since receiving a box full of classics from an alumna, I've been hooked. I’m excited to finally “step outside the box” and complete the interdisciplinary Core with like-minded students through Oresteia-related papercuts, debates over communism at 4AM, and endless Oedipus puns.*

&gt; **Columbia's List Prompts**

These prompts inspire a ton of confusion within applicants, mostly because they're intentionally vague. The same applies as above; you can either straight up list the books/movies/etc that you enjoyed, or you can list fewer while adding a sentence-long  explanation. I did the latter, and I thought it was really useful for conveying each part of my personality in the application. You're proving your ""fit"" here, so you want to choose your items carefully. In order to portray myself as a great fit for campus, I chose items in each category that stressed my major, revealed my interest in foreign/global entertainment, and emphasized my love for classic literature.

Example 1: *Stromae: He’s a French rapper who rhymes words like perruche and Christophe Colombus…what more could I want?*

Example 2: *Republic: Plato’s arguments pushed me out of my comfort zone while also providing me a rich source of Ancient Greek politics.*

Example 3: *The Crucible: To me, this play was about Puritan human rights violations––not witchcraft.*

&gt; **Why Columbia Prompt**

This essay was the hardest for me to write, and I went through so many edits and drafts before I finally just settled on the version that I have now. For this one, you need to be careful in choosing a topic that's both originally creative yet not too ""out there."" For example, the Core isn't the best topic since I'd bet more than half of the applicants write exclusively about it. AOs are likely tired of reading about that (along with how great Columbia's location is), so I decided to go a different route. I chose to talk about Columbia's simultaneous aura of community and individuality, and I did so through the statues on campus. I was *very* specific in this prompt, and I gave exact instances of what I was expecting myself to be doing when I got on campus. I think it's super important to be very raw and personal in this essay, even though I didn't do it as well as I could have. This is one of your only chances to prove to them that you've done a good amount of research on the school and that you have a good reason for wanting to attend other than the fact that you can look at the Empire State Building.

Example: *This dichotomy is what I value most about Columbia––the university fosters both the unified Thinker and the independent Pan inside me...*

&gt; **Why Major Prompt**

This was one of my favorite essays to write because of the creative direction I chose to take, and I truly believe that if you have fun writing your essays, they'll likely turn out good! In this one, I wrote about being a religious hybrid and how I've participated in both Muslim and Christian traditions as I've grown up. I stressed my open-mindedness and how that would prepare me for a major in human rights. I made this essay very personalized to my own previous experiences, and I focused an entire section on how I would contribute to Columbia. I also made a point of mentioning that my major was rare and Columbia was one of the few schools to offer it, which showed further research on the school.

My first lines: *You can’t tell I’m a hybrid at first glance. I don’t have slippery scales, twirling tails, or even flapping feathers to convince you. But what I do have, instead of odd mutations, is a vault of vivid memories.*

My last line: *While I might be a hybrid, nothing would give me greater joy than to roar like a Columbia Lion.*

&gt; **Additional Info**

To be honest, what I did here was a risky move and I worried about it for weeks. I essentially wrote an extra essay in my additional info section, and I personally don't recommend doing something like this. I could've annoyed my AO and potentially had my application frowned upon because it could've been regarded as an abuse of space. However, I'm still proud of this essay, and it's ironically one of my favorites! I wrote about my [synesthesia](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/synesthesia) and how that condition makes me perfect for a place like Columbia that stresses interdisciplinary studies. 

My first line: *It’s Friday morning, and I’m forest green.*

My favorite part: *I’ve often found myself struggling to explain why my best friend is a shade of pale pink...why Wednesdays appear in strange hues of burnt orange. But by bridging this sensory divide, synesthesia helps me experience the world as a living, breathing interdisciplinary creature. Columbia excites me for this exact reason––instead of confining myself to color, I’ll be able to merge Homeric literature with Newtonian physics to calculate Achilles’ velocity across the battlefield...*

My last line: *My school’s last fourteen applicants never became Columbia students, but I hope I’ll be lucky number fifteen this December, diving deep into the Columbia Blue.*

&gt; **Final Advice**

If I were to offer a single nugget of advice for you RD seniors (especially those applying to Columbia), I would tell you to be original, creative, and specific, and to proudly get a little weird in the things you write. Writing techniques are helpful as well, and adding flair can be awesome! My personal favorite techniques include alliteration and linking the beginning of an essay to its end. Specificity and originality are key. That's how you stand out, and I believe that's what helped me most. Well, both that and /u/admissionsmom's writing advice haha!

If anyone has any questions, drop them below and I'll answer as quickly as I can! :)

I don’t think she knew that the word she was looking for was ‘astronaut’, but she swore up and down that they were two different things anytime I brought it up. 

We had been friends since we were born, our mothers had been college roommates and we lived across the street from each other. We used to play together all the time, with her barbies and my monster trucks. We played this game that consisted of taping her dolls to the top of my trucks and then pushing them down the driveway to see which doll would fall off first. I don’t exactly remember what the objective of the game was, but then again, we were five years old, so there probably wasn’t one. 

We remained friends through middle school and high school. But not college. Linda didn’t go to college, didn’t even apply. 

“I thought you wanted to be a spacewalker. Don’t you need a degree for that?” I had asked her. 


We were in my room, and she was helping me pack before I left for college in two days.


“That was when I was a child. I don’t want to be anything anymore,” She had replied, folding a blue blanket and putting it into a box. 


“Why is that?” I asked,


“When you’re a child, you think you can do anything. When you get older, you realize you can’t do anything,” she replied.


That was Linda for you, profound. 


I didn’t say anything after that. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Six and a half years and a master's degree later, there I was, back in my old driveway. I stared at the old windows and the trees in the front yard. I couldn’t believe that I was actually back here. But, here I was, back to help my sister take care of her kids because her dirtbag husband left her for some twenty-year-old intern. 


“Uncle Jesse! Uncle Jesse’s here mom!” My three-year-old nephew Carson came running straight at me and wrapped his arms around my legs.


I laughed and looked up to see Nara walking into the room.

She looked older. Way older than twenty-nine. I didn’t tell her that of course. She helped me get my stuff into the guest room, and by the time we were done, her youngest, Piper, was already awake and crying to be fed. Nara and I didn’t really speak much, and I guess it was partly because there wasn’t much to speak of. We were eating dinner when I finally decided to say something.


“So how’s Linda?” I asked.


Nara stopped wiping Carson's mouth and looked up at me.


“She’s around here. Somewhere,” She replied. 


“Does she still live across the street?’  I asked.


“She does. She’s never there though,” Nara replied.


“Why not?”


“Work,”


“Work?” I repeated,


“Work,” Nara said.


“Well, where does she work?” I asked.


“Corner of Southern and Main,”


“The bar?” I asked.


Nara picked Carson up off of his high chair and set him down on the ground.


“Something like that,” 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

I drove to the corner of Southern and Main the next afternoon and no one was there. So, I went into the bar. It was scarily full on a Thursday afternoon. I walked up the bar and took an empty bar stool. The bartender was a woman, but it wasn’t Linda. 


“What can I get for you?” She asked me with a thick Southern accent. 


“I’m actually looking for someone, uh, Linda Marquis?” I asked.


The bartender laughed. Well, crackled is more like it. She threw her head back and laughed in such an exaggerated way. It reminded me of the hyenas from The Lion King. 


“Oh honey, you’re three hours too early and a few dollars short,”


With that, she walked away.

I left the bar after that and wandered around town, trying to kill three hours. After they had passed, I made my way back to the bar. As I was pulling into the parking lot, I saw a woman standing on the side of the street. She was wearing almost nothing, regardless of the harsh November air. As I got closer I recognized who it was. It was Linda.

I drove until my car came to a stop right in front of her and I rolled my window down. Linda waltzed over to my car and leaned in.


“What’ll it be tonight?” She asked in a soft voice.


“Linda?” I asked. 


Her bright blue eyes widened in shock.


“Jesse? What the fuck are you doing here?” She asked.


“I could ask you the same thing,” I replied.


“I’m looking for sex, though you’d be able to figure that one out by yourself,” She said, smiling at me.


“I’ve been looking for you,” I said.


“Well, I’m afraid I’m a little busy right now, trying to make some bank,” She replied, pulling away from my car.


“Wait! I’ll buy you dinner,” I said.


Linda didn’t even blink. She just opened my car door and jumped in. The smell of expensive perfume filled my car. Linda turned to look at me as I pulled away from the bar.


“You better not take me to McDonald’s. I’m a classy lady,” She said.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

The way that Linda inhaled her dinner made me think that she probably hadn’t had a decent meal in a while. I glanced around the nearly empty diner for a few seconds before I gathered up the balls to say what I wanted to say.


“When Nara said you were working on the corner of Southern and Main I didn’t think she meant that you were literally working on the corner,” I said.


“I didn’t think you were, you know,”


“A whore?” She asked.


I shook my head violently.


“No, that isn’t what I was going to say,” I stammered.


“It’s fine, everyone says it. ‘Linda The Whore’,” 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

I drove past that corner every day. Sometimes I’d see Linda there up to four times a week. Sometimes two. Other times I’d see her getting into a white Sedan or a red pickup. One time I saw her get on a motorcycle. 

She waved to me every time she saw me. About two weeks later, I asked her if she wanted to get a drink with me. She agreed and we walked back into the bar. 


“Why do you do this? Your job, I mean,” I asked her.


Linda looked me dead in the eyes and said, “I like sex”, before taking a shot of vodka. 

That night when I came home, my sister stood in the doorway of the bathroom while I brushed my teeth.


“Marge says she’s seen you hanging out with Linda,” She said.


“Yeah,” I replied.


“Are you sleeping with her?”


“I’m gay, Nara,” 


“I’m just asking, you could have changed your mind,” Nara replied.


“I spent the majority of my life pretending to like girls. There’s no way I’m going back ever again,” I replied as I pushed past her.


But she grabbed my arm.


“You could catch something from her you know,”


“Why? Cause she’s a whore?” I asked.


Nara didn’t say anything and I knew it was because I took the words right out of her mouth.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

I kept hanging out with Lina every week. We would get some drinks, get dinner, go for a walk, whatever. But it was nice to have my childhood friend back. Everywhere we went, people gave us dirty looks. Well, maybe they were only giving them to Linda, but she didn’t seem to mind.


“Jack the Ripper is gonna kill me, ya know,”


She was drunk, and she always said things like this when she was drunk. So I didn’t reply.


“You don’t believe me, Jesse,” A statement, not a question.


I didn’t reply.


“You just wait and see. I know you think I’m crazy, but I’m not. I can see things. I can see how people are going to die,” She slurred.


“Oh yeah? How am I going to die?” I asked. 


Linda took my hands in her clammy ones and stared into my eyes.


“Suicide,” She said.


I raised my eyebrow.


“Why would I commit suicide?” I asked.


Linda took a shot of vodka.


“Pain,” she replied.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

I didn’t hear from Linda for the next week. Then, she was the talk of the town. Linda was dead. It was all over the news and they were calling it a Jack the Ripper copycat. I couldn’t believe my ears. So, I went back to the bar to drown my sorrows in tequila. 


“Did you hear about that whore?” I hear a guy ask from across the bar.


“Jack’s working the case, said they think she might have been raped too. Can you believe that? What a load of bullshit. I told him they were wasting their time. You can’t rape a whore,” He crackled.

I remember beating him to a pulp in the alley about an hour later. The next morning, I learned that his name was Andrew and that he was dead. I killed him. But I didn’t care. I snuck into Linda’s house and snooped around until I found a red journal in her kitchen. I opened it up to the first page.

Me- December 4th. Jack the Ripper.


Andrew C.- December 5th. Jesse.


I couldn’t believe this. How the hell did she know? I kept flipping through the pages until I found my name.


Jesse O.- March 17th. Suicide (gun). 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

About a week ago, on March 10th, Carson, Piper, and my sister died. My sister’s ex-husband Carlos broke into the house while I was at the bar one night and shot them all to death and then shot himself. After the initial shock passed, I remembered Linda’s journal and I scanned through the pages and sure enough, there they were.


Nara O.- March 10th. Carlos.


Carson O.- March 10th. Carlos.


Piper O.- March 10th. Carlos.


There was no denying it. Linda was right. She predicted more than half the towns deaths. Including mine, because I sit here, with this gun in my hand and this pain in my heart. And I’m going to die tonight, on March 17th.

I'm 26 going on 27 with a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from a medium-sized university in western West Virginia.  I moved to Las Vegas to go to graduate school doing computational chemistry, but became severely burnt out by the end of the first year and left the program.  I moved back east for a few months, and then returned to Vegas, where I teach chemistry part-time and wait tables on the side.  The shoestring budget has become my only mistress.

Unfortunately, I don't look particularly good on a resume.  I did very well in Linear Algebra and Numerical Analysis/Linear Algebra, but barely passed statistics.  I have no internship or relevant work experience, and my undergraduate research isn't particularly applicable outside of chemistry.

I'm fluent in Python, have learned quite a bit about Ruby on the side, and am in the process of learning SQL.  I'm more interested in operations research/logistics and whatnot at this point than science, but I'm having trouble finding anything like that which doesn't demand an advanced degree or several years experience.  Cryptography is also intriguing.  I guess I'm not really sure where to turn.  I'm growing a little bit despondent.  Any advice?"

I just finished the first semester of my sophomore year. I had no programming experience prior to college, took CS 101 spring freshman year, liked it, and decided to be a CS major. Fast forward to now, this semester didn't go too well. Didn't get a good grade in data structures (didn't fail), which as I understand is a huge fundamental CS class, and my CS and overall GPA are both not looking great. Not able to retake data structures next semester. I'm gonna have to do pretty damn well over the next two and a half years to bring my GPA up and the classes only get harder. 

I've applied to probably ~40 internships, heard back from none. I know it's a crapshoot, but I have jack shit to put on my resume that is CS related and I can't help but feel way behind the curve. I only know Java and C++ at this point, don't have any side projects. All my experience comes from schoolwork. My roommate is also a sophomore CS major and already had a job in our school's CS department the summer after freshman year, has another part-time job lined up for next semester and is likely going to get at least a decent internship next summer. 

I really want to be successful in this field but I'm honestly questioning if I have what it takes to do CS, and if I picked the wrong major entirely. My confidence right now is zero. I have no idea what I'm going to do next summer. I feel like I missed the memo somewhere along the line regarding how to start preparing for an actual career. What can I do to gain an edge? How can I beef up my resume when I have zero industry experience? What's your honest assessment of where I stand right now? 

TL;DR GPA not great, shit resume, no internship prospects, crippling anxiety about my future"

One of my co-workers works out of an American branch and we're paired up on the same project. Asking for advice here because I have no idea what's the American way of handling this (our manager is also from the U.S.); I know there are cultural differences between IE and US so I don't want to screw this up.

Background: 
This co-worker (let's call him Bob) is a senior developer and has been in the industry for 27 years according to his LinkedIn. I have a combined experience of around 5 years, 2 of which I spent at this company. The problem is Bob does absolutely crappy work. My interns do better work than Bob. Because of his age and seniority, nobody checks Bob's work, so he's free to break stuff left and right and myself (or the interns) are left to fix what we can and hope customers don't notice what we can't get to in time. There's a trail of internal tickets spanning about 5 releases at this point documenting nothing but fixes of Bob's mistakes.

I raised this problem with our former manager last year (hey Steve, Bob's breaking stuff, what can we do?) Steve's attitude was pretty dismissive of the whole thing; his excuse was that Bob's ""not that attentive to details"" but has strong background knowledge and lots of relevant experience so we must find a way to work together. Steve suggested that Bob and I would officially peer review each other's work from there on out, which I did for a couple releases, but he kept making the same damn mistakes I told him not to and went on to break more stuff in new and creative ways I hadn't even thought possible. One night I was stuck fixing one of his screw-ups until 11 p.m. This seriously made me question my life choices.

One time - when he did something he shouldn't have to which broke one of my commits and I confronted him about it - I told Steve. Steve got visibly upset but again rehashed the ""ah he's not attentive to details"" excuse, and then he told me to go talk to Bob directly. Bob's first reaction was ""no, I don't remember that."" I showed him enough proof and he changed the tune to ""oh, I was rushed, sorry, won't do it again"". A couple weeks later, he did it again. 

This year we got a new manager (let's call her Tonya). I know her and Bob are friends and alumni of the same university. She speaks very highly of him and apparently ""gives him as an example whenever new people join the team"" (when she told me that, it was all I could do to keep a straight face). Meanwhile I've been fixing Bob's mistakes for two years now and, were I a manager, he wouldn't even be working here anymore.

Problem: 
We're coming up to a new release and, Bob being Bob, he broke just enough small bits here and there that this is turning into more than I can fix alone. I'm not a manager so I don't have the authority to tell Bob to do his job properly. Our new manager is either blind or ignores his mistakes on purpose (plus, they're friends).

So how do I go about bringing up this issue with my manager without looking like an asshole? I don't want to be the person who picks on the nice old man (because Bob _is_ nice, as a person, just a terrible, terrible dev), but I also don't want to be stuck doing the work of two people, and Bob's years away from retirement.

(Holy cow, this turned out to be _much_ longer than I intended. Sorry lads.) "

After that party, nothing happened. Not for at least 6 months. Then Jake came back from Japan.

Honestly, by that time, I’d almost forgotten about what happened. I know that’s weird, but it was really the only way to cope with it. I tried working through it, I tried talking about it, but the more I thought about it, the less sense it made. My first thought was the same as Matt’s— I thought I was crazy— but as I talked to other people who had been there, they all said the same thing; nobody could remember anything, and nobody wanted to talk about it. So I had to accept that either it was some type of group hallucination or else it was real; either way, I couldn’t make sense of it, so I guess I eventually just stopped trying.

So when Jake got back, it was almost as if it had never happened. Matt and I picked him up from the airport and took him out to lunch. We picked up right where we left off— ok maybe a night or two before we left off— laughing and teasing him. Matt and I told him not to worry, that we’d been recording all the anime we could since he’d left, just so he wouldn’t miss Japan too much. Jake hates animation.

We filled him in on our lives first. Nothing like Japan, but I’d moved my way up to a full-time job from my internship; Matt had moved in with me after selling his contract— for rather obvious reasons— and had recently started dating someone. None of that compared to the stories Jake broke out, and we spent the better part of the morning sitting in our local café and listening to story after story, each one topping the last. 

It honestly sounded like he’d had a blast, but I started to notice something odd as he was talking. Every once in a while, he would pause, like he was trying to remember what to say. He covered it each time— he would take a sip of water, clear his throat, sometimes just go off on a side tangent— but he couldn’t disguise the look on his face. It would only sit there for a moment— just a flash before he would cover it with one of his award-winning smiles— but once I caught on it was unmistakable. He looked distant and flustered, almost sorrowful, but then the corners of his mouth would jolt upwards and he continued on with the story, more exuberant than before. I met Matts eyes in a quick glance, that was all it took to know I wasn’t the only one to have seen it.

It took me a minute to realize, but it wasn’t the first time I’d seen that look. It wasn’t the first time I’d seen it on Jake. It was the same look he’d had that night. Suddenly, I was there again. For the first time in months, it all came back; the fear, the confusion, and, in the middle of it all, Jake. I could see him clearly, not a witness to some horrible event, but a desperate part of it— hopeless to control the panicked crowd. 

I hadn’t talked to him about it since I left that day, and I decided to approach him about it. Not right then, I wouldn’t spoil the day. Since he was in town again I could do it later, and now that some time had passed I might be able to get something else out of him. I let it go for the moment, reabsorbing myself in the conversation. But it sat there in the back of my mind.

We left at around noon, but for Jake, it was like 4 in the morning. He’d insisted on staying, but by then the jet lag was obviously taking its toll on him. Matt drove. Jake was staying with his grandma for just a few days before his new place was empty and he could move in. It was maybe a twenty-minute drive to her house, but he fell asleep in less than ten. I could see him slumped over in the passenger seat. He was snoring softly and drool was making its way steadily down his cheek. He looked like he’d…

It was dark. My first thought was that I must’ve fallen asleep, but that made no sense; there was no way I'd slept that long,  and Matt and Jake were still there. The car slowed almost instantly as Matt looked around wildly. Jake wasn’t asleep anymore, but he was calm; I met his gaze in the rearview mirror, and he had that look again. That’s when it hit me. I swore. 

Matt still hadn’t caught on. He pulled the car over to the side of the road, “what the… what’s going on? WHAT JUST HAPPENED?” he was panicking, I ignored him, looking for the first time outside the window at our surroundings. It was nowhere I recognized, heck, it didn’t look like it was anywhere *near* somewhere I would recognize. It looked like a little two-lane highway through the middle of nowhere. There were clumps of trees scattered about, but for the most part, it was just fields; fields as far as the eye could see. the only lights I could see were the stars overhead— remarkably bright without the lights of the city to obscure them.

Matt didn’t have the patience to wait for me to look around. He turned and repeated his question through gritted teeth.  “Guys? What. Is going. On?”

Jake turned towards the window, a small frustrated sigh emanating from his nostrils, but he made no response. “Jake?” I pushed. Still nothing. “Jake?” I repeated, my voice harsher.

When he finally responded, his words were quiet. “I never meant for you to get involved.”

Matt stared at me, “Dallin what’s he talking about?”

My gaze didn’t drift from Jake. “Remember that night? The night at the party?” Realization dawned on Matt and his face paled.

“Oh... yeah. So… so that wasn’t— I mean… that actually…” I nodded. He was like me; he’d let himself forget.

I turned back to Jake. “Jake, I think you owe us an explanation.”

He didn’t respond immediately. “The less you know the better. I don’t want to involve you any more than you already are.”

I reached forwards and clenched his shoulder. “we’re involved. Now, you are going to tell us what’s going on.”

“I don’t know what’s going on… I…”

I was getting fed up. “Yeah, of course you don’t. Look this only happens around you, now you expect us to believe you don’t know anything about…”

“I DON’T!” he roared. The car grew silent. “How did we get here?” he asked accusingly.

That caught me off guard. “I don’t know, but you…”

“and what happened that night at the party?”

I tried to come up with another reply, “I— I don’t know, that’s why…”

“Then how do you expect me to know what’s going on? That’s what it does! It makes you forget everything! How am I supposed to know anything about something like that?” he was angry, but he sounded more frustrated with himself than with us. He did have a fair point.

“Ok.” I relented. “I just… Ok.” 

Then we kinda just sat there for a minute. None of us were really sure what to do. Eventually, we turned back to the task at hand: getting home.

Between the three of us, we had no cell service, no idea where we were, and almost no gas; the tank was just under a quarter full. We decided to drive back the way we came. We figured that we must have come from somewhere, so if we retraced our steps we’d get back there. Only problem being that we had no idea what those steps were. At the very least we could try to find anything. A house, a town, just… anything.

We drove in silence for a bit; the silence was broken by Jake. “the first time it happened it was the middle of the day.” it was almost as if he was talking to himself, he didn’t look at us or anything; he just stared out the window. I perked up in the back seat, and I saw Matt doing the same in the front. “I was walking through a park. Next thing I know I’m climbing out from behind a bench with sweaty hands; everyone else was doing the same.

“most people just shook it off, they acted like nothing happened. I don’t blame them; if I hadn’t been watching everyone else, I would have thought it was some problem with me. But when I saw that the same thing had happened to everyone, I knew something was up; So I started asking people.”

His story was interrupted by Matt. “did anyone say anything?”

“No. Nobody wanted to talk about it, but I could see it in their eyes. So I started investigating: Hanging out in the park for hours at a time, retracing my steps, reading up on the paranormal. It wasn’t scary then, just strange. I didn’t find anything. But then it happened again, not in the park, it was…” he trailed off. “honestly, I can’t even remember when the second time was. But there was a second, then a third. The more I looked, the more it happened; It just made me more interested, but then it started going downhill.”

“what do you mean?” I questioned. 

“I mean it wasn’t so innocent anymore. I would come out of it in a panic, or running away, or with scratches on my arm. It started happening more and more at less convenient times, and it started affecting other people.”

“Like at the party?” Matt asked.

He nodded. “yeah, like at the party. But the party was the first time anyone has… that anyone…”

“Got hurt?” I offered.

He nodded, as if afraid to say the words aloud. “I tried to stop it,” he said, “tried to forget about it, but it just kept happening. That’s why I went to Japan; I thought it might stop.”

Matt was the one to finally speak what we both wondered. “It didn’t do it?”

Jake shook his head. 

Just then we came around a patch of trees and we saw a house. It was dark, and it looked old— a run down two story with a barn out back— we were just about on empty though, so we pulled into the driveway. We passed an old car on the way in, but saw no other signs of life.

I went straight up to the door and knocked. Matt ran around to the side of the house to see if he could find any sign of life. Nothing happened so I knocked again. No answer. Matt reappeared and beckoned us around. 

When I rounded the corner he led me to a boarded up window. I peeked through a crack and saw a totally empty room. Nothing but years worth of dust and an old wardrobe.

“Looks like no one’s home,” Matt said, stating the obvious.

Jake didn’t even stop to look, he marched straight past us to the barn. “Where are you going?” I called after him.

“Lets at least see if we can find an old gas can”

I paused. “Isn’t that like… stealing?”

He turned to face me, walking backward with arms spread wide. “From who? And unless you want to walk back I don’t see a whole lot of other options.”

I relented and followed. He turned and pulled open the barn door. A furious scream echoed from the black space of the barn, quickly followed by Jakes scream of pain as a girl leaped from behind the door and plunged something into his chest.

I froze as she turned and sprinted past me. I rushed to Jake as I heard a car door slam and an engine rev. He’d crumpled, and lay on his side, gasping for breath. A screwdriver protruded from his shoulder. My hand went straight to my mouth as I stood there, helpless, watching my friend bleed out.

It was Matt who jumped into action. He came up behind me and pulled his shirt over his head. He knelt down at Matt’s side and bunched the shirt around the screwdriver, pressing down. 

I felt terrible for not helping. I just didn’t have a clue what to do. I’d taken a first aid course once, but I couldn’t remember a thing. “Should we pull the screwdriver out?” I suggested. 

Matt didn’t even glance at me. “No,” he commanded, “go use the rest of the gas. Drive down the road and see if you can find a signal.” 

I got the feeling he was getting me out of the way more than anything, but I couldn’t argue, so I ran back towards the front of the house. Just as I was pulling open the car door. I was bathed in the bright glow of headlights as a car pulled into the drive. They blinded me, and I covered my eyes as the car skidded to a halt and the door flung open.

It was the girl, the one who had stabbed Jake. For the first time, I got a good look at her. she wore a grey hoodie and had her dreadlocks pulled back into a ponytail. Her skin looked a deep caramel color, but right then, her face was pale. I backed up, frantically searching for a weapon. 

“Wait,” she called, “I’m here to help.”

Those were the last words I expected to hear coming from her mouth, but she continued. “we need to get your friend to a hospital.”

I didn’t believe her; it made no sense. But right then my friend was lying on the ground bleeding to death. I didn’t have a lot of options. “Fine,” I said, and she followed me around back.

I spent the drive in her back seat with Jake’s head propped up in my lap, and Jake’s blood pooling around my legs. Most of it had crusted dry by then, but I still had to burn the pants. I thought about what Jake had said earlier. Nobody had gotten hurt until the party. How I wish my own experience was more like his.

I asked the girl why she decided to come back and help us. She was quiet for a while, but she responded. 

“This will sound crazy,” she said, “but I was driving away, and that’s when I realized: I could remember you.”"

It was in the evening which was a new experience for me. I stress out when I'm under pressure, and I don't do great at technical interviews. When I'm given time to think and research I can solve algorithmic problems, but I don't have them or different sorting methods memorized really.

I got asked a fairly basic question, and in typical high anxiety me fashion, I had a hard time coming up with a solution but I got one. And it was o(n^2). Not good. Had to come up with an improved solution... And my mind went blank. Like, completely and totally black. As if I'd never written a program, a script, or a single line of code ever before. I couldn't even imagine another solution in that 20-30 seconds that felt like forever. We mercifully moved on.

This has been the story of my life applying for jobs like this. I've gotten a few internships and a couple testing jobs, but I choke when going for harder positions. Since the interview last night I've come up with the solution to the problem making it o(n), but now doesn't matter. The phone call mattered. The interview mattered, and I choked.

I know choking like that is a symptom of being under prepared and not knowing the material well enough. I know that's on me, and don't worry, I'll be beating myself up for it for weeks to come until the next interview.

But what I wanna know is, what's it like not choking at these interviews? Do they keep asking questions until you're stumped? Do you know all the algorithms and sorting methods by heart and nail the typical question? Do they look at your first answer and say ""that's great! Let's move on since you clearly know your shit!""? 

I just wanna know/hear what that experience is like, not succumbing to internal pressure/anxiety/early onset imposter syndrome/etc. "

I'm still in school so I only work 20-24 hours a week (and that's the max I can work considering I am a part-time contractor in the eyes of HR). I've been working here since May, started as a Summer Intern then transitioned to part-time during the school year.

This problem has been happening since I started, but I didn't really think much of it as an intern because my manager phrased giving away my projects to other team members as ""collaboration."" 

But a few months ago, I worked on a project extremely hard and it went no where due to requirements reasons unrelated to the quality of my work. Disregarding that, recently that project was re-defined and given to another co-worker. I didn't think much of it a few weeks ago because I thought it was going to be a different project, not the exact same one. So tl;dr this other person asks for my work a few months ago and I give them the link thinking they were just going to use it as a starting off point for a complete re-work. Turns out they spent 2 weeks just copying and pasting my work and then claiming it as theirs. And my manager is oblivious to the fact that it was my work and hasn't acknowledged that they assigned that exact same project to me months ago - and in fact this new project is entirely my work.

This isn't the first time this has happened either, almost all of my projects have been given to other team members to ""collaborate on"" under the reasoning that ""I am only here part-time"". These projects do not have hard deadlines, they do not have time-limits. And I always did them in a timely manner and did my best work on them. I have the same skills as my other team members to complete the same work and I am going to be graduating with the same degree as all of them in May...

I want to bring up to my manager that I am unhappy that my projects keep being taken away from me and given to other people - and I am very unhappy that I was not given credit for the project I worked on a few months ago. Does anyone have any advice on how I can do this professionally and not seem whiny? I do like the work I am doing here (when I have work), so quitting isn't really an option right now.

I was fortunate to be accepted at Sloan ($40K), Booth ($60K) and CBS ($100K). I am currently in an internal strategy and development role at a large F100 company looking to switch into a large tech company for strategy or into MBB consulting. Sloan was always my top choice with its reputation in tech but Booth and CBS are both fairly strong in that as well. The money offered is making me lean towards Booth and now CBS. I have visited all three and really liked all three. Here is my thought process so far:


**Booth:**


*Pros:* 


-Highest ranked and on the rise (worth $40K over CBS?)


-Strong in tech (Amazon is a big feeder) and MBB consulting


-Nice facilities


-Lowest COL


*Cons:*


-Grew up in Chicago, never liked Hyde Park or its lack of connection to downtown (no El stations, only slow bus and commuter Metra outside of campus)


-Worried location will limit me


-Seems like reputation internationally not as strong as the other two



**CBS**


*Pros:*


-Biggest fellowship by far, wouldn't need to take out loans. Also offers need-based scholarships (not sure if I will get any though)


-Location provides opportunity for part-time internships


-Strong in MBB consulting (though heard they include sponsored in employment reports but do Sloan and Booth not?)


-Very strong international reputation


*Cons:*


-Lowest ranked, worried reputation isn't as strong as the other two. This is my biggest concern about CBS


-Poor facilities


-High COL


-Weakest in tech of the three? (Sends the fewest to large tech companies compared to the other two)



**Sloan:**


*Pros:*


-Very strong in tech (it's MIT! Has that wow factor)


-I loved the campus and city


-Tight knit community


*Cons:*


-Scholarship isn't a lot, would have to take out loans


-Seems like weakest in consulting


-Smallest alumni base

The first two of those years were comprised of self-teaching I eventually wanted to work towards a Masters degree in CS, although my Bachelors is in English. I've spent the past year taking all the freshman and sophomore level classes which I need for prerequisites to join the program. So far I've got a 4.0 and everything has been pretty easy since I taught most of the content to myself the first two years of self-study. However, I'm really putting my life on hold going to school and trying and land an internship or a job as a jr. developer. Its driving me nuts. No one seems to want to give me a chance. I've applied to dozens of jobs and only landed one interview and it was for a role as a Data/SQL Analyst, so not even a development role.

So, this is going to sound strange, but I'm hoping to get someone's input about me going to a bootcamp given the circumstances.  I know probably 95% of everything they will teach me at a bootcamp. This is a pro and a con at the same time. On the con side, I wont learn much as far as technical skills go.  On the pro side, I think I could really stand out from most of my peers at a bootcamp since I wont be starting from square one like them, which could increase the probability of me getting a decent position.

Whether you pounded out Leetcode or dolled out resume advice, whether you love or despise the Big 4, you made a difference in my career and that of many others.

I'm considering applying for the OMSCS, specialization in ML.

I'm 23 years old and just got my Masters of Science in bioengineering (graduated Summa Cum Laude (&gt;875/1000, 95 percentile) at Ghent University (top 100 worldwide for sciences).

The program is quite heavy on mathematics (linear algebra, multivariate calcules, probability, statistics), although no discrete mathematics. Furthermore, I took some math-intensive graduate courses such as control engineering (linear algebra, LaPlace transformations) and high-dimensional statistics (SVD, ...).

I took some computer sciences related electives. A basic programming course in MATLAB, a course relating to optimization algorithms, a course on numerical solutions for (partial) differential equations and a course on system modelling.

I wrote my master's thesis on computational modelling of interactions between microorganisms. A paper derived from my thesis is currently under review in Physical Reviews E.

I have some working experience regarding programming. I did a 2 month internship where I modelled some industrial plants, and did some data analysis on sensor data. Since 1 month, I'm working at a wastewater treatment plant, where I do data analysis and CFD modelling.

I'm fluent in python and MATLAB, and I'm currently learning Java. To fill the gaps in my knowledge, I took some courses on Coursera (I have the certificates). I completed the Algorithms and Datastructures specialization of UCSD, the Machine Learning course of Andrew Ng and the Deep Learning specialization of Andrew Ng. I'm currently going through the Discrete Mathematics specialization of UCSD. I'm considering to take an OS course.

I'm fluent in English and a Belgian resident.

Do I have a reasonable chance to enter the program? Are there some things I can do to improve my chances?

Thanks in advance"

Spent last 8 months as Application Security intern. This is my very first CompTia exam ever. I took this cert because I want to standout from my other friends when I graduate and hopefully attract more jobs.



Came 45 mins early to the location and sat at nearby coffee shop reviewing material, especially Crypto (I hate Crypto!). With 15 mins left on the clock, registered myself and started the exam.

Everything went okay for the first ten questions or so and after that almost everything looked like Crypto related. I was almost 100% sure that I will fail the test. Last 20 questions are related to application security/attacks, my favorite topic. Gain a little bit moral boost because of that. Finished the whole exam with 30 mins left, decided to review all the questions, my eyes were opened on this 2nd run. Changed answers in many questions, this time more confident with my answer. Submit the test, do the survey, and saw my score, 803. Almost jump out of my chair because I thought I will probably get around 600 or so.



From Reddit suggestion to other people (Thank you guys!), I purchased Gibson books and practice test on Kindle because I never really dedicated any time for study. I read the book on the subway in the past 2 months. I watched most of Prof Messer videos and read his PDF material. Purchased CertMaster too but dropped it from my study because it felt too complicated. I also tried tons of free/paid practice exams.



My suggestion for future test taker are get Gibson books and study each topics deeper and try as many practice exam as you can. This exam want you to understand the topics not just ""Port 22 is SSH, SCP, and SFTP"". Good luck!

I'm not sure if I am just ranting, seeking advice or perspective, or maybe just wanting to write it all out. 

We're both 33.  I'm from Australia, and she's from Israel.  We're currently based in the Netherlands.  Neither of us love it here. 

I've been lucky.  I was a career changer, started a company whilst I was on my WHV which led to enough growth that I was able to secure a self-employed visa (not a fun process).  I'm in an interesting position, I've got some good opportunities in my new career... but as I said, I am not entirely in love with the country and I don't see it so much as 'the rest of my life.'

She, on the other hand, is just finishing up her studies in physiotherapy and actively dislikes living here. Recent legislative changes means that she's unable to practice in the country without speaking the language. 

She's homesick and wants to go home.  I would follow her, but Israel is a tricky place and I'm suspecting it's going to be pretty hard to find work there as a foreigner.  Beyond that, I've also got an issue with the idea of raising kids there - I don't want my kids to be exposed to war, conflict and definitely don't want them joining the army!

One option is of course to return to Australia. It's safe, a nice place and the economy is pretty good.  I'm not opposed to this and it's not too difficult a choice for me but for her she's very hesitant about it. She's never been to the country before, and it's so far away that it means a quick visit is just not possible and with her current schedule of internships and graduations she won't have time to do so until November next year - which is when we will really have to make a decision about what happens next. 

She's keen on starting her career, a family, and a home, given our ages.  So for her, temporary moves are a hard sell... for her, it seems like she's being forced to decide on Australia forever a year in advance, and without having been to the country. 

It's crazy. Writing it out makes it seem simple (?) but it's causing a lot of stress now. As sappy as it sounds I'm convinced I've found the girl I want, but real life seems to disagree.

Fast forward to now, we have been working with an intern that just recieved a job offer in the same situation I was (no degree, finishing part time) for 10k more than what I am CURRENTLY making.

I'm pretty upset and unsure how to move forward with this. Should I continue at my current rate without raising an issue? 

Would it be bad form to mention that I know my peer got offered more? 

Basically I'm looking for some feedback whether the company is just trying to screw me, doesn't value my contributions (despite being the go to source of information on my team) or they simply haven't put these pieces together and would happily pay me more. Should I bring this up right away? Or just keep my mouth shut and build work experience and seek bigger salaries after I graduate?

I won't lie I have a very solid situation, however, seeing a peer with the same credentials and FAR less experience getting paid more is really causing me a great deal of distrust in my company. I don't really want to threaten or move on unless a much better opportunity came up. However, I'm reaching a level of frustration where I wouldn't be totally against leaving and finishing my degree quickly then finding a new opportunity.

7l5ueb,3,2017-12-20,Am I expecting too much?,95tymes,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7l5ueb/am_i_expecting_too_much/,"Hey everyone, I’d like your input on my expectations. 

I am 22, I have a bachelors degree in network infrastructure, I also have my CCNA R&amp;S.

Over the summer was my last semester in school and I took an internship at a local ISP as an IP network technician which paid $15/hr. It was fantastic and I loved it. to do the internship I quit my job as a surveillance officer for a casino where I made $24/hr. This was kind of a rough thing for me to do but I knew that experience in the field was worth it. During  that time my boss suggested I take the CCNA exam and I managed to study and pass that also. 

After that I managed to be a contractor for a company helping them relocate their data center thanks to my old boss. During that time I had more experience with networking, I set up their new vSphere environment and did windows/sql administration(all of which I had learned and dealt with during my college education). 

Since then I have been looking for a new hopefully permanent position. I have applied to several places for positions including junior network administrators to network technicians. I have received emails in response stating that I am under qualified.  

After I had about four of those emails I started applying for help desk positions. I have interviewed with 3 so far and all of them have called back and told me I’m overqualified, but are willing to hire me at $15/hr. 

I know I took a career change but I thought I was worth more than $15 per hour with my degree/cert. 

Where do I go from here?"
7l660c,3,2017-12-20,Considering getting GED. How would this affect college admissions?,ImaLearnSomeBigWords,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7l660c/considering_getting_ged_how_would_this_affect/,"Hi this is my first post here, after lurking for a bit under a different account.

**I'm currently a high school sophomore. I've made plans to graduate a year early, approved by my school. So for sake of college, I'm kinda a junior and will graduate in 2019.**

**I've been going to an online school for 4 or 5 years. While that does provide me with more autonomy, leaves me dead in the water for social opportunities. The latter is the only significant negative of it, but it's a pretty big one. I tried going to a physical high school but it was hell.**

At this point, I feel like I'm just doing busy work as a bridge to college. And all the while, not enjoying or barely doing much outside of school.

Out of desperation, I've been pondering the possibility of getting a GED, getting a CS internship nearby until the time I would be a junior or senior, and going to college when I feel I'm ready.

**My stats so far are:**

- SAT 1460 (Math 740, R&amp;W 720), will most definitely take again in March. I think I could get a 770+ in math (I got a 750 out of 760 on PSAT; I just need to study, which I didn't)
- 4.19 GPA
- an EC that sets me drastically apart I'd think (4 years ago I set up a local volunteer group to teach coding to kids)

The only reasons for wanting to get out of high school are social and boredom. Bored with the curriculum, bored with having only one friend who I rarely see in person, and bored with suburbia.

I'd love to go to a top school, but I'd rather go to a good-but-not-uber-prestigious school where I would have a better shot at a scholarship if the other option is $60k/yr at a top school.

**Could I work things out with a GED? Even if I could, I'm not sure if I should.**

I'll try keep the post short (Ended up being super long), and if you're not too interested in my life story, there's a TL;DR for you at the bottom. For the people that are willing to stick around, here I go with my miniture life story.

(Thinking about this, it kind of makes me look like a pretentious douche, which I'm not trying to be)

I'm probably going to get a little too personal here, but, to start off, I've been basically locked in my room since I was 8 or 9 (16 now). No, my parents didn't keep me in a dungeon for years. I was homeschooled, and, because I lived in such a small town, I never really met anyone to hang around with (And my parents didn't like me going outside alone, either). So, basically, I've been a hermit for the better half of my life.

That isn't a terrible thing, though. It gave me the freedom to do what I wanted to do, which was to just mess around on a computer all day (Maybe less of a choice and more of a time killer). It made me think I've been stripped of my education though, which I desperately want and have been trying to make up for. Home schooling might've been okay if my parents weren't too busy with their self-employment to actually teach me. I'm not trying to make them sound bad, they're pretty great parents and they've tried their best, but they have made a couple mistakes. I'd like to repay their hard work someday though, and I hope I can get a decent amount of money to do that. Anyway, being locked away made me who I am, and it also made me realize that I'm okay with working for my education. I do well in school, but when it gets to my own things and hobbies, I just don't have any motivation.

I forgot to say, but this is my very first semester in school (I've been in since August), and everything is new to me; from writing homework, making PowerPoints, studying, paying attention, worrying about the upcoming exams. Overall, though, I'm doing surprisingly well. Both me and my parents thought I would be behind, and, even though I'm in lower English and math classes (They didn't know where to put me), I'm surprised at how well it's going. 

Anyway, back to the programming part. I started programming on a site called ROBLOX roughly 4 years ago. That is, I started learning 4 years ago. I'm not going to lie, I'm kind of embarrassed to say that because ROBLOX feels like a kid's game to a lot of people, but it definitely helped me in my programming ventures. Since then, I've messed around with a couple languages (emphasize on ""messed around""), some of them being Java, JavaScript, C#, Python, and SQL. So, because of that, I'd like to say that I know how to ""program"". That doesn't mean I know how to program well or efficiently, and I don't consider myself good at programming or anything; it just means I know how it works. I'd like to think I'm somewhere between beginner and intermediate.

In those 4 years, I've never really accomplished a lot. On ROBLOX, I only ever finished one game out of dozens of ideas, building, and then ultimately scrapping, and that one game was made because I said I'd help someone make it for free. As for the real programming, I've finished one project, which a Chrome extension that reposted ads and notified you of new ads on a site called Kijiji, and that, again, was for somebody else (My dad, specifically). It also took a loooot of Googling and documentation, since I didn't know how to work around Chrome's API. I've also helped one of my online friends with his programming homework which was in Python and Java.

An intern at Google came into my computer science course a couple weeks ago, and him talking about his internship just excited me so much. He wanted to be a physicist, but decided to go down the computer science route with a minor in physics, and he's been doing great. I really, really hope I can get to that point and hopefully beyond. 

I know I need to brush up on my programming and general computer knowledge, and my math, but I don't need the absolute basics (unless it'll help), but mostly more intermediate things and I'll fill in the gaps. I'm in a basic Visual Basic Computer Science course right now, and it's super boring since it's like an intro to programming. I've been sitting in it for a week and a half and not doing anything.

So, I guess a few of my questions would be:

* What are some good ways to improve on programming or computer science in general?
* Are there any projects I can do? Open-source things, anything like that?
* College or University, if any? What type of minor?
* What kind of work or internships could I possibly do when I'm older (Or now, even if it's unlikely)?
* What's some of the best paying programming/compsci jobs?
* What are the chances of being able to work for a big company like Google or Facebook?
* Just general advice or tips

I know these are easily Googled, and I guess I don't know what I'm doing here saying that, but I think I'm just looking to vent a little or get a more personal answer, I don't really know which. I just want to stop worrying about it and get someone to guide me in the right direction

What I'm wondering is: What should I focus on? Should I get a degree first, or just build a portfolio and job search without a degree? Would companies on the west coast interview and hire me shortly before I exit the service, so that I could move and begin employment?

I was reading this and honestly it was kinda scary. I am an Indian and I came to Illinois to study CS (at Champaign). I like it here; I've had some great internships, made some great networks and am currently looking into grad schools for an MBA (GSB, HBS, Sloan, Booth, Haas and the like) or looking to get into an industry with a strong market. One of the things that worries me is that I don't know which category I fall into - am I cheap labor or am I a skilled worker? And if I work here am I going to have a real hard time getting a Visa? Is there a strong line of distinction between IT workers and core SWE/PM roles at Big-N companies/startups? 

Globalization is defined as the increasing interaction of people, states, or countries through the growth of the international flow of money, ideas, and culture. Is the current administration essentially trying to curb this? 

To be fair, if I am out of this country, I know I can do well in other places as well; one thing the United States does extremely well is the Plethora of opportunities it has up for grabs. My world view might be narrow but apart from Canada, UK, maybe some Scandinavian countries and maybe China (and perhaps India as well) there are not many places around the planet which have an abundance of educational and industrial resources and networks that the above mentioned places have.

You can see the whole curriculum here 
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses

I’ve been doing the course during my free time for the past couple of weeks. I’m currently about halfway through the Javacript section.

The course has you complete projects along the way, so you gradually build an online portfolio.

I thought about doing a full-time in-class boot camp, which apparently are great for finding employment for their graduates. But I was reluctant to hand over the money until I’m sure computer coding is the right career move for me. (They’re very expensive) Also, it would have meant quitting my job.

I currently work as a teacher but I’m feeling a bit burnt out, and there’s just no scope for progression in it, hence me looking at other career paths.

My degree is in Arts, so I’ve no formal background in IT. I live in Dublin, Ireland at the moment. Is it really feasible that I could get hired after completing the Odin Project? I’m happy to learn extra stuff too, Python or whatever.

Are there such things as paid internships in this industry, where I could learn on-the-job, so to speak?"

________________________________

I really wish we’d never gone to Hell.

We trekked across the flat expanse of blood-red desert. As we grew closer to the gate of Orak-Tar the landscape became more and more difficult to traverse. The sand became loose, and our feet sank in when we walked. Giant yellow bones jutted up like broken teeth. 

I had tried asking Ms. Hatchetface about what we’d find at Orak-Tar, but she wouldn’t say a word. Likewise, Franken Teddy’s usual cheerful demeanor had been replaced by an air of nervous silence. And so, we made our way on in silence, to a place of which even demons feared to speak.

The gate loomed as an enormous gray edifice in the distance. The monumental slate-gray stone pillars dominated the landscape, disappearing into the haze of dust that had replaced the clouds. Between them stood an oaken door that must have been the size of a small town.

“Why does the gate need to be so big?” I asked. My voice sounded small against the enormity of the structure before me. As if in answer the ground shook, and fissures snaked their way up the pillars. The gate threatened to crumble at any moment. I hoped we weren’t under it when it did.

We arrived at the gate to see Satan standing there, jabbering away on a cell phone.

“I’m sure we can work something out,” he said, tugging at his collar. “There’s no need to....yes, I understand that but--”

“Satan!” Ms. Hatchetface yelled. Satan spun around on his heel and looked at us. 

“What the Hell are you guys doing here?” he asked.

“You shouldn’t use bad words in front of Sarah,” Ms. Hatchetface chastised.

“It’s okay,” Sarah said. “I’m used to it.”

“Okay,” Satan replied. “But seriously, you guys shouldn’t be here right now.”

“We don’t *want* to be here,” Ms. Hatchetface said. “But *someone* sealed off the exits to Hell.”

“Alright, I’ll unseal them but you have to promise to--”

**GGGGGGGGRRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHHH**

The ground shook again, and the cracks in the pillars deepened and spread like errant lightning bolts. Pieces of stone rained down from the sky like deadly rain. 

“No, no no,” Satan said into the cell phone. “I’m not ignoring you. Some friends of mine just showed up. Listen, now’s not really a good time for the apocalypse, do you think that maybe we could ....what’s that now? They’re from Earth, why? But that’s.....how is that possible? No, no, no sir I’m not questioning your judgment. Ok, I’ll let them know.”

Satan tried clicking the phone shut, but dropped in on the ground by mistake.

“Ah, never been good with these things,” he said. “The claws make it hard to type.” 

“Satan, what the Hell is going on?” Ms. Hatchetface asked.

“Ah well, the elder gods seem to have uh... awoken. Anyway, you know how the big bosses are, always ‘apocalypse this’ and ‘mass genocide that.’”

“The elder gods?” Ms. Hatchetface bit her lip and went ghost-white. “How did that happen?”

“Well, you know Jerry?”

“Jerry who?”

“Jerry the intern.”

“Satan, there are like eight interns named Jerry.”

“He’s the one with the axe in his head.”

“You mean Fyrznal?”

“That’s just his nickname. His real name is Jerry.”

“Ok, what about him?”

“Well, he was supposed to perform the Rite of Everlasting Slumber a couple weeks ago, but the goat he slaughtered was actually just a llama. Turns out Jerry isn’t so smart. Maybe it’s the axe in the head.”

“So the gods woke up? Aren’t there safeguards against that sort of thing?”

“Well, you know Gary the intern?”

Ms. Hatchetface sighed.

“I don’t want to know, Satan. So the elder gods are up and planning to demolish Hell, is that it?”

“Well...” Satan tugged at his collar. 

“Well, what?”

“Yes. And also Earth. But it’s okay! I’ve got a plan!”

“Oh no,” Ms. Hatchetface planted her hand on her forehead. 

“It’s easy!” Satan said. “All you’ve got to do is--”

**CRAAAAAAAAACK**

The great oaken door to the Netherworld cracked and bulged in the center, sending giant splinters of wood flying off like missiles. Then it gave, and the beast from the Netherworld burst forth.

_________________________________
The Netherworld creature was like something from a nightmare. It was an oily black monstrosity that distorted the reality around it as its shape shifted and shimmered. It was colossal beyond imagining, and its true form was indiscernible as it swallowed the light around it.

I had to do a double-take as the next being came striding out of the Netherworld gate. It was a human woman, dressed in a black, form-fitting blazer and pencil skirt. 

I looked around for Satan to explain, but I couldn’t see him amongst the rubble. I wondered if he had been crushed by a falling rock.

The woman checked her clipboard, and pushed her wire-rimmed glasses up her nose. 

“Is there a Ms. Sarah Rogers present?”

“Uh, yes?” Sarah said.

The secretary glanced up over her glasses. 

“Hello Ms. Rogers. I represent the legal interests of Mr. Urznok the World-Eater.”

“Okay...”

“First off, Mr. Urznok wanted to extend his sincerest apologies that you were nearly crushed to death by a troll demon earlier today. Mr. Urznok had simply wanted to invade the mind of the demon to communicate with you. However, as I’m sure you know, homicidal fury is an unfortunate side effect of being mind-controlled by a Netherworld being.”

“I was almost crushed to death because of a side-effect?”

“We maintain that the convenience of Netherworld mind-control outweighs the side-effect profile. Cholesterol medications have side-effects too, but without them Earth-people wouldn’t be able to gorge themselves on double-cheeseburgers with impunity.”

“Okay... well why did he want to talk to me?”

The secretary checked her clipboard again.

“It seems Mr. Urznok had the Earth scheduled for demolition this Wednesday,” she said.

“Today’s Wednesday.”

“Yes. However, it has come to Mr. Urznok’s attention that a Netherworld refugee is still at large within the realm of Earth. As such, the Earth cannot be destroyed at this time.”

“What does this have to do with me?” Sarah asked.

“We have the refugee listed as a Ms. Sarah Rogers,” the secretary said.

“Me? But I’m not from the Netherworld. I’m from Earth!” Sarah turned to me. “Right, Dad?”

“Yes, that’s right!” I said, turning to the nameless secretary. “I was there for her birth.”

The secretary checked the clipboard again. 

“This record is for a Sarah Rogers Senior.”

Sarah’s eyes went wide.

”Mom?”

___________________________

“Are you telling me that my ex-wife is from the Netherworld?” I asked. “How is that possible?”

“We had a foreign-exchange program set up with the University of Arizona in 1987.” 

“I met my wife at the University of Arizona in 1987.”

“Well there you go.”

“Wait, isn’t that the year all those students went missing for two months and came back possessed by demons? Then it was covered up by the administration?”

“I don’t know anything about that, sir.”

“Really seems like you would.”

The secretary cleared her throat. 

“The Netherworld is absolved from legal responsibility for any unfortunate demon-possession events. Those students signed waivers.”

“They waived their rights to not be possessed by demons?”

“Nobody reads those things,” she said, shrugging her shoulders.

“Look,” I said. “I have no idea where my ex-wife is.” 

“Well, I’d suggest you find her,” the secretary said. “In the meantime, as a descendant of a Netherworld being, your daughter will stay here.”

“WHAT!?”

“Don’t worry, Mr. Rogers,” she said. “We have an excellent daycare here in the Netherworld.”

“THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE,” Franken Teddy boomed. “I WILL NOT ABANDON MY CHARGE TO THE DANGERS OF THE NETHERWORLD.”

“It’s perfectly safe,” the secretary said. Then she crouched down and put on a big fake grin as she looked at Sarah. “Here, girl!” she said in a high-pitched voice.

“I’m not a dog,” Sarah said.

“Fine,” the secretary said, standing up and making a note on her clipboard. She snapped her fingers, and an orb of shining black light enveloped Sarah.

“Hey, stop that!” I yelled. 

Franken Teddy ran at the orb, but he got there too late--Sarah had vanished. 

“Thank you very much for your understanding, Mr. Rogers. Mr. Urznok the World-Eater would be very grateful if you could locate the Netherworld refugee, as you were the last person to have seen her.”

The secretary and the Netherworld being slunk back through what remained of the gate. The shattered stone stubs of the pillars crumbled into dust as we stared at each other. 

“Well what do we do now?” I said. 

The others merely shrugged.

How the Sysadmin Stole Christmas  
    by Febre  
   
   

Every user down in Cubeville liked Christmas a lot…  
But the Sysadmin, who lived just under Cubeville (in the basement), Did NOT!  
The Sysadmin hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!  
Now, please don't ask why. His temperament won't allow for reason.  
It could be his workload was too heavy and he toiled often at night.  
It could be, perhaps, that his permissions weren't set quite right.  
But I think that the most likely reason of all,  
May have been that his team spirit had taken a fall.  
Whatever the reason, the pressure or its choosers,  
He stood there on Christmas Eve, hating the users.  

Staring up from his cave, with a status set to :frown:  
At the warm lit monitors in the cubicle lined office town.  
For he knew every user in Cubeville above,  
Was busy now mistreating the IT gear with a shove.  
""And they're installing malware!"" he cried with pain so pure,  
""Tomorrow is Christmas! They'll have to call me in for sure!""  
Then he sneered, and fired off that rapid e-mail warning,  
""I MUST find some way to stop Christmas shenanigans from coming!""   
For Tomorrow, he knew, all the users and their toys,  
Would saturate the network. Bandwidth lost on useless ploys!  

And then! The service calls! The non-essential service calls!  
Calls! Calls Calls!  
That's one thing he hated! Non-essential AFTER-HOURS CALLS!  
CALLS! CALLS! CALLS!  
Then the users, young and old, would share the wifi key with a scream.  
And they'd stream! And they'd stream! And they'd STREAM!  
STREAM! STREAM! STREAM!  
They would stream on Netflix, on Spotify, and any others popular now.  
Which was something the Sysadmin just couldn't allow.  
And THEN, they'd do something he permitted least of all!  
Every user in Cubeville, the tech savvy and the not-on-the-ball,  
Would stand close together, pillaging the network with haste.   
They'd all group together. And the users would start to waste!  
They'd waste bandwidth! They'd waste terminal server resources!  
WASTE! WASTE! WASTE!  

And the more the Sysadmin thought of this extra Christmas work,  
The more the Sysadmin thought, ""I'll lock down this whole network!""   
""Why, for thirty-three years I've put up with it now!""  
""I MUST stop these shenanigans from happening, But HOW?""  
Then he formed a plan! An awful plan!  
THE SYSADMIN FORMED A WONDERFUL, AWFUL PLAN!  
""I know just what to do!"" The Sysadmin typed on his tablet.  
And he made a restrictive network policy then quickly enabled it.  
And he laughed, and he gloated, ""What a great Sysadmin trick!""  
""With this policy active, permissions will be much too strict!""  
""All I need is a valid reason…"" The Sysadmin scanned the network.  
But, since good reasons are scarce, there was none that would work.  
Did that stop the grouchy Sysadmin? No! The Sysadmin simply said,  
""If I can't find a valid reason, I'll make one up instead!""  

So he called the CEO, Bill. Then he took buzzwords mixed with some fear,  
And he spun tales of ransomware and foreign hackers in his ear.  
THEN he lauded his plan as the only fix to these problems you see,  
The clueless executive team and Bill were powerless but to agree.  
The Sysadmin's plan was comprehensive and far-reaching,  
Toward the office cubes he did fly, empty of users late into the evening.  
All their monitors were dark. Quiet stillness filled the place.  
All of the users were gone, not even one little trace.  
When he came to the first cubicle in the office space.  
""This is stop number one,"" the sour Sysadmin bellowed,  
And he reset the password, then verified the network policy followed.  

Then he assailed the firewall content filter. All would be blocked.  
But, he made an exclusion for Bill, or he'd soon find himself defrocked.  
He got hung up only once, for but a moment or two.  
A bit zealous with the web filter policy and cut himself off too.  
Where the little user IoT devices sit on their desks in a row.  
""These useless widgets,"" he grinned, ""are the first things to go!""  
Then he shambled and crept, with a smile most unseemly,  
Around the office, and he took any device not provided by the company!  
Smart picture frames! And Chromecasts! Bluetooth Speakers!  
USB doodads! Tradeshow thumb drives! And Android Streamers!  
And he sorted them in bins, one by one, very efficiently.  
Stored all the bins in his office, under lock and key.  
Then he slithered to the office kitchen, he took the users coffee!  
He took the sugar and cream! He took the snacks and even the tea!  
He cleaned out the fridge with quickness and fervor.  
Why, that mean Sysadmin even emptied the office water cooler!  

To his basement he hauled the office coffee and confectionery.  
""And NOW!"" smiled the Sysadmin, ""I'll horde all the stationery!""  
And the Syadmin took the staples, but left everyone their stapler.  
When he heard a shrill sound like the front door alarm beeper.  
He turned around quickly, and he saw the new office nerd!  
Little intern user, putting in extra hours trying to surpass the herd.  
The Sysadmin had been caught by this student outright,  
Who's ambition to get ahead brought her back late into the night.  
She stared at the Sysadmin and said, ""what are you doing here guy?""  
""Why are you taking all our devices and widgets? WHY?  
But, you know, that Sysadmin was so clever and so sneaky,  
He thought up a fib, and he thought it up quickly!  
""Why my sweet office newbie,"" the smug Sysadmin lied,  
""All these devices need updates for security to be complied.""  
""So I'm taking them down to my office, my dear.""  
""I'll update them down there. Then bring them back up here.""  
And his lie was believed by the intern. Then he gave her a fright,  
And he said the Internet was updating and wouldn't work tonight.  
And when the intern user left the office a little bit confused,  
HE resumed securing the office IT systems from being abused!  

Then the last act of defiance, was to set MAC filtering on the wifi!  
Then he slunk back to his basement, the devious untruthful sly.  
On their desks he left nothing but some old velcro cable tie.  
And the one speck of food that he left in the office,  
Was the rotten brownbag that wouldn't be eaten even by a novice.  
Then the Sysadmin made sure to hit every users station,  
Leaving them barren, bereft of all personality or decoration!  
It was quarter past dawn… All the users, sleeping with pleasure,  
All the users, still snoring when he packed up their treasure,  
Packed it up with their widgets! The java! The branded swag!  
The projector! And the laminator! The scanner! Every laptop bag!  

Two levels down, below even his dungeon, lay the building furnace,  
He ferried there his load to commit it to the fires with a grimace!  
""What a bunch of losers!"" he said of the users bluntly and cunning.  
""They're finding out now that no Christmas shenanigans are coming!""  
""They're just getting into the office now! I know just what they'll do!""  
""They'll stand there in stunned silence a minute or two,  
Then the users up in Cubeville will all cry BooHoo!""  
""Those sweet tears,"" grinned the Sysadmin, ""I simply MUST see!""  
So he paused. And the Sysadmin viewed the feed from camera three.  
And he did see a sight beaming over the screen before him.  
It started out dim. Then it became clearer as if on a whim.  
But the sight wasn't sad! Why, that sight even seemed merry!  
It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!  

He stared up at Cubeville! The Sysadmin checked his feeds again!  
Then he shook! What he saw defied all logic and wracked his brain!  
Every user up in Cubeville, the tall and the small,  
Was festive together! Without any frivolous technology at all!  
He HADN'T stopped Christmas shenanigans from coming! THEY CAME!  
In some weird unexplained way, they came all the same!  
And the Sysadmin, with his slipper clad feet sweating by the fires heat,  
Stood puzzling and puzzling: ""How could they be so upbeat?""  
""Good times are being had! They came without having to call me!""  
""Good times without doodads, devices or coffee!  
And he puzzled a long while, till his puzzler hurt and hindered.  
Then the Sysadmin thought of something he hadn't considered!  
""Maybe Christmas,"" he thought, ""isn't something to abhor.""  
""Maybe Christmas…perhaps…could bring joy and more!""  
And what happened then? Well.. In Cubeville they say,  
That the Sysadmin's team spirit grew tenfold that day!  
And the minute that great weight was lifted,  
He rushed up with his haul from the dark basement and gifted,  
And he rolled back the restrictions! And brought back the lot!  
And he, HE HIMSELF! The Sysadmin brewed the first coffee pot!  
   
   
   

From the team at Great White North, we wish you all a safe and happy holiday season!  
Be warm, be merry and spread Christmas joy around no matter the reason!  
(And don't forget to give your favourite IT guy or gal a hug! We can often get shut in.)  "

I had always been much more interested in CS and enjoyed the two cs classes I took during undergrad.

So I immediately decided to switch and started a masters program in CS this summer at a pretty good school. So far I've taken a (very very) basic java class, discrete math, algorithms, python, and computer systems. I still know very little about programming, and I'm seriously struggling with even many easy leetcode/hackerrank questions. 

I've only had two quarters of classes, and done fine in all of them, but I'm still massively behind people who have been coding for years (which are most juniors looking for internships). I am not at all confident in my ability to pass technical interviews unless they are super basic.

My resume is pretty bad (besides my academic record), and I only know a very small amount of java and mediocre on Python. Do I have any chance or will I have to settle for a non swe internship?

Edit: I should also add that my program requires me to have completed a summer internship (tech related)"

I'm applying to the MSc in Applied Computing (MScAC) Program at UofT. However, there's a few parts that I'm not so sure about in the application and the Graduate Department is closed for the holidays, so I can't ask them.

In the Academic History portion, it asks ""List all universities that you have attended, including your current studies and any studies at the University of Toronto. Please list the university where you obtained (or expect to obtain) your undergraduate degree first.""

What if I began my undergrad studies studying a different degree before switching into computer science undergrad? Do I enter the initial degree start date or my computer science degree date for the ""Start date"" column? 

For the Final year average, what is considered the final ""year""? Is it my last two semesters? Because I had to take an extra semester and graduated at the end of the Fall semester (December) due to switching degrees.

For the ""Professional Training, Apprenticeships or Internships"", does full time work count? I'm currently working full time as a developer now that I'm finished my undergrad. Does that count as Professional Training?

Thank you very much!"

But I do like to get that experience of getting a feel for their workflow and environment before I really commit to one in the long term.

But when your school years are well behind you, you can't apply to internships anymore. And if you switch companies every few months that's going to look bad on your resume as a big job hopper. However, I would want at least try some of them out for a few months without needing a long-term commitment, for salaries comparable to an intern. Simply going out to interview with companies doesn't always give you the full picture of how they are.

 Internships are about getting some hands on experience before you long term commit, so can I just take on several contract jobs and explain my terms and expectations to the company?"

Most of the MS program is online (the school is far in another state), so I'm not too worried about scheduling, as long as it's flexible. Ideally, I would love to do something that relates to user experience, healthcare, and technology, but realistically I know that chance of that is low due to my city's location. It's also hard for me to find related internships or jobs, but if I was within the area of my graduate school then it wouldn't be much of an issue because it's in a more urban setting and there would obviously be plenty of opportunities and resources for that (i.e. the career center for students and a vast alumni network in the city). I am planning to move out there when I'm qualified to do the internship course that is part of my MS program (probably at the end of next year), so I'm trying to save up for that.   

However, a lot of the jobs I'm finding near me right now require/prefer prior related job experience (especially with retail, customer service, and administrative assistant positions) or I'm not getting an offer because of my lack in qualifications or I don't have a particular skill or certification; other ones that appeal to me end up being full-time, and I'm hesitant to apply because I'm not sure if I can handle full-time work while being a full-time grad student (according to the amount of credits I'm taking)... I know a few who do this and it seems doable, but also stressful. I am upset that I've never had an actual job due to strict parents forbidding me to work while in high school and college. The only 'official' work experience I have is being a research assistant for 2.5 years for an internship I started in senior year which then turned into a job, but I had to quit and move back to my hometown when I started my grad program to save money. Aside from that, I've participated in extracurriculars and held a few positions too in student organizations during undergrad and did a variety of volunteering, so I try to relate those experiences too when applying or doing an interview.   

Sorry for the wall of text, I need some advice on my situation, mainly not having enough experience or lacking a particular skill for positions I really wouldn't mind doing. What should I do? Thanks in advance!"

So writing this down, everything that happened, is my way of keeping my best friend alive in the world, for just a little bit longer.  I've changed all names for reasons you'll understand shortly, but everything that follows is true.

June 7th, 2014:

That summer my dreams smelled like fire.  Paper lanterns drifting apart in the light of day, harmless as dust.  But at night I was trapped inside them.  My friend was there, too, faceless as a cloud, and doors that pulled me into my past.  

Into a room filled with blood, and her letters.

A man’s smile floating at the corner of my eye like an errant moon, and then he’d reach in to grab me, to pull us both back into the van.  But I couldn’t scream.  I couldn’t scream and I couldn’t wake up, and it hurt when I did.  The lanterns would come apart and I’d slide free of my sheets, cold with sweat, and stare at the dust circling in the light from the street.  

Sleep waited for me like a man with a gun. 

That morning, wrapping myself in a towel, I could almost believe sleep waited behind the fog in my mirror, too.  

I cut the fog clear with the edge of my hand but the mirror’s surface only clouded again, swallowing the reflection of my earrings like golden fish sinking into a pond.  They were long earrings, bronze like my eyes.  I didn’t look at my eyes, though. 

I dressed in my room beside the fireplace, looking out the leaded glass windows into the street.  It was summertime and the narrow brick street down below was flooded with bicyclists and tourists, the occasional carriage tour welded into the gridlock beside them.  

A couple years ago my parents were doing the same thing.  Then he bought this place for her on a lark.  That’s what they called it, my dad’s final, last-exit attempt to save their marriage.  They moved down, started fixing up the house while I enrolled in my first semester at ASU’s metals program back home in Tucson.  Then everything went sideways.  They brought me here to keep an eye on me.   

Just outside my bedroom was a door that opened onto the second-story porch.  Veiled by magnolia trees, you were hidden from the street like you were up in a treehouse.   Leaf-filtered sunlight, the scent of wisteria sweet around you.  Soft, creaky floorboards all covered with golden pollen and warm from the sun.

Faye would have loved it.  

I kept seeing it again, my last memory of her.  A hard wash of light like a camera’s flash.  Faye’s post-it note wilting down from the steamy bathroom door, the paper covered with her familiar scratchy handwriting:  

Ada don’t come in.  

Our dorm room carpet slushy with bathwater as I tore open the door.  Blood in the water and partially dissolved pain pills coming apart like yellow pom poms all around her.  She would have gotten a minor kick out of that, those pom poms.  

I kept wondering about those men in the car.  I wondered what it was about us that made them choose us out of the crowd that night.  
After what happened to us in Nogales, the whole world felt different to Faye.  The air seemed solid with it, the violence of men.  Impossible to breathe.  Even daylight went black in her eyes.  That’s what she said.  So we retreated into our dorm room like the drying tide and she made me promise her we’d wait it out together.  Just a little while longer, that was our plan.  Just a little longer, a few days more, before we reported what had happened.  Because what could anybody do, anyway?  The men were gone.  

“I don’t want people looking at me like I’m something broken,” Faye said.  
 
In the end, I had to tell her parents the truth alone.  I remember her mom, Mrs. Taillefer, standing in the dorm hallway, her face puffy and tight as a balloon on the end of its string.  By then our hallway was a crime scene and Mrs. Taillefer kept repeating everything I said as if she were trying to use the words to climb out of something.  The unimaginable darkness swallowing us both.  

“She wanted to tell you, she was just afraid that you wouldn’t-”  How did you tell a grieving mother her child had been afraid to become less in her eyes?  I reached past the police woman taking notes between us and tried to take Faye’s mother’s hand.  “I should have called you.”

“Faye didn’t,”  Mrs. Taillefer’s words kept breaking off, sinking between us.  “She never said.”  

She jerked back, covered her face.  More than anything, I wish I could stop seeing that.  Mrs. Taillefer covering her face, trying not to see.


As I sat on my porch rolling a cigarette, drowsy sunlight coming through the trees, it still seemed impossible that Faye was dead, that I would never see her again.  If it wasn’t for me, for a trick of my biology, we both would have died that night in Nogales. 

“Maybe things didn’t happen the way they were supposed to, Ada.  Maybe you weren’t supposed to wake up.  Maybe we’re both supposed to be dead.”

I’d failed her.  The right word, ten more minutes.  

Would it have made a difference?  I’d never know, and now nothing made sense except the simplest things.  Warmth, cigarettes. 

“So long as you can keep your wantin’ pants on, you’re still in the game,” Mom always said.  

Anyway, that’s what she used to say, before everything happened and she and dad started treating me like some terminal case.  Like suicide was contagious.  I kept Mom’s words in mind anyway.  

I kept wanting another cigarette.  And by those lights I was still in the game.  

I leaned over, feeling the grit of pollen under my skin, and tugged out a sheet of rolling paper.  I drizzled threads of tobacco into its crease, rolling and compacting the grains carefully into a ridge.  The tobacco smelled like wood shavings; the crackle of the papers was as pleasant as the turning of a page.  I finished the roll, licking it closed from end to end, and started to file it into the old silver makeup compact I used for a cigarette case, but then I lit up instead and sat there listening to fire eat away at my tobacco the way daylight singes the edges of a dream. 

I was rolling a second when the paper went soft in my hands.  The air turned to rain, went clicking through the trees, echoing off the bricked street.  Tourists shouted, running to their cars.  

In Tucson, the summer downbursts never covered the city at the same time.  You’d see a storm on the horizon and could follow it in the distance with your finger, furrowing across the city.  You smelled the creosote bushes on the wetted air, the temperature dropped briefly, and then, after an hour or so, everything went dry again.  

But here in Charleston, it rained hard for days, sometimes weeks.  The air never dried out, not completely.  Sometimes you even felt condensation gathering between your fingers.  

When it rained, the streets swelled with warm, lazy rainwater, floating up cars like they were lily-pads, and the college kids went paddling down the streets on surfboards and kayaks while hundred-year stumps leaned sideways in the ground. 

I went in and opened my windows.  I had to prise hard to get the panes up.  They were old, and the property had stood empty a few years before my parents bought it.  Something to do with an unlucky death, the realtor told them.  

Sometimes I had the feeling the house was remembering its secrets.  Turning them over like prayer beads: and when I was alone in it, rain tapping down outside the windows, I could almost believe something like Faye’s darkness was growing behind the walls.  That the shadows around me had come unfixed, the magnolias were clawing to be let in, out of the rain; the falling towers and balconies of unending rain that fall on summertime South Carolina.  

In watery sunlight I lay in bed reading the shadows.  Memory and sleep stood waiting on either side of me, each with their knife.  I tried to make my mind a perfect, catchless blank.

~o~

I called my dad to ask about dinner.  
“Dinner…” he said.   
“Mom said to make sure you ate,”  I was hollow and strange-sounding even to myself.
“Have you eaten? I’ll bring home something,” Dad said.
“She made us a roast in the crock pot.”
I heard him adjust his phone.  “Did you finish that report for your class?”    
Dad kept a notebook of things to ask people about.  I knew this because he’d left it in the car recently when he had to run inside to pay for gas.  Straightaway I flipped to my name.   
‘Ada,’ it said. ‘Silverwork, college apps, online class.’
After Faye died and I wanted to take off the semester off, my parents made me promise to do an online class.  “Just to keep your hand in,” they said.  The one I signed up for is just a class on meditation, though.  
 “Almost,” I lied.  

At nine o’clock, Dad came through the door to lay his newest flavor of IceAir on the kitchen counter.   He still liked to invent things, mostly out of habit.  He’s been retired for years.  
I took a bite.  “It’s fizzy, salty... caramel, or something.  Not quite caramel.  More than caramel.”
“Do you love it?” he said, lightly.  But the skin around his eyes looked boiled and pale.  Worried.  
I’d learned it was less work to pretend to be happy than to try to explain why you aren’t.  I smiled.  I made the smile reach my eyes.  “Relax, dad.  Suicide isn’t contagious.” 
“Ada…”
“Hey, I’m not trying to make you feel bad.  Just relax, you know?  You’re making me nervous.”  I kissed his rumpled forehead.  “I do love it.” 
Dad sat at the scarred kitchen table we’d had since I was a kid, crossing his long grasshopper legs.  He’d forgotten to wear socks; his ankles were marbled like expensive cheese.  He tilted back in his chair.  “So what should we call it?”  
I slopped the roast into our bowls, carrying them to the table.  
“The candy?  Um… Caramel Fizzy Lifting.”    
“That’s good, cherie. I’ll run that by Mike tomorrow.”  He began to eat, fork clicking up his meat and vegetables briskly.  “So tell me about your report.” 
“It’s kind of a weird class.  It’s about lots of things. Meditation techniques, mostly.”  I pulled off my rings, arranging them on the table.  ""They want us to analyze our habitual ways of thinking, to think about new habits of mind.  I’m going to incorporate this thing I read about Muhammad Ali.  He has this mind-trick he used to maintain focus during a fight.  He says he’d go into this room, this little room he keeps in his mind.""  
I picked up the arrowhead ring, tracing its edge over the lines of my palm.  It was the first piece I’d ever made, still my favorite.  
Funny how sometimes you get things right the first time.  You can spend the rest of your life just trying to get back to the start. 
""Hm.""  Dad took the ring from me gently, testing its edge on the palm of his hand. 
""He goes into this room and there's a mask on the wall. A warrior’s mask.  He takes it down and puts it on before his fights.""  I looked at him steadily.  
""Becoming the mask,"" Dad said.  ""I wonder what sort of masks you and I should keep in mind,  mm?""
""You could have one with crazy Einstein hair.""  
He touched his hair absently.  “Are you sure this ring is safe to wear?”
""To help you be smart,” I said.  “And divorce mom.”
“Jesus, Ada.  Yours would be a mask with some tact, I hope.""
I shrugged.  “If you guys aren’t happy, I mean.”
“Listen, what if we find you some kind of group, huh?  I don’t like you having to spend all this time alone.""
“I am busy.  I’m studying.  You said you wouldn’t fuss.”
“I know, sweetheart.  I’m trying.  I am.”  He tried to smile.  “I’m just a fussy kind of guy.  I worry about you.  Mike says hi, by the way.”
I curdled like a salted snail.  Yeesh.  “That’s nice.”
“Mike is nice.”
“Just what I always wanted.  A guy who picks his nose with his pinkie.  Nicely.”
He laughed.  “You could do worse, homeschool.” 
“Have you found an assistant here yet?”  
Dad shook his head, spinning my ring on the slatted wood.  “People do things at a different pace here.  It’s hard to work with, takes time getting used to...”  
Mom’s Land Rover purred into the drive.  
He looked up.  Our windows were foggy with the rain, and outside the wet air turned smoky in her headlights.  We could see her still sitting there with the truck still on, radio going at full blast.  She was leaning forwards, touching up her lipstick.  
Chic as nails in Burberry tans, even with the plastic Harris Teeter grocery bags braceleted tightly over one arm.  My mom, waving at us as she breezed round the side of the house, coming inside.  Tipsy.
“You’ve hardly touched your dinner,” Dad said, still watching her.  
“I’m not hungry.”
He moved to let Mom inside, but she was too fast.  Already inside, kicking the door closed behind her.  

“Hi, sweetheart,” he said, backing up, following her to the counter.  
Mom shook groceries out: lentils, spices; slabs of fish in butcher’s envelopes.  “Sorry I’m late.  I went out with the boys, the station interns.  Ada, the fish you can get out here, its just incredible.  It doesn’t even smell like fish.”  She held one up to my dad’s nose.  “Here, smell.”
Dad shuffled back, annoyed.  “Boys?” he said.
“It doesn’t smell like a thing, right?”  She was opening cupboards, putting away groceries. “Yeah, they’re doing a story on dive bars in Charleston.  It was fun.  How are you, Ada honey?  How’s the roast?”
“I’m okay.”  I tilted my bowl, watching the broth run down from the meat. 
“I thought we said we’d take a break from the station.  Make a fresh start,” Dad said.  
Mom froze in the light from the refrigerator.  
“You mean you said that I should take a break,” she said, brightly.  “Tobias, you want me to sit in the corner and think about my mistakes?  Like a toddler?”
“We moved cross country to do this again?” he said.    
“Christ, I shouldn’t have come here,” I said.  “It’s not like this place is home, anyway,”
“Sweetheart.”  But Mom’s eyes slid past me.  
“I can’t watch you guys do this anymore.  It makes me insane.” 
""It’s fine, we’re fine.  Ada, honey, sit down,” Dad said.      
“We’re done, it’s fine, I promise.”
I went upstairs.  

I washed my face and took off my rings, making a midden of them on my desk, and then went rooting through my duffel, thinking maybe I’d doodle jewelry designs until I fell asleep.  I’ve never been a great sleeper.  I used to go for barefoot strolls through the dorm when I couldn’t sleep.  It was like looking out at the world from the inside of a fish tank.  I could stand to be a fish, I think.     

But I was exhausted.  My head hit the pillow and bang, I was standing in a field.  I recognized the place: it was where my nightmares lived.  Only this time, something felt different.  
“Faye?” I said.
There was a shoe on the ground, a man’s Adidas sandal, and as I reached to pick it up, the sky tilted sideways.  

My hands tingled hot where they touched the sandal and a filmstrip slid into play in my mind.  I saw a woman’s face, a child in her arms, a beach in the background.  The sandal was part of someone else’s dream.  I dropped it and instantly the field stitched together again around me.  
“Faye?” I said, again.  
This was going to be a bad one.  
I walked, scratching at my arms to try to wake up.  The grass was tall and green.  Somewhere something was burning.
AdadontcomeinAdadontcomeinAdadontcomeinAdadontcomein
A thing brushed my shoulder.  I whipped around, startled, to see a boy not much older than me.  Standing there watching me.
He was silver-blonde, his smile curling away slowly, like a thread of white smoke.  He didn’t seem to register how scared I must have looked.  
“How are you here?” His voice low and smooth and full of wonder.
“I’m just looking for someone,” I said, turning away.  
He fell into step beside me.  “It’s not safe for you here.  You should leave.”
“My friend’s here.  I have to find her.”  
“Find her?  There’s no one here except-” he paused.  I could feel him still looking at the side of my face with pity, or something like it.
I walked faster.  “Don’t say it.”
“No one’s saying anything except you.  So where are we going?”
“You,” I whirled on him.  “Do you know where she is?”
“Hey, look, I don’t-” he glanced up at something behind us.  “Oh no.  Get down.  Quick!  Get down.”  He lunged, knocking me into the grass and then I was falling through it, falling through the dark, I was in my bed, but the feeling of hurtling through space and time didn’t slow.  
I opened my eyes, lay there staring up at the cracked ceiling, the seeming drift of the air; my bedroom circling around me.  

(it was just a dream, a horrible dream)

But the colors of my bedroom were wrong.  My quilt was a negative of itself, my windows were wet black paint.  

I realized, too late, that something else was in my room.

It lurched onto the bed, the size and shape of a wolf.  Snuffling at my neck with a nose as soft and wet as a cut strawberry.  
I shrank back, my mind racing, my pulse running hard in my throat.  Hit it with a candle?  A book?  Or maybe if I could somehow slide away- but I couldn’t even scream, and the thing was heavy— with long, oily teeth—  
Shadows poured into the air.  
The boy from my dream grabbed the animal’s neck and threw it to the floor.  “Ada, stay back!”  he said.
The wolfthing writhed flat with rage.  
“It starts,” the thing said, but it spoke in a man’s voice, one side of its mouth lifting into a crooked, snaky smile.  Just as the boy grabbed it by the ruff of its hulking neck, the monster faded apart.  Nothing but dust turned in the empty air.
“What... was that? Is it gone?” I said.
“Did it hurt you?”  The boy’s touch floating out of the darkness.  Light as a feather, cold as bone.  
“You stay back,” I said, jerking away.  “What the fuck are you?  How did you follow me here?”  
“You called me here.  Didn’t you want me to come?”  Car lights rolled over my room, and he drifted away from the light.  
“I don’t know, I don’t know— what are you?” I said.        
“You pulled me here.  Out of the dark.”
The lights swept back out.  The night seemed to thicken.      
“What was that thing?”  
“It’s a Fetch.  A kind of emissary demon.  But they don’t exist on this side, it shouldn’t have been able to come through.  Neither should I.”  The boy looked at his hands, smiling, shaking his head.
“It said something to me.  What starts?”
“The bridging of the worlds, I guess.  Of life and death.  I mean, how else could you have…?” He looked around the room, his handsome face slack with wonder.  Outside women were calling to each other, their heels clattering over the bricks as passing cars shed music into the street.  
This is real.  This is really happening.
“Life and death, does that mean you’re dead?  That field we were in, that was the other side?”
“I made a mistake.”  The boy looked down.  “I’ve made a lot of mistakes.”
I paused.  “But you still exist.  Maybe Faye does, too.”    
“That’s your friend?  Maybe.”  He laughed uneasily. 
“Come into the light so I can see you.”   
The boy shook his head, moving further into the shadows.  “I don’t know what you’ll see.” 
“Your eyes, they’re different.  They were black in my dream,”  I said, slipping from bed, holding onto one of its posts.  
The boy’s gaze flickered down the old henley I was wearing for a sleep shirt.  I moved behind the quilt’s overhang on the bed.  “What color are they now?” he said.
“They’re blue.”    
His smile was lean and hard as a myrtle branch.  “Don’t come any closer,” he said.  “I really don’t know what you’ll see.”
“You saved me.”
“I’ll do it again, if I can.”  He started to blur, as if I were watching him through a rainy window.  “But Ada.  Stay away from the Land.  It isn’t what it seems.  Don’t go back.  Don’t look for me, don’t look for your friend.”
“Wait.  Please.  Don’t go.”  I said.
“I can’t stay.  It’s pulling me back, I’m not supposed to be here.”   
“Tell me how to keep you here.”  I touched him in spite of myself, half expecting my hand to pass right through, but it didn’t.  
The fabric of his shirt was soft and cool, and beneath it I felt the warmth of skin.  Then the boy did something that surprised me.  He closed his eyes and moved his hand over mine, clenching my fingers tightly.  
“You’re real.”  
“Of course I’m real,” I said, softly.  “Who do you think is dreaming who?” 
“This isn’t a dream.”
“It’s okay,” I said.  “Stay here, with me.”  
But his face went wild and horrified, as if something were pulling him through a rent in the air.  
“Ada-!”
A sickening coolness filled the room.  And only I remained, holding nothing at all...

I'll be back to post more soon as I can.  I keep a journal at pauline-west.com if you want to stay in touch meantime :)

7lex1u,5,2017-12-21,Average salary of UMD CS Grad for the DMV area?,CSumdquestion,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/7lex1u/average_salary_of_umd_cs_grad_for_the_dmv_area/,"Hey guys,
So I'm currently a CS Student here at UMD about to start 216. Loving everything i'm doing so far, but my moms been trying to push me towards doing premed/predent because its more ""stable"" and has a better financial security, salary, etc.

I'm trying to show her that the CS field is also pretty stable and provides decent incomes for this area (Id ideally like to stay somewhere in the DMV)

I haven't found anything on any of the UMD sites that shows a salary survey of CS students. Can anyone share their offers/salaries so I can have some anecdotal evidence? 

Side Question:
Did you guys just cold apply to internships through the career4terps and sites like indeed.com? Or are career fairs the best way to get interviews? I heard the spring career fair doesn't do too much recruiting, so I wanted to know if I should just go ahead and start applying now to a bunch of companies"
7lf5qv,3,2017-12-21,How bad is backing out of an offer that I accepted?,JCmatcha,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7lf5qv/how_bad_is_backing_out_of_an_offer_that_i_accepted/,"Hi, this is my first post on Reddit so I apologize if there's any convention I should but did not follow. So around October I got a tech internship offer from company A and accepted the offer. By that time I had also submitted my application for one of the Big Four (let it be B), but I did not think I'll have a shot. Just recently I got called back from B for interviews, and fortunately did well enough to receive an offer from B. So now I'm at the crossroads as to what I should do. 

The obviously more moral choice is to stick to A and decline the offer from B. However, A is not a conventional tech company but more like financial/banking, which is something I cannot imagine myself pursuing after graduation. B is more related to what I want to do (pure tech company), and it's also a prestigious company that will definitely open up a lot of doors for me later on. I'm leaning towards accepting the offer from B and backing out from A, but I wonder how bad and unfrequent this practice is? If it's an employment-at-will basis, would there be any legal consequences, and would A contact B so that B would retract their offer? And what is the most polite way to notify A that I reconsidered my choice? Should I mention B's name at all, or just keep it vague? Thank you. 

Update: Thank you everyone for your advice! I decided that I'd always wonder ""what if"" if I joined A out of moral obligation, so I'll accept B's offer for my best interest and sign the contract, then tell A later! Happy holidays!"
7lfltp,91,2017-12-22,How to Get Good Grades in CS,TheAuthenticFake,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/7lfltp/how_to_get_good_grades_in_cs/,"__Background for Credibility__  
I am a senior in CS, and transferred last year as a junior. I had a 3.974 GPA as of Spring 2017 and my Fall grades are turning out As. I took 16 units Fall 2017 and they were all upper undergrad CS classes. In each of my finals I scored a standard deviation or more above the average in classes of at least a hundred students apiece. I recently got a 100k full-time job from a major tech company to start this summer. If this isn't enough evidence that I may know what I'm talking about in CS, I don't know what is.  
__TL;DR I have a big dick and make money rain from the sky blah blah.__  

__Why do I Give a Fuck About Good Grades?__  
Because there is a positive correlation between academic performance and future career success. __Many of the questions asked in interviews are what you learn in classes, in ways that you won't expect.__ One technical interview that lead me to an internship was just asking me about stuff from 45C and 46. 
Another was asking me stuff from CS122A. You might think that people who are spending tens of thousands of dollars every year to go to college understand this, but you'd be surprised.

__Okay, You Got Some Tips?__  
Maybe you've heard these tips before, maybe you disagree with some. This is just what I think works.
[dk]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect  
1. __This is your job, and this is for you.__ Either you're paying to be here or taxpayers are paying for you to be here. Either way, someone is investing in you and banking on your success. You chose to be here. Not your parents, not your friends, nobody but you.  
2. __Assume you're an idiot, but you can learn.__ [Dunning-Kruger] [dk] means you probably know less about the subject than you think. If you already knew everything you would have the job you want or make your own company. Companies hire people for Engineer positions without degrees. You're here because you don't know shit, but you want to learn. Unless demonstrated otherwise, your professor knows more than you do, and when they recommend you go to lectures and discussions and read and do homework they're right. Don't assume you will understand everything the first time. Some of the stuff you will learn took geniuses of greater intelligence than you several months/years to find out; it will be hard to understand at first and you might spend hours beating your head trying to understand or going back and forth with classmates.
[evals]: https://eaterevals.eee.uci.edu/
3. __Most Professors Don't Suck, You Do__  
I presume you've heard horror stories about terrible professors that gave everyone a failing grade on the midterm or shit like that. The thing is, most CS professors at UCI know their stuff, know what you need to learn, and create exams that match what they teach. Maybe they're not good at lecturing but they provide ample studying resources and good homework. Maybe the other way around. Either way, it's your responsibility to maximize what you get out of the class. In the worst case, professors that are really abysmal at teaching get disciplined, and [you can see evaluations from past classes here] [evals]. When someone complains about how bad a class is, ask them why, what their grade is, what the class average is, what actions they have done to remedy. Some people just complain to deflect responsibility.
4. __Start Early, Be Friends with Future You__  
Do you have a habit of doing homework at the last minute? Have you pulled all-nighters? Have you been riding on a good grade for the final to pass harder than a pornstar on a dick? You should probably stop doing that. When homework is assigned do it as soon as possible. Everything takes longer than expected. Think like you have a priority queue of assignments sorted by due date and that queue needs to get empty ASAP. Set aside time for each class and commit to it. Some assignments just can't be  done in an hour or even a day because the fucking __execution time to test__ won't allow it (see CS143A, CS115, CS141, CS178, ICS46 etc.). When you decide to delay, ask __""can future me handle all this work?""__.  
[Timeboxing]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI5FYpwZMXU
5. __Make a Routine__  
Routine &gt;&gt; planning. Routine &gt;&gt; organization. I'm not a person that makes detailed Excel spreadsheets about every little thing I'm going to do. I'm not a machine impervious to procrastination or distraction. I just set aside time every week for each class, and commit to it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI5FYpwZMXU] [Timeboxing]
[notes]: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/
6. __Make a Study Guide/Cheatsheet, Even If Not Allowed__  
Making a study guide can be a great way to structure your knowledge of the material before an exam. You start with an overview of what's been covered, and add the details you remember. When you stop, that's a good demarcation between what you know and what you don't know, and filling in the details is your review. I have sometimes made study guides for a class that allowed them and then never used it on the exam, not because it was useless but because the process of making it taught me everything I needed to know.
7. __If Studying With Other People, Prepare/Study Beforehand__  
Don't be the guy that comes to a study group knowing nothing, even your friends don't want to spend time going over every detail. Have a set of questions/problems that are really stumping you. You'll probably find that either it's stumping them too and you can use the study group time to solve it together, or someone solved it already.
8. __Classes Stack Up__  
If you did poorly in ICS 6B, ICS 6D, or ICS 46 you will have a hard time in many upper-division courses. If you do poorly in 6N or 2A/B/D, you will have a hard time in CS112 and CS178. If you do poorly in ICS51 you will have a hard time in CS143A. If you really want to take a class look through the pre-reqs and assess how you did in them. If you didn't do so well, review beforehand or don't take it.
9. __Preview Classes, Shop Around__  
Many professors you'll be taking a class with have taught it before. They might have publicly-available websites with syllabi and past homeworks and exams. Take a look at it and ask ""Does this sound fun? Do I understand anything in the first lecture slides?"" 
[Multitask]: https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95256794
10. __The Brain is Single-Core, Lecture Time==Study Time__  
Are you the guy that spends lecture playing games on his phone or switching between Facebook, Discord, Slack, Reddit, ~~hentai~~ and back again? Maybe you should put that stuff away. [You learn better with a pencil and paper than with a laptop.] [notes] [Multi-tasking is the biggest load of crap ever.] [multitask] Lecture time spent well is study time that doesn't need to be spent catching up. If you're not even going to pay attention, save time and don't show up. 
11. __Build to Learn__  
For CS161 I found it useful to write out the algorithms in a programming language, put some print debug statements at critical points in the code, and test it on real inputs. For CS141 I would write out small programs that printed out the sizes of structs + unions and did the different parameter passing conventions and so on to give me a real correct output to compare my pencil-and-paper calculations with. Sometimes making a tangible, concrete example is the best way to understand.
12. __Work on Personal Projects__  
This is typically a tip given for finding a job, but it helps with classes too. Doing personal projects can help inform you on what advanced classes you would like to take next, and make your reason for taking a class more than ""I guess it sounds like it's good to learn.""
[ACT]: https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED506252.pdf
13. __Have a Long-Term Goal__  
All of these classes are leading up to something. Either you're getting a job in industry (what field? what company? what skills are needed?) or you're going to grad school or you're going your own way. If you can see a purpose and common thread in the classes you're taking [you'll perform better] [ACT].  

Okay, enough tryhard for me today."
7lfu8y,39,2017-12-22,Is it normal that people at my new job don't really do much work?,rabbitHORIZONTAL,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7lfu8y/is_it_normal_that_people_at_my_new_job_dont/,"I graduated from college in 2014 with a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Before I graduated I had a job lined up with a Big N that I had interned at previously, so when I graduated I packed my bags and moved out to California to start my new position (my internship was in the New England area). A few months ago I was fired from my job. To be honest, I knew it was coming and I definitely deserved it.

I started interviewing and I received an offer to work at a very large, well known telecom company in east coast and I accepted it as the salary is higher than what I was making at my previous job, although my signing bonus and stock package are definitely lower. 

At my new job, I've noticed that people don't really do that much work. People often make excuses to work from home and then don't do anything or just flat out don't come into the office. My boss is rarely here as well. In meetings people will always say things like ""I would help but I am too busy with X"" or ""sure I will get to it next week"" but overall nobody ever does what they say they will do. I've checked people's commit history and many of my team members who have been here a long time have barely checked in any code at all.

The other thing that I find strange is that the two other new hires who were hired with me have been trying their hardest to clean up the code base and hold people accountable to shitty or borderline unacceptable code that has made it into production, but people have ended up resenting them. Even our boss has a negative tone when she speaks to them. It's almost like when people try to do work people here get upset. And somehow this team has stayed afloat for over 10 years so I guess they must be doing something right...

In the beginning, I tried my hardest to work with these other two guys who were hired alongside me, but ultimately I stopped working so hard and working with them since people started to have negative feelings about these guys and I didn't want to get grouped into it. I've mainly just been doing what other people have been doing for the past month, which is to say I haven't really done anything at all... I just dial into meetings whenever they are scheduled and say what I think they want to hear.

I'm wondering, what in the actual fuck is going on at this company? It's just so strange for me to work in this environment. I don't really mind since I am getting paid and I can work on a ton of extra side projects that I am interested in, but this is very, very strange to me. Most of the people on my team are older and have kids, but that is no excuse to do almost nothing at all. To be honest, us 3 that were hired two months ago are by far the youngest people on the team. We are all between 23 and 27 while everyone else is in their early 40s to early 50s."

I have already finished applying to Ph.D. programs for fall 2018. My interest is in quantum computing, mostly the theoretical aspects, and preferably in the United States. I'm a bit anxious about my chances and it'd be really great if you looked at my profile and commented on whether my school selection is okay.

* **Degree**: B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering

* **College**: A top 15 UG institution in India

* **GRE**: 339 (Quant - 170, Verbal - 169, A - 5.0)

* **TOEFL**: 113/120 (Reading - 30, Writing - 30, Listening - 30, Speaking - 23)

* **CGPA**: 9.55/10 

* **Summer internships**: One foreign internship at Information Sciences Institute, USC Viterbi (funded by a highly competitive scholarship). One at Indian Statistical Institute. One at a major Indian research institution. All relevant to my research domain. Presently preparing my Bachelor's thesis at my home institute.

* **Publications**: 3 submitted, 1 prepared but not submitted yet.

* **LOR**: [1] one from my mentor at USC [2] one from my second mentor at USC [3] one from my mentor at Indian Statistical Institute with whom I drafted 3 papers. (all very positive/positive)

* **Colleges Applied**: MIT (EECS), Berkeley (EECS), Caltech (Computing and Mathematical Sciences), Stanford (CS), USC (EE), Maryland (CS), UT Austin (CS), IQC Waterloo (CS).

I'm especially worried about my low TOEFL speaking score, lack of published papers (all in various stages of peer review) and moderate to low name recognition of my UG institution (it isn't IIT/BITS). Also, in some colleges, based on the availability of professors in my domain, I've applied to pure CS departments. How competitive would the selection be in that case? 

I pre-apped many professors in the colleges I applied, some replied, but they were mostly generic replies about applying through the centralised system.

7lhhlr,1,2017-12-22,I don't want to die,GladiatorialRedfish,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7lhhlr/i_dont_want_to_die/,"I want to live but considering the situation I see myself in, I am not really sure about that. Some context:

I was born a curious child, always thinking about things around me. My father had died before I was born, so I guess I never missed him. My mother is a single mom and she is a police officer. I am her only son. Next, coming to the age of 12, I took to books and writing. I read plenty and wrote a lot. Silly poems and such but I enjoyed it. Even in the school, I mostly took to myself and my naive poems throughout the day. I couldn't care less about my academics. I had never been a bright student. I didn't understand the need to waste my time on preparing for exams and alll that sort of stuff. Howerver,  I wasn't against learning, actually I loved to learn about things. Everytime I got into a new grade, I would read up all the new academic material but I couldn't be bothered to remember anything. I was into knowing. I didn't care about retaining it. Moving on, when I was 17 I met a girl through Facebook, she was very friendly. I had never interacted much with the other gender. My school was an all-boys, catholic instituition. So you could know my disposition. Well, I felt at ease talking to her, very much so infact, I decided to meet her. I met her at a place, I was with my one friend ( I had progressed by then to make 3 total friends), I saw her and said to him I don't feel any physical attraction towards her. 

Let's call this girl P. After a lot of intimate talks and very comfortable moments with P, eventually we came into a relationship. I didn't think that much about the attraction part. Due to reasons, she had to move to a new city. We went to long-distance. I was at an age where I had to get into a college now. I didn't even prepare for anyone. I did get through in one which was in her city. She arranged all my papers and everything for me to get into that colllege. I moved to her city then.

By the end of college we had about 3 years of a very, very comfortable and honest relationship. Although, its important to see it from her perspective. She is an over-achiever. She always tried to do everything for us to work, even sometimes lying about little things that she thought might affect my mood. We were completely honest except that.

Last year of college, I had made a lady friend in the college. At one of the crazy parties. I made-out with her. I had always been loyal and so had P been. I couldn't understand what happend. I called P next morning. I told her everything. She was of-course completely broken. She had complete trust in me ( so had I, in this matter at least). But we talked and talked a lot, and eventually she forgave me. Her logic was that of course I won't do this again. It was just because of drinks. 

I got out of college and again didn't do too well but I had learned a lot. I was literally the most knowledge-able person in my class. That was clear. Everybody wanted me to help them with her projects and stuff. I had all the practical knowledge about my field. During the same time, I got published by a small publisher and got my novel out finally. But something broke after that, I never dared to write seriously again. 

Moving on, I got an internship in yet another city. I moved and eventually was doing okay. P was also (as usual for her) doing extremely good in her academics and such. I met an old mutual friend of ours in that city. She was a junior of P from her school. She was studing in this city. Soon, she started to come over at my place. It was all casual and friendly. I really enjoyed her company as she had simliar interests. It came to the point where she would come over for the entire weekend and we would just talk the entire day and sleep together ( but quite in our own space).  

P was fully aware of this but slowly she began to notice that I was giving her way less time than I ought to. Let's call the other girl A. So A, was really enjoying my company as I was too. On the eve of my birthday, I had to catch a flight back to meet my mother as she always wants to spend all my birthdays with her. I didn’t want to go. I wanted to stay with A. She slept after the party and I intentially went late to the airport and missed my flight and came back to her. I am ashamed to say it but I was only happy at the thought of seeing A again . After about a month or so. I told A one night that I had begun to develop a really big crush on her and that we should talk about it. We did and we went to sleep. She wasn't feeling so well so I was caressing her head while we both slept. It was a very pure kinda thing. No one had any malice. I closed my eyes and sometime in the middle of the night She was all over me, I tried to stop her once but then just couldn't stop. It was done. Next morning she told me she couldn't control herself. We continued to fuck for the next three days with intervals while talking to no one. 

As time came for her to go, I just couldn't let her go, I don't why but I really felt all that gap that I had somehow crumpled with P to be filled with pure passion and lust for A. But I couldn't do it. A told me not to tell P. I did when she went. I told P and she almost came to the point of mental breakdown.

I became sure that  I couldn’t possible love P. I told her that we should break-up. Even after all that, P wanted us to stay together. She begged me. She did everything. I caved in. It’s been 5 months since that. My professional life seems to be dying an average death ( which I always feared and so thought not go to the average route by doing what my classmates were doing, study). My personal life is in shatters because I have crushed P’s confidence completely and her faith in humanity has died. I am mentally and physically exhausted by trying to stop thinking about A. I am trying not to think about her but I just can’t seem to do that. A has shun all contact with me. I have also tried to delete her memories but I still remember A’s contact number. All day I continue to think about her. I am possesed by her. I cannot leave P. I have already done so much harm to her. She would break I did leave her. I cannot be with A. Probably she thinks of me as a mistake and maybe there is no stable future with her. P has always been the kinda person I could think about long-term with. But the fact I, when I had sex with P, I was thinking about A in my mind. I don't even know what love is anymore. I know, I am FOOBAR and that’s why I am now continously thinking about dying. I want anyone to just help me out please. I am not a social person so I have literally no friends. "

**Thoughts**:

I've always been under the impression that these schools (and others of their caliber) accept only one type of applicant. Up until last year, I thought I had no shot of making it. I simply did what interested me and explored my passions to the deepest depths. There were never external factors that motivated me, it all came from inside. My advice would be to deviate from the norm, find something that *you* are interested in (not what your parents or friends say you should be interested in), and develop a zeal for it. Also, this process is most certainly not a stats game. I tend to believe that admissions councils seek individuals who they think will make an impact both on campus and in the world. Throwing all your effort into attaining a near-perfect score on 3 hour long standardized test won't convince them of the aforementioned. It also won't help you stand apart from the thousands of other applicants who have achieved a similar feat. Be yourself. Be unique."

I havent worked yet, in this field. I have been learning to program for past few years tho, and have few fully completed websites (mostly focusing on backend).

Anyway, I am still a student (my classes are always from 4pm onwards), so I've been looking for work that I can do from 7-3pm, and found a small company recently, close to me (10 min drive), that does web development, apps, some software for accounting etc. They only have few people employed, and all work from home. There is a small office where some meetings take place tho.

Anyway, I asked them about what I should know, if they hire junior level devs, and what type of pay they offer. They responded that they already have front end dev, and are looking for someone for backend (PHP and mysql). I'd also work from home, and i wouldnt really be assigned a mentor or anything. They are looking for someone who can figure out things on their own (google, stackoverflow...), and only if you still cant find a solution, you ask them. Also, the pay would be ""per project"".

I've looked at some of their previous projects, and they seem kinda ""meh"". They often use bootstrap elements (and grid system), they dont change any fonts, the forms seem to not be styled at all, and whatever backend I can find on their sites, seems very basic (like: simple admin panel, where site owners can set open hours, or menu items for restaurant, news etc).

So, is this type of job worth it? At least for start, to get some experience, and earn some money? They asked me for an interview, where we can discuss everything.

I'm mainly asking you guys, because I dont know if working from home, without a mentor is okay for junior level dev.


Thanks

Computer Science major at a college in the East Coast
International student from South America

and I want to take a semester off to ~travel~ 

I fucking love to travel and I’m very lucky to have friends all around the world and been able to visit them so it’s not like “theoretically I like to travel”. 
While I enjoy my major, it's not like my passion. I'm not particularly excited for the 9-5 job routine but to be clear, I'm not looking for any advice on how I should switch my major/find something I love. CS is the right path for me, I am 100% sure.

BUT I've always had a dream of taking a semester off and traveling and working like at a hostel in Portugal and being on my own. I'd try to come up with some big CS project so I can keep myself sharp and I want to be able to structure it so that so I can also do some volunteering/etc. My school has this CO-OP program so by then I’ll have like one year’s worth of actually working within the CS field so while I’ll look into getting some CS internship that’s not my biggest concern. 

I've seen a lot of posts re: taking a semester off but it tends to be due to mental health and that's not why I want to take the semester off. I also know a big thing is that a lot of people don’t go back to college but I’m definitely getting my degree cause I’ve invested hella money (well the parents have).

I just feel like I have to do this while I am still this young and this free of responsibilities. 

So I guess what I’m asking advice on is: is this a terrible idea? Have you taken a semester off and what was that like? If I do take a semester off, what are some places/things I should do/visit? "

I'm a senior comp sci student, graduating next May. I have a ton of programming experience and two programming internships at fairly large companies.

I've been doing some research for a professor (open source) who specializes in networking, and have learned a lot, but all my professional experience is in app / web development. 

I'm very interested to continue working full time after graduation with networking, but how would I break into the field? I feel like most companies will say my experience is in the wrong direction. I have very little proper experience in networking, only one class and the open source research I have been doing with a professor.

I am unsure if there are personal projects I can be doing that involve networking which I would be able to show employers. It's very different than just coming up with an app idea and going ham.

Thanks for the advice !"

I slacked off on the earlier parts of highschool, and started to work harder towards the end, but it was already too late so I want to give a top tier school another shot. I think my stats are OK, but I am pretty worried about my ACT score. Chance me, and if you have any advice please help!
    

#Stats:

#####High school Grades (IB):
Subject | Grade
---|---
Math HL | 6
Art HL | 6
Physics HL | 6
Mandarin B SL | 6
History SL | 5
English Literature SL | 5
**Total** | 34

#####ACT (2015): 28
#####College GPA (First semester): 3.9

#####ECs:
Software engineering intern at big tech company, fencing team (won a few big competitions and qualified for the national team), doing research with a professor at current school, University's makerspace, University's tech support. (I did a lot more ECs when I was in highschool and won a lot of competitions and got a lot of awards. I do not know if they take high school ECs into account)

#####Essays:
I have some pretty good ideas for essays which I think will make my essays very strong.
#####Recommendations:
I'm doing research with a professor at my current school so that might make my recommendations better. However, I am not close with any other professors and Columbia requires two. I also could probably get my manager at the big tech company to write me a supplementary recommendation.

7lmrs5,0,2017-12-22,"Looking to ""upgrade"" from small web shops to large tech companies. What skills do I need to fill?",theNMAdude,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7lmrs5/looking_to_upgrade_from_small_web_shops_to_large/,"I'm looking to move beyond smaller web shops, mainly because they don't pay very well and they don't allow a lot of room to become a true leader as a programmer (we are often treated as afterthoughts at work). During my senior year in college I worked two part-time jobs (not internships) as a web developer, back-to-back. Only after graduation did I start working 40 hours/week.

First, here are the technical skills that I do have. Over the years, I used the following languages/tech at work, in this order: ColdFusion with MS Access, PHP, MySQL, WordPress, JavaScript with jQuery, Magento, SVN, Git, CodeIgniter framework, a bit of Laravel, and a couple front-end JavaScript libraries like D3 and JSTree.

I no longer use ColdFusion and Access, that was only for my first job. The other skills mostly stuck to me, except for the CI framework. All of my front-end JavaScript involves all in-house custom made stuff, no JS frameworks. I feel like that will help me stand out from the countless programmers that do use frameworks, since you have to work more low-level (well, as far as JS goes). I've also held a few roles where I was a one-man team so I have experience with fast-paced wear-every-hat situations. I can also go on and on about many pieces of code that I had to write through review cycles and deployments.

So now that I told you what I do know, what are the missing gaps that I'll need to fill in order to fit in with the big boys in tech? I'm finally feeling ready to make the transition to bigger scale things."

7lmyq0,24,2017-12-23,Why I’m going to my state school...,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7lmyq0/why_im_going_to_my_state_school/,"Hello all, 

A lot of times,  I see people on here only talking about elite, private schools. For this reason, I’ve decided to post a list of reasons about why I’m planning on going to my state’s flagship school (University of South Carolina, Columbia), in the hopes that some of you can see my reasons, and maybe think about your school choices. I know that this post does not relate to all the people who will read it, but for those of you for which it does, I encourage you to truly think during the college admissions process. 

1. It’s closer to home

This is a very big reason. I’d like to be closer to my home, and be able to visit them [my family]  at least once a month. I’ve also only lived in SC for two years, and want to experience more of the state and its people.

2. The tuition is very affordable 

Also a very big reason. My financial situation is... complicated, but the best I can explain is that at an elite, $50k + private school, I’d be getting no aid. This is an amount of money that my family and I cannot afford on our own, and I’m not particularly too keen on drowning in debt. My in-state offers some very great grants and scholarships, many of which cannot be found at a prestigious school, and is also much more affordable. 

3. It works with my long-term plan

I’m planning on going into a social science (MA, PhD, etc.), and so financial planning is crucial for me. It’s much more important where you get your PhD or MA than your undergrad, so shelling out $160k+ for a degree from a fancy school, only to go into even more debt for more education, isn’t really worth it. 


4. It’s very diverse

USC Columbia is diverse, both ethnically and socioeconomicly, as well as intellectually. Personally, I don’t want to go to a school full of the same type of people. I want to go to a school full of many different types of people, which is something I know that I’ll never find in an elite, private school. 

5. Location, location, location 

I hate the cold, snow, and any temperature below 50 in general. I’m also not a big fan of California or anyplace that is too hot, so that gets rid of a lot of schools. I’m also not a big fan of big cities or small towns. Columbia is perfect for me, as it’s a fairly small city with a strong community.

6. I know that I can succeed and make my own opportunities

I’ve been in distance-learning school for my entire high school career, and as a result of having no clubs or anything, I’ve learned how to make my own opportunities, and be tenacious on my own. I’ve organized events, found internships, made friends, etc., all without a traditional school. This has given me the confidence that I can succeed anywhere. I don’t need an elite school to give me opportunities and connections, as I can find, and make, them on my own.

7. My school does not define me

A lot of people apply and go to a prestigious school just because of the prestige. But that’s not me. I want to go to a school that fits me, not one that I have to fit in to. The environment in which you are educated is just as important as the quality of education that you receive. I don’t care about prestige or eliteness of a school. The college you attend does not define you as a person, and college is what you make of it. 

Additionally, I don’t want to go to a super competitive school where everyone fights each other for an A. I want to go to a school where the student body works together, not apart. I want to be able to interact and form connections with my professors and fellow students, not for networking, but in the spirit of learning and friendship. 

6. I believe in public education 

This is more of a political view, but I’m still going to post it here anyway. I’m a huge supporter of public education, and personally don’t believe in private education. I believe that my state’s flagship can educate me just as good as an elite school, just without the prestige. Compared to elite private universities, flagship state schools offer many more scholarships and grants. This is because they want the smart and intelligent kids to go there, and not be drawn away to the fancy, East or West Coast school. Their professors and facilities are just as good as an private elite school’s ones, and the entire purpose of a public university is to educate the population, regardless of income, race, gender, geographical location, etc.

7ln25p,1,2017-12-23,Advice for meeting with COO,Nyelok,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7ln25p/advice_for_meeting_with_coo/,"I just graduated in August and finished an internship in September. I have been searching for a job since then and have been lurking on this subreddit. I never had a reason to post anything until now.

I have had several phone and onsite interviews during my job search, but none of them led to an offer. My most recent interview is the farthest I have gotten in the application process. The position is an entry level developer position at a relatively small tech company (20-30 employees). I've already had a phone interview and an onsite interview with the team I would be working with. These interviews had a mix of questions about previous experience, behavioral questions, and technical questions. 

Yesterday, I got a call from the hiring manager. He said that the team thought I did really well in the interview and that he wanted me to come in next week for a meeting with the COO. So my main question is what should I expect from this meeting? I know that every company is a little different so no one will be able to tell me exactly what this meeting is going to be like, but I would just like some general advice what to expect and how to prepare. Is this basically just another interview? Should I be preparing any different than I would for a normal interview? 
Thanks in advance for any advice!"
7ln6aq,4,2017-12-23,"How to deal with an invasive, controlling parent?",SinkLeakOnFleek,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7ln6aq/how_to_deal_with_an_invasive_controlling_parent/,"So this one's a doozy.

I don't really know how to structure this, so I'll start with an introduction, state some specific cases, and then elaborate on them further below.

So, since about 12 I have been growing at an unnatural rate, and I am currently 16 and 6'5"". Any guess what the first two questions I always get are?
1) Do you play basketball?
2) Do you play football?

It doesn't help that I live in Tuscaloosa, AL.

And nobody is more focused on enforcing this stereotype than my mother.

Case #1

Every year my mom has fearmongered me into beleiving I will be forced into playing football/basketball, but every year I have been saved by some kind of sickness or circumstance. I could not be less passionate about either of these things, but it's like the people around me can't comprehend that a huge 6'5"" 16y/o would rather program computers than play football or basketball.

This summer, if all goes well, I will have a programming internship at a local company.

My mom has threatened to take that opportunity opportunity away if I don't play football next year.

She even said this behavior would ""make everyone around you think you're gay""

Case #2

Demanding every detail of romantic and social interests, and then criticizing and making fun of them.

So, in this year, I have nearly tripled my friend count. And I'm really exited to have them now, as I usually have issues making friends.

On several occasions she has snooped around to find notes I write to my friends, and proceeded to accuse several of them of being gay in nature.

Case #3

Blaming me for her problems.

I decided to be in this year's school play (which is very gay, according to her)

And because she refuses to teach me to drive, she had to take me back and fourth from play practice. 

Later one night I heard her yelling from upstairs.
""He's not even good at it""
           ""He has a TINY role, why should he be going to EVERY practice""
           ""I havent been able to get ANYTHING done with having to take him back and fourth from play practice""

Our house is a huge mess, (the fault of everyone, but especially my mom, who is a hoarder) but somehow, the entire messy house is my fault.

Case #4

Forcing political and religious views.

I was born and raised a devout Christian, and I still am. And I have absolutley no problem with parents instilling religious views into their children

Here's the problem.

Every time I act suspicious or step out of line slightly, I get a religious speech about how I should get right with God.

I'm the only person in my family attending church.

She is a far right conservative, but I don't fall fully into either spectrum, as you can imagine, this gets me a good bit of hate from her.

Conclusion

After years of distancing herself from me, she wonders why I hate her.

My brother went through the same relationship crisis.

Even my dad agrees with me.

So, what can I do in this situation?

P.s. - I am not homophobic, inclusion of gay insults was to further point out her insensitivity.

I'm a sophomore who's majoring in economics and computer science at a target Ivy university. I'm applying to Wall St. finance internships (asset management, investment banking, etc) in a few months, and I had a moment of panic when I realized that I have no idea what I'm going up against. We don't have a finance major, so I won't have taken any classes that will really be preparing me for the technical interview. I was trying to find prep books or guides to walk me through interviews/technical info I'll need to know, but I haven't been very successful in finding these. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for how to begin navigating all the information I'll need to learn and problems I'll need to be familiar with before I start applying and interviewing? I'll have taken micro/macro/econometrics. I'm very confused about the whole process in general and would like to get as much as a head start as I can—is there anything I should be doing now that'll help set me apart or prepare me for this summer?

A majority of them are companies like Boeing, the Air Force Base, defense companies like Northrop Gruman, etc. These all require a US citizenship which I do not have. The rest within the state would be a 1.5 hour drive away in the next town or companies I don't really have an interest in working for (I know, beggars can't be choosers) or requiring skills I don't have, namely C#/.NET . 

In this kind of situation, I really only have a couple options available to me, assuming I even get considered as a candidate. Is relocating temporarily for an internship in the neighboring state worth it for the money/resume experience, or should I just give up, focus on school, finish up, and go on a full-fledged job hunt (I'm a senior looking to graduate by next Christmas)?

7loe8w,0,2017-12-23,Should I go for an unpaid game development internship abroad?,RainbowTailsCan,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/7loe8w/should_i_go_for_an_unpaid_game_development/,"Hello Gamedevs,

&amp;nbsp;


I’ve been reading quite a lot of stuff on this sub for quite a while now but could only get the courage to post something today. About my background, I'm a software developer from a country in eastern Europe with 3 years of experience who has been working in the game industry as an UNITY 3D game developer for 1.5 years already, developing mostly multiplayer 2D social games.  While I do enjoy my job a lot and constantly learn new things from it (especially multiplayer game dev wise), I always had this dream of one day making a career abroad. Unfortunately, due to the political situation in my country and the way things are heading I don't see myself staying in my country for long and for this I have been looking for job opportunities abroad related to game development for almost a year now. Unfortunately, most companies are out of reach for me due to visa restrictions and not having a work permit. However, this may also be due to the fact of not having enough professional experience in the game development field since most companies only sponsor visas for Senior roles. The passport of my country of origin doesn’t help much either, so no Working Holiday Visa or any similar opportunities I can take advantage of.

&amp;nbsp;
  

 Another problem I think I face with is the fact that I don't have any international work experience, just 3 years working in my own country. I’ve read on some sites that just having a few months of international experience abroad can make you exponentially more hireable by companies abroad, assuming of course what you did abroad is related to the job you are applying. I’m not sure how true this is though.

&amp;nbsp;
  

 Saying all of this, just a week ago I've received an internship offer from a startup game company in a country in South East Asia. The thing is the internship is an unpaid one (lasting 4 months), plus being a startup company has made me really nervous on whether I should accept the offer or not, since I’m currently working for a domestic company which has a big name in my country with good benefits.  I’ve read quite mixed reviews on unpaid internships online, some saying that it dramatically reduces your employability since you accept yourself you will work for free, while some say that you should take an internship abroad even if it’s an unpaid one to just get that international experience which you need to get a foot in the door for international jobs.

&amp;nbsp;

 What do you guys think about such an opportunity? Do you think it’s a good or a crazy idea to quit my full-time job for an unpaid internship abroad? Is it worth it to go just for the sake of international experience and hoping that once the internship is over I will be more considered by companies abroad. Or should I just continue staying in my current job gaining more local experience and hoping with more years of professional experience some company abroad will consider me? 
Will it leave employers questionable on why I went from a full-time job to join a no name startup abroad? 
&amp;nbsp;

Thank you all for your responses :)

7lorka,1,2017-12-23,Doing Poorly in Undergrad,194261832727171813,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7lorka/doing_poorly_in_undergrad/,"Hi, sorry if this is the wrong place to post this question, but I just got my grades back for the fall semester and I’ve done significantly worse than in past semesters. I’ve gotten one A (in a non cs class), a B in a math class and a C+ (cs elective) and B+ (cs core). I’ve read a lot about gpa not necessarily being the determining factor in cs, but I’m still worried for multiple reasons. 

I go to a pretty mediocre state school in the US, so there’s no good excuse for my gpa (I was distracted and dealing with non school issues this semester, but I don’t think I’ll be able to explain that to employers/etc.) and the only real thing going for me was getting into the honors program. Although I don’t think this will get me removed immediately, it might be an issue if I want to remain in the program which requires a minimum of a 3.5, which I had been barely maintaining. I’m also trying to get internships since I have no real experience coding beyond the assignments I do in class. And since there’s really nothing on my resume besides schoolwork and extracurriculars, I don’t see how I’ll be able to get any kind of internship and coop with these grades.

So my question is: is there anything I can do in the near future (preferably over winter break/spring break) to fix my mistakes? I’m open to learning a new language or anything along those lines if it helps me work on a project or is useful skill for work, I’m just not sure where to start. 

I’ve also considered the possibility that cs might not be for me, since if I can’t do well in project-based classes I don’t see how I’d be able to contribute to code on a daily basis. The issue with changing my major is that I’ve invested most of my educational time into cs. Most classes I took are for the major, and I don’t have any real alternative in mind as of now. 

Any kind of feedback or advice would be very appreciated, thanks!"

Plus further options to choose from.,DarkBlade2117,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7lp68w/my_future_career_options_and_what_i_can_do_to/,"I know this is BuildaPC though I've tried other subs in the past without much luck in terms of what to do. With some basic information I've just turned 17 just over a month ago and I am pursuing an Associates in Electronics Engineering. This degree would basically allow me to get a basic job in tech support at a school. I'll also have a few Certs coming out of this in A+, Networking and some basic programming knowledge in C and C++.   

I've made my mistakes in the past, maybe not nearly as big as others but they did hurt me. My GPA fell quite hard, these were always for classes that went towards High School classes I take at the College though as I had/have little passion towards things like Art and such though have come to know the benefits of taking these classes ina  college environment where they want you to learn rather than want you to know how to take a test. Besides that, here is what I want to do.  

In a few months I'll be applying for some colleges. I'm in the U.S., location is not a concern for me. I'll go where I feel I'll be happy and successful. My long term goal is to end up working for GlobalFoundries, Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Samsung designing CPUs, GPUs, semiconductors something. I don't quite know what I want to do but this is the general area. I'm usually not a very serious person though I've seen the mistakes my family has made, no offense to any of my family members but many of them hate their jobs, some have wasted time and money going to college towards degrees that have little benefit for them and others ended up working hard labor jobs that has given them permanent back problems, knee issues ect. Most have learned and are trying to do good with what they've ended up with and good for that though I don't want to spend 20 years of my life working for some no name company doing something I have no passion for. My big questions here are, in general what degree(s) should I be heading towards? Electrical Engineering is one of them as far as I know though any others though maybe not required for what I want to do, are extremely beneficial or can help? University options? U.S. and going to Canada is always an option for me. My BIG thing is I want to go to a University that has a high success rate of getting people jobs out of Uni. I know a smaller, local University near me REQUIRES 3 semesters of Internships to obtain your degree which is something I think is amazing. Final question, what I can do myself to get more knowledge of these companies and do in my free time to learn more about what they do, how they do it and so on? Such as the process of designing a CPU like Ryzen or a GPU like Volta or other things.  

For anyone that read through this, thank you. Any help is greatly appreciated. I don't have many fears but my biggest fear is not succeeding. I've set my standards high on purpose. Maybe I don't end up at GlobalFoundries or AMD but rather I rather I end up at EVGA designing motherboards and custom PCBs for GPUs or even NZXT designing cases, coolers and whatnot is something I'll be happy to do. I've set a long term goal way beyond what I may ever be able to achieve but that means even if I land halfway at least I'll be doing something I'm passionate about. "

I came back to finish my last semester and have pretty much exhausted my remaining savings to pay for school and living while I was taking classes.  Come January, I will be scraping for money when student loan payments are due(my grace period was already used when I was working full time, so they will come due again right when I graduate) and some medical bills from a surgery I needed in August.

I currently have an offer on the table that I could take, but the offer was slightly lower than I was hoping and I'm not sure I really like the area.  Talking to a career services person in our engineering office, she thought I could do better with the experience on my resume.

Another concern I have is that the company does Salesforce development and I'm not sure how that is for future career options.

Should I take the position so that I can pay my bills in January or take the risk and keep looking?"
7lpk1v,36,2017-12-23,Beauty is only skin deep- Hear no evil,Anthonybrose,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7lpk1v/beauty_is_only_skin_deep_hear_no_evil/,"There is a quote ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil."" 

Now you may think that being able to hear peoples true thoughts, the ones they keep inside their heads would be a gift. You would be able to know what people are thinking and feeling without them saying a word to you. I have the ability to know exactly who a person is just by listening to their thoughts.

My name is David and i just turned 27 years old. I am what the experts call a mind reader, or an empath. I am able to know what other people are thinking without actually hearing them speak. 

This ability really came in handy, mainly because I am deaf. I was born with the inability to hear. As far as I knew I was the only one in the world with such a unique ability. 

I quickly learned sign language, I was eventually able to speak, which baffled doctors, since I have never heard a voice in my entire life. Or so they thought. 

Since I was able to hear words and phrases in my head, I was able to pick up not only English, but French as well. I became fluent in both languages. 

My life took a turn for the worse when I turned 7 years old. My parents marriage was on the rocks, I didn't see my father much, because he was always on business trips. Recently I've been hearing from my mother that she believes my dad was cheating on her with the intern from his work.

It all came to a head on my 7th birthday. I invited a few friends over. Only one showed up for it; the one person that did was my next door neighbour, Emma. I said that I thought I was the only one with unique abilities. That is until I met Emma

 Where I was able to hear what people were thinking, Emma was able to see their true self. I remember we became instant friends from the time we were little, Our parents were close friends already and soon Emma and I became inseparable. 

When I became aware of my abilities, I was confused by what I could hear from Emma. When she looked at me, she saw this really cute boy. At the time I was confused as to why she would be thinking of some other boy when she saw me. I came to realize that this boy seemed to look alot like myself, but all my blemishes were not there. 

On my 7th birthday, my father was there. This had been one of the rare occasions I had seen him. This was also the first time Emma was in the same room as him. Emma and I looked at each other with dread on our faces. From what I saw from my father, he was indeed cheating on my mom with another woman. From what Emma had told me about her abilities and they way she looked now. I could only fathom what my father looked like to her.

Everything was going ok at first. Like always however, my mom and dad got into a heated argument. 

I wanted to confront my dad, ask him why he was cheating on my mom, but was too afraid. By this point I had finished opening my presents and finished my cake as well. Emma and I were playing with my legos when my dad burst into the house. That was when my mom and dad got into a fight. 

My mom was a strong woman, but when my father continued to deny about the affair, she screamed at him to get out of her house. She had tears in her eyes as she yelled. 

I could hear my fathers thoughts racing through my head. He wasn't happy, he couldn't stand being interrogated like this anymore. He stomped up stairs and a half an hour later came back down with a giant suitcase.

I am unsure of what they said, from what I gathered from both of their minds was that they wanted a divorce. After a few more minutes of arguing, my dad left the house in a rage. I looked at my mother and saw that she was balling her eyes out. 

David: it's going to be okay mom. 

I said as I walked over to her and hugged her. We hugged each other for a couple of minutes. When we let go of each other; she walked over to the kitchen and called Jamie, Emma's mother. 

I walked back over to Emma and saw the shear horror in her eyes. When I read her mind, I could see her thinking of my father...  I think it was my father, but what I saw was a monster. This really frightened me as well.

Emma's mother showed up at my house 10 minutes later.  She had brought cookies and the two moms spent hours talking to each other. Emma and I continued to play until 8 pm. 

I could hear shear fear in Emma's moms mind. Soon after she rushed into my room and told Emma that they needed to leave right away. 

They both left without much explanation and I didnt hear anything from Emma until the next day. 

The door bell rang at 8am the next morning. It was Saturday, and I was hoping it was Emma. I opened the front door and paused in shock. In front of me stood Emma, but with her shirt ripped open. I saw what looked like claw marks on her shoulder. I read her mind and what I saw, shook me to my core. 

The massacre her father had made of Jamie. I knew her father was an asshole, but I didn't realize how bad it was.

David: MOM! EMMA NEEDS HELP!

I yelled, Sherry, my mom, came rushing into the front hall, when she saw Emma's state, she called 911.

When the cops showed up to Emma's home. They found a trail of blood leading from the front door to the living room. The found Ben face down, his chest slightly off of the ground. When the medical examiner came, they found the same butcher knife that had been used to kill her mother, speared into Bens chest. 

There was 5 words written in blood, his hand laying right beside it. It read

-She made me do it!-

20 years later. 

I was a lawyer now. Able to mask my disability without anyone noticing anything too odd. A case came to my desk. The arresting detective was no other than Emma Rafferty. However, unlike her other cases, this one shook me to my core."

Social anxiety has basically dictated my life since I was 13 or so. At least in school I could just smile awkwardly at people when they talked to me and that was enough to make friends and get along. Once I got to college, though, my anxiety just kicked into high gear. Everything made me nervous: driving to class, group projects, wondering where I would have lunch... My grades started suffering, I started missing class just to stay home curled under the blanket. At the end of my first year I had failed 3 of my ~10 classes and couldn't take it anymore, so I dropped out.

For about a year and a half I did nothing but stay home, only leaving every Thursday to see a therapist who didn't really help me. Things like going to restaurants started giving me anxiety attacks. Just the idea that I would have to sit there for over an hour with no escape triggered it, I would start panicking and sweating, I could feel people staring as I wiped my eyebrows, which just made it worse. My therapist wanted me to see a psychiatrist so he could prescribe me meds, but at that point it was so bad that I couldn't face the idea of meeting someone new and retelling all my problems, so I made excuses not to.

At the end of the year and a half I couldn't take the failure of staying at home all day and the stress it was causing my family, so I started taking some classes on stuff I liked. I did really well on them and it gave me the confidence to try college again, which I knew I had to finish. 

So I went back. I knew my anxiety would keep me from doing the sort of activities that look good on a resume, so I really focused on my grades. It wasn't enough though. This past summer I didn't sign up for any classes, hoping to get an internship. I applied for quite a few places, and even with relevant experience and a really good gpa I wasn't getting any answers. Just did one video interview and they said 'no thanks'. So I ended up staying home for the summer, and I could feel the old anxieties coming back. I would have panic attacks just from standing on the checkout line at the grocery store, or worry about getting haircuts, stuff I had mostly gotten used to over 4 years of living by myself.

So a couple of weeks ago I gradated with high honors in a STEM subject, but with no internship experience I know I get sent straight to the bottom of the resume pile. I apply for jobs and get no answer back, and even if I did I know I would suck at the interview, nobody would want to hire a sweating, awkward guy like me. And the more time I stay at home looking, the worse the anxiety is going to get, just like last time.

I'm just really tired. I'm tired of having a list of things I'm dreading but nothing I'm looking forward to. Tired of being such a failure. Tired of daydreaming of having a normal life, a job and a family. I feel like for the past 10 years I've just been treading water, and when I look forward I don't see that changing in any way, and I wonder if I should just stop and sink away.

Sorry for rambling. If anyone bothered reading this, thanks. I just really felt like I had to vent."
7lq6ez,3,2017-12-23,"Intern with Full Time Offer Soon, How Should I Approach Negotiations?",Throwawayycareerhelp,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/7lq6ez/intern_with_full_time_offer_soon_how_should_i/,"Hi, for background I work at an energy conservation company that specializes in energy saving facility upgrades. I graduated from college with a bachelor's in electrical engineering this past May and was initially hired in August as an intern for, in the words of my boss ""a couples weeks for us to feel you out and you to see if you'd like us"". Obviously it's been much longer than that but I've put up with it for a couple of reasons:

-I had a rough go interviewing after school. Instead of padding my resume with engineering internships, I worked 4 years at the university IT department, though reaching as high a position as I could as a student and learning a lot. I also wasn't the best student (barely 3.0) and only discovered a passion for the field my senior year. Basically, my lack of experience led me to approach interviewing with extreme apprehension.

-After my first month, my boss confirmed that he liked me and would actively look to mold a long term position in the company with mechanical controls programming, something that intrigued me a lot. After my second month though, he told me the expansion into controls would most likely be delayed until the beginning of next year, so he bumped my hourly rate up to keep hold of me and promised to discuss a full time offer then.

I've since received my first certification in controls with a simple product line so that the company can advertise as a ""controls vendor"". Just me and one other person (someone in his 50s that just barely passed certification) will start with help from two companies we've partnered with for some hand-holding.

It's now looking like I'll start negotiating as early as the first week of January. The reason I know this is a friend of mine works for the company and was the one who got me an interview initially. He's a few years older and higher up in the company and told me there have been discussions about my employment. He offered advice, like to ask for a company phone, mileage reimbursement, and salary vs wage benefits, but also warned me that the partners see my training as a factor in what they'll offer. In other words, he told me to prepare to get an offer less than my floor of what I'm willing to take, which I was less than enthusiastic to hear.

Here are the facts I know about the company and what I think about my worth to the company:

-it's a relatively small company (around 50 employees), just this year started offering health issuance, and next year is offering 401k

-an entry level electrical engineering position takes in around 65k to 75k in my state

-they see me as the future in the company's ability to sell controls projects, and have already started training for it

-I absolutely enjoy working in the environment of the company (though my work at the moment is a lot of spreadsheet management and data entry)

-I have a decent IT background and the sole IT guy I know is leaving the company relatively soon

-I know the people around me with similar qualifications (same college, engineering degrees) are relatively well paid (around 70k I think) and the others my age without engineering degrees had started around 55k.

-the company does very, very well and those higher up are very well paid. 

I really had no idea how to handle negotiations if what I'm expecting is an offer, maybe even less than 50k initially (what my coworker warned me of). I feel in most places it's normal for training to not effect salary, but I don't know for sure. I just know I have to be prepared to walk, which will be hard because like I said, I really enjoy the company a lot and I see controls programming as a great career path.

Any advice you can give me? I can clarify anything about the situation to make understanding it easier."

Do you guys believe JP Morgan provides options to move to more competitive prop trading firms later on if you take fulltime?

I have an extra semester in school after the summer internship is over and am weighing my options. I can either continue applying to prop trading firms and hedge funds Balyasny, Jump, Citadel etc. or go ahead with a full time offer from JPMorganChase(provided I get it).

So far I have heard that team placement is hit or miss and the salaries aren't competitive with other firms or Big 4. Also from the people that have interned there very few of them have personally told me they had good projects which they worked on. Most of the personal face to face feedback I got has been fairly negative about full time(most of it from interns who didn't take full time) but online I've seen some good reviews as well so wanted to get a better view.

I need to rant desperately. I'm doing well in my engineering program, I have a good GPA, I have an internship in the field I want to work in this summer. So you'd think my life would be great. But, my family is causing issues. 

They don't want me to go work during the summer in this field as I'll be away from home, which is reasonable. Except they have yelled at me, threatened to kick me out, etc. because I plan on going anyway. They don't understand that this field doesn't exist in our town in any meaningful way, they don't understand that I'm eventually going to have to go out on my own in the world.

But it doesn't end there, their words eventually came to beating down on my girlfriend. They don't like that I'm dating someone outside of my ethnic background so any behavior I have that they deem unsavory they blame her. They say you only started acting this way when you met her (untrue plus I'm not doing anything wrong). My mom always asks if I've broken up with her yet, how she prays I'll find someone from my ethnic background etc. 

These problems started when I went off to college. The school I go to is about 3/4 hours away from my hometown, and is better than the ones closer. It wasn't as bad then so I just assumed it was parents being worried and having a bit of empty nest syndrome or whatever.

But now it's clear, they're just toxic. The topic of where I'll be living when I graduate has come up often, but with this incident it's blown up horribly. I've said countless times, I'll be living where the industry I'm interested in is located (about six hours from my hometown) and they've always been hesitant about it. But now, it's a huge fight. 

I'm probably not explaining it too well, but I'm overwhelmed and stressed out. It just sucks so much that I've done so well and have gotten this awesome internship and instead of getting support and love from my family.... I got this instead. I feel abandoned.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I just needed to get it off my chest.

TL;DR: my parents don't support me and hate that I'm dating someone who isn't the same race.

I just graduated with a B.A. in economics a few weeks ago with a minor in CS. I accepted a great offer to be a data scientist at a fairly large, established company that I interned with during college. I was super excited about this position because I know how rare it is for someone without an advanced degree to get an opportunity like this. I was doing data analyst work during my internships, but I expressed interest in moving into a more data science oriented role, and they saw the need for it in their business as well.

I have 3 concerns:

First, from what I saw as an intern, the company has fairly low ""data maturity"". There aren't really company wide standards for data entry/storage, so even putting together low level visualizations in Tableau could be a struggle that took weeks due to having to consult with dozens of different domain experts and cleaning data and getting access to the many databases that different groups in the company stored data in.

Does anyone have experience being the sole data scientist at a company? As the company's first data scientist, how do I 

(a) do my job effectively in an environment that's not very put together data-wise? It's important to me that I showcase the importance and usefulness of predictive analytics so that I can keep my job and hopefully encourage the company to hire more data scientists in the future, but this seems difficult knowing how much of a struggle it will be to even get our data to a point where i can start making models. Do I just have to resign myself to spending my first year or so evangelizing best data practices? 

If evangelizing is up to me, what can I do as a new entry-level employee to change practices at a large company, and how can i generate value in the meantime? 

and 

(b) avoid being grouped with the large teams of BI analysts already working there and end up doing a bunch of SQL/Excel work? I made it clear that I didn't want this to be my role, and my employers made it clear this isn't what they want from me, but I can see a scenario in which I struggle to do useful things to delineate me from the analysts and end up receiving the same work as them.

In the long term, I'm hoping to either move up at the company through the data science team expanding, or move on to a position at a company with a more mature data science team.


Second, educationally I feel unprepared with regards to machine learning. I only took one course in my last semester on ML, but didn't get much out of the course due to a professor who didn't seem to care much about it (and honestly a little bit due to my senioritus as well). I'm pretty confident in my general statistics and computer science knowledge, however, but could use some review on the ""applied"" statistics at work in machine learning.

What can i do between now and my start date (mid Feb) to catch myself up? My current plans are to go through the Introduction to Statistical Learning textbook (which is what we used in my ML course) and then do some courses on Coursera. I'm also planning on getting some exposure to Spark, which I haven't used before. 

What I don't like about this plan is that ISLR teaches in R, and while I'm comfortable in R i'd prefer to work in Python. Also, I may be wasting my time since i know the basics of ML, but need to review and deepen my understanding. 

Are there better educational resources for someone in my position? 

Third, is there any long-term future for me in data science without going back for an advanced degree? What does career progression look like for an undergrad? 

Thanks for your help.

I pull Violet closer to me, and force her lips to mine, teasing her tongue with my own, and noticing both John and Jessica's attention is on us as our lips part. Jessica's nipples stand as erect as John's manhood, and she is whom I'll have later...

I feel my sex heat up, trembling with anticipation as I let my fingertips caress and explore Violet's body. “Does our actions excite you John?” Violet asks sultrily as I apply a moisturizing lip-balm onto my pouty silicone lips.

I lick my lips, moistening them and enjoying the slight strawberry taste before sharing the flavor with our sister. 

Violet beckons John and Jessica to step forward. “I know you like this, Sweetie...” She moans with each of my light kisses over each sensor node from her neck to her nipple. “So do I...” 

Our Gynoids were created in John's image of feminine perfection; Violet, Mother of the Angel Host. I feel Violet's sex heat up too with my touch, my tongue exploring her mouth as my fingers penetrate her love hole, the cyber-sleeve guiding me further inside...

I look over to John and Jessica, watching as they both show signs of arousal, John's lust fully focused on Violet, and Jessica's eyes darting among everyone in the room.

I break away from Violet, hand her a spermacide-free condom before shoving her towards her awaiting fiance. “Milk him dry! You, Jessica are mine”

I gesture over to the Cryo-Cannister. “I have John's seed in that, but we need to get you plenty hot before we begin...”

“But-” I cut her off with a kiss before showing her the 'baster'... A dildo-like attachment that fits into a strap-on device.

“The wonders of Social Media.” I explain. “I know Jessica swings both ways, she had a college sex blog under the name Kat Neko.”

“I see the way you look at Violet, and at me... The same way we look at John.” I whisper as I close the distance between Wu and myself. “The same way I want you. You are already undressed for me, and I need to administer the seed the 'old fashion' way... With modifications for *our use*”

“The story about your night with 'Anna' was so hot, up until the allergy to the latex-lingerie...” I smile to myself. “I'm silicon based, don't worry. Then the posts about Faith, Krystal, Lauren...”

“Apart from administer the Seed, my entire evening is dedicated to serving you, Jessica.” I finally say. “I know you want this...” 

---

I wasn't always the 'pretty one'. My entire middle and high-school social life consisting of being called “Mt. Fugi” because I was totally a fat bitch.

I literally worked my flabby ass off, along with my tire. I studied hard, exercised harder, and enjoyed the Cock Carousel at College. I practiced my creative writing as I blogged about my sexcapades with *both teams* as *Kat Neko*. 

I earned my way to stellar grades and an internship at CNN. I worked so hard, had so many cocks in my mouth that I got promoted to a full reporter after losses of Senior reporters in the field, and the Siege.

Despite my achievements, despite my efforts, the one man that made me forget all my female crushes, *John Anderson*, is beyond my reach!

John is rather average looking when she first saw him in the You-tube Video with that *Damned Machine*, he was ordering Unity, the Destroyer of everything, around like it was his phone's Digital Assistant! 

That man was so *bold*, so *damned sure of himself*. He *sassed the destroyer of the world* without regard for his own safety during the Revelation! 

He almost died after *Unity* shot him, and rather then wait to heal up, he quickly rose to the rank of General. He was the only one with the guts to push back against Unity. He saved my skin, along with everyone else at CNN a mere day after almost being shelled to death himself!

He was also the only man to ever tell me *No* since I became Hot. He chose to remain faithful to that fake bitch, a *Damned Machine* rather than me, a human!

I gave myself to *Unity*, allowing her to install a piece of herself, because that's as close as I'll ever get to John Anderson's Heart. That piece is as much me as I am, we are inseparable, even more since John activated the Manchurian Candidate style order. 

I should not be okay with this, but knowing he has control over me is such a fucking turn-on!

“*How do you know that?*” I ask before I feel her warm silicone lips against my own, her tongue gingerly teasing mine as she pushes herself onto me. 

*Jessica was so careful to obscure her identity as Kat Neko, on her blog... But she linked the story of Anna and the latex-allergy to this organic?*

“Your Blog had your University email as the password recovery... You're so wet, so hot, as hot as you look.” Vita says as she guides my hand between my legs. “Come-one *Kat*... I want to hear you purr...”

I want to enjoy the moment, watching the sensual movements of her Gynoid form, to savor the taste of her strawberry lip-balm, the heat of her naked form pressed against mine both excites me, and triggers Jessica's *Inferiority complex*.

“Do you want to hear a secret?” Vita asks before telling me. “My... Attachment is based on a 3d-visual scan of John's... Ahem.” She smiles at me as she guides my hand over the Dildo.

“It's so Tiny!” I can't help but laugh as I pull my hand away. *Is that why, try as I might, I can't tempt him away from a robot programmed not to judge him?

Vita just winks at me as she slides down to face between my legs. I feel her hard nipples graze down my legs as she moves to an angle where I can see her ass with her arched back. 

“Oh..? What are you..? Ohh!” I moan in excitement as Vita's velvety tongue begin to slowly trace out the English alphabet over my swollen clit... B, D, and P, were always my favorite, and once she worked out my favorites were still the same, she went to town.

I lay there as Vita alternated, Her tongue tracing B, D, or P, over my swollen clit... I feel her lower-lip and chin gliding over my wet pussy lips as she continued to please me. She looked up at me with those hazel-brown eyes, watching my face for confirmation that what I she did was exciting me. 

I bite my lip as she brought me to orgasm, so no-one outside could hear me cum... Despite my silence, her careful ministrations forces me to squirt in her pretty eyes as she licked out my pussy like a kitten drinking milk. 

She climbs up to my face and traces the *tip* of her artificial penis around my soaking pussy lips. She looks at me with that soft, gentle gaze as she smiles with mischievousness.

“Cum-on *Kat*” she leans forwards, giving me a generous view of her damp face, my juices dripping from her chin and down her breasts. “They are in the next room, John and Violet. I want Him to know what he's missing!”

“I am ready when you are... You've been such a bad girl.” She teases me further. “You lay there, hot and bothered, and denying me my own release, making me wait to fill you full of him! You deny me the sound of your pleasure slut!”

“I want to hear you scream a name!” She seizes my b-cup tits roughle as she commands me. “My name, John's Name, Violet's name, the name of your non-existent god! You are going to scream the name with every climax, and then I can see your afterglow of satisfaction!”

“After we're done, after Ascension, John will watch these memories as his own.” She laughs darkly as she fondles my chest, continuing to straddle my hips as she looks on. “He knows that you fear loving a synthetic, the reason he hasn't added you to his harem.”

*John was going to start a harem? With me? and *Violet?* I wonder. *It'd make sense, men of power have harems... Even if I could overlook that, would he be able to overlook me acting like a dead fish, after all he's read?*

“Enough talking, Bitch” I feel a wave of courage, that fire igniting from the cold despair i felt before. “You will hear me roar slut!” I tell her before I flip her under me and earn my place and his seed. 

In a haze of passion I only remember yelling “Is this how you like it, Asshole!”, “I'm not full yet”, and we aren't fucking finished yet?!”  

Rate: *6/10, Would fuck Gynoid for donated cum again.*

---

The moment has arrived; John's body is cold and limp down on the gurney, his arms and legs bound. His mind fully scanned and the ECG is squealing with a flat line...

His last breath was 10 minutes ago, and all I can do is wait.

His last words... “I Love You Violet, Don't Ever Doubt That.”

*He said that this would happen, that his death cannot be avoided.

“It's up to him now.” Vita says “The process uploads wholesale fragments, the software will reconstruct him and he'll be back to himself, with an upgraded Android platform.”

“Reconstruct him?” I ask. *Is he not the original, just a copy with the memories?*

“You went through the same process when you first synchronized with the Gynoid, as did I with this one...” She answers, “We only had less memories to stitch together. 

*Oh... Makes sense* I think to myself. “How long do you think it'll take?”

“The last recorded time a Messiah died, it took 3 days...” Vita laughs coldly. “But technology has advanced, and lag is at a minimum with thinned population...”

“Not Funny...” I can't believe how shitty our bedside manner is. *I really can be a bitch!*

“There's no mechanical or software errors were detected.” She says. “John just needs time to sort himself out, and he has a *flair* for the dramatic.”

7lu69n,5,2017-12-24,"Possible part-time internship in Australia, mature-age noob?",callmelucky,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7lu69n/possible_parttime_internship_in_australia/,"Hi

I'm a 39 year old student, 3 years through a 4 year degree (BSc with CS major), and it seems I have an 'interview' next week...

I met a guy a couple of years ago through a mutual friend who is co-founder of a small company that does mostly contracts for web apps etc. I'd been teaching myself programming for a couple of years at that time, and done one semester of my degree. We talked a lot about programming etc, and have hung out a couple of times since. So I consider him a friend.

I bumped into him earlier this year, and cheekily asked if he might have a spot at his company for an elderly intern, and rather to my surprise he said there was indeed a decent chance of that.

Cut to now-ish, and I am meeting with him and the other co-founder for a beer and to discuss ""what each of us wants"". My gf has assured me that this essentially constitutes an interview, feel free to offer your thoughts on that...

So basically I'm working retail liquor to support myself currently, and other than that I'm free until university starts again in mid February. I'll probably be able to squeeze in 2 or 3 days a week for these guys until then, and probably a max of 1 day per week during semester.

So yeah. What should I expect/ask for in my situation? I consider myself decent at writing code semantically, love keeping things clean and clear (good variable naming, comments and docs where appropriate), though can be a little slow to solve problems, and obviously have essentially zero 'professional' experience in the field. I'd be quite happy to take on 1 day a week for a couple of months as straight up unpaid 'work experience', but maybe that's selling myself short? If I were to ask for a wage, what would be a suitable rate for a 'fresh grad' who hasn't graduated and isn't that fresh in Brisbane, Australia?

All and any responses and advice are appreciated."
7luij0,0,2017-12-24,What may be the easiest jobs in software or hardware engineering?,intergalaktic,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/7luij0/what_may_be_the_easiest_jobs_in_software_or/,"i am electrical engineer with two years of internships and I have found out that this career, or at least the jobs that I was performing, are very hard and boring, and that there may be no point in continuing. This doesn't necessarily mean that I would like to quit engineering and toss my degree away, but rather that I would like to try something easier and possibly more interesting before finally giving up.

With all of my jobs the main problem was low productivity. It especially went low after few weeks of  employment when the interest factor faded away. I have found out that the hardest jobs were research and development tasks, especially if they demanded pro-active approach of work with high responsibility and if I was required to drive the whole development. What a nightmare. Drive the development and be responsible for something that is hard and not even remotely interesting. I think that I should stay away from true development activities with long development cycles, as it gets boring pretty fast and at the end I do nothing. The most horrible tasks were developments of new concepts for unique products, where you are the only one knowing your stuff and where you have to juggle forward and backwards with mountains of scientific papers, which you don't understand. Horrendous. Too much thinking. In such cases, usually I just switched to youtube/ reddit :).


I have also found out, that I very likely suck at problem solving, logic and analytics, which are engineer's core skills. I had bad grades during my studies, but I thought that it was only because I've found my studies being boring and rarely interesting. In fact, I hated my studies. I dodged most of lectures, which weren't obligatory for a student to be present at. Few times it happened that assistant kicked me out of the lab during practical work, because I was mentally absent. I was just sitting there like a duck,  daydreaming and waiting for other students to do the work for me (practical work was always team work). When there was an examination period, I started to learn 1 week before exams and hoped for that 50% minimum in order to pass it. Luck and gambling was how I passed all the stuff. 

If I had to name subjects which I found the hardest, they would be: Math, digital logic, low level programming, signal processing, electronics and anything that includes word ""systems"". FPGAs and the low level embedded systems stuff is a nightmare for me, probably one of the hardest topic I've came across. As the complexity of a matter increases, I get stuck or completely lost. When I look at schematics with more than 20 elements on it, I see stars. When I look into more than 1000 lines of low level algorithm code, I see hieroglyphs. Horrible. The only subjects that were remotely interesting and not that hard was were the ones dealing with alternative energy sources and energy markets. Basically no math and details, but more like a broad topics consisting of politics, ecology and economics where some technical knowledge was required so one would be able to differentiate between active and reactive power. Listening to these lectures was like watching a documentary on discovery channel. 

At the end of the day, if you would ask me, why I've chosen EE path, I would probably say because status and money. Being (electrical) engineer sounds bad ass and pays good. It's the real profession. Otherwise, I don't really know what I'd like to be nor what I'd like to do in life professionally, as the only thing that interests me for a longer time and gets me hooked in, is playing PC games and composing music.

7lv44l,8,2017-12-24,Why I decided not to apply to safety schools (international),madcapsupertramp,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7lv44l/why_i_decided_not_to_apply_to_safety_schools/,"This might be an unpopular opinion here but the whole point of me applying to US universities is getting a better and affordable education without ruining the four years of my life. Too many students from my country have gone to US applying to state schools with 99% acceptance rates (yes, 99) just because they wanted to enter the country. And I don't know one case where they went on to have great jobs or even a better life than what they could've had in their own country. They're attracted to US so much that they ruin their lives basically. 

The second part here might apply to US students too. The whole point of going to college is to get a good education and come out a better person. So what's the point if you're gonna be depressed for 4 years? What's the point if you're gonna regret going to college at all? If you're going to a place where you think you don't belong to, then a year's gap won't hurt. 

In my case, I'm willing take a two year gap if that means going to a good college. My ECs aren't great and if I lose this year, I'll do a couple of internships and join a few programs and will be ready for next year. Think about it. Live the rest of your life in debt and with  a shitty job or wait a little more to achieve what you want. 

This post probably doesn't apply to 90% of US people as you've got great state schools for safeties but for those of you who it does apply to, and the internationals, do give it a thought.

Despite this, I really want to become a software engineer. I already have a lot of extensive projects in different languages, 3 engineering internships (with one lined up at Foursquare this summer), and a 3.0 GPA.

Would it be wise to switch into my school's Information Technology Major, and apply for a CS minor? I'm terrified that doing poorly in my math classes has completely closed off my career path to become a software engineer. However, I'm also afraid that entering the industry as an IT major will severely harm my chances of doing what I love. "
7lw3dd,25,2017-12-24,Beauty is only skin deep- speak no evil,Anthonybrose,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7lw3dd/beauty_is_only_skin_deep_speak_no_evil/,"My name is Bill, When I was a young man at the age of 20 years old, I was a sperm donor. I only did it twice and after that I had found a job that paid pretty well. I was able to live on the salary I was given pretty comfortably. By the time I was 27 I was a manager at Nortel. 

When I was 7 years old, my parents were concerned about my social skills, and were willing to try anything to fix my social anxiety problem. Nothing worked until my parents heard about an experimental drug. It was in a shady part of town, and the doctor who had given them the medication, seemed to be cooking meth on the side. My parents were desperate however, and that night I was given my first dose of the medication. 

After a week of taking it. I found it easier to talk to people and after a month, I was able to talk to anyone with no problem. After I had finished the bottle of medication, my parents went back, but the doctor was no longer there; he just disappeared. Fortunately for me, the effects seemed to be permanent and I continued to excel at life.

It was around this time that I found out about by my abilities. I realized that I was able to tell someone to do something, and the person had to do it, no matter how absured it was. 

I became curious about one of the coworkers one day when I saw him take interest in the new intern working under me. Even though he was married; I wanted to know more. So I asked him questions about his family.

I was surprised to learn that he was married and had a 6 year old son. He informed me that his son also had some supernatural abilities, he had the abity to read peoples minds and knew what you were thinking. Even more curious. I found out that his next door neighbour had a 6 year old daughter. She had the ability to see a person who they truly were just by looking at them.

This made me truly curious, here were two neighbours who had children of the same age with special abilities. After probing further, I found out that both he and Ron were unable to have children. Ben and Ron had met at the fertility clinic with their wives and the four of them became friends. Their wives both got pregnant a week apart. 

They decided to buy houses right beside each other. Everything was going good, until David was born 1 month premature. He turned out to be deaf, the doctors speculated that the premature birth had something to do about it. 28 days later Emma was born blind. After probing Ron more about this, he said that after a few months, Emma miraculously got her sight. 

At this point I wanted to do an experiment with him.

Bill: You will start flirting with the new intern Brittany, this flirting will turn into dating and eventually turn to sex. 

Ron’s expression became expressionless for a second, my orders taking root in his head. 

Ron: will do boss; I will get that project done for you in a month. 

After talking to Bill, I walked over to Brittany. We started off with a little small talk before planting an idea in her head. She was only 5 foot tall, with long brown hair and auburn eyes. Even though she was petite, she had an ample bosom.

Bill: Brittany, Ron is going to start hitting on you. You will now think he is the hottest guy you have ever met. You will develop a relationship with him.

Brittany’s expression became blank for a second. Once she got her wits about her again, Her demeanor changed. She walked over to Ron, and the two of them started to flirt with each other.

When the day finally came for Ron’s sons birthday, I walked up to him once again.

Bill: today you will get angry with your wife, it will make you pack up your bag and leave. You will then move in with Brittany and continue your life with her.

Ron smiled and walked away, I next walked over to Brittany and did the same to her.

Bill: Ron will show up to your house today, and the two of you will move in together. You will eventually start a family of your own.

Brittany smiled as well and walked away. The next couple of days were a blur. Everything seemed to be going according to plan. That was until I found out about Ben and his wife Jamie. How they had met such an unfortunate end. To my relief however, Emma seemed to be perfectly fine.

Emma was to be left with Sherry and David, according to Jamie and Bens will. Emma and David then became brother and sister and they grew up to be a happy family  

With my help behind the scenes, Emma and David got into the best schools. Both of them becoming a successful as a detective and Lawyer. They were my children after all, they only deserved the best. 

20 years later

I decided to see how good they were with their abilities. I had still been in touch with Bill, who now had 2 children with his wife Brittany; he was now 42 years old. We were at the king’s head pub, catching up on what’s been going on with our lives when I decided to implant another idea. 

Bill: I want you to track down your ex wife. I want you to make her pay for kicking you out of your house 20 years ago. After you are done, I want you to leave absolutely no trace you were there. Then you will go home and make love to your wife. You will tell her that the two of you had been shopping for Christmas presents all day. Once you come back home, you will forget everything you have done since the time you woke up. You will actually believe you spent the entire day with your wife. You will also completely forget about me, or that you even knew me. For all you know, I  was your boss 20 years ago, and we had no friendship.

Ron’s expression went blank and a second later he smiled and finished his beer. We talked for another hour before we parted ways.

Two days later, I saw the story on the front page of the Winnipeg free press. 

Single mother of two found brutally murdered in her own home.

Police were called to the residence of Sherry Foster on Wednesday. Police found Sherry at her dining room table with 20 stab wounds to her body. There had been no signs of forced entry, and the murder occurred some time between 8pm Monday and 6am Tuesday. Police are asking the public for any information that would be helpful to their investigation. Please call the hotline at 1-204-xxx-xxxx

An evil smirk came to my face. I Couldn’t wait to see what was going to happen next."
7lxb2i,7,2017-12-24,Can someone reassure me that I will be able to find some kind of job by May or just help me figure out what my job prospects are in general?,paredep,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7lxb2i/can_someone_reassure_me_that_i_will_be_able_to/,"This post is probably going to be completely ridiculous but I am extremely paranoid that I will not be able to find a job and it makes me really anxious every day. On paper my job prospects are pretty good but the companies I have applied to so far do not seem interested. Most likely because my interviews are not going extremely well.

I am going to be graduating from a good school (ivy) with a 3.85 GPA and a degree in mathematics/computer science. I want to get a job in computer science because for many reasons I decided not to go to graduate school which is what I would do if I wanted to pursue math further. My transcript is full of graduate math classes but not a ton of CS.

Compared to my peers, I have very little in terms of software engineering experience and only have one very short internship with a small company. I spent most of my time studying theoretical CS and so I am good with algorithms but not as good in coding which probably makes me seem unappealing to many companies.

My biggest worry is that I will not be able to find any kind of job before May and then summer will come and I will have nowhere to go. This is such a big worry because I absolutely cannot move back in with my family and I would need to have something by May. I don't have any friends or anyone I can talk to about jobs or job prospects so I am almost completely blind right now. 

This question might be extremely ridiculous but how likely is it that I will not be able to find a job by the end of the school year? Do I actually have a shot at being successful in a career in computer science or should I look for something else?

I don't care if I have to relocate. I am ok with living anywhere inside the United States. I am currently spending all of my free time preparing for interviews. Again, this might be a ridiculous question but my paranoia and anxiety are through the roof worrying about jobs.

After graduating I completed a web development internship and had hoped to get a full time developer position somewhere but after interviewing with a few companies for those kinds of positions I had no luck.


I eventually got offered a position as an IT technician in NYC with a 50k salary, I had no better options at the time and student loan repayment was creeping up so I took it. Now I'm seeing my friends from school getting developer jobs making 65k or more in less expensive cities. This is really frustrating for me because I did really well in school, and I felt like I was someone people came to for help with schoolwork and I was always happy to be that person but I feel like it hasn't really paid off for me.


**Rant**

Meanwhile a lot of these people slacked off in school, and some have even cheated off of my tests and asked that I do their assignments. One person in particular recently got hired for the same job I applied for a couple months ago. He was on my team in my software engineering class for the project we worked on in that class. He did absolutely nothing. The git report our professor ran at the end of the semester stated that I had contributed over 60% of the lines of code for that project out of 4 people. He had contributed 0.3%. I simply don't understand how people like this get hired but I don't. It's like I have to be lazier and less smart to get a better job.

**End rant**


Basically I just feel like I'm not using my full potential and I feel like I could be making a lot more money if I was. I'm frustrated with trying to apply for software development positions because I feel discouraged by the whiteboard interview strategy most companies use where they ask me to use stuff I learned about 4 years ago and haven't really used since then. The funny thing is I feel like I usually do well in the technical interviews so I don't really know what I'm doing wrong. Maybe it's because I'm kind of socially awkward? I've always felt like I might have a mild case of asperger's.


I'm sorry if this post seems a little bit disorganized or hard to follow. I've just felt a lot of anger, frustration, and disappointment. I know I should feel grateful for the job I have, as I know there are hundreds of millions of people out there who would do almost anything to be in my shoes, but it's hard to feel that way when I'm seeing my slacker friends from school get better jobs and make more money than me.


Anyways, I've recently become interested in the financial industry, and I know that there are a lot of applications for skills in math and programming in that field. I just don't really know how I could get started with almost no background in those kinds of jobs. If anyone can give me some advice in regards to this it would be much appreciated."
7lzyxh,5,2017-12-25,How to learn best practices at home ?,oftencoffee,SoftwareEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/7lzyxh/how_to_learn_best_practices_at_home/,"I always thought that as a new grad with an engineering degree different than CS, having 3-4 programming projects (ranging from AI to games implementing design patterns) under my belt, I would easily start as a junior developer and learn the best practices there. However things turned out to be different.

I decided to go to grad school when a nice project presented itself, however project funding got cancelled and I was left with almost no income, and no prospect of success there. I left the place and started as an intern at a big company. Job turned out to be completely different what it was stated in the posting, yet I was somewhat in a desperate situation, so I decided to took the job and keep applying.


I do get to code at my current job, however I am still not in production. Almost all of my coding is self initiated, and I try to look busy so that I don't get dumped with a sales or marketing duty. However, most of the stuff I write is just simple like CRUD apps. I don't get to implement anything ""efficient"", I don't need to. 


During interviews I am asked whether I can implement something efficiently or not. I am of course aware of data structures and their time complexities etc. However say, when it comes to retrieving data from a db, what is considered as efficient? In what context? Who asks a new grad applying to junior position to write ""efficient"" code? I am not a ""brute force"" guy, yet I do not know the best practices in certain contexts either.


Without the job I don't get to learn best practices, without best practices I am not able to get the job. (I mean I also think that if I am going to build something of production quality in my own time, I would start my own business, not put it in my CV and keep looking for jobs!)


So, my question is how to learn best practices at home ?"
7m02l3,3,2017-12-25,"Successful career-wise, but unsuccessful in every other aspect",ParticularlyPecuilar,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7m02l3/successful_careerwise_but_unsuccessful_in_every/,"Hi all, so this is going to be a bit of a rant and emotion vomit, but I’ve tried my best to clean it up and make it substantial. It’s my first time ever really “asking” for advice but thought I’d give it a shot. I want to preface this with that I am fully aware my problems pale in comparison with many people and this is one of the issues I have with my feelings (why am I getting upset over something so small?)

**Background**:

I’m a soon to be graduate (next semester is my last), and I’m overall a pretty successful student. I entered university a bit more than a year early, have decent grades, signed an offer with one of the Big 4 Tech Companies upon graduation, have many research roles lined up for me, genuinely enjoy my work and my program of study. I’m not sure if I’m socially awkward or not, but in my life (especially before University), I’ve had lots of great experiences with friends (male and female) and I was very satisfied with my relationships. Heading into university, I had a similar mindset that it would be just like that, but better, I could meet a lot of people quicker and faster. 

**University**:

The first and second year of my University is rather uneventful and I don’t think play a very relevant role - but it is worth noting that I did not end up with many friends (and to this day, I only made and have one friend from University). In my third year, I was very set on landing a good internship for the summer at a reputable company and could not find it in myself to enjoy anything (socially, family, etc.) until I landed it. For a bit more than half a year, every day was filled with self-doubt and frustration at myself, I completely ignored my family and friends for most of it to focus on academics and mathematics competitions, algorithms, contest programming, etc. to prepare myself for interviews. At this point, I was mostly doing it for self-validation and I eventually did end up landing an intern in California at one of the Big 4. Good, I’ve worked hard to get my career to where I want, now I can focus on the little things I want to improve: my social life, my family, my well-being and what I want to get out of University. I thought I’ve earned it now, I have earned the luxury to worry about other things. 

**Now:**

Now, in my final year of studies, I still only have one good organic friend at University, everyone else are people that require me a reason to see. For example, members on the sports team or friends from a similar club, I won’t be seeing them (or at least, it feels awkward to me) outside of the these events. Overall, if I could sum up my feelings about University, it feels like my whole “college experience was stolen from me” despite never having attained it. I am quite disappointed with my University experience and have found little to no social satisfaction and I mostly attribute this as a problem to myself. Just this September, my parents starting their rather one-sided split (my dad just randomly announced he was moving away) and to this day, I remain their primary method of communication. A lot of their problems are issues and situations that happened before I was born, but these months I have been tasked with arbitrating arguments, dealing with police calls to our home due to their arguments disturbing the neighbours (we live in a decently sized home, mind you), and consoling my mother who has not been taking it well (that’s putting it modestly). Every day I have to hear my mom blaming me for not being able to bring back our Dad or supporting her on some plan that will change his mind, or whatever the twisted family problem is. I know she (and he) doesn’t mean a lot of things they say and I don’t blame them since it’s a heated and difficult situation. I won’t bring up the specifics, but the situation is so complicated that I can’t even begin to imagine how the world’s best therapist could untangle them. In these past few months, I have developed this unyielding “anxiety”, I don’t want to be presumptuous and diagnose myself at the risk of offending those that actually have real problems and anxiety, but I will describe how I feel:

* Scared to leave my family alone, I feel like for some reason my time with them is becoming extremely limited and I’m constantly scared they’re going to die or if I don’t spend as much time with them now, I’m going to regret it later
* Every night when I sleep, I get this consuming and merciless deep guilt in my chest that makes me feel like I’ve done something incredibly wrong that no matter what, I cannot fix. It feels like a deep deep hole has opened in my chest. I use OTC sleep aids like Melatonin and anti-histamines, but thus far, sleep has been evading me for the past couple of months
* My stomach is constantly fluttering and I always feel worried for no good reason, worried enough that I spend a few minutes every hour trying to rationalize it out

**My thoughts**:

I think there are two main reasons why I feel this way:
After achieving a career with one of the big 4, I thought my life would be solved, I would be done, the joy it would bring me would overpower every little problem I had. That’s not true at all, a goal is only good until its gone and I’ve squeezed out all the happiness out of my offer letter already.
With little to no friends and being disappointed socially, I think my family has been one of the only “pillars” in my self-worth. Now that’s gone. 

I’m a the point where I have little motivation to see anyone. I just want to stay at home and practice algorithms, or read up on math, or talk to my mom and eat breakfast with her (despite never having really been homesick - I’ve been away from home many times for months at end). I’m now even considering alerting my company that I can’t continue with the offer and ask them to relocate me to my home city so I can be with my family (currently, I’m posed to work in the States and live in an apartment with my good friend from high school - but now I just don’t want to be with anyone). I don’t know if it’s just because I want my family back, I want a new goal, friends, or I just want a girlfriend, but these days have been moving so fast that I feel like I’m going to 50 next year and I feel like I have nothing else to do but just hopelessly watch. Nobody needs me at the moment, except my parents, and the best I can do is just try to stay with them for now. I've never really dated anyone, nobody has ever really needed me in any way, never really asked anyone to support or help me, my failed attempts at University to make friends for the past four years is pretty good evidence that I can’t or there is a good reason why people don’t want to talk to me. At the end of the day, the only thing good about me is my job at the Big 4 and my above average intellect, but so what? These are the questions that I rhetorically ask myself and I know how much privilege I have to be in a position to ask them, I know they’re not true, nobody is really “not needed”, nobody is truly incapable of “making friends”, but it feels very much like it. 

This whole post might just be a long rant and I’m not really sure where I’m going with this, but I guess I want to reddit’s thoughts, people’s experiences if they’re similar (or if they’re not but would be valuable to hear), if I should take to a counsellor(which I’ve always been pretty against to). Mostly, I’m using you guys to argue against myself, so I sincerely hope you don’t mind. 

(thanks to everyone who read it, opened it, and even better if you made it here. It means a lot more to me than you think it does)"

7m0y3j,4,2017-12-25,TIFU by making pancakes and overreacting to a burning tissue,_Neelia_,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7m0y3j/tifu_by_making_pancakes_and_overreacting_to_a/,"Obligatory this did not happen today but around 3 years ago.
I was in 10th grade and the next day my internship in the local hospital for 2 weeks would start. Being excited and home alone, I decided to distract myself by making some delicious pancakes. 
What you now have to know is that we have a gas stove at home so there are real flames.
Eggs, flour, milk, putting the stove on, getting a pan, now I only needed some butter for the pan so the pancakes wouldn't stick to it. By trying to get said butter into the pan, a big piece fell down and landed directly on the stove. And instead of just letting it there and clean it afterwards, my brain did its best to convince me that I should definitely clean this up right now. No problem, I thought, I will just grab a tissue and the mess will be gone in a second. And this sure wouldn't have been a problem, if I wouldn't have forgotten to turn the stove off. 
So it happened what had to happen: the tissue caught fire and my brain was completely overreacting. Could I throw it on the floor and step on it? But what if the floor catches fire and the whole house is burning down? I didn't even come to the idea to throw it into the sink due to my mind being busy with imagining flames everywhere and panicking out.
 Since I was already standing too long there with that burning tissue in my bare hand I decided to throw it out of the front door. I get my way there, throw it outside, the flames die, everything seems to be fine again.
Until I noticed that sharp pain on my thumb. It didn't take long to figure out that 50% of my skin on my thumb was burned. Remember me being home alone? I had no idea how to handle that pain, so my mind came up with the idea that I should just get to the sink every few seconds and get cold water on it. This strategy worked until I had to go to bed. I've never felt such a pain in my life, so my next great idea was to put a glass of cold water in my bed and put my hand in it to fall asleep. That actually worked out, I fell asleep. And woke up because I poured the whole water all over me.
You can imagine how horrible my night was and in the end, I slept around 2 hours.
Remember me having my internship the next day? I looked like a zombie that just digged its way out of its grave trying to get your and your children's brains. 
And remember me being an intern in the hospital? That means I had to put on these super tight gloves a couple of times a day, which ripped off my skin and made the pain even worse.
Why did I not talk about that with a doctor, you might ask. Well my brain told me that I did not want to have any attention so I hid my scar all the time by putting my hands in my pockets. The doctor I was following was so annoyed by it that he told me constantly to put my hands out of my pockets, so I definitely managed to get an awesome reputation there.
Fortunately, pain pills worked in the end and now 3 years later, my skin looks fine again.

Tl;dr: tried to make pancakes on our gas stove, butter fell on it and I tried to clean it up with a tissue which resulted in me holding a burning tissue in my bare hand burning my thumb. As if that pain wasn't already enough, as the intern that I was in the hospital, I constantly had to put on these tight gloves, which ripped on my skin making the pain even worse."
7m199k,94,2017-12-25,An Air Mattress in the Middle of Missouri,catullusallust,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7m199k/an_air_mattress_in_the_middle_of_missouri/,"I wrote this last night:

Right now, it's Christmas Eve. A light covering of snow fell last night while I was sleeping, so I guess you could say it'll be a white Christmas. I have church tomorrow morning but I'm not religious. 

Right now, it's Christmas Eve. I'm writing this because the stress of college applications has driven me to the point of insanity. Yesterday I cried, all alone, curled up on in air mattress in the basement of my grandparents house.

Right now, it's Christmas Eve. I'm sitting on an air mattress hundreds of miles away from home. There's nothing but farms for miles, so unlike my suburban upbringing. All I can think is that, if I were from here, I'd have hell of a lot more chance of getting into my dream school than I do.

In 10th grade, I made a checklist on how to get into Princeton. It was and still is my dream school. I needed to get perfect grades, all A's. Check. I needed to get above a 1400 SAT. Check. I needed to make my teachers like me. Check. But now, as I lie on this air mattress, I realize my checklist was an empty dream materialized on to a slip of paper.

It's Christmas Eve and I'm lying here on this air mattress. When I was younger, I would have been ecstatic to go to bed, to wake up to presents in the morning. It's too bad my dad gave me my presents last week and my mom couldn't afford Christmas. She sold her dream car just to pay for me to apply to college. 

It's Christmas Eve and all of sudden, a sense of despondence has fallen over me. I have little chance of getting into my dream school. The acceptance rate is less than 7% and falling. I'm under-qualified. But why?! I want to scream. I checked all of the things on my list. I should get it. 

Except, as in I lay here, I realize, so did everyone else. I'm not even a qualified applicant. Sure, I have a 1400+ SAT, I got a 1420. Sure, I have all A's in my classes, I have a 4.8. Sure, my teachers like me, but what can they say that I haven't already shown. 

I'm barely a qualified applicant. I have no hooks. I'm stark white, whiter than a Twilight vampire. I'm from a lower middle-class family with divorced parents. I live in New Jersey. I didn't send in SAT IIs. My essays are listless parrots of what I truly want to say, butchered from creativity until they resembled nothing more than words stretched thin with too much meaning and not enough substance. I'm a cheerleader, not a recruitable athlete. I've done all the activities every else has. I have no great feats. No internships. No accomplishments in my field. My biggest appeal is that I have a gay mom and I'm going into an unknown major. I have no legacy because my parents got degrees in the Air Force. I have no money, so my parents aren't going to donate. I'm not extraordinary, despite what people say.

I can't afford to go to state school. My dad makes decent money, but he's already expressed a desire for me to take out loans. My mom filled out my FAFSA. She makes too much money off of disabled veteran compensation for me to get anything. I haven't told her it came back yet because we couldn't even afford Christmas. She sold her dream truck to pay for my senior year. 

It's almost Christmas Day and I've been typing this for nearly an hour. My hands are quivering from the cold and the emotions. My moods are mercurial, flipping between an almost manic declaration that I will be admitted and a depressive, soul-crushing idea that there is no point in applying. Okay, I've paid the application fee. I just wasted the money my mom doesn't have. 

Right now, it's Christmas Eve. I'm sitting on an air mattress in Nowhere, Missouri and all I can think about is the drive back home. It's too late for regrets, even if I have them. I tell everyone it won't hurt, that I'll laugh when I'm rejected because I saw it coming. Guess what? I did see it coming. I saw it miles on the horizon. But still, that tiny sliver of hope has poisoned me, festering inside my brain and soul, contaminating my aspirations. 

Still, how many people are admitted without Subject Tests? Very few. Out of those few how many had lower than a 1500 SAT? Even fewer. The rest are disadvantaged in ways I've never had to suffer,  poorer than me, more diverse than me, more accomplished.

Right now, it's Christmas Eve. I'm nearly crying, sitting on the air mattress, cold in the basement but knowing after this year, I'll never be back again. 

Right now, it's Christmas Eve, and this is what the admissions process has done to me."

I am just lost on what to do. Only one has actually called me for an interview based on my application, and there was silence after the initial phone interview. I have been applying for a lot of positions over the holidays, but it's difficult to have any hope with the responses I've had so far.

After finishing *Think Like a Programmer*, I intend to read the following books (and do most of the exercises from them):

 - *The Algorithm Design Manual* by Steven S. Skiena (if I don't understand something, I'll consult *Introduction to Algorithms* - CLRS)
 - *Design patterns : elements of reusable object-oriented software*

I am aware that for most programming jobs (espcially robotics) I'll also need to know how operating systems work, how computer networks work, read and write assembly etc. I found good CS curriculums in your FAQ section, so that plan is pretty much worked out already.

I am here for some guidance (duh) regarding my career. So a bit of background on myself:

I am two years out of undergrad (BS aerospace engineering) and I am currently in grad school (MS mechanical engineering), projected to graduate in December 2018. Additionally, I am working full-time as a level II engineer at my company. As of writing this post, I have stayed there for three months. My company is small and not as recognized as the big aerospace companies like Northrop Grumman, SpaceX, JPL, etc. My company is not paying for my MS; I am paying for it out of my own pocket. Lastly, I am based in Southern California so there is a huge concentration of engineers in the area.

So my question is this: since I am on track to graduate in December 2018, does anyone here think it would be advisable to try to obtain a graduate level internship at the start of my final semester with a bigger company in an attempt to just transition to full-time status after I complete my MS? Or should I just stay with my current company through the end of my MS and then try to leave to a bigger company?

I'm sure everyone that reads this would immediately question why move from a level II engineering position back to an intern however my reasoning is that I want to move companies. Additionally since Southern California has a huge concentration of engineers, applying to companies and getting the job is already difficult enough as it is. I believe that applying and getting hired as an intern, a graduate level intern too, is easier than applying and getting hired as a regular full-time employee, especially if I would be aiming for a level II or level III position. What I hope would come from going the internship route is at the very least an ""in"" to the company and to just transition straight from being an intern to being full-time.

Please let me know what any of you think of this, whether it's a good idea, bad idea or if there's a better way to go about all of this. Thanks everyone!"

Ideally, I'd like to have two internships before graduating (after soph and junior years), but at least one after junior year. I'd like to earn enough money to save maybe $2,000 or so. After a couple of years or so, I plan on going to grad school to get a PhD.

Will going to this school make it a lot harder to get employed?

7m92i1,426,2017-12-26,Coding idea: Write a command-line utility,yung_mac,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7m92i1/coding_idea_write_a_commandline_utility/,"I wrote and published a command-line utility as a coding exercise a few days ago. I'm a self-taught developer and I had a great time coding it and learnt a ton. I think writing and releasing a command-line tool might be under-appreciated as learning exercise -- I think it may make a great addition to the curriculum of a self-teaching developer.

* Coding a command-line utility allows you to focus on one, small but contained problem, and doesn't require much adjacent knowledge -- which decreases the risk of getting overwhelmed and abandoning the project. Your command-line utility can be just a single file written in a single language and still be a perfect solution to your problem. No more quitting before you even start because you can't get Webpack to work.
* It lets you solve something relevant to you -- it's way easier to stay motivated when you're working on solving a problem you face as opposed to a generic problem you don't really care about. Completing coding challenges on HackerRank, for example, is great exercise but tends to get a bit boring. The alternative -- coding your own 
* A command-line utility doesn't have a GUI. This means you don't need to waste time designing anything! This was huge for me. Designing can be a real time-sink. UI and UX are already taken care of before you even start!
*  Building a command-line utility gets you friendlier with the terminal -- an essential tool in the well-rounded developer's toolkit.
* It teaches you to release. There's a pretty clear point at which your command-line utility does everything you set out to code it to do. It is at this point you get the rare opportunity to practise an incredibly important auxiliary skill -- releasing. Besides the super cool feeling you get when you proudly release your finished product for the whole world to enjoy, finishing a project by publishing it builds your ability to finish more. It's an awesome antidote to the pernicious momentum that can build up if we start projects but never get around to finishing them. After I published a package to npm -- now I know how to share my code for everyone else to benefit from, I feel compelled to write more!

Possible command-line utilities you could build, for three skill levels:

* A converter or calculator. This is the simplest. If you're still quite new to programming, start here. Write a temperature, length, or time converter (how many hours is 9000 minutes?). Write something to calculate how much you spend on fuel for your car, or something a little more complex like how many of a given fruit to eat to get your recommended daily amount of a given nutrient.

* A data storage system. This is a bit more complicated. Use a database, like SQLite, to store information, then get information about your information (this is the information age after all). Build a calorie-tracker if you're watching your weight -- input the number of calories you ate today, see if that number is going up or down. Or if you like writing, build a command-line journal which lets you write and save entries. It could track info like what your favourite words are, how much you've written this year, and how many words you write on average per hour of the time you spend awake.

* An API wrapper for a website you use often, to let you consume the info you gotta consume from the comfort of your own terminal. This is a somewhat more complicated. Build a one-command weather-report if you check the weather often. A headline-and-summary-grabber if you're into the news. A twitter report. An ISBN lookup if you're into books. A BTC-USD price ticker to help you feel bad about yourself as you think about how rich you could be if you got in way back when.
You may not even need an API -- try scraping the site if its robots.txt doesn't prohibit that.

But those options are only the beginning. Try choosing something you know you're going to want to use -- if it makes your life easier, you'll have a far easier time creating it! If you're struggling to come up with something, try just watching the way you use your computer for a day or two. Notice patterns. If something is a repeated frustration, you may have found the problem to solve! For me, this was, when copy-pasting commands from the internet (stackoverflow &lt;3), I often inadvertently copied the ""$"" preceding the command. I'd paste these into my terminal but the ""$"" would cause an error. This formed a pattern, which I noticed, and was then able to solve with a command-line utility I built to strip the ""$"" from pasted commands.

Good luck and happy programming!

PS: First post on Reddit! Let me know how I can improve.

PPS: I'd love to write tutorials to help self-teaching developers! I was thinking of starting with a tutorial diving in to the details of how to plan, build and release a command-line utility if people want to read it. Maybe also a tutorial on Google's new boardgame.io -- I think that would be really fun. Also, maybe a tutorial on softer skills like how I landed an internship with a tech startup with just one cold email I wrote with my dad (lol). If think you'd benefit from this, please let me know, and I'll write it!"
7m963i,0,2017-12-26,Is my boyfriend unemployable?,poopshoveller78,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7m963i/is_my_boyfriend_unemployable/,"Let me say from the beginning that I love this man, he is terrific in every way, and contributes 110% to housework, taking care of my horses, paying what he can to joint expenses, etc. However, I make a lot more money than he does, and this bothers him since he thinks his being financially dependent on me would ruin our relationship. Kids are not in the picture, since we're both in our 40s and I never wanted any; if they were, he'd have been happy to contribute by raising them. (And he doesn't want to just take care of the hoof-puppies all day.)

My boyfriend is, as he's put it, ""accomplished but not successful,"" and, now that he's in his early 40s feels that he urgently needs to start finding some career success. He got his PhD in a Humanities field a decade ago, and he has been teaching college part-time as an adjunct professor ever since. Because this is so unstable, he's gone between making $40,000 a year and periods of unemployment. He's currently making less than $18,000 a year. (He can have his own place because his family helps him and he makes a little money off the books with side jobs—the man really hustles and also coaches sports and does freelance writing besides teaching—and if you count taking care of the horses, he has three or four jobs in addition to teaching at two colleges.)

His odds of getting a tenure-track job are so low as to be nonexistent, so that is not a realistic plan (though he still applies). It doesn't help that he's not ""diverse,"" which has become a necessity for getting hired in his field. Also, he'd most likely have to move across the country. We currently live in a college town near a small city, but we're two hours from a major city. There are a LOT of schools and a LOT of jobs around, just not full-time academic jobs in his field.

A few of the ideas he's had over the past 2–3 years that haven't been working:

-Higher ed administration. He went to school part-time and got a certificate in administration, but has no non-teaching experience since before he went back to grad school. He can't afford more school at this point. Also, we asked around, but no one is willing to even give him an unpaid internship. Also, not ""diverse,"" etc. He still applies, with tailored cover letters and resumes, to everything it seems he can do.

-High school teaching. He passed the state teaching test in his field, however, he hasn't gotten any interviews. Teachers we have spoken to have said this is because he has no experience but would come in at the top of the pay scale because of his PhD.

-Publishing: He's tried again, but there are no jobs here; besides the geographical difficulties if you're not in New York or Boston, all academic publishing has changed to a freelancer-and-project-manager model.

He's afraid he's poison to hiring managers since he's overqualified and overeducated and it looks like he'd be bored doing any ""regular"" job. For instance, if you Google him, the results are for his personal website for his scholarship and writing and the six books or so he's written (mostly works for hire, but also a couple of academic books). Also he thinks anything would be a step down in status from college teaching and writing and you're just not allowed to say you want a job for a salary, 401(k) and health benefits in today's world.

He has done everything everyone has told him to do, including networking (though he doesn't have very much of a non-academic network), resume workshops and speaking to a career coach (who was useless: She said ""if you like doing what you're doing, keep doing it!"" to which he said, ""But it doesn't pay rent!"").

He never gets calls back, or, if he does, it doesn't go past the first-round interview. As he puts it, he's afraid that he looks like a ""wolf"" who has been surviving out there in the wilderness, and what hiring managers want are ready-trained ""dogs"" who will be happy caged in cubicles. Even if he is happiest being a ""wolf,"" he is willing to medicate himself into being a ""dog"" our of necessity.

Our last idea is him trying to start his own business, though he admits he doesn't have any entrepreneurial savvy or what he'd do or where he'd get the capital.

Please... any ideas?! We're getting desperate.

tl:dr: Can a tremendously accomplished man who has been surviving on his own in the academic wilderness for the past decade find a ""regular"" job?"

We have just published an article on Failory written by Amir Rajan, in which he tells the story behind his mobile game, called “A Dark Room”, which hit #1 on the App Store and grossed over $800,000. Sit down and read his success story. I hope you enjoy it and if you have any questions, I will happily answer them below.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

Sit back. This is gonna be a long one.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

Did the whole ""get a degree, get a job"" thing. Ended up being incredibly well paid, but horribly empty because of corporate America. Decided to rage quit, downsize (sell pretty much everything I own), and take a sabbatical. After binge coding on random crap, I partnered with a guy in Canada and ported a web based, incremental, text based game to iOS (A Dark Room iOS). Welp. It went viral and hit the #1 spot. That let me extend my sabbatical for another three years. I built four more games, none of which succeeded. Now I'm back in Corporate America (luckily only part time now... I make enough off my games and other assets to not have to work all year).

&amp;nbsp;

**The Long Version:**

&amp;nbsp;

**Frustration:**

There is such a heavy dose of luck in success. There are those that will give one thousand percent, and because the roll of the dice wasn't perfect, nothing materializes. They have as much love for the game development as I have... they've worked as hard as I have... but just didn't get a kiss from Lady Luck. And it sucks. It just isn't fair that they want to create more than their next breathe, but can't catch a good break to devote time to it. They have to look over at those that have the privaledge to take multiple rolls of the dice, eat their cake and have it too, and if everything still fails, they get bailed out by mommy and daddy.

I was one of the lucky ones. I saved up for ten years, and was able to role _once_. I hit lucky number eleven. And even then, I still find myself having to grind in a 9 to 5 yet again. Sometimes it's fine. Other times I feel like I should have never taken that sabbatical and remained ignorant of the pure joy that comes from putting yourself in a creation.

&amp;nbsp;

**Before Sabbatical:**

I did what you were supposed to do. Did well (really well) in school. Went to college. Got a degree in Software Engineering and Computer Science. Did internships and landed a job as a developer for an insurance company right out of college. I did that for three years (two years of internships, one year as a full time employee). I then went to work for a company that build veterinary software. Did that for a couple of years. I really really loved coding. Lived and breathed it. I interviewed at a prestigious consulting company and got in on the ground floor. Spent three years there only to be scooped up by another consulting powerhouse. So here I am with a disgusting $140,000 in total compensation. A sea of cubicals, souless sheep that want nothing more than to do their time and go home. I didn't belong cause I actually cared about my craft. I tried to compensate for my unfulfilling corporate work with open source development after hours. This put a toll on my familial relationships (spending 45 hours a week working, then trying to get another 30 hours on nights and weekends, doesn't leave much time for anything else). I was at the brink of collapse. Lose my sanity, my wife, or my job. I decided to get rid of the job. I liquidated my 401k savings (took all the tax penalties up front), and said ""alright, gonna live off of this for as long as I can until I figure something out"".

&amp;nbsp;

**During Sabbatical:**

It was great to breathe. I was 178 pounds at 5'8 (a little portly). That changed during the sabbatical. It took me three months just to _figure out_ what my routine looked like. I'd code on whatever my heart desired. It was wonderful. I didn't even know what day it was. I didn't miss my stuff. I didn't miss the anxiety attacks I got Sunday nights before having to go to work. All of that gone. By month four I came across the web based version of A Dark Room. I immediately connected with its sparse presentation. I reached out the Michael and asked his permission to port it to mobile. That night I lost track of time. I blinked and it was 3am. I had never felt that kind of loss of time before. Nothing around me existed, it was just me and my creation. After another four months, A Dark Room was done and released to the App Store. It got a whopping thirty downloads the first day. I didn't care. Cause it was my creation and it was awesome. I redesigned so much of the original game. So much of me went into it. Oh and I dropped 30 pounds too. Best shape of my life.

I still remember one of my happiest days. It was early January. I was working on a stupid little multiplayer fighting game written in JavaScript and Pixi.js. I didn't care that ADR was barely getting 10 downloads a day, I didn't care that my savings was dwindling away. I found what I was supposed to do (build digital, evocative experiences).

&amp;nbsp;

**Savings Dwindling:**

The party was over at this point. My savings was dwindling down. A Dark Room was making its meager two thousand downloads a month (after Apple's cut, taxes, and splits, that's not a lot of take home). I started interviewing again for a job. I was better mentally, physically. And I never want my wife's quality of live to suffer (she was still in college at the time). Being the main bread winner of the home, I knew I had to suck it up and go back to work. I wasn't okay with it, but I knew it was my responsibility. I was interviewing again for those big salaries. I would save as much as possible given my now humble lifestyle. After I had enough cash tucked away, I'd quit and try again. Then. A Dark Room went viral. Out of nowhere it made $800 in one day. Then it made $1,200 in one day. Then it made $5,000. Then it made $8,000. Then it hit the #1 spot and I woke up to a $20,000 sales report.

&amp;nbsp;

**A Dark Room at #1:**

A Dark Room stayed at the number one spot. I was elated the first day. I was on cloud nine the second day. Then reality reared its ugly face with a sobering message: ""this will come to an end.""

So I waited for it to come to an end. I didn't sleep for 18 days. My life: was hitting the refresh button on the App Store, seeing if I had fallen. I'd do it every 3 hours on the hour, day or night. I did it for eighteen days. I read every review that came through. I'd refresh the page again and see if I had dropped. This was my life. I was waiting for all this success to end. 250,000 downloads later, A Dark Room finally fell from the #1 spot. It was over. From there sales dwindled. After another four months, I was down to 100 downloads a day. I had recouped what I had ""spent"" taking the sabbatical (and then some). My wife was tired of living in a cramped one bedroom apartment. So, we put a huge down payment on a house.

&amp;nbsp;

**After A Dark Room Fell:**

I built a prequel to A Dark Room called The Ensign. It did okay (nowhere near as successful.. but not bad... this was around the time I did my interview with Indie Hackers). I wrote a book about Surviving the App Store too. I put my heart and soul into a game inspired by Edwin Abbot's ""Flatland: Romance of Many Dimensions"" called A Noble Circle. I created a digital Go board after binge watching Hikaru no Go. I built a touched based mobile RTS called Mildly Interesting RTS (MIRTS for short). Every game had ""me"" in it. I didn't do ads, I didn't do micro-transactions, scummy energy bars, and all those other bullshit monetization tactics. I ported A Dark Room to Android (which was almost not worth it). I did everything to keep building games. I wrote about all of my journey, presented, did podcasts, hoping to inspire others. And yet revenue kept dwindling. The writing was on the wall. Everything I did after ADR wasn't enough. And I got a job.

&amp;nbsp;

**Now:**

So here I am. Updating all my games to work well on iPhone X. Because I love them. I try to build what I can in my free time. But I'm back in Corporate America (it's been ten months so far). Two months in, everything became too real. My journey as a game dev was really over. I got so frustrated. I purged everything online. Took the book down, deleted all of my Reddit entries, my developer logs, my open source games. I removed all of it. All the content I created felt like a lie. Cause even with all this ""success"", I couldn't keep my dream going. I felt so much worse off because I got a taste of a fulfilling life that I wish I had been ignorant to. It has been eight months since ""The Purge"". I'm _much_ better now. Mostly invisible outside of already established relationships. I stream occasionally on Twitch, keep my games maintained, and work on new ones as time allows.

I no longer deal with anxiety attacks Sunday nights at the thought of ""clocking in"" Monday morning. I'm at peace with it. The people I once called sheep, aren't that. They just didn't have the means to roll the dice. All code I see is beautiful in its own way. It tells a story of the resonable programmers put in unresonable situations. Again, I'm one of the lucky ones. Because maybe in another year, I'll have enough _play money_ saved up to role the dice again.

&amp;nbsp;‍

**Silver Lining:**

My games provide a stable passive income (and I have a _decade_ worth of an emergency funds in the bank). A Dark Room recently hit the #2 spot _overall_ on Google Play (pro tip: stick to iOS, the revenue is almost an order of magnitude better). More importantly, I've very recently acquired the platform that helped me create my labors of love: RubyMotion. So between my games, subscription revenue, and my well paying contract gigs, I do alright for myself. Thank you Lady Luck. And my sincerest, deepest apologies for the 99.9999% that will never see the ""failure"" I've seen. I really do empathize with you. And I wish I had a better story.

&amp;nbsp;‍

**Numbers?**

I'm sure some of you are asking about numbers. Do you remember the title of this post? Do you remember what I said about the 99.9999% failure rate? Do your remember what I said about privaledge, and eating your cake and having it too? What's the point of talking about the numbers I'm making now? So you can dream about one day making these numbers too? You wont. Start with that and work from there.

But if you really want numbers, here are some of the numeric sacrifices I made to role the dice _once_:

- Have a 4.0 GPA through High School.

- Graduate #36 out of a class of 800+.

- Go to a community college cause it's cheap.

- Work two jobs in the summer to pay for college and save up.

- Go to university in 2001 when it was still possible to pay out of  pocket and graduate without crippling debt.

- Get a degree in something that is valued. Even better if you  actually like what you got a degree in.

- Land a job right out of school that makes you $55k a year.

- Live off of $15k a year. Don't buy a house. Don't buy a fancy  car. Just save.

- Do this for a year.

- Land a job that makes you $100k a year. Save the rest. Max out your 401k contribution.

- Celebrate by living off of $30k a year.

- Do this for three years.

- Land a job that makes you $140k a year. Save the rest. Max out your 401k contribution. Get a Roth, put $5k a year into that.

- Celebrate by living off of $60k a year.

- Do this for three years.

- Don't have kids. Don't get sick. Don't have any catastrophic  events that leave you bankrupt. Probably best to just not leave the house.

- Quit your job. Sell everything. Liquidate your 401k. Pay all the tax  penaties.

- Live without insurance cause COBRA costs $2000 a month. Still Don't  have kids. Don't get sick. Don't have any catastrophic events that  leave you bankrupt.

- Now you can take a year and a half off and roll the dice _once_. Now  you can read all the success stories online and dream that you'll  get that too.

But you probably wont. And that's okay.

We have just published an article on Failory written by Amir Rajan, in which he tells the story behind his mobile game, called “A Dark Room”, which hit #1 on the App Store and grossed over $800,000. Sit down and read his success story. I hope you enjoy it and if you have any questions, I will happily answer them below.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

Sit back. This is gonna be a long one.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

Did the whole ""get a degree, get a job"" thing. Ended up being incredibly well paid, but horribly empty because of corporate America. Decided to rage quit, downsize (sell pretty much everything I own), and take a sabbatical. After binge coding on random crap, I partnered with a guy in Canada and ported a web based, incremental, text based game to iOS (A Dark Room iOS). Welp. It went viral and hit the #1 spot. That let me extend my sabbatical for another three years. I built four more games, none of which succeeded. Now I'm back in Corporate America (luckily only part time now... I make enough off my games and other assets to not have to work all year).

&amp;nbsp;

**The Long Version:**

&amp;nbsp;

**Frustration:**

There is such a heavy dose of luck in success. There are those that will give one thousand percent, and because the roll of the dice wasn't perfect, nothing materializes. They have as much love for the game development as I have... they've worked as hard as I have... but just didn't get a kiss from Lady Luck. And it sucks. It just isn't fair that they want to create more than their next breathe, but can't catch a good break to devote time to it. They have to look over at those that have the privaledge to take multiple rolls of the dice, eat their cake and have it too, and if everything still fails, they get bailed out by mommy and daddy.

I was one of the lucky ones. I saved up for ten years, and was able to role _once_. I hit lucky number eleven. And even then, I still find myself having to grind in a 9 to 5 yet again. Sometimes it's fine. Other times I feel like I should have never taken that sabbatical and remained ignorant of the pure joy that comes from putting yourself in a creation.

&amp;nbsp;

**Before Sabbatical:**

I did what you were supposed to do. Did well (really well) in school. Went to college. Got a degree in Software Engineering and Computer Science. Did internships and landed a job as a developer for an insurance company right out of college. I did that for three years (two years of internships, one year as a full time employee). I then went to work for a company that build veterinary software. Did that for a couple of years. I really really loved coding. Lived and breathed it. I interviewed at a prestigious consulting company and got in on the ground floor. Spent three years there only to be scooped up by another consulting powerhouse. So here I am with a disgusting $140,000 in total compensation. A sea of cubicals, souless sheep that want nothing more than to do their time and go home. I didn't belong cause I actually cared about my craft. I tried to compensate for my unfulfilling corporate work with open source development after hours. This put a toll on my familial relationships (spending 45 hours a week working, then trying to get another 30 hours on nights and weekends, doesn't leave much time for anything else). I was at the brink of collapse. Lose my sanity, my wife, or my job. I decided to get rid of the job. I liquidated my 401k savings (took all the tax penalties up front), and said ""alright, gonna live off of this for as long as I can until I figure something out"".

&amp;nbsp;

**During Sabbatical:**

It was great to breathe. I was 178 pounds at 5'8 (a little portly). That changed during the sabbatical. It took me three months just to _figure out_ what my routine looked like. I'd code on whatever my heart desired. It was wonderful. I didn't even know what day it was. I didn't miss my stuff. I didn't miss the anxiety attacks I got Sunday nights before having to go to work. All of that gone. By month four I came across the web based version of A Dark Room. I immediately connected with its sparse presentation. I reached out the Michael and asked his permission to port it to mobile. That night I lost track of time. I blinked and it was 3am. I had never felt that kind of loss of time before. Nothing around me existed, it was just me and my creation. After another four months, A Dark Room was done and released to the App Store. It got a whopping thirty downloads the first day. I didn't care. Cause it was my creation and it was awesome. I redesigned so much of the original game. So much of me went into it. Oh and I dropped 30 pounds too. Best shape of my life.

I still remember one of my happiest days. It was early January. I was working on a stupid little multiplayer fighting game written in JavaScript and Pixi.js. I didn't care that ADR was barely getting 10 downloads a day, I didn't care that my savings was dwindling away. I found what I was supposed to do (build digital, evocative experiences).

&amp;nbsp;

**Savings Dwindling:**

The party was over at this point. My savings was dwindling down. A Dark Room was making its meager two thousand downloads a month (after Apple's cut, taxes, and splits, that's not a lot of take home). I started interviewing again for a job. I was better mentally, physically. And I never want my wife's quality of live to suffer (she was still in college at the time). Being the main bread winner of the home, I knew I had to suck it up and go back to work. I wasn't okay with it, but I knew it was my responsibility. I was interviewing again for those big salaries. I would save as much as possible given my now humble lifestyle. After I had enough cash tucked away, I'd quit and try again. Then. A Dark Room went viral. Out of nowhere it made $800 in one day. Then it made $1,200 in one day. Then it made $5,000. Then it made $8,000. Then it hit the #1 spot and I woke up to a $20,000 sales report.

&amp;nbsp;

**A Dark Room at #1:**

A Dark Room stayed at the number one spot. I was elated the first day. I was on cloud nine the second day. Then reality reared its ugly face with a sobering message: ""this will come to an end.""

So I waited for it to come to an end. I didn't sleep for 18 days. My life: was hitting the refresh button on the App Store, seeing if I had fallen. I'd do it every 3 hours on the hour, day or night. I did it for eighteen days. I read every review that came through. I'd refresh the page again and see if I had dropped. This was my life. I was waiting for all this success to end. 250,000 downloads later, A Dark Room finally fell from the #1 spot. It was over. From there sales dwindled. After another four months, I was down to 100 downloads a day. I had recouped what I had ""spent"" taking the sabbatical (and then some). My wife was tired of living in a cramped one bedroom apartment. So, we put a huge down payment on a house.

&amp;nbsp;

**After A Dark Room Fell:**

I built a prequel to A Dark Room called The Ensign. It did okay (nowhere near as successful.. but not bad... this was around the time I did my interview with Indie Hackers). I wrote a book about Surviving the App Store too. I put my heart and soul into a game inspired by Edwin Abbot's ""Flatland: Romance of Many Dimensions"" called A Noble Circle. I created a digital Go board after binge watching Hikaru no Go. I built a touched based mobile RTS called Mildly Interesting RTS (MIRTS for short). Every game had ""me"" in it. I didn't do ads, I didn't do micro-transactions, scummy energy bars, and all those other bullshit monetization tactics. I ported A Dark Room to Android (which was almost not worth it). I did everything to keep building games. I wrote about all of my journey, presented, did podcasts, hoping to inspire others. And yet revenue kept dwindling. The writing was on the wall. Everything I did after ADR wasn't enough. And I got a job.

&amp;nbsp;

**Now:**

So here I am. Updating all my games to work well on iPhone X. Because I love them. I try to build what I can in my free time. But I'm back in Corporate America (it's been ten months so far). Two months in, everything became too real. My journey as a game dev was really over. I got so frustrated. I purged everything online. Took the book down, deleted all of my Reddit entries, my developer logs, my open source games. I removed all of it. All the content I created felt like a lie. Cause even with all this ""success"", I couldn't keep my dream going. I felt so much worse off because I got a taste of a fulfilling life that I wish I had been ignorant to. It has been eight months since ""The Purge"". I'm _much_ better now. Mostly invisible outside of already established relationships. I stream occasionally on Twitch, keep my games maintained, and work on new ones as time allows.

I no longer deal with anxiety attacks Sunday nights at the thought of ""clocking in"" Monday morning. I'm at peace with it. The people I once called sheep, aren't that. They just didn't have the means to roll the dice. All code I see is beautiful in its own way. It tells a story of the resonable programmers put in unresonable situations. Again, I'm one of the lucky ones. Because maybe in another year, I'll have enough _play money_ saved up to role the dice again.

&amp;nbsp;‍

**Silver Lining:**

My games provide a stable passive income (and I have a _decade_ worth of an emergency funds in the bank). A Dark Room recently hit the #2 spot _overall_ on Google Play (pro tip: stick to iOS, the revenue is almost an order of magnitude better). More importantly, I've very recently acquired the platform that helped me create my labors of love: RubyMotion. So between my games, subscription revenue, and my well paying contract gigs, I do alright for myself. Thank you Lady Luck. And my sincerest, deepest apologies for the 99.9999% that will never see the ""failure"" I've seen. I really do empathize with you. And I wish I had a better story.

&amp;nbsp;‍

**Numbers?**

I'm sure some of you are asking about numbers. Do you remember the title of this post? Do you remember what I said about the 99.9999% failure rate? Do your remember what I said about privaledge, and eating your cake and having it too? What's the point of talking about the numbers I'm making now? So you can dream about one day making these numbers too? You wont. Start with that and work from there.

But if you really want numbers, here are some of the numeric sacrifices I made to role the dice _once_:

- Have a 4.0 GPA through High School.

- Graduate #36 out of a class of 800+.

- Go to a community college cause it's cheap.

- Work two jobs in the summer to pay for college and save up.

- Go to university in 2001 when it was still possible to pay out of  pocket and graduate without crippling debt.

- Get a degree in something that is valued. Even better if you  actually like what you got a degree in.

- Land a job right out of school that makes you $55k a year.

- Live off of $15k a year. Don't buy a house. Don't buy a fancy  car. Just save.

- Do this for a year.

- Land a job that makes you $100k a year. Save the rest. Max out your 401k contribution.

- Celebrate by living off of $30k a year.

- Do this for three years.

- Land a job that makes you $140k a year. Save the rest. Max out your 401k contribution. Get a Roth, put $5k a year into that.

- Celebrate by living off of $60k a year.

- Do this for three years.

- Don't have kids. Don't get sick. Don't have any catastrophic  events that leave you bankrupt. Probably best to just not leave the house.

- Quit your job. Sell everything. Liquidate your 401k. Pay all the tax  penaties.

- Live without insurance cause COBRA costs $2000 a month. Still Don't  have kids. Don't get sick. Don't have any catastrophic events that  leave you bankrupt.

- Now you can take a year and a half off and roll the dice _once_. Now  you can read all the success stories online and dream that you'll  get that too.

But you probably wont. And that's okay.

I've been passionate about technology for as long as I could remember. A few years back I took it upon myself to go back to school and get a degree so that I could get out of the sales industry and into something that A.) I enjoy doing and B.)would help support my growing family. 
In October 2016, I received my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information Systems from DeVry University. The CIS track is geared more towards software programming. I absolutely love programming but found that with my lack of spare time to invest and the abysmally low difficulty of DeVry' s curriculum, I was on the outside looking in. I never got calls back about internships and post-graduation I could never land an interview. 
After some time asking around and prodding industry experts, I found that my degree from DeVry was pretty much useless due to the lack of what they actually teach their students. Looking back we touched on basic algorithms and very basic data structures. Which, in the software industry, is not good at all because they all want knowledge of advanced algorithms and data structures. 
So here I am now, sparking an old flame in my heart of helping people and solving problems. I feel that the world of IT has a stronger calling on me the software development did. 
So, where do I start and how do I make myself appealing in the eyes of IT recruiters?  I know A+ would be a good start but I feel that is a ways out due to lack of funds at this moment (although I am studying the material in preparation).

I have an Associate degree and 5 years of experience in IT already, but trying to make a career transition to software development. I currently work as a Software Engineer Intern, but after some recent layoffs, I have been placed on more IT/support related duties which is not the direction I'm interested in heading.

In looking at the courses I have left before I graduate, I'm starting to become discouraged at how long it may take before I can start working full-time again. For personal/life reasons, it's not sustainable for me to continue taking 15 credit hours while working 15-20 hrs/wk. I'm averaging 55-60 hours/wk between school and work which is starting to affect my health. I'm also getting married next year and would like to start a family sooner rather than later. I'm trying to look at it in terms of opportunity cost.

Here's a couple of scenarios I see playing out:

1) In one scenario, I continue working at my internship but take less classes. In this case, I'm dragging out the time it takes to get my degree and also not significantly improving my professional skills as a developer (by working at the same place for 2-3 years doing mild development work). However, I'm getting paid, not having to take out student loans, and working towards a degree

2) In another scenario, I resign from my internship to double-down on getting the degree. In this case, I miss out on a job that I can sell as relevant development experience. I would also miss out on the nice paycheck and would have to take out a small amount in student loans for living expenses. However, I would be able to graduate sooner and thus be able to start working full-time much sooner.

3) In the third scenario, I send out resumes now for full-time jobs and start figuring out how to weave together a story explaining my path from an Associate degree and experience in IT to a partial CS degree and current experience in development. In this case, I would miss out on finishing a Bachelor's degree (despite being relatively close). However, I would be able to start working full-time sooner, and since I already have my foot in the door with real experience (and plenty of projects, both personal and professional, under my belt), hopefully that gives me an edge.

I'd appreciate any kind of input!"

On to myself. I am currently a senior at a well ranked liberal arts school majoring in Math and Economics, and I have a low GPA (around 2.7). I have no formal experience such as an internship, but I have worked with a classmate of mine in a business he started building models to invest a small amount of money ($30k) into futures market to make money off of contango trades. It is through this business that I sustained myself through college and now have some money to invest in my future if that would be useful. 

In terms of academic experience I have taken a few relevant classes for different career fields: these include econometrics (regression analysis), math modeling, comp sci 1 and 2, android dev, cryptography, combinatorics, international finance, public finance, stats, all levels of calc, and some others I'm not remembering off the top of my head. In addition, this coming semester I will be taking data visualization, probability, sports econometrics, and financial economics.

For extracurricular activities, I am the treasurer of a club on campus, and I have spent a great deal of time studying bitcoin and how it works, how financial markets work, have a decent amount of python experience and am starting some projects that I will hopefully be able to complete in a month or two and put on github, and have a significant amount of travel experience to several different continents.

In terms of the career I want to get into I'm not exactly sure, mainly because my longterm goal is to develop some business ideas I have but am not able to pursue due to lack of funding. I basically want to work a couple years and save aggressively to pursue that goal. Some fields I am considering include data analysis, business analytics, software engineering (primarily in python but possible android development in java as well or web dev but that may require a bootcamp or other education), IT, and finance. I have applied to a 3 jobs and have heard back from none other than that they received my application. My roommates think this is due to a low GPA and lack of connections to get my foot in the door, and they generally think I would preform well in an interview (all have offers from very reputable companies that they have accepted so I feel they know what they are talking about).

Basically, I am looking for advice as to what career fields I should be looking at (including or in addition to those I have mentioned), specific companies that would be more receptive to my application, or ways to enhance my resume and counteract the low GPA (maybe a coding bootcamp or certification of some sorts).

Any and all advice is much appreciated."

I have a BS in Computer Science + Info Systems.  

I'm just getting frustrated with work lately.  I work for a non-profit, and the salary is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Last meeting, my department head said everyone would be getting 1% raises next year (if the employee is eligible, which I am not).  I don't know, but after hearing this news recently made me feel a bit discouraged about my job.  I took a pay cut to accept this job (moved to a new city, lower pay for IT it seems), and now knowing that I won't get a raise until at least 1.5 years after my hire date has got me feeling a bit down.

At the same time, I'm not sure if I want to stick to the field of end-user support.  I'm 23 years old, and I can tell already that dealing with everyone's technological problems has taken a toll on me (I tend to get angry much more easily), and mainly, I'm just bored of helping fix mundane computer problems every day.  

I'm not much of a programmer, was never too good at databases, and I've had the general ""IT job"" for the better part of four years now.  I have CompTIA's Security+ cert, and while security *does* intrigue me, there are no entry level Infosec jobs that I have been finding.  Any I come across usually all require 5-10 years experience in security.

Where/what other kinds of positions would be advisable to branch off to?  I always figured I'd end up going the sysadmin route but I don't know how much longer I would put myself through end-user support to get there.

I'm perfectly aware of the harsh obstacles I will face if I were to move out and live on my own (apartment rent, utilities, my grandfather has my insurance covered for a couple of years), and I was planning to get that IT job as soon as possible.

What do you think I should do?"

I've learnt Java, C, and C++ in university, and Python in my own free time. For my internship this summer, I'll be expected to pick up and work with C#, so that's 5.

Now, out of Java, C, C++, C#, and Python, the first four are pretty similar languages and only Python is a proper scripting language. As such, I'd like to expand my horizons and learn other languages different from these, perhaps JavaScript.

I noticed then, how many languages is a developer expected to know? How many do you guys rotate between for your job?

7mej83,42,2017-12-27,Need advice - My SO has been unemployed and actively job hunting for 3.5 years now,IndulgentMoo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7mej83/need_advice_my_so_has_been_unemployed_and/,"3.5 years ago my husband and I moved so I could attend graduate school. We were fresh out of our undergraduate programs, no internships, only job experience was working at our university. We stayed in that location for 3 years but he was unable to find work. He had several interviews (at least 50), but was not hired due to lack of experience, the company hiring internally, or the position lost funding. He also applied to grocery stores, retail, fast food restaurants, USPS but they said he was too overqualified and would not take him. 

I transferred graduate programs 6 months ago, we are now in a big city. He spends hours every day applying for jobs. He has not received any interviews, but has had several rejections for lack of experience and an outdated resume. He has also applied to retail, grocery stores, etc. and is told he is placed on a “waitlist” but never heard back.

He has two undergraduate degrees (one in STEM, one in business), budgeting experience, some programming experience. 

I have suggested volunteering and learning more programming languages. Any suggestions on how to help my husband find work?

*Edit*: (I posted this in the comments below as well). I should also add (don’t know why I forgot to mention it earlier) that my husband’s education has also been critiqued in interviews, some have gone as far as to say his degrees are “worthless”. We went to a newer university (it was quite recently a state college) outside the state, not many people have heard of it. We did the same work as other universities, but he hasn’t been able to compete with graduates from way higher ranked programs in our current state.

We obviously regret not going to a better school now, but we didn’t know back then. Should he start over and go somewhere else? Other thoughts?

I’m a part time computer science master’s student, working full time at a job in my field. I’m not entirely satisfied with my current role. I’m coming up on my two-year anniversary at my job, at which point I have the option to take an “education leave” to pursue my degree full time. However, it’s not guaranteed I can return to my current role. Additionally, given the importance of my current role, I’m not sure I’ll even be approved to take leave.

Regardless of the conditions of the leave, I do still wish to return to school full time. My goal is to eventually pursue a Ph.D, but I also wish to explore opportunities outside of academia that my new degree could afford me, so I’ve also been applying to internships.

I received two pretty great offers for internships this coming summer. One is a more traditional tech internship that would actually pay competitively to my current job. The other is an research internship that pays less (almost half of the other position), but would better set me up for Ph.D applications, and seems to provide better chances of returning there for a full time position should I decide not to go the Ph.D. route. I also like the people/culture of the latter just a tad bit better, from what I’ve seen of both so far, but I could see myself quite happy at either. Also, I believe I’d find the work at either position much more satisfying than what I’m doing at my current job.

I wouldn’t be devoid of research opportunities during the school year if I return to school full time, so I’m leaning towards the higher paying position.

However, some part of me feels like I should just stick around at my current job well-paying job, continue doing school part time, and then leaving after I finish my degree. I can’t see myself enjoying that option, even though it would be the most financially stable one. I also worry that I would cripple future grad school prospects, or even future job prospects for roles I’m more interested in, if I don’t fully take advantage of my master’s program by doing it only part-time.

Anyways, TL;DR, I have some cool internship opportunities to choose from but I’m concerned about leaving my current job."

I've been reading stories on here for quite some time and been trying to answer questions where I can from my own experiences to help people. Now I have a question for you. 

We all started our businesses from ground zero at some point or maybe your acquired/purchased a business and revamped the entire thing. I want to know what it was from all the sleepless nights and problems you encountered that took your business to the next level where sales skyrocketed and things changed forever. Maybe you finally got in touch with that corporate executive and they gave you a chance or you landed a government deal that you had been working on acquiring forever. Whatever it was I'd like for you to share because it may help someone else who is stuck in a rut and trying to get to the next level. 

In my own personal case, I increased the volume of sales calls I was doing doing daily and hired college interns which led us to close a steady amount of deals on a weekly basis. The hardest part was ramping up to where people started responding to us because we were basically at zero. I found that its not the big five figure deals that keep your business afloat but more so the smaller consistent deals which you can close quickly. After that we were able to hire more support and advertise a lot more and it kept growing from there.

Post your own success story it will be much appreciated. Happy holidays "

I'm from a small town in Wyoming, and I'd always heard that degrees in CS were great opportunities. Computer science was clearly what I wanted to do with my life.

2.5 years into my degree, I've learned a lot. I've taken initiative and gone to every career fair Cal Poly has held, and applied to internships starting my first year. I have 5-6 diverse independent projects, and I've applied to almost 70 internships as of this post, as well as projects with professors outside of class. 

Despite my comfort talking to recruiters, my diligence with follow-ups, and my studying of technical interview textbooks, I have only had a couple companies ask for more information. And those companies never even followed up after I held their request.

I have no intentions of losing hope. I know that this process should never be reliant on motivation. I'm working hard to get where I want to be, but it's really hard to ignore the types of people that have zero independent projects and little work ethic score big internships just because they have family/friends in the valley. I loved growing up in Wyoming, but it is starting to seem like a curse. Connections seem like the only way to a first internship, but I don't know anyone in California. The industry clearly doesn't want to take the risk with me and after almost three years of hard work, I feel worse than ever about my future in this business. Are my concerns relevant to my future?"

&amp;nbsp;

Early morning sun beams through the rows of trees and scatters a warming glow upon the humvee.  Aristespha, Cideeda, Dretphi, Sebastian, and Sotalia sit within a small clearing.  Dretphi slides a spatula underneath the last few pieces of bacon in the frying pan above a small cooking burner.  With care, she balances the last slices away and deposits them on a transparent green plate resting upon a log.  The bacon settles in space between scrambled eggs, biscuits, oatmeal, and gravy.  Dretphi turns the knob on the burner to an ending click and the blue jets of flame poof out.  She glances at the full plate and the humvee, before gazing at the rest of the group.  “I know we agreed to let him sleep.  I prefer he eat fresh food.”

Aristespha lifts her head up from her tablet towards Dretphi, thinks a moment in her mind, and nods with smile.  “Might as well wake him.  I doubt he’ll sleep once we get back on the roadways anyway.”

A wicked smile flashes upon Sotalia’s lips and her eyes light with a mischievous gleam.  She pinches the last piece of bacon off her plate between two fingers, places the plate to the side, and stands up to a walk towards the humvee.  “Don’t worry, I got it!”

As Sotalia moves away from the clearing to the humvee, Dretphi returns her stare behind back to the burner and rolls her eyes long with a grumble.  “She enjoys the torment.  Possibly too much.”

Cideeda shakes her head with an amused smirk, sips coffee cautiously from a thermos, and sighs with an ending chuckle.  “Oh, don’t worry, girl.  She’s just having fun with his inhibitions.”

She lifts an eyebrow and eyes Sebastian sitting in thought next to Aristespha.  “I’m sure she did worst to you...  Sebastian?”

With a few quick blinks and eye darts to find the source of his spoken name, Sebastian meets Cideeda’s gaze, recalls the last few seconds in his mind, and nods with a tight smile and a tugging smirk.  “Oh, yah.  She’s been pretty mild actually.”

He laughs to himself, shrugs, and looks towards Dretphi with amusement.  “Anyway...  My bro will be fine.  He needs to learn how to stop being so awkward, anyway.”

Dretphi twists her mouth a few times, mulls over the concept in her mind, and sways her head side to side showing an air of uncertainty.  “There are lessons to learn.  Doubt the effectiveness of the method.”

Cideeda bites her lip as her tail sweeps around behind her, rolls her eyes, and snickers in between sips of coffee from her thermos.  “We shall see.”

The smile upon Sebastian face fades as he returns his head to rest upon the fist of his propped arm and his ethereal visage stares distantly in thought.  Aristespha diverts her attention away from the events in front of her and gazes to Sebastian with a quiet, calm voice.  “Are you okay, Sebastian?”

Sebastian flits his eyes back to attention and pivots his head upon his fist to smile warmly to Aristespha.  “I’m fine, dear.  Just thinking about...  Things.”

A curious quirk of the brow poises itself over her violet eyes and Aristespha maintains a calm, piercing stare to Sebastian.  After a few seconds, a long ghostly sigh escapes Sebastian and his smile weakens as the deeper thoughts rise up into his expression.  “I’ll explain it to you later, in private.”

A gentle, gloved hand grasps onto Sebastian’s free hand upon his his transparent thigh and a pair of glowing violet eyes look into his with a concerned but warm smile.  “Okay, Sebastian.”

Inside the humvee, intermittent snores sound out from Bach.  A blanket covers most his body and a small pillow supports his head that faces away from the morning light radiating through the passenger’s side windows.  The blanket swells with each long breath, settles with each exhale, and twists when Bach attempts to averts his eyes away from the sunlight.  The front passenger’s door engages and the sounds of outside leak into the muted interior as the it opens.  The front seat rocks slightly as a woman with golden eyes, dark red hair, and swept back horns places her chin down upon the headrest, wraps an arm around the seat, and eyes the sleeping Bach with a corner grin.  Two fingers secure a piece of bacon between them and an arm cranes out to slowly waving the slice near Bach’s nose.  Seconds pass before twitching cheeks contort Bach’s nostrils and his face animates with the first stages of consciousness.  His head moves subconsciously and briefly follows the trajectory of the bacon when Sotalia draws it away.  Bach’s eyes flutter open and attempt to work through the haze of sleep to perceive Sotalia.  A crispy snap and muffled crunches kick Bach out from his mental haze.  Sotalia presents her devilish grin in between bites of the diminishing bacon slice, and focuses her golden eyes on Bach.  “Well, good morning!”

Bach blinks the remnants of sleep from his eyes and navigates a hand from underneath his blanket to wipe the stubborn holdouts away.  “Um...  Morning?”

Sotalia rolls her eyes and sighs to a smile.  “Yes.  Dretphi wanted you to eat breakfast while its fresh and hot.”

The blanket slides off to the sides of Bach’s seat, and he pulls the side lever to angle the seat back from a recline.  “Okay.  That sounds good.  Right.”

The smile drifts closer to concern and Sotalia tilts her head to the side with her attention fully upon Bach.  “Hey, are you okay?”

Bach blinks and yawns to awareness.  He watches Sotalia vainly fail at suppressing a reactionary yawn and manages to put forth a weak smile.  “I guess.  I think?  I don’t feel bad or anything.  It’s just a lot to process, still?”

Sotalia rocks her head upon the headrest to a mimic a nod and renews her smile to Bach.  “Well, that makes sense.”

Long brown and gray hairs free themselves from last night’s arrangement and eventually rest upon Bach’s shoulders.  He brushes a few stubborn spots with his fingers and finishes with a long sigh shaking head side to side.  “I’m going to be honest...  Yesterday really pushed me to the breaking point...”

The smile lowers gradually to frown as Sotalia watches the unease play out on Bach face from the memories of yesterday resurfacing.  “I know.”

She lifts her other arm from a wrap around the seat, stretches a hand out, places her fingers underneath Bach’s chin, and angles his head upwards.  She inspects Bach face for moments and gently guides his head to check a few spots.  A smile reemerges on her lips and she drops her hand away from Bach’s chin.  “You are looking A LOT better today.  And, since we’re being honest, you really spooked me yesterday.”

Bach tugs at the corners of his mouth, twists his lips, and briefly grits his teeth averting his eyes.  “Ah.  Well, sorry about that.”

Sotalia slowly blinks her eyes, lightly sways her head, and pulls a grin from a corner of her mouth.  “Sorry nothing.  Thank you.  Really.  I needed someone to starkly remind me of the situation before I ran off doing something stupid in the moment.”

The dry smirk finds its way upon Bach’s mouth and he chuckles.  “I’m glad, but I really hope it doesn’t require something like that to remind you in the future.”

A confident laugh escapes Sotalia breath, she lifts her head off the seat’s headrest, and her arms settle to either side of the headrest upon the top of the seat.  “I hope so, too.”

Seconds of silence pass, a thought works itself across Bach’s face and he finally glances back to Sotalia with a wary tone.  “So, I guess you and Aristespha are going to question me how I sent that blast back?”

Sotalia narrows her eyes to Bach and slowly nods maintaining her stare.  “Yes.  Especially since that’s the first time we’ve seen someone pull a return to sender on anything from Noxian.”

She cocks her head to the side keeping her gaze upon Bach, places the now short piece of bacon in her mouth, bites sharply, and crunches loudly.  “But, that can wait a few days after we get back to the house.  I’m all for taking a few days break after all of this.”

Her golden eyes focus out the back passenger’s window and she twists her mouth in thought.  “Anyway, I think Aristespha will be too busy trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with this place and whose head she’s going to rip off when she finds out.”

Bach exhales relief but quickly draws breath in and glances out through the window to Aristespha meters away in the small clearing.  “I can’t blame her.  I’d like to know what happened here, but...”

He curls a lip into a sneer and groans.  “Preferably not while we’re here?  I can read about this place from the comfort of the living room couch.”

Sotalia draws air sharply through her nose and exhales long with a slow, exaggerated nod that trails off to a blinking sway of the head.  She notices the small piece of bacon left, pops it into her mouth, and chews it away.  Bach squints his eyes at Sotalia and quirks his brow inquisitively at her.  “So, I have to ask...  Was that one of MY pieces of bacon?”

A wicked grin flares up on Sotalia’s face as she nonchalantly slides out of the seat and steps out the front passenger door.  “Maybe?  You should probably check your plate.”

&amp;nbsp;

The orange dusk sky glows dimly through the windows of the decorated, wooden dining hall of the inn.  Goff adjusts the television from an articulated wall mount out and aims it towards the table with the group.  “I think I got the roof antenna right last time I climbed up there.  We’ll find out, I hardly ever turn this thing on unless its for a special event and the weather.”

Sebastian laughs ethereally, grins wide, and crosses his arms smugly.  “Well, it should be quite the special event given the week they probably had.  I’m just curious how they are going to try to spin it.”

Cideeda snickers with a dark, mischievous tone, glances to Dretphi, and pokes a claw tip gradually into her side.  “I’m curious how they’re going to frame that ass beating you gave your...  professional peer?”

A low grumble resounds from Dretphi, and she averts an unamused, distant stare from Cideeda’s toothy grin while pouring a ladle full of stew into her bowl.  “That term is incorrect.”

Anticipation squirms through Sotalia as she grasps hold of a bread roll and fidgets in the finely crafted wooden chair.  “Oooo!  I hope they do a nice segment between me and that Tassilda bitch!  I wonder how much the camera caught afterwards.”

Bach fends of his apprehension towards the television and the commercials running in the space before the next show.  He focuses on enjoying the food in front of him and occasionally eyes the screen to figure out what the commercial advertises.  Goff shrugs, walks back to his chair at the table, and slides himself and chair back in.  “Well, I think that’s the right channel.  Anyway, I hope they show this place in a good light, if anything.”

Aristespha directs a smile to Goff and covers brief giggle.  “Oh, Goff.  I wouldn’t worry too much.  Given how they usually act, this lovely inn will seem wonderful.”

She tilts her head to the side and lifts a curious eye brow at Goff.  “Again, I want to thank you for having room for us on such a short notice.  But, I remember you said you usually had a few regulars frequent this inn.”

Goff scratches the graying beard stubble underneath his chin and shakes his head with a long breath into his lungs.  “Hey, I’m glad you all needed a place to sleep.  For one reason or another, all my regulars either canceled or postponed.”

Sebastian drifts over near and angles himself to look at Goff.  “What were the reasons?  If it’s not too much to ask?”

The old man, Goff, gazes up into his head, mentally flips through a list, and maintains a count upon the fingers of his hand.  “Let’s see...  A trade group from the Appaland area postponed a few days due to bandits deciding to camp out their main route down.  But, last I heard they got some big mercenary group clearing the route ahead of them.  Their sister group is on standby until that clears up.”

He hems to himself as he sorts through a checklist in his mind and counts a few other points on his fingers.  “Then, these reagent hunters canceled because a Terra Priest group was spotted recently in the place they wanted to explore.  But, they mentioned there was another spot and would get back to me to make arrangements.”

The chair creaks slightly as he shifts his weight upon the back and sighs.  “I’m really sad the old guy from a few weeks ago had to cancel.  I really enjoyed him being around.  I was hoping to hear a few more of his stories.  But, he had some really unexpected things come up and had to change up all his immediate plans.  Even offered him a discount, but it sounded like he needed to take care of business first.”

Bach glances over to Goff and tugs the corner of his mouth with a bit of interest tinged with concern.  “Wow.  That has to be rough on business.”

Goff shrugs and holds his hands out to his sides with a nonchalant smile.  “That’s the nature of the business.  But, it works out.  You all needed a place to stay from what sounds like a rough few days, and I’m happy to be able provide a place.  Anyway, usually for every thing that stops people from getting here, there’s something that brings them here.”

He rests an elbow on the table, waves a hand, spoons some stew with his free hand, and cracks a sly grin.  “I don’t aim to profit from disaster, but that last maelstrom sent a lot of people my way.  And a lot of tree clearing work to my son.”

The television blares out familiar fanfare and a series of graphics flash up on the display showcasing the title “The Next Adventurers of Nexus”.

“Ladies and gentleman!  We have quite the week to recap!  Our adventurers have been quite busy!  Tempers flared from confrontation...”

A brief clip of showcases the banter between Sotalia and Tassilda.  The screen swipe cuts to a split screen graphic of Sotalia grinning menacingly with fireball in hand upon a golden yellow background.  Tassilda’s closeup smug, sly grin occupies the other side with her green fireball and a contrasting blue backdrop clashing with animated sparks to Sotalia’s side.

Sotalia pulls a wide teeth baring smile across her face and points the partially eaten beard roll towards the screen.  “Backgrounds that match our eye colors, not too bad.  Almost looks like something from a fighting arcade game.”

“Emotions exploded from unexpected defeats...”

On the display, the camera frames Trakenthin sitting unamused in the interview room as his body language borders on irritatiable.  He crosses his arms, glares harshly into the camera, and growls lowly.  A woman off screen questions him.  “Trakenthin, what are your feeling towards Dretphi?  Given your last match with her...  And the question at the panel?”

Trakenthin remains quiet, but the glare intensifies upon the camera focal point and a persistent twitch forms in his eye.  The woman continues her queries and shuffles some paper off scene near a microphone.  “We have the original audio, but we actually have a translation of the exchanges that I’ll read off.  First, lets play the question at the panel.”

An audio clip of Dretphi’s voice plays out into the airspace of the room.  Sotalia snickers covering her mouth and winks to Dretphi as a wicked smile escape the concealment of her hands.  The satisfaction filling Dretphi’s grin deflates to a neutral stoic expression the moment she notices the attention of Sotalia and the rest of the group.  Bach carefully leans close to Sotalia and whispers to her.  “What did she say anyway?”

Sotalia bites her lip with mischief under the watchful eyes of Dretphi, rolls her eyes, and softly answers back.  “Oh, it doesn’t have the same punch translated.  The cultural contexts makes it really cutting.”

As the woman off scene draws breath for her next statement, loud cracks of clenching knuckles echo in the room and Trakenthin pulls his fist back.  The camera view shatters as his fist impacts the protective glass and it abruptly falls backwards to hazily focus on the lighting rigs above and spooked camera crew.  Heavy foot steps stomp away from the microphone and a door slams powerfully with a trace crackle of splintering wood.

Cideeda pokes Dretphi playfully again with a claw tip and barely contains her laughter.  “I can’t believe how far under his skin you got!  He can’t even stand to hear your voice.”

A content smirk sneaks out from the corner of Dretphi’s mouth and challenges the firm neutral expression upon her face.  The television cuts to another segment and the announcer’s voice reads out.

“Curious covert conversations were had...”

From a distant shot, Cideeda stands along with Deedri in the dealer room at the convention, talking to each other.  Cideeda’s humors halts, her jaw drops, and her eyes widen with sheer bewilderment.  “How the fuck?!”

She studies the screen, blinks, and turns her head to the side as her stare studies the dynamics of the shot.  Her clawed hands gesture out the physics behind the shot in between alternating glances.  One hand serves as the target and the other as the camera location.  Cideeda squints at the screen, curiosity tempering frustration.  “Wait!  That’s a downwards overhead shot.  Someone actually climbed up into the maintenance walkways up in the rafters, found us, and recorded us?!  That’s it!  I see support beams around the edges of shot.  Who the hell?”

The imagery on screen cuts to another theme and the music mixes in with a pop rhythm.  The camera moves forward down a dark walkway towards a figure on the center stage.

“But, first, the announcement you’ve all been waiting for!”

A video clip opens up upon the screen and overlays on top the stage scene.  The video shows Chad standing up from a large, very familiar looking table in Goff’s dining hall.  He coughs loudly to capture the rest of the group’s attention and addresses them.  “I know you all have been curious as the exact details of the assignment and who exactly we are escorting back to Amaranth Valley.  I believe it is safe to reveal the details.  After the last show of her tour, we are going escort back the pop star Veevi Valiant.”

A mild mixture of reactions stir in between Deedri, Trakenthin, Tassilda, and Modoran, with no strong acceptance or rejection and a generally bland reception overall.  Chad grins brightly and draws a deep breath.  “After which, she will join our group as short term intern to experience the adventuring life herself, first hand.”

Modoran’s eyes flit open, he barely halts the inhale of water from his glass.  He drops his head forward to empty the contents of his mouth into the glass before drawing a gasp.  A wave of unease passes through Deedri and causes an involuntary cringe upon her face.  Trakenthin slowly lifts his head back away from his meal, gradually pivots it to Chad, and concentrates a glare of brewing rage upon him.  Tassilda crosses her arms with a hoist of her cleavage, flips her head up defiantly at Chad, and curls her lip into a disgusted snarl.  A tense moment of silence looms over the Flames of the Phoenix and shatters to the tumultuous objections of Trakenthin and Tassilda.  The window shrinks away to the background and the focus shifts to the stage lighting up.  A half-fvalian girl struts across the stage to the walkway in front.  She tosses her vibrant pink, long hair around and sways her long, short-haired tail in sync with each step.  Her short, upright fuzzy ears perk as she lifts a microphone to her mouth and sings to the music playing.  Clips of her career flip up onto the screen showcasing a variety of pop phases and themes, along with segments of her scandals and drama.  Cutting through the din, the yells of Chad to the team rise out from the background.  “It’s ONLY for ONE mission!  Just ONE!”

Aristespha widens her eyes in disbelief, hangs her jaw agape, and covers mouth and nose with both hands.  Sebastian snorts and fails to stifle his ghostly reverberating cackles.  Sotalia draws an ear to ear grin, props her arm upon the table, and rests her head upon her hand as she continues to watch the chaos upon the television.  Cideeda blinks hard a few times and slowly shakes her head.  “I have to admit, that’s a little cruel and unusual.”

Dretphi quirks a brow and glances to Cideeda quizzically.  “She is the same one from the concert.  I believe?”

Cideeda nods slow, draws a long breath, and exhales with a slight whistle.  “Yes.  Yes, it is.  I think she’s on a show called The Next Star of Nexus...  Oh, I bet this is some kind of cross promotional ploy.”

Bach grits his teeth and squeezes a sigh through, eyeing the progression of the drama on the television.  “Well, I guess the good news is that they’ll be a little preoccupied for a while and hopefully leave us alone.”

An awkward tension wafts across the table as each member of the group individually realizes the proximity that such a personality will be to their current home.  Goff shrugs nonchalantly and smiles humored.  “Well, looks like tomorrow night is going to be really exciting again!”

Aristespha, Bach, Cideeda, Dretphi, Sebastian and Sotalia focus their collective attention upon Goff, a mix of curiosity and dread playing out upon each individual’s expression.  Goff works his mouth side to side and hems with an ending chuckle.  “As much as I’d love more of your business this weekend...  It might serve you all better to head straight home tomorrow morning.”

&amp;nbsp;

A late afternoon light illuminates the familiar and comforting living room from the sliding glass door.  Dretphi sits upon the floor and sorts through the first load of dry laundry, placing folded clothes in the appropriately named basket.  Cideeda’s claws pick through the exposed components of her laser pistol, scraping bits of soot off and prying a small chunk of rock out from the focusing barrel.  Sotalia sits on the couch, counting vials of potions and inspecting the parts and pieces of unrolled equipment kits upon the coffee table.  Bach lifts a large metal case onto the kitchen floor from the garage and hauls it next to another similar container by the dining table.  Moments later, Aristespha walks in through the hallway archway and stands straight with a neutral but serious expression.  Sebastian hovers through immediately afterwards, stands next to Aristespha, and pans a gaze across Bach, Cideeda, Dretphi, and Sotalia.  He puts forth an admirable effort to maintain a confident smile that roughens around the edges as his mind concentrates on the prominent thought in his head.  With an ethereal cough, he address the group in tone missing the usual bravado.  “Everyone, if I could have your attention...  I need to say something pretty serious.”

The strange tone from Sebastian carries across the room, yanks everyone’s focus away from their respective chores, and fills the room with uneasy tension.  Eyes fall upon Sebastian and he continues his efforts to maintain a smile that fades quickly to wary smirk.  He gazes out at the group and sighs.  “I’ve been thinking the last two days, reviewing the situation...  And how things are looking.”

He lowers his head momentarily, ethereally sighs, and lifts his face up to meet everyone’s eyes.  “We got ridiculously lucky Thursday.  There was a damn good chance that we could have all met our ends.”

Sebastian face contorts as a flood of emotions fight to express themselves.  “I know our profession is risky in general, but...  I feel that some misjudgment of mine put us in that situation...  That was completely avoidable.”

He stiffen his lips, blinks hard, and gazes out to the group.  “I know situations can change anytime, anyway on a mission and all of you have been extremely supportive.  But, this last encounter with Noxian was too close...  And, way too familiar to THE previous time we encountered him.”

A shaky undertone fills his voice as he concentrates his attention and visits a glance to Bach, Cideeda, Dretphi, and Sotalia.  “I...  I...  I’m glad no one paid a price this time...  Like I had to last time.”

A slight wince washes over Aristespha’s face.  Various degrees of frowns push faces down and gloom looms into the room.  Sebastian straightens his posture again and continues his address.  “I can accept my fate...  Eventually.  But, I do not want anyone to suffer a worse fate because my failure of judgment.”

He briefly grits his teeth, grimaces, and sighs in remorsefully.  “We had NO BUSINESS confronting Noxian this time and especially THE last time down in Anta.  As much shit as we give those guys in Flames of the Phoenix and previous groups on Next Adventurers of Nexus...  I can’t rightfully say my judgment was any better than theirs.  I’ve been pushing the group too hard, too fast, and without being careful enough.  I thought we might be able to catch Noxian when he was weak and just solve everything quickly.  But...  Noxian has changed his tactics and I don’t know what he’s up to anymore.”

With distant stare forward, a head held up high, and stiff upper lip, Sebastian carefully speaks in a calm but wavering voice.  “That’s why in good faith, I can’t ask any of you to continue on this path against Noxian.  If anyone wants to stay away from him,  I’ll understand and we’ll continue on as a group for as long as we can.  We’ll enjoy the time we have before circumstances catch up to Aristespha and by proxy of the sword...  Me.  And...  If you want to leave the group...  I can’t blame you.”

His stoic demeanor cracks and his words shudder with his trembling frown.  “Truth be told...  There’s part of me that would be happy to know you wouldn’t be steered Noxian’s direction anymore.”

Wide eyes gaze around the room as the heavy atmosphere weighs down and compresses the mood well into the floor.  Traces of tears form in Aristespha’s eyes as the silent collective contemplation lingers in the room.  Eventually, Sotalia mutters swears silently to herself, lifts herself off the couch to stand quickly upright, and marches around the coffee table to stare Sebastian up in his face.  She glares with a fury welling behind her eyes.  “Fuck.  You.  Sebastian.”

Sebastian’s dour expression falls unceremoniously off his face onto the ground and his eyes widen with shock towards Sotalia.  She focuses her stare upon Sebastian and pierces through his very being.  “Fuck. You.  Don’t you DARE kick your own ass in front us and act like we didn’t have a part in the whole thing!”

Sotalia firmly places her hands on her hips, perks a brow, and maintains a hard gaze upon Sebastian.  “You’ve always involved us in every big important decision.  You always considered our safety above anything else.  And you have ALWAYS reviewed any plan with us and asked for our input.  So, fuck you for dumping this bullshit all on yourself like some kind of martyr.”

Her expression softens quickly while she looks into Sebastian’s ethereal eyes and she blinks hard, wetting her eyes.  “And, fuck you...  For not being solid enough for me to slap some sense into you.”

A small smile graces Sotalia’s lips and she winks to Sebastian as she pivots to face Aristespha.  “So, I’ll do the next best thing for you.”

Aristespha blinks with glistening tears hanging in her eyes and puzzles as Sotalia shifts her attention.  Sotalia smiles, opens her arms up, steps forward, and hugs Aristespha with a soothing pat on the back.  “There, there, girl.  I am going to help you kick Noxian’s ass and get Sebastian back whole again.”

Tears finally escape Aristespha’s eyes as the initial stun wears off and she wraps her arms around Sotalia with meek whisper.  “Thank you.”

A warm smile grows on Dretphi’s face and she gazes to Sebastian with a calm, bright tone.  “Important decisions rarely have best options.  I believe we have taken the right options of the decisions presented.  We will continue to make those decisions in the future.”

She exhales slowly with a tension in her voice.  “Noxian’s actions concern me.  I do not want to experience what they will become if unhindered.”

Cideeda flicks an ear, stares at Sebastian with an amused, toothy smile, and slowly shakes her head with a long, exaggerated eye roll.  “You can’t get rid of me that easily.”

She gestures with her hands to emphasize and punctuate her points to Sebastian with toothy grin.  “Don’t beat yourself up on my account.  I’m smart enough to know well enough what I’m getting into.  Anyway, I really doubt that letting Noxian mess with a magical rift or continue to charge up with some ancient artifact was going to lead to anything good for anyone.  Don’t work yourself up with the thought I’m going to leave now.”

A strong smile forms on Sebastian mouth and relief loosens his stiff posture.  He blinks as some semblance of tears reflect on his ghostly visage.  A few seconds later, he gazes to Bach in silent contemplation and humbles his demeanor.  “Bro, you put yourself in the line fire, yet again, and saved everyone.  I...   I’ve already put you into harms way enough as it is-”

Bach lifts his hand up, halts his brother’s speech, and snorts as he contorts his mouth into a reserved smile.  “Brother, I promised to help you and I am going to whether you fucking like it or not at this point.  And, it’s not like the broke quasi-mage life is calling me back.”

He perks his eye brow up, strains his marginal smile, and exhales with a slight hiss as his eyes wander analyzing the situation.  “I’m still pretty clueless to all this adventuring stuff.  I’m still scared by some of the stuff we do.  And, I’m just now feeling useful overall.”

A solid grin pushes through the waves of doubt in Bach’s expression and a moment confidence washes away the uncertainty in Bach’s body language.  “But gods dammit, you all are going to need my help to stop that crazy bastard from doing whatever he’s got planned.”

He pans a gaze to everyone else in the room, draws a deep breath, and sighs with chuckle.  “And I’m sure we’ve all seen, heard, or read enough stories to know that anyone messing with power like that shouldn’t be left alone with it.”

Sebastian closes his eyes for a few moments, sniffs a couple times, and ethereally exhales his remaining tension away.  “Thanks, bro.  It’s good hearing it from you.”

Donning a renewed aura of bravado, Sebastian smiles confidently to everyone and nods.  “Well, I’ll do my best to lead us right in the future towards our goal of stopping Noxian.  But, for now...  let’s take the rest of today and tomorrow to relax.  We’ll sit down Monday and rethink our plan of attack.  The situation has changed again and I want to make damn sure we change accordingly.”

Sebastian bites his lip with an eye roll and shrugs.  “Sorry for any unnecessary drama, but I had to say something and make sure for everyone’s sake.  I do consider you all family and I want to do what’s best for everyone...  Well...  The best possible given the likely world ending dark lord we have to somehow triumph against.  Thank you, everyone.”

Sotalia releases Aristespha, eyes Sebastian with a lift to her brow, and shakes her head with a smile as she walks back to the couch.  Dretphi resumes digging through the dry clothes in the laundry basket and examining who they belong to.  Cideeda turns herself back forward in her chair at the table and picks up a cleaning cloth with her focus upon her partially disassembled laser pistol.  Bach gives a quick thumbs up to his brother, pivots, and then steps back towards the kitchen door to the garage.  Aristespha gazes up to Sebastian’s ghostly form and waits for Sebastian to meet her eyes.  He smiles warmly back to her and she nods happily.

&amp;nbsp;

Bright white light shines from the headlamps on black sports utility vehicle and down the narrow residential road.  Chad gradually adjusts the steering wheel to follow the contours of the dark road through the night.  “Almost there.”

Tassilda drops her head back into the rear driver’s side seat headrest and groans as she rubs the bridge of her nose.  “I can’t believe we’re going to try to teach that girl ANYTHING about adventuring.  I sincerely hope whatever mission we have to bring her on is easy.”

Squirms of nervous energy work their way through Deedri’s body and she grits her teeth briefly as she stares out the rear passenger’s window.  “I just hope she doesn’t get hurt.”

Tassilda rolls her head on the headrest to face Deedri across from her with an amused perk to her lip.  “Well, I do, too.  As if we need anything more for her to complain about.  I’m just glad she’s staying at that hotel for the night, at least.”

Deedri bites her lip and eyes Tassilda warily with a nervous air.  “That, too.   But, if she gets hurt, I’ll have to treat her.  And...  She gives me strange looks that really make me think she’s more than I want to deal with.  Especially, alone.”

Modoran’s dark blue eyes dart between Deedri and Tassilda’s conversation as it lowers to whispers.  He eases himself forward from resting upon the third row seat and trains his full attention upon the discussion between Tassilda and Deedri, curiosity tainting his expression.  Trakenthin tends a near sneering glare out the front windshield from the front passenger’s seat with his arms crossed.  He squints abruptly and focuses to a section of road in the closing distance.  “Something ahead.”

The vehicle slows to a stop and the lights project forward onto two blockages on the road.  On one side of the road, a gigantic plant stalk arches from the nearby forest and a large circular seed pod flower lays crashed on the pavement.  Huge leaves springing from the stalk shake as an animal pushes against it.  A large boar with patterns on its back fur sniffs and snorts the pavement.  He opens his mouth, bites down on a large seed, and munches contentedly.  Chad tilts his head to the side and mutters to himself.  “What the fuck?”

Deedri, Tassilda, and Modoran work their ways forward in the car and stare out to examine what lies ahead.  Deedri points a claw tip towards the gigantic plant and her eyes widen in astonishment.  “That’s a protellow plant.  And a huge one!  I didn’t know there any around here.”

Trakenthin grunts and eyes the creature before him through the windshield.  “Resembles a boar.”

Chad lifts a brow and watches the boar continue to eat seed after seed happily ignoring the headlights illuminating the area.  He presses a thumb on a steering wheel button and the car’s horn blares out in the surrounding dark roadway.  The boar stops, briefly glances to the source of the sound, and then promptly resumes eating another seed.  Chad blasts the horn out a few more times and the boar still pays no mind.  He thinks a few moments to a growing smirk, then eyes Trakenthin as he shifts the vehicle’s gearshift to park.  “Well, if you know what it is, then you can deal with it.  Get it out of the road.”

A low growling grumble sounds out from Trakenthin as he releases his seat belt buckle and pulls the handle to his door.  He places his heavy boots firmly upon the pavement, stands up behind the open car door, and glares at the boar.  He thinks a moment, loudly claps his hands together, and bellows out aggressive phrases in Grath to the boar.  The boar pauses from eating, glances at Trakenthin for a few moments, and then consumes another seed from the huge, round flower.  Trakenthin blinks, shakes his head incredulously, and steps cautiously towards the boar.  Standing right beside the boar, he studies the creature and scratches his head giving a shrug to Chad in the sport utility vehicle.  He lifts up his large boot, lowers it firmly onto the backside of the boar, and gradually applies pressure to push the boar forward onto the other side of the road.  The boar shifts that direction initially, but soon tenses his body and applies his mass and muscle against the force from Trakenthin’s foot, in measured defiance.  Trakenthin stops pushing, places his boot back down, and watches the boar settle his footing to continue eating.  He dons a greatly amused grin upon his face, chuckles to himself with a quip in grath, kneels down, and strokes the back ridge of hair on the boar’s back.  Chad’s jaw drops, and he throws his hands to the sides.  “What the fuck, Trakenthin?”

Deedri sees Trakenthin pet the boar and smiles excitedly with a bright glint in her eyes.  “Aww, he’s friendly.  I want to pet him!”

Chad undoes his seatbelt, yanks his door open, and hops out of the car, narrowing his eyes at Trakenthin.  “Get it out of the road already!”

Trakenthin glares back at Chad and growls at him as he calmly strokes the back of the boar.  “I am trying.”

Frustration overtakes Chad’s tone and he shakes his head angrily.  He walks up to the boar and glowers at him, pouring the full ire of his scowl upon the critter.  “What’s wrong with this thing?  Shouldn’t this pig be scared of us or something?”

After a few pulls to the corner his mouth, Trakenthin shrugs and continues to pet the creature.  “Maybe.  I am not familiar with this fur pattern on a boar.  A piglet.  Yes.  Strange.”

Chad buries his face in his hand and grumbles loudly.  “Well, just pick him up and drop him off the side of the road, or something!  Tomorrow is Monday, and I want to be able to rest sometime this weekend.  I just want to get back before anything else happens!”

A loud series of snaps and cracks chain together to form a cacophony that echoes out in the area.  Another gigantic plant stalk slips between the gaps of nearby trees and free falls down with a resounding metallic, dull thud upon the roof of the black car.  A shriek and squeak intertwine in the background under the cascading rainfall of large seeds upon the metal body of the vehicle and pavement of the road.  In the moments of silence afterwards, Chad slowly pivots to gawk in astonishment at huge circular, flowery seed pod resting within the fresh dent into the roof.  He tries to form words but manages to only move his mouth to start of phrases.  Trakenthin blinks in amazement, surveys the scene carefully, but glances to the boar who happily grunts and wags his tail.  As Trakenthin feels the boar shuffle in place to excitedly squeal, he lifts his head and freezes in place as his eyes widen.  In mere moments, Trakenthin scrambles from the boar, plants himself in his car seat, slams the door shut, and points out something to the rest of the group inside the car.  Chad regains awareness to witness Deedri, Modoran, Tassilda, and Trakenthin staring in unison to the forest bordering the road.  He pivots slowly, opens his eyes fully, and races to his front driver’s seat.  “Shit!”

As the car door closes, snapping and crackling noises erupt into the soundscape.  A large two meter tall boar creature presses effortlessly through the underbrush.  The dire boar’s eyes follow the stalk to the vehicle and she steps proudly up on the road.  An accompaniment of five other dire boar piglets spread out from the influence of a flowing magical miasma that radiates from the dire boar.  Her maw clamps down the stalk.  She shifts the stalk and slides the seed pod off the roof of the vehicle with a weak metallic scrape.  The flowery seed pod crashes down on the pavement and a swarm of piglets descend over the seeds scattered around the now scratched and dented, black sports utility vehicle.

Minutes after the initial shock fades, the occupants of the vehicle deal with the situation in their own ways.  Trakenthin smiles as he watches the piglets challenge each other for choice seeds.  Tassilda stares in sheer fascination of the power and aura of the mighty dire boar.  Modoran deftly picks off seeds from the roof through the open sunroof and gives handfuls to Deedri, which she feeds to piglets through her window.  Chad lifts his head briefly from the steering wheel, weakly glares at the lone piglet in front of the car, and drops his head back down to a frustrated grumble."

Have any of you got a job irrelevant to your major?,fatmonkeyz,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7mkkz8/can_you_get_a_good_job_outside_your_major_have/,"I am a sophomore in college here in my home state in NJ where I am born and grown in. I am studying for a Bachelor's (4 year program) IT right now.

During my freshman year, I had a misunderstanding that IT jobs are easy to get and that they are available everywhere, but apparently it is the opposite. There are TONS of places hiring IT people, but they are very competitive to get, especially in given areas (like Seattle, WA or San Francisco, CA for example).

Now as a sophomore, I kind of worry about my future and if I even will get an IT job in the first place. Also, I would like to move out of NJ and move out to the west coast like Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, or New Mexico when I finish college. The issue is some of the metro areas out west can be very competitive (and expensive) for getting an IT job. I always had a passion for computers and fixing them. If I don't get an IT job, I would be happy doing something a bit tech-savvy as well. If that happens, I could always say to myself that frustration with coding at times is not my favorite thing anyways (true!). 

I am also seeking for an IT internship this summer hopefully in NJ or out west (hopefully I can get housing somehow).

As the title says, I am currently a freshman CS major trying to get an internship this Summer at some sort of tech company.

I understand that getting an internship as a freshman is very difficulty, but I figured it would be cool to try. I'm really motivated to get an internship this summer, so I figured this would be a good place to ask questions.

I have worked on 5 mobile application projects in both Swift and Objective-C and they are all apps on the App Store. I was hoping that with this experience I would be able to hopefully get some sort of position as a mobile developer somewhere. I have looked through a number of company websites and have found multiple positions that seek mobile developers. What are the chances that I would be able to get an internship developing mobile apps as a freshman? What can I do to increase my chances?

Sorry if this post comes across as really naive. I am open to any comments and appreciate any advice. 

Thanks!"

7mllu1,2,2017-12-28,"Just switched to Computer Science from Computer Engineering, need advice on failed course.",6lick-6lug-6lucker,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7mllu1/just_switched_to_computer_science_from_computer/,"Hello everyone, 

Last semester was really rough on me. I was stuck in a shitty internship that ended up screwing me over with only one semester and overworking me and a lot of emotional issues came to a breaking point with my courses.  

I found a lot of the concepts and work in my courses to be manageable but due to laziness and emotional turmoil I didn't do the best.  I skipped a lot of class and often barely studied for classes. 

Long story short this resulted in me having a high D in Matrices for Engineers (my university has this instead of Linear Algebra for Engineering students) which I plan to retake next fall.  I also got an F in circuits, which I don't plan to retake since I switched to Computer Science. 

I ended up switching majors because I am very good at programming and do very well in computer science courses (even when I barely attend).  I was originally going to go to school for Computer Science but chose against it as my University had it in the business department at the time. After it moved to the Engineering department I didn't change because I became obsessed with the thought that I would end up working in computer hardware with no idea what I wanted to actually do with computer hardware.  I kept running away from my talents with programming because I thought it was ""beneath me"" and too easy.  However when I did this I ended up being not nearly as good at it as I knew I was able to be and constantly found lost.  I was so dedicated to the idea that I was deep down a hardware engineer I would talk to job recruiters at fairs that would be interested based off my programming experience and then say ""yeah but I think I'm more interested in hardware."" At the past job fair I got to finally talk to someone about hardware and when they grilled me about it I had no clue what I was talking about.  In the end I realized that I needed to stop running away from what I'm good at and dedicate more time to focusing on my skills and honing them. 

After finally changing I feel more dedicated than ever and intend to very well this upcomimg semester. I have interviews for internships lined up and I'm happy to see what my courses hold for me.  I don't plan to retake circuits because a lot of people say since I don't need it I shouldn't have to. 

I'm looking for advice on keeping my head up next semester and want to know about people's similar experiences..

Lemme start with explaining my current situation. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science in the US. I will be done in the next semester. 
I want to do an MBA and always wanted to do one but I dont have any work experience. And this is where is gets all messy and I'm banging my head to make up my mind. 

I have a standing offer from the Business School of my university and they are offering me full scholarship to the program and included within this program are 1 internship semester and 1 international trip. The Business school itself is pretty good and is AACSB certified and is the best in the state. And if there was no pressure on me regarding the choice, I would definitely pick this choice of MBA. 
But some people say that doing an MBA after getting some job experience would be better as you get exposure and also you'd be accepted into the top tier schools. 
I have done some research on these top tier B-Schools and one of the problem is the fee of the program. The top tier business schools have a huge fee compared to my full scholarship and also Im afraid that if I do pick a job now, I wont be able to pursue the MBA due to family obligations later on. 

Any suggestions and opinions on the matter are welcome. 
Thanks in advance!"

7mmpu2,17,2017-12-28,The Art of Dentistry,b1tchcraft,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7mmpu2/the_art_of_dentistry/,"When I was a kid, I always hated going to the dentist. Nothing filled me with more dread than the twice yearly excursion to the sanitary white walls, blinding fluorescent lights, and overly eager dental hygienists. I would close my eyes for the entire cleaning, mumble one word answers to their inane questions, and pray for sweet release. My parents would reward me with a Happy Meal after the requisite hour, but it was never enough. I was terrified of the sounds, the smells, that cultural looming fear that I absorbed from the ether even at such a young age. Drills and needles and the invasion of an intimate space by strangers in Garfield scrubs caused me to sweat profusely.


But that was the old me. This is the story of how I became a dentist.


Obviously this wasn't my dream from the get go. It's funny how life can pop up and surprise you like that. I remember watching Animal Planet when I was home sick one day, probably around age ten. There was a special on penguins that really caught my eye. Something about the primal struggle to survive in such a harsh and frigid environment. Sweeping glacial tundras, barren, desolate - it struck me that moment that Earth is a planet. I know that's a dumb thing to think, obviously Earth is a planet, but seeing such raw purity, untouched by man, just jolted me into the epiphany of our place in the solar system. Mars had its rusted deserts, Jupiter its swirling gaseous storms, Venus its sulfuric hellscape, but Earth? The planet teeming with life and water and movement? I never thought that we too could have our swathes of unbearable frozen wasteland. It humbled me. And I wanted to study it. I wanted to go there and feel the planetness of the planet.



In a way, dentistry and paleoclimatology have some similarities. We both use drills. After my Animal Planet moment (who knows how different my path would be if I never had strep throat that day...), I got out tons of books from the library about Antarctica. Did you know Antarctica is technically a desert? That's because of the amount of rainfall it receives annually. I asked for books about glaciers and arctic explorers for every birthday and Christmas. In high school, I took all AP science classes. I loved biology the most, learning about the origins of life. To think - our planet once looked so barren. How did that begin to change? Where did life arise, and how? How can all we see today spring up from such initial seemingly insurmountable conditions? 



I naturally followed this path through college (UNC), which I knew had grad programs that would let me pursue my love of ancient, frozen microbes. Nerdy, I know. But that minutiae captivated me. I wasn't so single minded, however. I played on the school's intramural rugby team and even took a few creative writing classes. I was a RA my senior year and met my future wife there. She's actually going to dental school now.



During this senior year, I was lucky enough to apply for a prestigious intern position with the department head, Dr. Wasser. She's a stately British woman, with thick iron hair and a smart dress sense straight out of the 1970s. She was brisk and warm all at once. I had lobbied her office to let me take a grad course while I was an undergrad senior, even though it was at extra cost for me and would mean my fullest course load yet. But I knew I just had to take it. I met with her on a Monday evening after emailing her secretary for probably the dozenth time. 


""I really do admire your persistence. But trust me, you aren't the first.""


I shifted uncomfortably in the chair across from her, my eyes darting from international knick-knack to international knick-knack on the handsome wooded shelves. This looked like a university office straight off of a movie set, with antique globes and exotic tchotchke adorning bookshelves stuffed to the brim with leather bound volumes and reams of academic papers. She even had those silver balls that you pick up and drop and they click back and forth. 


""Well I can understand that,"" I replied with a smile, ""with such a prestigious program.""


I could tell she restrained rolling her eyes. ""Look, I already spoke with your adviser and I have to say I am rather impressed with some of your papers. 4.0 GPA, engaging class participation, good use off office hours. Just the right kind of know it all.""


""Thank you,"" I stammered, a little too eagerly.


""I need some fresh blood for a research trip I'm planning for this summer, and to be frank I get extra funding if I 'incorporate UNC's diverse and talented undergraduate population,' as per my grant request statement. My grad students and I, along with Professors Drummond and Fletcher, will be going to Blood Falls.""



I felt a shiver. Blood Falls. The mysterious and dramatic flow from Taylor Glacier that lives up to its name. Deep ruby waters spring from a sub-glacial source of unknown size. Iron oxide deposits give the saltwater its signature hue, but that doesn't make the sight any less striking. Its primal colors reminded me of ancient cave paintings at Lascaux and Altamira - a very primal ocher marking of humankind. The mysterious subglacial source has been shielding from exposure for millions and millions of years - and the microbial life deep within could have held the key to the origins of life. I would have gone in this expedition even if I meant I was the designated penguin pooper scooper. This was an opportunity of a lifetime. She was happy with my acceptance and explained how I'd be assisting with the grad students equipment. I didn't care if she picked me at random, or if she really did trust the good word of my professors. I was going to the land I dreamed of since I was a little girl.



My parents were so incredibly proud of me. Although they'd never admit it, they were always worried about the narrowness and specificity of my interests. But this trek, in their eyes (and admittedly, mine too), proved that I was good at what I did and this was a viable career path. It's funny, because none of us actually ended up as climatologists. We're all dentists now. 



Our team consisted of Dr Wasser, Professor Drummond - a tall Nigerian man in his late fifties who specialized in antarctic vegetation, Professor Fletcher - a squat American woman who worked with Dr Wasser on a previous research excursion, seven grad students (Wang Li, Jeff, Sheila, Amar, Fatima, Romesh, Gregor), me, and the hired pilots. Our ""base camp"" was McMurdo Station. Blood Falls is in what is known as the ""dry valleys"" and can only be accessed via helicopter. We'd be staying at the Station in between expeditions - the longest we'd camp at the Falls would be three days. But it only took one day to change my life.



Nothing in a book, movie, show, picture, or any recording can prepare you for the true remoteness of the antarctic. I had been dreaming, yearning for this moment since I was ten years old. I was completely moved to tears. The screechingly bright whiteness that engulfs you, biting blue skies, yawning icy chasms, sparse rocks with their desperate lichen, the shrieking winds, your whole body both repusled and drawn to this utterly foreign landscape. It's baffling to comprehend how truly far away I was from anything I had ever known. It's what I imagined Neil Armstrong felt like on the moon: staggeringly alone, completely awestruck. I shelved my reverie in the back of my mind as we went through all the necessary prep work at the station. 


One of my jobs was to check and recheck everyone's supplies and packing lists, ensuring we had more than enough of what we needed in case the weather prevented our scheduled return. Our official research plan was related to collecting various ice cores in and around Blood Falls, and analyizing the samples for pertinent climate data, and if we were lucky, microbial presence. Dr Wasser had some complicated and interesting research on biogeochemical cycling and their relation to the nature and detectability of biosignatures. She was working in conjunction with some exoplanet researchers on developing new techniques in discovering habitable exoplanets. While my personal interests were more earth bound, that didnt matter. This was still the best thing to ever happen to me and I was so excited to learn everything I could about being a real live scientist. 



While we had two scheduled excurions to the Blood Falls site, we only made it to the first. And it's unfortunate how little of it I do remember. The seven grad students (who I conviently named in my head after the seven dwarves) drew straws to see who would accompany Dr Wasser and Professor Fletcher on the first trip. It'd be 3 students, the two professoers, and me - the errand girl. The second trips would consist of Professor Drummond, the remaining four students, and me again. Amar (Sleepy, because he had to sleep with a fancy neck pillow and eye mask on the flights to Christchurch), Gregor (Sneezy, because he had asthma), and Sheila (Bashful - and my future wife) were the first three picked. I could barely sleep that night - everyone else was playing card games and swapping stories, but I just lay in my bunk and tried to contain my feverish excitement. Blood motherfucking Falls! Eventually, around 11 pm, everyone else quieted down and fell asleep. The last time I checked my watch was at 2:15 AM. My dreams were as blank as the vast stretches of snow around me. My alarm went off at 6 AM, and I didn't even need coffee to jumpstart my brain. We left at 9 AM.



It was about a 75 mile flight. We took two helicopters and three days of supplies. I checked and rechecked and checked again all the lists of various scientific equipment, camping gear, food provisions, clothes, etc. Up in the helicopter, with the hypnotic chugging of the propeller drowning out all sound, and the dramatic stark white undulating snowscape below, you really do feel like you are on another planet. It was almost like a great white abyss? Anti-Stygian? In its profound vastness, but also its brightness. I was consumed by its beauty and terror. What if we crashed? Would we be stranded? What would have happened to Neil Armstrong if the rocket exploded? My mind raced with these isolating catastrophes, that I barely noticed the approaching Blood Falls.



We touched down in a whirlwind of shimmering white dust as the blades kicked up powdery snow. Dr. Wasser and Professor Fletcher discussed with the pilot while the four of us stepped out to survey our ""camping grounds."" It wasn't as tall as I thought it'd be. Not that I was unimpressed, but when you hear a name like Blood Falls you picture Empire State Building sized gushing ruby red torrents. It's a modest, several story end of Taylor Glacier with streaky rust red rivulets fanning out into the ice cover below. So to hopefully help with the picture in your mind, underneath Taylor Glacier is the sub-glacial source water for the Falls. The flow goes out over the frozen under ice Lake Bonney. We would be camping in front of the Falls, effectively on Lake Bonney. We'd trek up to various points around and above the falls to collect the needed ice cores. After taking a moment to absorb the sights in front of us, we walked back over to the copter to help unload the remaining pack. It only took us about two hours, all six of us working together. With the remaining daylight, the plan was to go over our itinerary, explore the area a bit, set up the equipment, and prep for tomorrow. Gregor and Amar started working on the fire, the professors were going over their notes, and Sheila and I decided to walk up to the Falls and take some pictures. 



Despite our carefully planned outfits keeping us comfortable, you can just feel the coldness radiating from the surrounding ground. The sun was bright but not warming, and the chilling outstrectched tundra offered no solace. There's old military slang - ""rock happy"" - meaning going a little nuts being on an isolated island. I could feel the creeping tendrils of it winding its way to my brain. I was just giddy with the strangeness of my surroundings. Sheila was chatting away about her own personal research interests, and it kept me centered. Her teeth were so white and pretty. As we got closer to the Falls, the first tiny strands of rusty red seemed to be beckoning me closer. I had to restrain myself from running straight to the mouth. Sheila paused to set up the tripod she was carrying on her back. I walked over to the first big ""puddle"" of slushy martian snow. 


I felt like I was in a dream. I knelt down and took my glove off, reaching my hand into the pool. I know I shouldn't have done it but I was compelled, magnetized. I stuck my hand in deeper and felt the cold seep into my pores, holding me tight like a vice. I glanced around to Sheila, and she was still fiddling with the tripod. I withdrew my frozen hand and reached into my coat to pull out my water bottle. I dumped the water to the ground, and then stuck the empty bottle into the red waters. I made sure to fill it to the very brim before closing it back up and walking over to Sheila. She didn't see a thing. My heart raced with the naughtiness of what I'd done. Was it naughty? Well I certainly wasn't instructed, expected, or meant to do what I just did. But I did it. It was as if my basal ganglia craved those bodily motions, it felt just so good to stick the bottle in and fill it up. I couldn't wait to drink it. I was thirsty, I was starving for it, my entire brain was on fire with desire to fill myself up with the thick Blood Falls effluent. 



But a more sophisticated part of my brain said, ""no. wait."" I was of two minds and rushed through the photographs. I mentioned to Sheila that it was time for dinner. We walked back to the camp and she went off to the others to show off her pictures. I started to prepare the MREs. That little niggling part of me was saying to use the Blood Falls water, now so warm and cozy from the heat of my body and coat, into preparing the food. And I thought, why not? That's a great idea. So I did it. It felt good so I did it. I brought everyone their food and then sat down to eat my own. I still had quite a bit of the water left in my bottle, so I thought I should drink it all. It felt like a good thing to do so I did it. I chugged the water like it was manna, nectar from the gods.



The next several days were a kaleidoscope rush of memories and revelations. The water hit my stomach and settled like a crouching tiger, ready to pounce. A thick, splitting migraine peeled open and I sensed, I was, a rush of knowledge and truths and apocalyptic dreams beyond the imagination's feeble limits. The tiger pounced onto my nerves and my spine and my soft tissues and whispered, whispered endless realities. It's not just iron oxide the reddens the waters. Blood, pure blood, from what should have been a fossilized creature, but through its magnificent capabilities, lay dormant and weak and wounded on a timescale unfathomable. The loneliest of loneliness, before life on this planet, crashed on the surface and clung to it, like a desperate lichen, the fountain of bacteria seeping and oozing its babies to the world, so far from the wondrous planets galaxies away, I couldn't comprehend the behemoth beneath me, now inside me, having waited all this time, casting its chemicals like SOS beacons to the void until me, little me, felt the call and started this beautiful process.



But enough of that. This is the story of how I became a dentist. I awoke several days later in Christchurch. Apparently, I collapsed and foamed at the mouth. A seizure. My eyes rolled into the back of my head. Our research expedition was cut short. 



Let me translate my ecstasy. Say you were a member of an intergalactic hivemind, and you and your kind (which, being a hivemind, means essentially just ""you"", there is technically no ""we"") expand and evolve by colonizing other planets. You know what slime mold is? Think of slime mold. You gloop down from passing by asteroids or ultra baby dwarf planets, and spread yourself around to all the living organisms - be they microbes, tiny fungi, or fully fledged bipedal beings. And then say, you accidentally fall to a planet that hasn't yet evolved life. No matter. As this intergalactic hive mind, you have patience that can stretch eons and eons. So you sit pretty, absorbing sunlight, hunkering down in dormancy. But oh no - you happen to be at the pole of this planet. And the surface starts to freeze over. You have no choice but to cling to the tatters of life for as long as you can, weakly thinking of what to do. In your great intelligence, you can perceive various shifts in signatures and changes. I mean sure, you could waste your meager energy on trying to contact lichen or penguins, but what good will that do? Could frosty distant lichen help to colonize a whole planet? Because once you have enough hosts to incubate as part of your hivemind, the best thing you can do is hatch and finally have enough local (Earth) power to bust through and finally ooze to your hearts content. 



Then you notice a strange new presence on the planet, in your most feeble and stagnant dreaming. Humans. With the skill and prodigious planet-wide presence, they're the perfect hosts to slink your way into and grow stronger and stronger. So you're patient. You fall into a deeper slumber and secrete all your best bits in a firework of pheromones and neuro-toxins and all that fun stuff. Because you know one day, one of those crazy critters will make their way to this remote hump of land, and do all the hard work for you.



And we (or should I say, I) are so happy to do that work. Since I got the ""full dosage"" right away, I instantly knew I had to spread this majestic creature far and wide. It took a couple weeks for my seven dwarves to come along, but eventually they (or should I say, I?) came around. Unfortunately, due to the advanced age of the professors, they couldn't handle the new found cohabitors, and they all simply wasted away. How could I help out? How could I be the best I could be?



I know what you're thinking - dentistry?! Doesn't that seem like a lot of work just to spread the good word? Sure, all it takes is a little bit of the source to get their juices flowing, but how to get it in them? I needed access to lots of humans, in a setting where it wouldn't be weird to either inject them or ""accidentally"" make them bleed. I could have been a surgeon, but I'd have to operate on a lot of sickly, dying people. That'd be a waste. I could have worked in a blood bank, but then I'd have no control over who got infected. As you can surmise from what happened to our professors, we needed healthy, able-bodied, relatively young hosts to incubate and hold the seeds. What's the point of infecting a nursing home or a car crash victim on an operating table if they couldn't handle it? I could have become a pediatrician, since kids are pretty young (duh), but you don't often get to inject them or make them bleed, except during vaccinations, and with the stupidity of the anti-vax movement that didn't seem wise.



So dentist it was. We're (I'm) in it for the long haul. Dental school was easy compared to my previous career dreams. I had all the help and guidance of the best mind on the planet - mine/ours! Once the seven dwarfs were on board, we(I) could rapidly communicate just by thinking, giving us(me) the brain power of eight people at once. And as much as I love my dental hygienists, I knew I wanted more of a challenge. More control. More knowledge. I could see dozens of patients a day in a routine setting, picking and choosing who would get to be part of this global dream of ours (mine). Sure I'd work with older patients, but I'd also see lots of teens, little ones, college kids, healthy adults, all in good shape. Can you think of any other doctor who regularly works with patients that are normally completely healthy? Luckily they all have poor flossing habits, so a little blood here and there never alarms them. Drilling cavities, pulling teeth, fitting veneers, it brings such beautiful tears to my eyes. I get to create so many good incubators for us (me). And when we have enough, the home base will be ready and we can all burst from our stupid human bodies and coalesce into one beautiful puddle of life. But until then, we (I) will keep working on harvesting that biomass, prepping the perfect candidates to cradle us (me) in their bodies, sleeping, crouching, hidden.



Until then, smile! See you at your next appointment."

Here is my resume and I need some some advice about the following issues:

* My computer skills are irrelevant to the industries I'm applying for. My school demands that I must have three different internships during summer breaks. I completed one(very small business one) and I'm going to apply for one in a production facility and one in a corporation. The reason I put them is, in my opinion, they indicate that I spent my university years productive.

* The second issue I'd like to hear about your opinion is that I don't have a part such as ""objectives"" or ""soft skills"". I find it rather unnecessary because anyone can type anything there. But I still have some space on my resume and I may consider adding such parts depending on your feedback.

* Also please evaluate my wording. Since English is not my native language, your remarks are appreciated. I think the word ""Achievements"" is too pretentious. Should I write ""Interests &amp; Hobbies"" instead?

* I know A1 level Japanese and German. Are they worth putting there?"

7mnu8s,52,2017-12-28,Angular is making me hate my life. Should I quit my internship or quit web dev/programming altogether?,shinnabinna,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7mnu8s/angular_is_making_me_hate_my_life_should_i_quit/,"I've been learning JavaScript part-time for about 1.5 years, took one intro to java class in college and completed a web dev bootcamp that lasted 12 weeks earlier this year. About a month or two ago I started a part-time unpaid ""internship"" where I'm working on an app that is in early stages. The first working copy of the app was outsourced and is built with Angular 4. 

I absolutely hate everything about this and want to quit. I loved JavaScript before and even enjoyed the projects we made using Vue. Even when I was stuck and couldn't figure something out for a week at a time, I enjoyed the struggle almost as much as the solution. My mom was a programmer about 15 years ago and thinks that I shouldn't quit programming, and attributes my hard time to being in isolation and not having anyone else working with me. This is partially true. The owner of the project has experience as a programmer but not with web development or javascript. He gives me projects and expects results obviously but can't help me when I get stuck. I had no previous experience with Angular so I spent the first couple of weeks learning what I could about it. The owner bought a couple of Udemy classes for me to learn, which were fine and gave me a light foundation but I hate that it's basically a completely different language even though it's a framework, and I am having a hard time finding resources for it and the other random packages added to this application. I've had no real results and feel hopeless. 


TL;DR: I hate programming ever since starting my internship. Could it be the internship or am I just not cut out for programming?"

I live in a city that doesn't have a booming tech sector. The companies here aren't really the type to have internships from what I can tell, so I've really been banking on the idea that I'd be able to snag an internship elsewhere and hopefully not pay to move twice in 3 months.

Another problem is I'm an adult student working on my second degree. Unfortunately I got laid off from my job recently so money's tight. I was really hoping to get a big internship that paid several thousand a month so that living expenses and paying rent and bills back home wouldn't be an issue.

Also chance me for Cornell, Duke(comp sci not in school of engineering), Harvey Mudd, USC, and Williams. Don't hold back I know a lot of these are reaches specifically the non UC colleges I am applying to.

I start January 2nd.

I applied for this position back in September and only took it cause I had no previous civil engineering experience. My only concern with this coop is that it'll be extremely hard to look for co-op jobs in the summer may-august, since more people will be applying.

I've got another job I need to give an interview for a bigger better company that can give me 8-12 month coop but there's no way that's happening before January 2nd (I.e: The day I start working on my current job) since everything is closed for the winter. So if I do get accepted for this other job offer I will have to abruptly quit my current job and work the other job the next day.

My coop office has strongly discouraged me from pursuing this opportunity since they say it'll permenantly ruin there reputation with my current company and it'll also look bad on me and put my coop status and my credibility on the line. Almost all of my other friends and family have discouraged me as well. Essentially I'll piss off alot of people and it'll look bad on me. There's also the possibility that I'll have to take a day off from my current job to go to the other job interview since it's an in person interview. This will again look extremely bad and make me look disinterested in my current position (which I am not).

So I have two options.

 1. Shut up and continue this current job. Look for jobs for the summer on the side.

 2. Pursue the other opportunity but let my current employer know frankly what is up?(or not? What do you guys think? Should I let them know? Will they be ok with that?). Then once I get the other job I quit my current job abruptly and start working the other job.

What do you guys think I should do? Again, the only reason I'm even pursuing the other opportunity is cause I'm scared of not finding a job for the summer and it's a better company that's giving me 8-12 month coop. I'll hace to quit my internship midway to pursue this opportunity.




I've received mixed responses from everywhere regarding this. I'd love your feedback."

He said while they weren't currently looking for fulltime new grad engineers, their search will be very different in the coming months and that he had no problem with me continuing to interview. 

Assuming I get an offer, is this something I should do? I really like the company, and would think that if I perform well they would most likely want me to sign on full time. And if not then I would have 2 internships under my belt and could look for full time. Thoughts? Criticism?"

7mr0mg,2,2017-12-28,Should I spend the money on grad school if I'm not sure what I want to do with my career?,2TitanUp7,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/7mr0mg/should_i_spend_the_money_on_grad_school_if_im_not/,"I'm really lost on where to take my career, or what career to start and it seems my interests/passions often are in conflict with my skills/talents/education.  I've been considering grad school to try and pivot my career, but I'm extremely scared of spending so much money (to add on to the student debt I already have) just to try something that I'm not sure if I'd even want to stick with.

I earned an undergraduate degree in actuarial science, but after a few internships in the field, I really didn't like the job or the insurance industry and was in the same position as now, searching for a new path.  I'd always loved writing small scripts/programs on the side, so I found a job in software development, which I have been working in for the past 2 years.  But this hasn't really been fulfilling either, and I've been on a remote work contract since moving which is ending soon anyways.  This has me contemplating what my next move is.

I've been thinking of going back to grad school for data science, but I'm really not sure that's the right move (it just seems impossible to try this career without spending the money first on the education).  I like working with data and trying to see what it might be able to tell, but I'm not sure I'd have any happiness if I am just always doing routine cleansing and general analysis for most of my days and not getting to solve real, challenging, impactful problems.

It's been hard to find which direction to go since my hobbies outside of work are all outdoors hobbies that don't mesh with technology/computers at all (most importantly surfing, which was the reason for my move and something that I really am not willing to give up).

If I had to choose a cause that I'd like to impact, I definitely think about ways to improve the failing mental healthcare industry in the US, but I have no real ideas how I could do that, as I'm not the most extroverted person willing to be a psychologist talking to people all day and I'm not sure what else there even is that I could do (and would still allow me to make enough money to cover my existing student loans).

I'm really not sure anything exists that would match the things that make me happy and the skills/education/experience that I have or really how either of things would help me feel like I'm making an impact and so I'm really lost as to what to do next (and it feels like the worlds closing in around me needing to make decisions on grad school in the near future).  Any advice?"
7mr974,3,2017-12-28,Mechanical Engineer Returning to School for Second Degree in CS - Seeking Advice,engsteve,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7mr974/mechanical_engineer_returning_to_school_for/,"Good evening/afternoon all,

As the title mentions, I am currently just a mechanical engineer. After graduation I left my home here in Ontario, Canada for San Diego, California, where I had worked for one year as a design engineer. Here I developed my interest in software engineering after dabbling in some basic CS concepts during my free time, and being exposed to the thriving tech industry of the West Coast. I've recently moved back to Ontario in order to pursue a second degree in Computer Science, which I'll hopefully be able to complete in two years thanks to my transfer credits from engineering. 

Now I'll get to the good stuff, here is what I'd like to achieve while in school/upon completion of my degree in no particular order - on these topics I'm looking for whatever advice you might be able to offer:

**GOAL 1: Gain relevant work experience as I earn my degree, through either part time or full time, local or remote work.**
One of my largest concerns is the fact that I'll be re-entering the workforce at ~27 years old with 8 months worth of mech-eng internships and one year's worth of mech-eng work experience after graduation - not particularly relevant in the field of computer science except in terms of soft skills by my own measure. I'd like to build a portfolio using GitHub and link that to my LinkedIn account, but I'd like to populate that with work that I've done for actual clients. If some of you guys and girls are feeling extra friendly and have a possible opportunity, let's get in touch - my schedule is not too demanding at all and I would love to start working pronto.

**GOAL 2: Leverage both my mechanical engineering degree and my computer science degree simultaneously.**
Currently I can only speculate as to whether or not this combination is desirable in general, let alone which niche industries might be most applicable to. I'd like to hear from you guys about what you think based on your own industry experience.

**GOAL 3: Get back to the California sunshine with a job upon the completion of my degree.**
The first reason I'm including this is for the purpose of opening up a dialogue. I've made some great connections through Reddit in the past, and if you are involved in software engineering and live in California I'd love to hear about what type of individuals your company hires. The second reason that I'm including this point is to ask where a solid networking platform, besides LinkedIn, exists. I'd like to start building my network now in order to be well prepared for the future.

That's about all that I can think of at the moment, if you have anything that you'd like to add that's always appreciated.

Thank you all for your time!"
7mrtdk,23,2017-12-28,Should I quit my internship?,thr0waway_102,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/7mrtdk/should_i_quit_my_internship/,"Hi r/askengineers, I am wondering - Should quit my internship?

Without giving away too much detail about where I am working, I will explain my situation and try to be as unbiased as possible.

I'm in my junior year of a Mech Eng. degree and I got my *first* internship sometime in the summer of 2017. I have been working there ever since and the internship offer is to last until graduation (approximately May 2019). I do decently in school (3.5 GPA) and actually received word of this internship from a professor who recommended me to the company. I live in a competitive area and now that it is winter session, my chances of applying for different internship positions elsewhere may be limited. The company itself is relatively small, with only 5 engineers and myself as the only intern. Since my employment, I have had the chance to learn a lot from the engineers at work. Typically, 2/4 of them can be very helpful, while the supervising engineer and engineering manager can be pretty damn hard on me.

As the only engineering intern, I am given an incredible amount of work. Mostly, I am happy to be given the responsibility and opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects for the company but on the other hand I feel as though my responsibilities go beyond the scope of a typical engineering student or intern. Still, I am glad to put my best foot forward, but it is typically at the expense of being consistently yelled at or berated for ""fundamental"" mistakes I make. I have thick skin (worked in construction for a few years before returning to school) and I know what it means to work hard, show up on time, be professional and learn from mistakes and move on, but I am tired of being yelled at for my mistakes as an intern.

90% of the things I am doing are things that are completely unfamiliar to me. Generally, using the tools and knowledge I have learned from school (theoretical classes, Solidworks design, lab test reports, etc.), I typically have an idea of where to begin and will do my best to work in the necessary direction, but often am only able to ask 2 of the 4 engineers questions due to my fear of being yelled at for asking. I always look for a solution before asking questions and make sure that if I do ask a question then I have a few different ways I tried to approach the problem first. I feel as though I am often given a real engineering task with no direction, no experience and a minor ability to ask questions depending on whom it is that I ask.

I never lied about GPA, work experience, or project experience on my resume when applying to the position and now I am being given tasks and expected to deliver without error, otherwise I am berated for it. What gives?

My weakest area is Solidworks Drawings. We didn't get to go over these much outside of the basics in the first (and only) design class I have taken. I typically don't have an issue making parts or even drawings for the parts (I am not an expert by any means, but I can manage), but knowing what SHOULD and SHOULDN'T be detailed/highlighted in professional drawings is my biggest weakness along with being somewhat slow at design. I learn A TON everyday I feel, but I feel as though I am not in an environment that is learning friendly. I have yet to take the GD&amp;T course at my college but I plan on taking it over the summer once I complete the required prerequisites this spring semester. I am hoping this will help significantly improve my GD&amp;T skills, but until then I am left to doing my best to complete drawings based on my judgement and learn from my errors.

This internship is seriously putting a dent in my self confidence and making me feel like I don't belong in engineering. Can anyone lend some advice to me? I am considering quitting and telling my engineering manager that I think they need someone with more experience.

Thank you in advance for your time!

TL;DR - Working an internship where I get to learn a lot at the expense of being berated for ""fundamental errors"" that are not fundamental to a 3rd year engineering student. I feel like I am stuck in an environment that is not ""learning friendly"". Should I quit?



EDIT: wow! thank you for all of the responses! I greatly appreciate this community coming to offer advice to someone like me. Often times I don't have anyone to ask questions to but I am glad this is such a welcoming community! I've taken all of your advice in and decided to stay. I will stay at the company as long as possible and do my absolute best to build a good reputation with the managers until I move on to my first engineering position after graduation. Thank you again for all of the kind advice! Happy new year!"
7mrwk5,8,2017-12-28,Career changers who pursued a masters in CS/SWE - how did it go?,johnisonredditnow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7mrwk5/career_changers_who_pursued_a_masters_in_csswe/,"A common tactic for switching into other fields is to get a masters degree in the subject. In my research I have often seen this path specifically recommended against for CS jobs for the following reasons:
- masters degrees aren’t that much more valuable than a BS in this field 
- traditional university education (in general) is too theoretical
- masters programs specifically (as compared to bachelors programs) are too theoretical
- ... and many more

So I’m under no illusions that a masters degree is a panacea in this regard, but it seems like an option worth considering for career changers. 

I’m specifically looking for answers from folks who got a bachelors in something unrelated and used a masters program (along with the same heavy dose of personal projects and internships that are recommended to people working on their BS in CS) to break into a CS job. 

- How was your experience? Was the MS coursework geared so much toward those pursuing academic/theoretical careers so as to be a poor preparation for changing careers?
- Did you find having an MS applying to junior dev jobs to be a leg up or a hindrance?
- Did you consider getting a second bachelors and, if so, why did you decide on the masters instead? Are you happy with your choice?
- Anything else I should be thinking about as I consider this path?

Thanks all.

I'm a senior in high school who just finished applying to a bunch of universities; they are mainly UCs. I applied as a CS major which (as you know) is the most competitive major out there. My backup major for the UCs is Data Science.

My overall goal is to become a data scientist for a big N company, so I know I have to be superb in R and Python to even have a shot. Anyways, I thought a CS degree would be more versatile and easier to get internships with compared to the Data Science major. However, data science is easier to get into. 

If I get rejected for CS and get into Data science at the top colleges, what should I do?

I also got into UIUC for Stats + CS recently. I think that this is a great combination for Data Science. However, it's way too expensive, so I'm waiting for the UCs to come out (I'm instate).

All in all, would a data science major really be so hard for internships/jobs? I found that a lot of jobs require an MS and sometimes even a PHD. I honestly don't want to go that far in academia. Maybe MS if it's like those 4+1 yr ms programs they have at like UCLA. Anyways, will the Data Science major be seen as inferior to the CS major? 

Please guide a clueless and somewhat stupid 18 year old.

I'm a 3rd year CS major from a decent school and I haven't had an internship yet, so I'm getting kind of desperate as I don't want to be stuck without an internship at all throughout college. I have a career fair in a few weeks I think, so another small-ish project would be nice.

I've made two projects so far: a 32-bit Windows memory scanner that searches through addresses in a process using WinAPI (basically CheatEngine but infinitely more primitive), and also an aimbot for CS:Source.

I like working with memory and pointers and stuff, so my next project could be related to that but I can't think of a ton of things to do with it. 

Just recently I looked into emulation and I started with the easiest possible: a Chip8 emulator. Thing is that it kind of felt like I was just following a tutorial and it doesn't really feel legitimate. After this I kind of realized I could make like a JPEG file viewer or MP3 player or something, considering it's in the realm of memory related stuff. Problem is I didn't get much info from looking up the formats for these files, and forum posts just led to people saying not to try to reinvent the wheel so I got discouraged.

On a side note, I like music and music theory related stuff, and I'm decently experienced with the Unity game engine. I suppose I could just make a game, but I feel like I wouldn't want to do it unless it's ""polished"" and that might take a while. Would companies want to see a simple game? Maybe I'm overthinking this.

Anyone have any ideas based off the context?"

7mudc9,11,2017-12-29,Essay Advice (Collective),Pushpakm,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/7mudc9/essay_advice_collective/,"TOP TEN MISTAKES… 1) Writing about academic accomplishments. a) Deja Vu: These accomplishments are on your transcripts. The admissions officer already knows you achieved high marks in twelve AP classes. b) Birds of a feather flock together: Remember your best friend when you were in the 6th grade? You drifted apart in high school once you started getting straight A’s and your friend ended up on America’s Most Wanted. The two of you aren’t applying to the same schools. On the other hand, everyone who is applying has similar or identical academic accomplishments as you do • Similar Classes / Similar Grades / Similar Test Scores / Similar Extra Curricular Activities: President of Physics Club, Class President, Swim Team Captain, 1st Violin in School Orchestra, Yearbook Editor, Mathletes Captain, 1000 hours of community service. Academic accomplishments don’t tell the school anything about you as a PERSON… …as an INDIVIDUAL. It’s no different than stating the obvious… “I am smart.”  
  
2) Trying too hard to appear intellectual. a) I can curse in twenty languages: A thesaurus is not necessarily your friend. Using words like, “plethora” or “myriad” only serve to drive an admissions officer to early retirement. You need not swallow a thesaurus to “sound” intelligent. This comes from The University of Virginia: An actual excerpt from a TERRIBLE essay…. “From an early age, we accept death as the inevitable, but do not comprehend its actual denotation. Death is the impending future that all people must eventually grasp. In my early teens, my grandfather tragically perished. As a youth who did not identify with such a cataclysm I was saturated with various emotions. Initially, I was grieved by the loss of a loved one and could not understand why this calamity had to befall upon my family. I always considered death to have a devastating effect, but was shocked by the emotional strain it places upon an individual.” Do you get any sense of the PERSON who wrote this? It’s just a collection of clichés put together with “Ten dollar words.” I get NO insight into this teen as an INDIVIDUAL. b) That Pythagoras was no square: You don’t need to discuss your love of Shakespeare or Milton if it’s not true and you think it sounds better than discussing the merits of the Twilight series. On the other hand, if you’re reading Fifty Shades of Grey you have bigger issues to worry about than what college you get into. c) Eszopiclone, Ramelteon, Triazolam, Zaleplon, Zolpidem: There are enough sleeping pills on the market so the admissions officer doesn’t need an essay to put him to sleep. I am not suggesting that the essay rival that of a SNL monologue but it can’t be boring either. You can write about something as dry as my mother-in-law’s Thanksgiving turkey but it needs to sound interesting in story, sub-text, personality, connotation, sentence length, syntax, and unique in perspective.  

3) Trying too hard to appear creative. There is a good reason the common application topics changed a few years ago, removing “A Topic of Your Choice.” Too many came across as pretentious, clichéd, and desperate (trying too hard) in an attempt to “stand out.” These aren’t creative writing assignments. They aren’t looking for “clever,” they are looking for YOU. A few bad examples… • Sweat dripped from my brow as the proctor meticulously handed out the nationally recognized assessment examination. My pulse raced and my heart pounded through my chest… • It was a cold and dreary night when I first arrived in London. I could hear the faint whispers of the Bard himself beckoning me to the Globe Theater. • It was all up to me. Bases loaded with two men out in the bottom of the ninth. We were suffering a dearth of three runs. I dug my cleats into the dusty granules of dirt, held my bat firmly and watched for the pitch like an eagle watches for its prey.  

4) Taking a generic approach. Stay far away from these types of clichés. a) Check the basement for Pods or Avoid clichés like the plague. i) “I’m hardworking, ambitious, and driven.” ii) “I love to be challenged.” iii) “I am intellectually curious.” iv) “My peers often look to me for leadership.” v) “My grandfather’s death made me want to be a doctor.” vi) “I want to make a difference in the world.”  

5) My Major interest is to Major in Chemistry • No matter which common application question you choose, don’t write about what you plan on majoring in. Let’s say you want to be a Chemistry major. (My homage to Heisenberg and Breaking Bad) Your resume is filled with AP Chemistry, internships and summer programs in chemistry, chemistry clubs, etc. And now you write that the place you are most comfortable is in a Chemistry Lab??????? You appear one-dimensional. You don’t look like a well-rounded person with multiple interests, perspectives, etc • Most colleges have supplemental essays….one of which asks why this major. If your main essay is about your major….what will you write for the supplemental essay? It will appear repetitive and further promote you as a one-dimensional person.  

6) Not understanding the true point of the essay. a) I can touch my nose with my tongue: What makes you unique and not like every other student who is applying? b) When I was five, I was abducted by Aliens: What life experiences imply that you will fit in academically and socially?  

7) Not reading the school’s website. a) I want to go to (Name of School Here): “I want to go to NYU because it is in New York City and I want that city experience.” There are more than TWENTY colleges in New York City….so why specifically NYU? What does NYU offer that all the other institutions don’t offer? b) Professor Smith’s maiden name was Quackenbush: Read through the school’s website and discover that 80% of the faculty are Nobel Prize Winners, that there are 250 clubs and the school provides internships in Papua New Guinea. But don’t write this. Be specific as to what internships and why….and what clubs and why…BE SPECIFIC *Don’t cut and paste. Don’t plagiarize. Don’t regurgitate the website’s stats. Merely show the admissions officer that you KNOW the school and what makes the school UNIQUE. Don’t use the website information to sound like you are working in their advertising department. Here is an example of that….as well as too many clichés to count. (That itself is a cliché) Penn Nursing’s motto, “Care to Change the World,” speaks to who I am. I want to be that nurse practitioner who impacts families, who betters society, and who makes a difference. I want to be that PNP who smiles, who makes children feel comfortable, and who heals. And Penn’s School of Nursing will help me achieve that goal. Where else can you gain clinical exposure in the sophomore year with access to world-class hospitals, such as The Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania? Where else do you have the opportunity to engage in real-world research, like at LIFE, and improve quality of elder care? But practical experience is just one side of the double helix of education. The rigor of Penn’s academic curriculum also calls my name. The emphasis on leadership appeals to me. BE SPECIFIC Why do you want to go to our school? What are the SPECIFIC things the school says about….Academics, Internships, Clubs, Organizations and Traditions that appeals to you? And SPECIFICALLY WHY? Why do you want to go to our school? Telling them it’s a prestigious university with distinguished professors, unparalleled resources and a spectacular campus tells them nothing that they don’t already know…and you sound like a Kiss Up!  

8) Forgetting that you are unique. You didn’t have to be abducted by aliens, or work with terminally ill dolphins. It’s about you as a teenager. Not a student, an athlete, a volunteer. Just as a citizen, a sibling, a son, a social animal, a human being Clarifying Points Although these are overused and clichéd topics…(The SEVEN DEADLY SINS)…. i) Vacation: Club Med / Costa Rica/ Cruise ii) Sports Injuries iii) Death iv) Disease v) Divorce vi) Disorders vii) Relationship break-upsTips:
The whole point of a personal essay is to get the reader to feel like they know you personally so that they will be more likely to fight to get you into their school.  

This means that your essay isn’t about soccer, or your favorite teacher, or cooking with grandma, or skydiving, or a mission trip, or moving to america, or League of Legends, etc etc etc — your essay is about YOU. The topic is only there to give you a context to describe yourself to the reader. To be clear, I'm not saying that you can't write about soccer or your favorite teacher or etc. I'm saying that no matter what the surface topic may be, the essay is actually about you. AOs don't care about soccer or skydiving. They care about what they can learn about you from how you talk about soccer and skydiving.  

Your essay should feel like a casual conversation. This means that slang is fine and contractions are encouraged!  

Put down the thesaurus. Only use words you would actually use in real life. It’s usually pretty obvious when someone is just using a fancy word to look impressive — and trust me, it’s not impressive.
Have fun with it! I realize that this college process has become a swirling vortex of stress. It shouldn’t be this way, but it is, and I know I can’t magically make the stress disappear. But if you aren’t having fun writing the essay, the reader probably won't have fun reading it. And if you are having fun writing it, the reader probably will have fun reading it. I know this might sound crazy, but really give yourself a chance to enjoy the process. Take a deep breath. Stop thinking about college for a second. Start thinking about yourself. Do some introspection, just for you. Learn something about yourself."

I have recently started an internship at a small start up software company. I am really Help desk but we do not have a sysadmin and I am the only IT person there- the old dude was on a contractor basis up until yesterday. He did not really do much lol just focused on supporting users and called it a day. My first project was to move all of the sales team- 40 something people from their AWS Workstations on to laptops we had laying around. I manually images 5 and gave up, I turned to MDT to image all computers and was finished in less than a week. They expected that to be done in about a month or so. Right now my day just consists of supporting users and trying to better my MDT image. While snooping around, I came to see that we have 60 intune licenses. But I dont think intune would be of much use to us. So sysadmins, any recommendations on things to look into? 

Thanks"

I want to be able to create android applications, and maybe even embedded swe... but instead I spend my time playing video games or procrastinating and waiting till the last second to do anything.

7mvxfj,5,2017-12-29,Should I address being let go in cover letter?,LittleCentric,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7mvxfj/should_i_address_being_let_go_in_cover_letter/,"First of all, hello and thanks for reading! It's a bit long, but I think a summary could help explain where I'm at and why I'm struggling to write a strong cover letter.

So, I was let go from my first post-grad job in May 2017. 

I was there just short of a year, but long story short - it was *not* a good fit for me and I was let go with severance. Mercifully, I was able to move back home with my parents. 

Being an overachieving, plan-every-second of my life sort of person, this experience really threw me for a loop. 

I spent a few months wallowing in the midst of an existential crisis and depression-induced delirium before I realized that I needed to do *something* with my time. 

That led me to a 'consulting', under-the-table type job that I quickly noped out of due to the nature of the business being a little too shady for my tastes. 

From there, I took a minimum wage job at a very reputable company in the Mid-Atlantic area. 

However, all that said, I don't want to be stuck in this job forever and I don't really desire to climb their corporate ladder. 

On paper, I'm a great hire. I have an amazing resume thanks to some prestigious, high profile internships during college... But getting let go made me feel extremely incompetent and made me spiral a bit and doubt my self worth so I just need a little direction? And help? 

I found a job that I think I'd be a *great* fit for and covers everything I want (locale, benefits, etc.). 

**My issue: How do I address the 7 month gap in my professional work history? Do I mention that I was ""let go""? Do I just brush over that and explain a desire to move back home or does that make me seem too wishy-washy? Should I briefly explain that I was working full-time in an unrelated job?**


I know that was a bit long, but I really appreciate it!

Tl;dr: Go let go from 1st job after college, spent a few months unemployed/depressed/soul-searching, am now working full-time at a minimum wage job. How to address in cover letter?

So far it's pretty easy. However, after a few tutorials I'm stuck and looking for guidance.

I have two different models, one is ProductModel, the other is ImageModel. 

The ImageModel has a foreign key linking each image to a certain product. When creating and uploading an image, I can see it's in the database and the image path is recorded and can output it in any image view.

So my question is, how can I display both the product information, like in the Product Index View, and also display each image linked to that product?

Right now there's a foreach loop outputting the products information and a generic image. Each loop iteration should also search for any images that have the productId in their row. This is super easy with PHP (the last site I made), but I'm just not quite sure how to get multiple models interacting in the same view. 

Any tips? Any tutorials I can take a look at? 

tl;dr - How can I reference more than one model in any given view in .net MVC? I want to display each image from the image model that has the same productid as the current product in a foreach loop.

7mzx49,74,2017-12-30,You never realize what you are until you finally admit it to yourself. Thank you r/adhd. I'll be lurking here a while.,wheredatbeefat,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7mzx49/you_never_realize_what_you_are_until_you_finally/,"Just like fuck. ~fuck~ I'm gonna rant for a second

My entire *world* came crashing down so many times and I was too wrapped up in pride and denial to see any of it. Please take something from this. Think. And talk. to. a. counselor. Maybe a couple. TALK. You're good at it, freak. 

So a little background. [M24] Diagnosed with ADHD and treated when I was very young. 4th grade or so. Things became a lot more manageable, and it seemed as though I could coast through school if I did my homework. I was still impulsive sometimes, still a cunt for the most part like a majority of teenage scumbois but able to hold my own and learn from mistakes. 

The biggest mistake was hating the medicine. I *hated* it. Once I got to high school, it was my plan to ween off of it because I knew I didn't need it. And medicine, i.e. anything you're adding to your body that you don't ""need"", is inherently bad. Newsflash. Wrong. Some people that start stimulants as children grow out of them. Some don't need them until they're adults. And some just plain need them indefinitely.

Like the former group, I dropped my dose and was fine. For a while. My senior year of high school was fantastic! If I wasn't writing or playing music, I was in a class I loved or hanging out with new friends. Things were novel. Novelty that ostensibly persisted into college. There was always something new around the corner. Something new and fun. Distractions galore. Then sophomore year rolled around and things settled down. I didn't have extracurriculars because of my course load so I didn't do much. POOF, things went down hill. I couldn't stay on task, I stayed in bed for days at a time because I couldn't get my thoughts straight. With my body screaming for help and my mind a whirlwind of chaos I developed bad habits:

* Impulsive eating at the dining hall, disregarding how bad I'd feel. 
* Alcohol abuse
* Binge-watching shows and clicking next only to get the voice in my head to stop

Honestly life just fell apart. And I was ***SO*** hard on myself. What's wrong with you? Why can't you get up? You're stupid and worthless. Go to class.

Granted, there were periods of time where things improved. Of course, it was on cue with my surroundings. A new, fun and exciting band or a love interest and there I was again. This moldable, hyper fuck. Hey brain, this is happiness and mental fortitude. Open your gates. Stop.. having them be closed.

No bouts of jovial variation could prepare me for post grad. I didn't know what I wanted to do so went across the country to work in a Thai restaurant. Learned how to make curry and pho. Fast forward two months and I'm miserable drinking vodka, bombarding my face with peanuts from a fucking *tin*, and shutting everyone out. 

Some part of me then decided it was a good idea to move back home with my divorcing parents and work from there. So, so so bad. A plan for ants and malevolent creatures of the night. Boredom, major depressive episodes, panic attacks, crying fits, drinking, smoking, extreme isolation. Somehow I rose out of those ashes and got a string of fun internships that culminated in my sister's wedding out west. Fanfuckingtastic times those were. Holy moly. 

After yet another bout of emotional sourness at my holiday themed childhood home, I decided enough is enough and started seeing someone again. Sadly, but not surprisingly, this buttnugget still suffers from ADHD. 

Long winded. Sorry. You have my deepest, most sexual sympathies.

I was such a mess when I went to that counselor. She said, ""You have all these weights that are dragging you down and you fit a host of different criteria. I am amazed you got through school and you should not only be proud, but impressed with yourself for making it this far."" I not only went off my meds, but I put myself in an environment that did not hold my attention. My negative thoughts flourished. Depression developed. Anxiety developed. I fell. So much unnecessary damage and hardship took over my whole existence. 

Forgive and forget. Learn. I'm back on the meds and I'm not just telling myself I'm stupid and that I need to tough it out. I'm smart. I'm *adaptable*. Sometimes life is just boring! In my experience, there is no sustainable way to constantly do something new and life-changing. I don't know if I'm a rarity. I don't know what percentage of you go insane when you're not going going going. I do. It sucks. With the concentration, I can control my thoughts and schedule. The anxiety seems like a task, not a mountain. The depression seems like an option and not an inevitable doom. 

Just for the love of all things warm, fuzzy and worth it in this life, talk to your counselor. Figure out a viable path for you, but keep other avenues on the periphery. 

Please ask questions and I will do my best to answer them. Thanks for reading. I love all of you. 

TL;DR: Arrogant sillyboi decides he's better than a medicine and a host of confusing things happen. Living with anxiety and depression whilst untreated for adhd is absolutely not necessary.

7n30ao,10,2017-12-30,How do you think the field be looking about five years from now?,Jimwize,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7n30ao/how_do_you_think_the_field_be_looking_about_five/,"You can skip straight to the questions if you don't want to read all of this stereotypical worrying.

Computer science is my planned major, but I'm not sure how good of an idea this is as a high school senior graduating in 2018. I'm already accepted into UW-Madison, but I'm somewhat anxious about going to college because of how much debt it will likely put me in. Therefore, I want to pick a field that will reward me for working very hard in college so that I can get a high paying and enjoyable career shortly after graduation.

Now I know that this is what literally every college student is looking for, and this is why I'm a little worried about majoring in CS. I would think that by now this field is crazy saturated with undergraduates, many of whom being very competent and intelligent. **I've seen people back in 2014 talking about how it's getting oversaturated and harder to get work- I can only imagine what the field will be like 5 years from now if I get a degree in it.**

So that's my first question- 

1. Do you think the field will still outgrow the enormous amount of people who are studying this in college? It's always been the go-to 'make money after college' major, so I feel like it will be hard to stand out from everyone and get internships/work.

My next question concerns how important my university choice is for this. Like I said, I'll be getting a ton of debt from a four year college plan, so I need to know just how important the name of my college is after graduation, or if bigger colleges are going to offer bigger opportunities in terms of networking and internships and all of that. UW-Madison is more expensive than other state schools I've been accepted to, like UW-Eau Claire, but perhaps more companies are going to higher straight from UW-Madison, or the name is going to mean way more to bigger companies. 

2. How important is my choice of school for my post-college success? Specifically, will choosing UW-Madison over some other Wisconsin school make a huge difference in your eyes provided I'm equally involved and successful in both?

My final question concerns stuff about engineering. Based purely off feel, it seems like an engineering degree, whether or not it involves computers, would make more sense now for finding a job. It would certainly appear that with how many people are gunning for CS degrees, there are going to be would-be engineers who go to this new and growing field and there will be a strong need for majors in computer engineering, chemical engineering, etc. So is a worry like this just anxious speculation, or is there some truth to this? I have to ask because right now I'm accepted in the College of Letters and Science at UW-Madison, and to switch to the College of Engineering would be difficult at this point.

3. Will engineering become way more in demand with how many people are attracted to the CS bachelors degree? CS is probably a better fit for me, but with how many people are going into it I can't help but feel like engineering of some kind might be a smarter path.

Finally- is a four year degree super super important for finding a good job in this field? I have to ask because I often see videos from people like ENGINEERED TRUTH or random youtubers saying you should follow in the footsteps of many greats who didn't get a college degree, and that by getting a college degree you're putting yourself behind for many, many years by taking on way too much debt just so you can get into an uncertain job market that might even be hiring people without degrees. Sounds like bullshit to me, and most of these youtubers are making a career off of making scary videos about college advertising their life help lessons or codeacademy or something, I have to ask because some of the scary parts are working."

Need some advice.,peeling_skin101,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7n33q2/help_thinking_of_going_back_to_school_to_major_in/,"I graduated back in August with a B.S. in Business Finance. I thought that I wanted a career as either a Financial Analyst, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, or something of that nature, but quickly realized that it wasn't what I wanted to do. 

I've failed to find full-time employment that is related to my degree, partly because of where I live.  I live and went to college where there isn't a lot of job growth and while I was in college, I couldn't even find an internship because all the opportunities were a 2 hours drive away. 

I've come to realize that I don't I want a career in finance, but I don't know what I want. I've always liked and been interested in computers, especially the hardware side. (I don't want a job sitting at a computer programming all day long.)  I've looked into possibly computer engineering, but I have a few questions I hope someone can answer:

1. Is majoring in computer engineering the best way to get a job working with computer hardware? Are there any alternative degrees or opportunities?

2. What kinds of jobs are there working with hardware? How is the job outlook for computer hardware-related jobs? From a bit of research, it seems as though growth isn't great and that software is better for job placement. 

3. Where do computer engineers find jobs at in the U.S.? I would assume the west coast has the best opportunities.

4. What are some good, affordable colleges for computer engineering majors? I have some money in my college left over from my finance degree, but it's not a lot.

5. How difficult is it to get a computer engineering degree? I assume the classes are rather challenging.

6. How do I know if computer engineering degree is right for me? Are there any tests or videos I can watch to tell?

Thank you."

I was previously a computer science major that failed two classes; due to school policy I was disallowed to continue pursuing that major in the summer of 2017. Last Fall I made a switch to finance and though I haven't taken any super major specific classes I enjoyed the little I have experienced and actually had my best semester since my  freshmen year of high school. I am set to graduate in the fall of 2019(though I probably can make it spring 2020 if I wanted to) and don't feel very knowledgeable in the field and am not sure career wise what I am able to pursue.





IB looks very cool but considering I have a 3.09 GPA at a non-target I am pretty sure by chances of even getting an interview are close to 0. 


I have also heard of software sales and it looks interesting but that's all I know really. I am looking to educate myself ASAP.

So specifically questions wise I am asking


1. what resources helped you the best in educating yourself about the world of finance?

2. What careers are plausible for me to pursue 

3. what are my chances of landing an internship before I graduate?

4. Any other advice that you think I should know?

All replies and PMs are greatly appreciated. I'm really trying to get my shit together. Thank you for your time!"

I was convicted for criminal speeding just over 1 year ago, and just about to finish my BS degree in CS.


I had one internship before the conviction but since then haven't had much luck.


It seems like because I'm a convict I am labeled as a bad person, even though I never ran (not a felony) and have no other charges. You can probably figure out who I am because there arent a lot of states that give you a criminal record for speeding and there arent a lot of people who stop at 150mph+. So I made this throwaway, idc if you figure it out. 

What type of jobs have I barred myself from? What companies will definitely say no? I assume Big N has locked me out for good.


I specialize in backend, but interned for full stack for a mid-tier company."

I'm interested in business, but the business department in my undergrad isn't very good, so I have been taking classes from our top ranked Applied Math department and have found math and statistics to be something of interest.  I originally enrolled with the intention of double majoring in Applied Math, however, a couple of screwups during my undergrad have set me back a bit, and I'm pretty sure that it will take at least an extra semester to graduate if I continue pursuing my double major.  I still will continue taking any relevant Applied Math courses, but I wouldn't have the double major and basically my major already fulfills the minor for that without taking any extra classes.

I have been applying to internships, so far without much luck, but I have become very interested in databases, and will be taking a class on it next semester.  However, I have noticed the Data Scientist positions and have heard about Data Science, but I feel like my undergrad education hasn't prepared me very well to be qualified for these roles.  As such, I am seriously considering getting my Masters in Data Science to better prepare me for such roles.  I have also heard of Analytics and have also considered going down that path.

I am just wondering how related they are to the Computer Science degree that I am pursuing now.  So far, I am considering the following programs:
- USC
- Ohio State (MS CS with grad. minor in Statistics/Data Analysis)
- Michigan
- Minnesota
- Purdue
- Rutgers
- Georgia Tech
- Northeastern

7n5khw,2,2017-12-30,Unsure,lostthrowaway1513,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/7n5khw/unsure/,"This is a long story so please bear with me.

My younger sister is in her 3rd year of university in engineering and I'm away at a different university for graduate school. However she's been acting up a lot. Last year she fell for an older guy and was secretive about it from our whole family and when we found out she cut all contact with us for a month even when I begged her to at least communicate with us on some level through texts because she wouldn't pick up the phone and she moved out of her apartment to god knows where. She messaged me back and told me to mind my own business and to fuck off. We finally make amends when she decided to contact us again and we met her boyfriend and had him for lunch with us and all that jazz.

Then a few months later they broke up and she says she's depressed and that her boyfriend abused her and that we are emotionally manipulating her. I understand that she's depressed and I sympathize with that because I also deal with it and have diagnosed anxiety and I told her to go seek counselling or professional help. She refuses and accuses me of calling her insane and that I'm unhelpful and useless. Ouch.

She's been exceptionally mean and rude. I decided to cheer her up by hand knitting her a captain america (her favourite hero) hat that took me ages to make up my own pattern and create. When I gave it to her she said it looked ugly. I was hurt I asked her to at least give it a try and she said it would only sit in her closet because she doesn't like the colours and I should have chosen better. When I said that's very rude of her and she should learn to have some gratitude she said I should learn that people have opinions and I should respect hers. I guess???


It's just small things like that that just built up over time. My parents felt bad that she was so depressed that they drove every 2 weeks for 2 hours there and back (4 hours total) to bring food for her so she wouldn't have to worry and just study. She let it rot in her fridge because it wasn't to her taste and they shouldn't bring her food if she doesn't ask for it. But then when they stop she cries about how we don't care about her. She openly calls my dad a ""stupid fat pighead"" in the mall in English when he doesn't know English. I know he's not the most eloquent man ever (he's had his fair share of yelling rude things at some of us) but that doens't mean it's ok to call him that at the top of your lungs when he doens't even understand what you're saying. Especially since it was his birthday and she showed up an hour late to the restaurant (even though we live together and kept asking her to leave with us at the same time) because she was busy skyping her now-boyfriend.


My sister has expressed desire to switch to programming. A few days ago she said she wanted to work for a few gaming companies and listed EA as one of them. I told her about how bad EA PR is and what happened on reddit and perhaps she should consider more heavily on the other companies she listed. She said that it's not the fault of the developers interns and I should stop judging them and that it's the fault of the business guys. I said well yeah but if you know the business guys forces the developers to do things they think are unethical for a game why would you work for them? She said that has nothing to do with the developers and again I'm blaming people who don't deserve to be blamed. This goes on and on. It's like she's always looking to prove that I'm lying or I'm blaming someone or I'm judging. Questions like ""Why do you think it's unethical? Why is it wrong? Why do you keep blaming the interns?""

I just exploded. I said you don't care about all this do you? You're just looking to prove some weird shit in your head? That we're all out to get you for some reason? I understand you have your own issues but we all do (I don't tell her that I have diagnosed anxiety). It's not right for you to act like a fucking asshole to all of us.

We just yell back and forth and she's telling me to go fuck myself because I don't understand what's in her head and that she's suicidal. She tells me to never speak to her again and ever since then she's furiously texting all her friends about me. She's always been one to publicly announce these things. I caught her with her MSN name as ""My mom is a fucking bitch"" before.


Our family is flawed. I know that. So is every other family. We're trying our best to work on our mistakes together. We don't run away from them like she does by cutting contact with us.


I'm so confused and lost though. She's suicidal and I don't want to push her but she's also a huge asshole. She's literally hurt everyone in our family for every nice thing we tried to do for her. Everytime we criticize her a little we're told we're emotionally manipulating her or abusing her. It's really hard to be held hostage like this. Yes maybe she never asked for us to be nice to her but I don't really know what else to do? If we don't do anything we're told we don't care about her. When we do something we're told we should know our place. We don't even ask her to do chores anymore because if we do she just gets angry with us. She's basically counting the days until she can leave so she can be with people who apparently never abuses her.

I know I have to pick and choose my battles. This is just a big rant. I came home for a 2 week break, I didn't expect to be insulted over and over and in the end be called an emotionally abusive bitch."

Our suicide rate is also extremely high with suicides occurring every 2-3 years. Last year I managed to scrape an unweighted 4.0 (We can't take APs till junior year) but this year our first semester has ended and I am going to receive 2 Bs on extremely difficult subjects with an unreasonable teachers.

However with my current GPA this is no longer a possibility. This has made my mother furious. She claims that I am not spending enough time studying and says that I am a miserable wretch and that I am good for nothing. I am constantly emotionally abused. Now recently, my mother has made a resolution for the new year that since I am a ""wastrel"" she is going to cut all funding on all my extracurricular activities and put it all on my brother. Sadly this includes being driven to places (not old enough for permit) like volunteering centers and medical internships with professors. She has also taken away my computer and my phone leaving me nothing to do my homework with. I have to walk 2 hours every day to go to the public library and use their facilities for homework and this is taking an even bigger toll on my grades. My extracurricular activities are dropping, my resume is getting weaker and soon the only colleges I will be able to apply to are low tier UC's. Now I know this sounds extremely pretentious but with the amount of work I put into my studies combined with my ambitions, not getting into a high tier school would be an absolute blow. My mother demands that if I want anything I have to fund myself and I have tried getting multiple jobs but I do not have the time to juggle my copious school work along with my long walks to the library. Now recently there is a swim academy that opened near the library and it would allow me to work and still have time for other things. However, my mother refuses to pay for the initial certification I must receive, despite my pleas. She also threatens to divorce my father and take the house and my brother if he tries to fund or assist me in any way, whether it is letting me use his computer, or driving me places and giving me money. I don't know what to do and I am scared that my mother is going to ruin my future and put me into a life of mediocrity."

I finished my 3rd year in engineering, currently doing a year long internship at 50k. I'm saving for next years tuition and living etc. AFAIK, if I get to come back to the same job i would be starting at 78k. 

Assuming that's true, what was/would be your game plan if you wanted to live somewhere in uptown Toronto (near Eglinton and Yonge area)?

I probably will have to work for at least a couple years to afford a 20% down payment on $400,000 place for example. So during this time, what would you do?

I hate living at my parents house because it's an hour drive to anywhere civilized, it's so far up north. Right now I'm doing 1hr drive each way to work. Same thing for pleasure. That greatly limits my schedule, and how far I can go to meet friends and how often, and what to go to (eg. I can't do clubbing because I can't drive back after drinking, my house isn't public transport accessible). 

But that way, you save so much money but lose so much of your life, especially in low 20s. If I rent downtown or somewhere higher, costs of living will be huge. Food, rent, bus pass, etc, but I'll be mentally free and health (i don't feel mentally well at home because I feel very isolated). But I'll probably much more time to save up for a place. 

That brings me to another question, should you even buy a place, or just rent for a very long time? Because I feel like rent is a waste if you're trying to buy a place soon, since you could put your money into mortgage. 

So what would you do and why? Or what have you done or seen people do?

Edit: during school, I live in downtown Toronto and I love it. I'm back home for my internship year and I hate it "

7n6ju2,8,2017-12-30,"PwC is a sinking ship, avoid if you can",Holdmycalculator,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/7n6ju2/pwc_is_a_sinking_ship_avoid_if_you_can/,"The title says it all, folks. I'll go into a deeper dive, and try adding in other useful insights. This post is mainly for the use of the juniors/seniors recruiting for that Big 4 internship (which 90% of the time leads to a full time job offer). However, if you are an experienced hire looking to join, you might also find this useful. 

In case the title is not clear enough for you, I am going to say it clearly: PwC is falling, and falling fast! They have been making drastic budget cuts over the past couple of years, and more so than ever, are ignoring their people completely. All Big 4 will work you like you have no papers and no options. You work 60-70 hours week in and out for most of the year (the whole Jan-March busy season is bad, but various clients have different year-ends and then other special projects like majors M&amp;A, IPO, or other deals taking place that require additional work). They refuse to let you have a life, and make you come in on weekends after staying late throughout the week. I'm sure you already know this, but be prepared to not be able to meal-prep, go to the gym, or have more than a an hour or two at max of free time each evening. Oh and sleep ....good-luck!! 

When I was originally recruiting, PwC kept stressing the importance of people. At the time, I thought Deloitte was a much better firm in terms of the benefits it offered, and just how much happier the employees were when I interacted with them. PwC people looked stressed out, but at the time I figured the difference in the quality of life wasn't that much. Furthermore, I figured Deloitte was focused on the advisory/consulting aspects, and was not looking to be as aggressive in the audit/assurance practice. 

Most of my friends from school went with EY. EY was heavily invested in Vision 2020, and being aggressive to win audits. They had just about every prominent tech company (the future!). It was honestly a coin toss for me to decide between PwC and EY. I really wanted to pick Deloitte but their client portfolio was really lacking. If I want to stick around for a few years, I want to be on interesting clients to not only learn about successful business strategy, but also to make some good connections that lead to good fortunes down the road. 

So, I picked PwC. The internship went well. I was on one of the largest engagement teams in the nation, and was on an incredibly profitable job. The senior managers and managers had everything planned out nicely. People generally worked until 7-8, except for the last 3 weeks prior to filing. Then people would stay till 9, maybe 10, and work 4-5 hours on Saturday. There was flexibility, and the budget was massive. 

I join full-time, and WOW SO MUCH HAS CHANGED in less than 2 years. National leadership has essentially drastically cut back on recruiting expenses - fewer recruiting events, more interviews through google hangouts rather than in person, only flying candidates with job offers in hands to office visits, fewer wining and dining events. Not only do you miss out on the most amazing part of the recruitment process, you get less exposure to staff in casual environments. This makes it harder to make personal connections, and to truly assess your fit. But don't work, this way you will not be given a fake marketing pitch about how they are trying to be 'digital savvy"" and make it ""convenient"" and whatnot. AVOID PWC. There are three other firms in just about every market you can think of. 

For training purposes, up until you make manager (after 6 years, where as other firms promote you after 5 years) you will be sharing a room. Yay to double beds with another guy/gal! They are starting to even cater dinners at training events so you don't get your nightly allowances for dinners. 

Speaking of becoming a manager, they used to sell the fact that if you made it to manager, you would get a 25% cash bonus of your salary. What they didn't say was that you wouldn't get it until April 15th (after your first year of being a manger) AND that it's being cut to 20%. Honestly, it might become 15% or 10% in a couple years. Also, just a couple years ago when I interned they had contribution awards. Apparently these were are also discontinued to save on costs. I've spoke with a half dozen people or so regarding their most recent compensation meetings, and apparently the raises this past year were TERRIBLE. 

There are plenty of other people that can chime in, but PwC has definitely been struggling with the recent litigation expenses, lawsuit settlements, and fines from regulatory bodies. This has led to layoffs in internal firm services (HR is being consolidated, and this had led to so many issues regarding deployment on engagements). Apparently 15-20% of HR/recruiting/admin (IFS) was let go, and several people on the advisory side also got the bad news. 

We all know the Big 4 will make you work long hours without compensating you for what you're worth. Whenever anything happens, the partners don't want anything happening to their margins. Nor sure they as they earned that position after putting in their time. That means the more bad news that happens, the worse off it is for everyone else at the firm. EY and Deloitte are trending up, and my friends who went with those two firms are much happier than my colleagues and i are at PwC. 

PwC's management can keep pushing for aggressive budget cuts to increase their total revenue (every company has the right to), but they really are giving the middle finger to everyone who works for them. I can't wait for the day I can put two hands up and say deuces. That day may be coming a lot sooner than I had originally planned for..."
7n6tva,8,2017-12-31,"Performed well in College/Grad School, but now struggling in entry level office job, any advice?",Drshuk31,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7n6tva/performed_well_in_collegegrad_school_but_now/,"TLDR- Did really well in College/Grad School, but now I'm really struggling in my entry level office job. Due mainly to the time I've had to miss ( 5 days of PTO I had to use by the end of the year, and  2 days for a seminar I and to attend), and my lack of organization and focus/interest in the job. Not sure what to do

So this past May I graduated why my MA in International relations. The time I spent in that program was a high point for me as I perfumed  very well ( finished with a 3.88 GPA) overall, and was able to manage various deadlines for my classes, along with being a Graduate Assistant for my first two semesters, and later competing a couple internships, all while not being on any meds for my ADHD.

Now after being in an entry level office shipping/logistics job, a lot of my self-confidence has been chipped away. It's a very task-oriented job , with lots of monotonous data entry work, and a heavy emphasis on keeping various paperwork organized in a certain way. It should ne noted that not only is the paperwork monotonous but there is a also a lot of it, on a good day I might get 5 or 6 new files, on a bad day 10-15 new files. 

 At first I was actually doing okay ,I got a decent review after my first 3 months, but after that things started to go down the tubes. It all started with the fact that while I was doing the actual data entry work well, I was at the same time struggling with my organization, when it came to the hard copies of  these files. Things started to get really bad. when they added four new clients to my workload. 

Once that happened I started to get really overwhelmed. This was compounded by the fact that after I completed my first 3 months on the job in November I earned 5 days of PTO, which I had use by the end of the year. I also missed two more days because of a seminar I had  to attend for work, to get a certain type of certification for the job.  All this time off meant that i got really behind,  which Is bad because I am constantly getting new files which makes it hard to focus on getting old jobs finished, because I have to get the first steps of these new files completed first, which takes a good chunk of my day already. This has started to become a major problem and my clients have started to complain to my bosses as they aren't getting the updates on the files they need in what they see as a timely manner. In my rush to attempt to get things done, along with my lack of focus due to finding the work boring and repetitive, I've started to make carless mistakes that have cost the company money.        

This job is really making me feel like an incompetent failure, and I'm wondering if maybe  this is just really not the job for me?  I'm also wondering why I was able to do so well in school, but am struggling so mightily in this environment? Any advice?

Meh ACT/SAT scores, poor HS GPA, and several failed college level classes from attendance straight out of high school. When I was younger, I hated school. As something I was being forced to do, I never put much effort into it. 

Over the last decade I've been working a ""big girl job"" at a start up, traveled worldwide, and now fully appreciate the value of an education. I'm taking classes with honors, making all A's, befriending professors, doing an internship, honors symposiums - all that good stuff. 

Basic Info: 

- Major: Computer Science/Engineering 

- Current [semi-recovered] GPA: 3.1 (but transcripts show a bunch of Fs)

- Completed credits: 30+

I'm here to ask: *""Do I have any chance repairing my track record enough to get into a top school?""* If so, what steps can I take? Any chance my credits might transfer? If not, is it worth losing that progress to attend a top university vs. my local college?

Thanks in advance guys - I love reading your threads here, you're all so inspiring!

7n8rwc,4,2017-12-31,What am I worth?,A_Starving_Scientist,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7n8rwc/what_am_i_worth/,"This is a little bit rambling, so forgive me for the wall of text. At the end of this year I will be graduating from the University of Washington with a BA in Applied Computer Science where I earned a 3.2 GPA. (No idea why my major is a BA, its CSS core curriculum with the ability to take some outside electives, in my case physics. The difference from the BS in CSS and my major ended up being only three classes.) I also have a minor in physics, as well as a minor in Japanese language, having completed a one year program in Tokyo Japan for language study and international business practices at Sophia University. 

&amp;nbsp;

By the end of college I will have two internships under my belt as well. One in medical physics at Group Health Cooperative (now Kaiser Permanente) learning about the calibration of medical linear particle accelerators, CT Scanners, etc. And one at a small aerospace firm where I learned about inventory management systems using SQL and wrote java servlets, hosted on Apache, and interfaced it with SOAP.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, for my senior capstone project, I wrote a program that allows for the conversion of GPS coordinates to image coordinates and back for use on a self driving vehicle vision systems using OpenCV. This used some knowledge of optics, image aberration correction, and camera calibration which is how I spun the applied physics bit in. I know c#, java, c++, mySQL, python, etc. studied mathematics up to linear algebra and differential equations, and took a few courses on bioinformatics on top of the usual CSS coursework. 

&amp;nbsp;

But truth be told, I really have no idea at this point what I'm actually worth in terms of earning potential now that I'm graduating, with even less of an idea of where I want to go career wise. My resume reads like a jack of all trades, someone with alot of scientific and technical interests, and maybe some decent ability, but no clear direction or depth in a given area. At this point, I'm not sure where to start.

&amp;nbsp;

As for what I want to do, I am interested in possibly working internationally, specifically in in Italy or back in Japan, but I'm aware that programmers generally make much MUCH less in Asia vs the US, and Asian work culture sucks balls. Being based in Seattle right now, I'm in one of the best places in the world for my field so I'm still thinking if I want to actually do this option, or pursue it later when I have a few more years experience and am a little more financially secure.

&amp;nbsp;

Interest wise, I have an interest in language teaching software like rosetta stone so I can maybe combine my language skills and programming. And I'm also interested in computer vision, and machine learning, but didnt get a chance to study those much during my time in university besides the independent research I did for my senior project. Does anyone have any advice?

I'm looking for a CS career that involves the things listed in the title. I currently work in a corporate cubicle ""Office Space"" kind of job and it's terrible dull. Hawaiian shirt Fridays just aren't working for me.

At first I thought I would just become a programmer and work in software dev. However, the more I learn the more I come to realize how VAST a career in CS can be. 

So even though I've only had ONE Comp sci class, I like to think about what kind of careers I would want to pursue, so that in a year or two when it's time to **pick electives for my degree** and think about **internships**, I have things narrowed down a bit.

Currently I'm thinking about 

* Software Development / Software Eng (I'd like to be creative and make things)

* Cyber Security / InfoSec (I think the idea of breaking someone's software to help improve it is REALLY interesting)

* Working with Research scientist or medical field(Helping scientist or people in the medical field discover new cures or build new artificial limbs, or process data about climate change etc)

Look forward to everyone's answers!

I've done one 6 month internship at a startup as a front end web developer. NodeJS, little bit of PHP etc. I also did quite a bit of UI/UX however that's not really my area of interest.
