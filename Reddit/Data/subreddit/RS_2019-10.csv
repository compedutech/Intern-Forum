I'm an 18-year-old who's working on my resume so that I can apply for paid internships during this upcoming summer. I want to make my resume really pop, but I have almost nothing to put on my resume. I am applying for internships that deal with anything that has to do with Computer Science.  


If you could possibly point me in a direction that would be wonderful.  


Currently, these are the things I can put on my resume.

\- Going to college for a Bachelor's in Computer Science (Currently a freshman)

\- A cashier at a Grocery Retailer for 1.5 years

\- Took AP courses all throughout high school (not sure if this is of any importance at all.)

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that I'm generally stumped. I know parts of Java, javascript, and I'm currently neck-deep in learning C++

Is there anything you would recommend I put on my resume as a College Freshman? Or should I keep it simple?"
dbl0mm,13,2019-09-30,Graduated in May this year with a Communication Studies degree. Still working retail. Feeling super lost. (22F),hahahasob,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/dbl0mm/graduated_in_may_this_year_with_a_communication/,"Hi all! This is gonna be a long post, so thank you to anyone who decides to spend their time reading it. This is gonna be long and jumbled up since I'm coming from feeling extremely dejected over a rejection email of a job in which I thought the interview went really well hahahahahaha sigh.

As the title states, I graduated in May with a Communication Studies degree. My university offered two specializations for the major-- and mine was 'Rhetorical and Cultural Criticism.' Basically, this dealt with more of the media side of communication and what can be critiqued/learned about the messages we receive in these various mediums i.e. the news, tv shows/movies, advertising, PR, etc. I took classes that dealt with the more personal side of communication as well, such as interpersonal comm., nonverbal comm., health comm., etc. It included a lot of theory classes, and I enjoyed classes in the same school such as PR and advertising. I graduated with an associate's degree in Arts and Sciences (Art option) as well before transferring to complete my bachelor's for my Communication Studies degree. This was more of a liberal arts/general courses degree, but I was still lost on what I wanted to pursue in community college, so it was fine. For my associate's, I graduated with a 3.9 GPA. For my bachelor's, I graduated with a 4.0 GPA.

Even though my GPA looks like nothing in terms of my \~easy\~ majors, I struggled with untreated depression and anxiety throughout all 4 years of college (still do) and have been working at the same shitty retail job as a cashier all 4 years which has just worsened everything. I don't feel like I need to explain why I need to get out of retail in which I am making less than $15k/year with a degree, but I can at least state what I dislike about the job and what I never want in a career.

I hate talking to people-- I know most people don't, and it's ironic to hear this coming from my major, but I can't stand constant social interaction. If it was a few interactions a day it would be fine, but constantly being 'on' is exhausting. I hate having to talk to people and be polite to them despite their terrible attitudes. I hate standing for 7+ hours a day, in which I come home both mentally and physically exhausted and feel like the day's already over. It's such a repetitive and soulless job that I don't have the energy to pursue my creative interests when I come home, as well. I need to be able to be creative in some form, and this job obviously does not offer that. I am expected to follow the standard procedures, fake enthusiasm and be interested in terrible small talk, and not make any mistakes or else the customers will just get angry with me. It's at the point where I'm usually crying in the bathroom on break and on the car ride home, so I need to get out ASAP and have been trying to escape for the past year.

The thing is, I don't know what I even want to do. I originally wanted to pursue social media, but every job posting requires 3+ years experience for every entry level job, so I am holding off on it. I have mostly been applying to receptionist/admin work/account receivables etc. roles just to do something to get out of retail and leave it behind. I have taken career tests, and most of them point me in the direction of creative jobs i.e. artist, set designer, movie director, etc. While I am creative, I know that getting most of these jobs would be tough and hard to break into. Instead, I am trying to use my creativity in an office setting that is secure employment and includes a set schedule, but allows me to do creative thinking. I really enjoyed writing in my undergrad career through research papers na critical analysis papers. I actually really enjoyed being given a topic, collecting data for it, and presenting my findings. In this way, I actually liked my public speaking class since that is what our assignments entailed. I enjoy working alone and at my own pace, which I understand may be hard to come by in terms of a career-- but definitely something I prefer. If I were to never have to have a face-to-face interaction ever again, I think I would be perfectly fine. I find myself lost in fantasy a lot, so a career dealing with creative thinking in which I can be lost in thought in order to solve problems would be ideal and super cool.

My resume...is alright. I don't think it's bad in terms of organization, but I just...do not have much to put on there. Early in my job search, I created an online portfolio for me to host my illustrations, writing/undergrad papers, and presentations that I feel represent my work and skillset best. But, I honestly doubt anyone's even looked at it-- even when I make sure to mention it and include the link in my cover letters. I have only had this single cashier job as my work experience, which is obviously an automatic rejection pile for most jobs I'm assuming. I never did any internships because most of them were unpaid (and I kinda uhhh needed money to pay for school) nor did I participate in any clubs because of my poor mental health. I have my job experience at the bottom, and decided to highlight a few of my projects from my undergrad career instead where I discussed what the project was about and which skills I utilized in them (research, data analysis, APA/MLA style, etc.) I feel like I really have nothing to show despite having a degree with high GPAs and obviously not being entirely stupid, but the constant ghosting and rejections have taken a blow to my confidence in all honesty. 

In terms of pursuing my creative passions when I have the time, I've gotten back into drawing/doing illustrations lately which are mostly just fan art for my favorite games. Of the sites that I post my art on-- Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram-- I've gained about 500+ followers combined in the past month or so. This is definitely way more than I ever expected for someone of my skillset, but definitely too little to take the plunge and try doing freelance work for income.

I would like to eventually get into coding/webdev/whatever people say to get into for careers, but I don't feel as if I am 'smart' enough to understand it in all honestly. I am in manageable student debt, but it is still debt and don't see myself ever going back to school-- or at least for another 10 years or so. Although I am looking for long-term goals and careers, I am extremely desperate to get out of retail. If anyone could even help me on what I could possibly search on job sites, even for short-term gigs, I would be grateful. Thank you to anyone who decided to read this, and an extra big thank you to anyone to decides to help me in any way."

I was suppose to be in software engineering but they kicked me out because my GPA wasn't high enough. Currently I am a sophomore taking 18 units a semester while working around 30 hrs. 

I don't know what I should do to better enhance myself to help myself land a job after I graduate. I've reached out to my friends to see if they can help hook me up with an internship in the summer. What should do? Like just focus on school or try and go earn certain certs. which i don't even know where to start. Or should i go and try to learn a programming language? I've tried Java and it was tough after learning loops which i didn't fully understand either. As an IT I also don't know what I would want to specialize. I know cloud and devops is like the current hot job on the market with lots of demand. I also saw people in this sub recommend cyber security."

I have an upcoming interview (my first actually) for a software development internship at a large company. I have recently learned there will be some technical questions for the phone part of the interview. Its this Wednesday afternoon, so I really only have a day to prepare for it (I also have classes and schoolwork).

A few questions, and I know you won't know the exact answers:

Will I most likely get to choose what language I'm coding in?

How difficult are the questions?

What is the best way to prepare for something like this?

How much weight will be put on this?

dblk7s,446,2019-09-30,Moved to Germany this past weekend for grad school - been planning this for 6 years and it’s finally happening!! [Also brought forth the end of a very good long-term relationship].,ProofSpecial,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/dblk7s/moved_to_germany_this_past_weekend_for_grad/,"No real point to this post but just wanted to share my story. 

I’ve visited this sub at various points over the last few years while frustrated with a variety of aspects of my “normal” life: general discussions about culture or politics with colleagues and peers, the healthcare, obsession with careers at a young age, my standard working hours, hyper-consumerism, people around me only caring about marriage and Instagrammable weddings and buying a house, my boss answering emails while in the hospital to give birth (lack of maternity leave), gun craze, etc. 


I am generally cynical and negative, so I would probably find issues wherever I was living, BUT, I always dreamed of pursuing an additional degree. Since I’m also all about living cost-efficiently (I wouldn’t say frugal, since I do spend $45 on face cream and I love gourmet cooking ingredients), I always thought an English-speaking program in Europe with its free tuition would be the best option. I applied to schools in the UK right after undergrad and realized I couldn’t do it financially with zero-savings. I got a job, worked for 3 years. That brings us to two years ago, I revisited the idea and started thinking about it, by this point I’m in a serious relationship with someone who would not move to Europe so I’m kinda slow with my documents - oops the deadline passed! Then last year, basically the same thing happened - I was anxious about the distance and its effect on my relationship, I was scared about leaving familiarity, comfort, love, and a genuine partnership - things I hadn’t experienced all at once previously. I was super depressed at work which ironically made me not want to do anything to make it better. Deadline passed again. 

Finally April 2019, I knew it was NOW OR NEVER. I at least wanted to submit my applications. I researched programs for 2-3 weeks and wrote tons of notes. I made checklists and to-do lists. I contacted friends who lived abroad. I gathered all my documents. I SENT EVERYTHING ON TIME by the May/June deadlines. My partner was supportive but generally quiet about everything. 

You probably know where that part is going, the break-up convo came up but it wasn’t set in stone and the relationship continued just like it had for the past 4 years. I started regretting my decision of even sending the applications and jeopardizing my life with my partner.

First I received 2 rejections, I honestly didn’t have high hopes and these rejections made me realize that my dream might kinda fizzle away, but at least I tried. Then came 5 acceptances in the weeks to come. 

My excitement coincided with sadness, my relationship with my sweet, caring partner basically had a deadline - and it was the same date of the start of my new, exciting move to Europe. Take about a emotional dichotomy. 

Anyway, last week was rough and involved lots of crying for both parties. 80% of my things are still in me and my partner’s apartment, I tried packing away as much as I could into my closet but it’s hard removing all traces and photos and trinkets of a long term relationship. Plus I could only take 2 suitcases which basically have winter clothes for Germany. 


First few days in Germany:

I haven’t done much in the past few days aside from roaming around the streets of my new city, hanging out with a friend that lives here, going to the university to walk around and give myself a tour, visit potential flatshares, walked around a grocery store and figured out German words for things. 

I feel excited just walking around, this is the catalyst of stimulation I needed and lacked in my life. I can only imagine what is to come once I start classes, meet classmates, sign up for a gym, take German lessons, travel on the wknds, get an internship. I think this is awesome and I know I would have regretted not taking this opportunity. I’m very sad that things didn’t work out with my partner. I wish they would have considered moving here with me or tried a long-distance relationship, alas, I cannot force someone to commit in ways like that, nor can I make my goals and dreams someone else’s. 

I’m happy to be here, it took me a long time, but I’m happy the wheel is turning. 

I hope you all pursue your own progression and adventures :)"

Race/ Ethnicity: Hispanic/Latino (American/Ecuadorian)

State: New York

First Generation (Parents are from Ecuador)

Income: $80,000&lt;

Intended Major: Business and Marketing

SAT: 1370 (taking again on October 5th, practice tests say I have a chance at getting a 1480-1500)

GPA: UW: 3.7 (my school doesn't do weighted)

Extracurriculars: 

\- Senior Project: Created a business that provides a platform for Ecuadorian artisans. I wanted to help bring into vogue the work of these artisans, but due to their lack of knowledge in fair trade due to unequal economic opportunities, they are unable to display their work to the world. In a way, craft is a vital tool that helps connect the heritage from the past with our present. I have filmed a documentary/interview where I went around cities that used to be known for artisan crafts and talked with locals about how the economy has impacted their businesses. I have created an e-commerce website (still working on bits) and am about to launch products such as panama hats, textiles, scarves, bags, jewelry etc. The rest of profit will go to a non-profit organization called Childrens International, which helps provide children and young adults in Ecuador with nutrition, employment, and education. (Sorry its long, really wanted to talk about it) 

\-Was accepted into the Innovation Lab program at my school (very few kids got accepted). It was an entrepreneurship program that allowed me to grow in my understanding of how businesses function. I created a project there where I created glasses that helped aid the blind by helping detect motion around them.

\-Founder of the business/marketing club at my school

\-Athletics: Basketball (6 years) Captain of the JV team and Captain of the varsity team

\- Karate (8 years) was head of the class and dedicated months in community service by helping run the dojo when my teacher was sick

\- Community service at my local church (around 60 hours)

\-At my school, there are study abroad trips:

My first trip I went to Borneo where I learned about marine biology and went and helped a team discover impacts pollution had on the coral and local marine ecosystem. Helped clean up islands around Borneo, which accounted for around 24 hours of community service

My second trip was to Zimbabwe, where I volunteered as a program counselor at a program called Hoops 4 Hope, which helps children stay off the streets and providing them with a safe environment to play and learn. We also helped rhino/elephant conservation groups. I received 48 hours of community service from that trip. 

Lastly, I went on a cultural trip to India. We learned about the culture of India and explored the markets and helped with conservation groups.

\-Summer: This summer I didn't have the opportunity to go to colleges to study/ internships. Due to family health reasons, I worked at two summer jobs to help my family pay medical and house bills. I write this in my common app essay on how this summer has taught me responsibility and hard work through difficult situations, all while maintaining a positive attitude (I'd say my essay is a 9/10) 

Letters of Rec:

Dean of Mathematics and Media at my school

Also getting letters from three Upenn alumni that are I am not related to. One owns a billion dollar investment firm (son goes to wharton), the other is a famous song writer, and the other marketed for nike and starbucks 

Essays: Summer (read above) and supplement essays are about how the Innovation Lab brought me an interest in business and marketing. 

Chance me for ED Wharton, northeastern, michigan, and others you think I have a chance.

So yeah, its kinda long. Let me know what you think!

dblr5b,45,2019-09-30,"First interview today, stumped on ""problem solving experience"" question. Any advice?",jjxseph,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/dblr5b/first_interview_today_stumped_on_problem_solving/,"I am posting this in an effort to learn from my mistake, receive any sort of feedback, and to prepare for my next interview with the help that is received. Thank you in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

Just some background information. I am about to graduate with my undergraduate degree in CE and I applied to a few jobs already. I had my first formal interview today for a company that I am fairly interested in working at. The thing is, I don't have any prior experience. No internships, no job shadowing, nothing. I get bored in classes a lot because I am a very hands on learner... I still pay attention in class, it just seems to all be so confusing until I make it to the lab, where the concepts are a breeze. I do get questions a lot by other students about labs and so on because it is where I spend the majority of my time so I am able to learn the material. I have done many side projects, all the way from configuring registers to control a DAC on a uC to implementing professional sites (I do web dev for clients). I am a very independent worker and love doing the work that I am fortunate enough to be able to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, to the issue that I was having. I was asked during the interview (over the phone) what my experiences in problem solving were. I kid you not, I didn't know what to say! I gave one example of a project that I am currently working on, basically telling him what the project is. I then asked ""Did that answer your question?"", ""nope"". I then thought for a second, and decided to talk to him about the design procedure that I had done for my capstone project at school.

&amp;#x200B;

It got me thinking, if I were asked the same question by a student: ""What problem solving skills did you implement in the class?"", I'd reply with ""form a hypothesis, conduct the experiment, analyze the results, form a conclusion, and repeat the process."" Textbook scientific method...

&amp;#x200B;

HPF not at the right cut off frequency? Change the resistor value and plug it in the formula again, observe what happened, adjust accordingly.

I2C message not coming back to the uC? Throw the signal up on the scope and look at timing, voltage levels, see if the signal is even being transmitted, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The list goes on, but I would assume my point is clear. The problem is that I don't know a good way to answer what was asked of me. It's part of engineering; to find a problem and then solve it. I really am just clueless as to how I should go about answering this for a future interview (since I doubt I will hear back from this company).

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is welcome and very greatly appreciated!"

It's a vocational school that specializes in IT and business, and by the time I graduate, I will be certified in many subjects such as python, html, and more. This is very exciting to me because I want to work in the IT field when I am older. As well as this, it teaches all of it's classes at an advanced level. And, it offers pre-calc to freshman, which I am taking. It also has many internship programs that allow students to get to train in really advanced stuff such as white hat hacking. If I go to this school, I feel like I will be basically guaranteed into top IT colleges as long as i do good in standardized tests. Since this school is teaching at an advanced level, the amount of homework given out is crazy. Last week, for the first time in my life, I didn't have time to play video games at all. Also, although I am making lots of friends and getting to know everyone, since people in this town come from all over the county, and none of my new friends live near me, I doubt we will be able to hang out alot outside of school, whereas in my old school, all my friends lived within biking distance. My friends at my old school, and I were very close, and I feel as though my new friends will never be quite as good as my old ones. As well as that, I am always hearing that people's highschool years were the best years of their lives, and I don't want to waste these years at a school where I am constantly unhappy. Also, my old school has many programs that I want to be part of such as electives starting freshman year, as opposed to junior year in my new school, a japanese program with AP japanese, and a trip to japan, and more options for clubs. I want to switch back to my old school except for that fact that if I do, I feel as though it will be harder to get into top IT colleges, and get high-paying jobs in that field. Along with this, my parents and relatives are very much against me switching back to my old school.  I would like advice on what you would do if you were in my situation. Would you stick with the new school where you are very unhappy, so that you could get into a good college and get a high paying job in a field you enjoy, or would you go to a school with your best friends since elementary school, more fun programs, but risk being less successful in the future.

Also, if you say that you would switch back to my old school, when would you do it. At the end of freshman year, or as soon as you can.

TL;DR- would you waste your highschool years in a school you don't like so that you can be more successful in the future"

dbnz3z,1,2019-10-01,Choosing between highschools,Rosegold_123,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dbnz3z/choosing_between_highschools/,"Right now, I'm starting my freshman year at a new high school. It's a vocational school that specializes in IT and business, and by the time I graduate, I will be certified in many subjects such as python, html, and more. This is very exciting to me because I want to work in the IT field when I am older. As well as this, it teaches all of it's classes at an advanced level. And, it offers pre-calc to freshman, which I am taking. It also has many internship programs that allow students to get to train in really advanced stuff such as white hat hacking. If I go to this school, I feel like I will be basically guaranteed into top IT colleges as long as i do good in standardized tests. Since this school is teaching at an advanced level, the amount of homework given out is crazy. Last week, for the first time in my life, I didn't have time to play video games at all. Also, although I am making lots of friends and getting to know everyone, since people in this town come from all over the county, and none of my new friends live near me, I doubt we will be able to hang out a lot outside of school, whereas in my old school, all my friends lived within biking distance. My friends at my old school, and I were very close, and I feel as though my new friends will never be quite as good as my old ones. As well as that, I am always hearing that people's highschool years were the best years of their lives, and I don't want to waste these years at a school where I am constantly unhappy. Also, my old school has many programs that I want to be part of such as electives starting freshman year, as opposed to junior year in my new school, a japanese program with AP japanese, and a trip to japan, and more options for clubs. I want to switch back to my old school except for that fact that if I do, I feel as though it will be harder to get into top IT colleges, and get high-paying jobs in that field. Along with this, my parents and relatives are very much against me switching back to my old school. I would like advice on what you would do if you were in my situation. Would you stick with the new school where you are very unhappy, so that you could get into a good college and get a high paying job in a field you enjoy, or would you go to a school with your best friends since elementary school, more fun programs, but risk being less successful in the future.

Also, if you say that you would switch back to my old school, when would you do it. At the end of freshman year, or as soon as you can.

TL;DR- would you waste your highschool years in a school you don't like so that you can be more successful in the future"

I'm really not sure if my profile is good enough for top-20 CS PhD programs and want to see if I should instead go for an MS first. 

**GRE**: 159 Q, 167 V, 4.5 Writing 

**GPA**: 3.65/4

**Papers**: Two in the pipeline, one as co-author and another as first author. One of the papers got accepted as a finalist in some international poster competition in Saudi Arabia. Papers will not be published by the time I apply, but the LoR from my PI will talk about them. 

**Research Exp**: One year in a neuroscience lab, one year in an AI medical imaging lab (which is where my two papers came from). Also had 3 applied research internships at startups, no published work from those. 

**Awards**: University scholarship, acceptance to a Capital One engineering program, nothing else though....
 
**LoR**: One from university PI (well recognized cancer researcher), one from coworker at current job (Stanford PhD, but in unrelated STEM field), and one from CTO of one of my internships (MIT PhD in EECS). All of them should be pretty good"

I like my job, however, I'm not sure if I should be looking for another internship to round out my experience. 

I mostly have practice in the scientific side of programming, so should I try and get some other kinds of development under my belt? How much of the python job market is science/data based? I could see myself getting into machine learning, and data science but I'm not sure if companies hire undergraduates for that.

I also have a clearance if that is of any interest to employers.

What should I be doing to up my chances of landing a nice paying job out of college- what companies should I be looking into, and applying for internships with?"
dbpcb1,1,2019-10-01,Please help me decide which CS/IT career path is best suited for me?,enzio901,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dbpcb1/please_help_me_decide_which_csit_career_path_is/,"I am a 25 year old male living in Sri Lanka currently doing 4th year (final year) of a Software Engineering degree.  There are some personal details I think would be relevant so included that as well.

**Schooling**

At school I followed GCSE London curriculum not the local Sri Lankan one. The local one is much tougher because there is a competition to get into the limited free slots in government universities. For my A levels I selected core mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics. 95% of those who did this wanted to do medicine as is the case in many asian countries. I thought I wanted to be a biologist.

**Learning difficulties**

At this time I realized I had some difficulties in learning new information and skills compared to other students. For example in school the teacher would teacher a concept for 45 minutes. I would kinda understand it at the time. In the next 45 minutes another concept would be taught that builds on the first concept. Now I have totally forgotten the first concept so would not understand anything. The teachers would complain that I am not attentive and don't listen in class. I would get low marks (30's) in term exams. But at home I would study the first concept over and over until I get it. But still I would forget more frequently and had to constantly study/redo questions.

This was the same when I tried to learn anything. Eg : martial arts, swimming, driving, rowing. Almost all the time the instructors were suprised that I haven't learned a technique  at that point. They always complained that I haven't paid attention. But reality is that I paid maximum attention. I just have to repeat it more. Another problem I noticed was that I don't remember directions when navigating. I had to go somewhere more than 50 times to remember how to get there. I would forget the turns landmarks etc. I suspect I have some form of learning disability relating to the memory. Was tested for ADHD and found negative.

I somehow finished my AL's with 3A's and a B. B for physics. But the effort took a mental toll on me. In the final year I only slept around 6 hours a day and spent most of my  waking hours studying. I believed that I was not cut for science. Meanwhile my collegues in the commerce batch had a much more leisurely life. People who scored medocre in math get 90's in Accounting. I said I wanted to do commerce. I told people that this is because I wanted to earn money in finance and other fairy tales. But deep down I was bitter. I actually liked science and had no interest in this subject. I was 20 years old at the time.

**My experience abroad doing undergraduate**

I also disliked my country and wanted to escape to a western one. So, somehow convinced my parents to send me to Australia for a degree in accounting or finance. My parents were middle class but they agreed to fund my initial education and I would go there and do a part time job.

In my first semester I actually got good marks in the commerce subjects. The courseload was much smaller. But at the end of the semester I was depressed. I didn't like anthing I was studying. I felt like I would commit suicide by 30 if I worked as an  accountant. At the same time I discovered computer science and also did the Coursera course ""Learning how to Learn"" by Babara Oakley which said that with the proper study techniques it is possible to do a degree in science.

So, in my second semster I switched to computer science. Soon I was overwhelmed. The courseload was twice that of accounting and I ended up failing the semester. I have wasted around 20k usd of my parents money and I was going no where. I felt awful. At the end I decided to quit the degree and come back to Sri Lanka. I would try to get a degree in software engineering from a private campus here. This way I could stay and home and not get overburdened by other responsibilities of living alone.

**Software Engineering degree in Sri Lanka**

All the top software engineering companies here do work for clients in the US, Europe and Australia. CS degrees from Colombo and Moratuwa  universities (government operated) are the most highly regarded in the industry. After that it's the degree offered by a small private institute. The actual degree is offered by a British institute. They just do the teaching here. So, I enrolled there. Soon I realized that the courseload is not as advanced as my Australain degree. It was watered down. Syllabus is given [here](https://www.iit.ac.lk/course/beng-software-engineering/#menu0).

At this time I have developed some good learning techniques mainly revolving around Anki Flash card software. This and due to the reduced courseload I managed to maintain an average around 75%. After completing the second year, the entire third year is a internship at a company.

**One year internship**

I got selected to one of the top 5 software companies here but I have mixed feelings about my experience. First I was assigned to a MEAN stack project. But I was not given any work in the actual project. Instead I was given a research task to come up with a good docker/kubernetes architecture to host the app. After this was done I was writing test cases and then a large chunk of time with no work. Not entirely their fault because they were dealing with a difficult client who constantly changes  requirements. In the end the project was shut down. Next I was transferred to an Angular project which was trying to meet a tight deadline. I was fixing bugs in forms etc. After this ended in a few months I was assigned to a research person who wanted to to develop a testing framework for react-native. I spent around a month doing nothing waiting for the project to start. Finally it never did and I was transferred to another big project with a team of around 30 people. This was the oldest project at the company. Now, I had around 5 months left of my internship.

The team was much more mature and stable. They had a procedure of dealing with new recruits such as KT sessions. Here, I got to work with actual production software. I mainly worked with .NET and Node backends. So, I finished that and started my final year. My internship was not very productive except for my last project. Meanwhile people who stayed in a single project doing a single technology the whole year are now very profecient at that while I knew little bits of node, angular, react, sql, .NET, react native. I came back to Uni to do my final year.

**Problems I have**

Many people passively learn when they do something many times. For example commuting somewhere every day you would  learn the sorroundings of places you pass, when cooking a recipe many times you would learn to make it without the recipe. Even in programming people remember the libraries and functions they use regularly without active memorization. But I don't. But I don't learn like that. Or I have to do  absurdly large amount of repetitions to remember. So, I have to actively try to remember these things using Anki software. I use Ank to memorize the roads in my city, proper form used in the gym exercises, names of people I meet, common knowledge I should be aware of etc etc. The rest I document in onenote notebooks meticulously.

In uni I carefully make Anki cards for all the concepts learned and all the different types of past paper questions.  I make sure that a single recall will only ask for a single piece of information. This way I manage to get good grades for my exams dispite my memory problems.

I worked in Angular for  months and I had only a shallow understanding of the technology. In the next 3 months I created an Anki deck for Angular and tried to actively memorize the concepts such as routing etc when I encoutered them in my project. After sometime I felt like I'm getting profecient. I could understand things in the project more deeper. But this is a double edged sword. I dont' know what to anki and what not to. Somethings I used rarely and better off not memorized and googled when needed.

Everyone told that using Anki this way is counterproductive. You don't have to memorize frameworks or libraries. Just google things when needed. You'll learn the important stuff while you are donig it anyway. But this last part is very difficult for me and I feel no one else understands.

In a job where you memorize the principles, techniques or theories and then applies them to solve problems I would excel due to my efficient study techniques related to Anki. And further more I have good discipline and drive. But programming is not such a job and I feel like I will always struggle to progress. I am confident that I'll get a good class in my degree and it won't be difficult to get a job at a good programming company afterwards. But I'm not confident that I'll be able to do the job properly. Maybe this view is because I was shifted between  different technologies and had lot of time doing nothing at my internship. Maybe if I was assigned to a single project I would have become profecient at that. But I don't know that.

**So, here's my question**

* The only things in life that  helped me remember the things other people remember naturally are Anki and memonic technique of visualization.
* If I go into a career in programming, I will have to use the above. Then I have to understand which concepts to memorize and which are best googled when needed. If this is not practical I don't see much progress in myself in such a career.
* If programming is not suited for me what career is? I cannot go into a completely diffierent field now. Are there any jobs in IT that are best suited in my condition?"

I have a few questions that will clear out the picture for me so it would be absolutely amazing if anyone can help me here.

I know this is quite long and I might seem a noob in this admission game but any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance! :)

Some info about me:

1. I'm from India and will be graduating from a 2nd-tier college(Manipal Institute of Technology) with a CGPA of 8.6/10.0 with major in CSE in May 2020.
2. I've worked actively in student tech communities for uplifting tech culture on campus by regularly organizing tech events. I've also served as the General Secretary of the biggest student tech society of my university with over 2500 members and I've also been recognized by GitHub as a Campus Expert based on my work for tech community on campus.
3. LOR from the founder of the startup I interned at along with a couple of LORs from CSE department of my college.
4. Currently a TA for which I'll get a certificate or LOR towards November end.
5. I have an offer from Samsung Research India for a 6 month internship and a possible job opportunity where I'll be starting from January '20. I think I would not be able to use this in my applications for fall '20 but might be able to use this work exp for fall '21 application and thus the question should I apply for '20 or wait till '21.
6. I would be looking for a general masters in CS program or masters in Software Engineering program.
7. I'm also attaching my resume in case I missed on something.

Questions:

1. Is my profile good enough to get into a top-20 and hopefully top-10 CS program? What should be the minimum GRE score I should aim for?
2. If my profile is not good enough, what are some places I can work on and improve before applying for fall 2021 admissions?
3. I'm currently aiming for Cornell, CMU and UCB. What are some colleges you would suggest based on my profile?

I finished my freshman year as a CS major at BU (Boston) but am taking a leave of absence for personal reasons. Right now I'm in a tight situation where I can't be where I currently am right now, and need to return to Boston ASAP. 

The thing is, my family's financial stiatuation isn't great right now and for the next year or so before I return to school in September, I need to start working and feeding myself.

I'm pretty desparate for a part-time job/internship right now in Cambridge or Boston, and would prefer to have some experience in jobs where I can get some experience in industry. I was thinking about contacting my professors but I'm unsure how they'd react given I'm not an official student right now.

As for my CS experience, I have none in the way of jobs or internships. I have a bunch of credits in AP and IB for math and science in high school and took 3 classes (Intro CS2, Discrete Maths, Linear Algebra) of which I got 2 As and a B. 

Are there any suitable part time jobs/internships that can last me until next year when school starts?"

I finished my freshman year as a CS major at BU (Boston) but am taking a leave of absence for personal reasons. Right now I'm in a tight situation where I can't be where I currently am right now, and need to return to Boston ASAP.


The thing is, my family's financial stiatuation isn't great right now and for the next year or so before I return to school in September, I need to start working and feeding myself.
I'm pretty desparate for a part-time job/internship right now in Cambridge or Boston, and would prefer to have some experience in jobs where I can get some experience in industry. I was thinking about contacting my professors but I'm unsure how they'd react given I'm not an official student right now.


As for my CS experience, I have none in the way of jobs or internships. I have a bunch of credits in AP and IB for math and science in high school and took 3 classes (Intro CS2, Discrete Maths, Linear Algebra) of which I got 2 As and a B.
Are there any suitable part time jobs/internships that can last me until next year when school starts?"

I'm 21 and I currently work in bioinformatics for almost 4 months already. I graduated last year with a CS degree from a top tier university in my country. Since undergrad, I've been focusing on Machine learning, DataSci, Computer Vision and a little bit on web development. Before this job, I was an intern for a startup doing web dev and then I taught CS in high school. I am thinking of transitioning to a corporate CS job for long term job stability. Bioinformatics does not provide it (in my country) . However, I'd like to make use of what I have right now. My office is nearby a my country's best university so I'm thinking of taking an MS CS degree next sem. My current job gives me lots of free time and allows me to work from home. It's a contractual basis job which means by June 2020 I'll have to find another job. Usually, there's always another contract project on the table. 

Should I focus on building my portfolio more or should I take an MS CS next sem? 
I'm thinking enrolling in MS CS so it can give me an edge  over fresh grads if I look for a job next year in the fields of ML/DataSci. 


Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I appreciate you comments/suggestions."

Thank you so much!**

&amp;#x200B;

**Demographics:** Female, Indian (Asian), from Michigan, went to a public high school, youngest one in my grade (17 when I graduate) and am in the STEM Academy at my school.

**Intended Majors:** Computer Science/ maybe double major CS and Psychology.

**SAT/ACT/SAT 2:** So I just started my junior year, so I haven't taken any subject tests yet. I have taken the SAT twice, got a 750 on both sections so 1500 overall the first time, and then a 770 on both subjects on the most recent August SAT, so a 1540 overall. I'm taking the SAT again in April, so I'll update this if I improve. I took the September ACT, so I should be getting my scores back for that any day now, and I will update this once I receive them.

**UW/W GPA:** Like I said, I'm still a junior, so my unweighted GPA right now is still a 4.0. My weighted GPA is a 4.042. If my grades go according to plan this year, I will have a unweighted of 4.0, and a weighted of 4.168. (Our school only weights AP classes as .021 per semester, and we don't count honors classes).

**Coursework:** Took APUSH Sophomore year, got a 4 on the test. This year I'm taking AP Lang, AP Comp Sci, and AP Physics 1, will update later once I finish these courses and take the test. Senior year, I plan on taking AP Pysch, AP Macro Econ, AP Calc A/B, either APES or AP Physics 2, and AP Lit.

**Awards:**  Been really trying to get more stuff in this category because I currently don't have much. Academically related, I've made honor roll every year and got one of those academic letters. Non academically, I placed fourth in our region for bowling and went to our state competition. I also recieved my varsity letter freshman year for bowling.

**Extracurriculars:** Afterschool, I am a part of our school's Rotary Interact Club, which is basically a service club dedicated to helping our community. I am also a part of our school's Student Government and our Diversity Club. I am the treasurer of our school's Gone Boarding Club, which is a club that allows students to design and create their own snowboards, skateboards, and longboards. I am also one of the creators of our schools Lean In Club, which is the first youth circle of Lean In in Michigan. Lean In is a discussion club in which we talk about controversial issues, and try to come up with solutions for problems in today's society. I also have been on our school's varsity bowling team for all years. Outside of school, I have a job at Gourmet Concessions, and I volunteer at the local KDL Library, and at Kids Food Basket. I am also a part of the Kids Food Basket Youth Action Board, which is a leadership program that allows us to create and execute projects that will line up with the Kids Food Basket mission and benefit the community. Senior year, I am going to have an internship through the STEM Academy at my school. (location TBD).

**Essays:** Omitted for now, will update this later.

**Schools:** University of Michigan, Stanford, CalTech, MIT, Berkeley, NYU, Michigan State, Carnegie Mellon etc."

Looking to move on, but in a predicament",Reagorn,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/dbvkqi/currently_a_junior_fin_analyst_looking_to_move_on/,"I graduated from my Masters in Econ degree in August 2018. Since then I’ve been working as a Junior FA. It’s a contract position that was meant to be until last month, but extended until end of December. 

I took this role under the assumption that I would be working directly under a Senior FA doing only analytical work. In reality, I’m doing a mix of analytical work and AP work, which really annoyed me, but I wanted to stick around for a year and pay off my loans, which I’ve almost done

I know they won’t extend my contract again because they took my asking for more analytical work as being unhappy. They now plan to either cut the role or replace me with interns (they pay ridiculously low pay to every employee compared to the market. They rather cut costs my replacing or ending my contract)

 Ive interviewed for a couple roles, but haven’t got because I was under qualified or they had to postpone hiring for the role

So my first question: when I get asked why I want to leave, I usually say something along the lines of I feel my learning ability has stopped, so I want a role where I feel I can continue to learn/grow
Not sure if I should mention my contract is ending end of dec and I rather not continue. 

Second question: when I talk about what I do, I usually stay away from the AP stuff. I usually just talk about the ad hoc and analytical work I do. Is that a fine idea?

If I don’t find anything between now and December. I’m worried how my contract ending would look to future employers. If that does happen, do l just say I was cut due to budgets? 
To follow that, what if my current supervisors say they don’t want to give me a reference or do give a reference but say a reason other than budgets to them?

Ive made a couple small mistakes on the AP side when I first started, but those were all corrected when I found them. Other than that, I haven’t been told anything about work quality being bad and I’m assuming if it was bad, they wouldn’t extend my contract in the first place. 

Any advice would be appreciated"

I'm also a career changer and this is my first full time job in tech.



Midway through my MS, I noticed something interesting about hiring patterns.  Compared to the school career fair that I got my previous internship through, the second school career fair I attended was pretty empty of tech companies besides the 2 largest companies who are always hiring.



I took that as a sign that a recession is on the way.  Rather than applying for my second internship, I decided to apply immediately for any full time job I can find since I already have an undergrad degree.



I ended up getting a good paying job at a local startup that allowed me to complete my degree part time.  Finishing my degree so far has been pretty crazy with work, which i have been doing since February.  However, then I read the news about an incoming recession and I feel grateful for the opportunity.


Did I make the right choice delaying graduation to get into the workforce before the recession hits?"

I have 2 associates, one in liberal arts and the another in computer information systems.  I work full time and take classes full time, I've tried working with FCC but I've been really inconsistent with it - after working a full shift and having to do assignments, it leaves little energy to do anything else. What should I do at this point? Most of the internships I apply to reject me before even inquiring more information.

I’m planning on applying to masters of education programs for school counseling this winter and hoping for some advice on whether I should retake the GRE or stick with my scores. 

I took the GRE last Saturday after signing up for it the Thursday before. I’d been so anxious about the test that I continuously procrastinated studying so I literally studied for one day - the day right before the exam. I took two practice tests and read about the format of the test. On the day of the test, I was incredible sick from anxiety.

My scores were 161 verbal (88th percentile) (who knows how lol), 156 quantitative (60th percentile), and 4.0 writing (57th percentile). I’m thinking the verbal and quantitive scores are okay but very worried about the writing score. If I had actually prepared for writing, I think I might have been able to do better but I’ve researched how they assess the responses and I’m not sure. My writing style is very succinct because I’ve spent all of undergrad analyzing research/ programs and practicing shortening my writing. I think I’m pretty good writer but it seems like my natural writing style won’t help me on the GRE. My fear is that maybe I’m just not a good writer and practicing/ retaking the exam won’t help.

If I were to retake the test, I don’t think I would be able to get the same verbal/ quantitative scores again without actually studying and I don’t know if I’ll have time for that. My first application is due Dec. 1 and I’m a full time student with a part time job and leadership positions with multiple organizations. I might be able to improve the writing a little bit (maybe a 4.5 or 5.0) but I’m not sure. 

The schools I’m applying to:

* My first choice (UVA) published average GRE scores for accepted students to all M.Ed programs: 156 verbal, 153 quantitative, and 4.5 writing but they say they take a holistic approach.
* My second choice (William &amp; Mary) just says their guidelines are 40th percentile or higher.
* My third choice (UNC Chapel Hill) doesn’t require the GRE if your GPA is above a 3.5 and I can’t find any guidelines for the scores they look for.
* My fourth choice (James Madison) also doesn’t have any guidelines listed.

For background:

* I’m currently a senior at a top 5 public university double majoring in psychology and youth development in the school of education. My overall GPA is a 3.82 and my major GPA is a 4.0. 
* I have 5 years of experience working with kids as a swim team coach, I’ve volunteered with about 5 tutoring/ mentorship programs for youth (but each only for a semester or year), I had a one year internship with a community non-profit, I’ve worked a part time job throughout college and now have a supervisory role, I’ve volunteered for a crisis hotline for 3 years, I’m in a sorority, and am the president of two student organizations. I also have a couple education/ research related certifications but I have no actual research experience.
* My rec letter from my internship supervisor should be really good and I’ll have two recs for professors that should be pretty good but maybe not excellent.
* My personal statement will be pretty good - I have clear reasons for why I want to go into school counseling and clear reasons why I think I will be a good school counselor.

I’m so sorry this is so long but I would really appreciate any advice about the GRE or any advice regarding applying to grad schools for school counseling in general. Specifically, if anyone has any other grad programs they would suggest (ideally around the southeast) or advice for making my application look more competitive. Thank you so, so much!"

This will be my final year in school before I finish my bachelor's degree in computer networking and security. The stuff I learn is mostly going towards the CCNA certificate. But, I still haven't signup for the test yet. Here's a little bit of my background:

Second part-time: Internship with Department of Education(Currently): already did 1 year and this will be my second year.

No certificates

I'm using a new account because I'm anxious and I don't want people who I know asking me about this. First, I think I'll give you guys some context/background. I'm 21M, Brazilian and finishing my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at the end of the year. So, I always liked coding, for me It is kinda of a hobby and I have a little bit of experience (small ofline system for a family's company and some games for fun), very basic stuff. I ended up choosing engineering because it was my second option, and on the university I applied for, engineering was stronger than computer science education wise.

Months ago, I started a intership as a junior process analyst (is very common for any type of engineer in Brazil work in management). This job is related to production engineering and sometimes i had to automate stuff through coding. I realized the coding part is the one I like the most, so the idea of pursuing CS/IT cameback to my mind and since then it has been pretty strong.

I talked with my parents about switching careers and although they ""support"" it, I know they think I lost a lot of time, and to be honest, me too. Now, I have the opportunity to study abroad after I graduate. I want to go to Canada and I can sustain myself for 2 years, but the problem is, bachelor's degree in CS is 4 years. First, I was thinking about getting an associate degree in CS (I know Canada does not have the associate's degree but there is an equivalent which is 2 years long), but after lurking on some subreddits, it seems like a bad choice. Instead, a masters related to CS/IT sounds way better, since is generally 2 years long and it won't be a ""waste of time"".

I want to use aducation as a way to immigrate, because Brazil is not going financially well. Here, Canada is being advertised as in need of IT professionals and even has some programs to encourage people to move there. Are there reallyt oportunities for people who immigrate? What is my best choice?

* &amp;#x200B;

1. Switch careers, go to a public university and get a bachelor's degree in CS. After, get a masters in CS in Canada.

* 2. Switch careers, go to a private university and get a bachelor's degree in CS. Private universities are sometimes better because they have better partnerships for internships. No money left to go to Canada.
   * Pros: Completely in the IT field. Better chance to find a job and survive through the crisis.
   * Cons: Long time to complete. No possible immigration.
* 3. Go to Canada and get a masters in CS with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.
   * Pros: Less time to complete. Chance to get a job and immigrate.
   * Cons: End up in a job that is not so IT related, but still able to code.

For me, 3 seems the best choice, but I want unbiased opinions.

Can you guys give me advice on what master's degree should I pursuit, given that a masters in CS/IT without a bachelor's in CS/IT is possible.

Thanks!"

I am willing to get paid on the lower end of the spectrum since it seems like not many companies want me anyway. I have been trying to apply to start ups instead of the huge companies since I know for a fact I won't hear back from them(I have plenty of experience in that are). To put it in perspective, I have received 16 rejections as a software engineer and 1 email back for a phone interview. This is all so confusing because some sources tell me I need side projects and others say they won't really bother to even look at my side projects. Does anyone else have this issue?"

When is it okay to remove the completed coursework on a resume? Should I keep this section until after my first full-time position?

dc2rz7,0,2019-10-01,I'm freaking out right now and I don't know how I should feel.,heymikeyp,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/dc2rz7/im_freaking_out_right_now_and_i_dont_know_how_i/,"Today has been very eventful for me and I feel like crying but can't. I [made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8m56tp/got_laid_off_after_almost_4_years_devastated_need/) about a year and half ago and was stupid and ignored most of the advice people gave me especially the top comment where I should have looked for a job as soon as possible. I mostly focused on school and struggled to learn outside of it (still am). I guess being somewhat depressed made me drown in my sorrows and get completely lost with time.

After that job loss I had I thought it was over for me so I enrolled into school as soon as I can in hopes of learning anything. I chose Software developing, regardless of whether if I knew I had liked it or not. Got tired of being indecisive with my life. 

Well I started to feel immense pressure with having to pay 1400$ total in rent/utilities and roommate always being late. My savings was just falling every month so I started applying everywhere I can. LossPrevention positions (3+ years experience), help desk (got my Comptia A+ through school), software internships etc.

Well I had my first interview a few days ago for a LP roll for close to what I was being paid at my last roll. And today I had the second interview for that position, and it seems like a done deal with scheduling for orientation. It's totally unrelated to Software btw. I just needed a decent paying job.

But to top it off I got a call from a company for a part time software engineering internship today, and I'm scheduled to meet with the director of QA and VP of engineering Friday, and look around the office. It's different than a traditional internship in that they're very flexible and seems to take place during school. (My school is a regionally accredited fully online school, B.S in Software Development).

It's just making me freakout because I needed a job desperately, and now it seems I may get an opportunity I don't feel qualified for. And since it's part time I can do it before my full time afternoon-night job. To give you an idea, they seem like a great smaller and growing company, and that they're just looking for someone who knows fundamentals and is going to school for something related. They seemed interested in me because my B.S is more focused on Software Development than CS. I don't know how I should interpret this, so I asked what is expected and they just said fundamentals. They explained the stack to me which is mostly in Javascript, MySql, react/angular. Honestly I don't know if it's normal to feel the way I do. I expect it to be a huge learning experience, and they did say they will take me up to speed. I guess I'm just not confident with what I know. I'm almost half done with school and so far I had a programming fundamentals course in no particular language, some web development courses (very little JS involved), an intro to IT course, a networking course, about to finish up my second database/MySQL course, then I'm on to object oriented programming in C# for two meaty courses.

This is so overwhelming for me and I don't know how to react. I applied just to apply because it doesn't hurt to and now looks like I have an opportunity to learn a ton from. Friday is more like a meeting I think than an interview (I guess it's an interview regardless), but do you guys think I should read up on anything first? I know I have to make an impression, but they made it seem like they wanted to already take me on. I'm also scared because I'm going from half assing school, gyming, and home all day to what looks like 8 hours (Full time job), to 4-5 hours (part time internship), making 12 hours of me out there doing what needs to be done. I'm also worried about trying to juggle school in there (although it's go at your own pace).

I need words of wisdom or self assurance. Anything really. I gotta calm down, I feel like I had an adrenaline surge for a couple hours now."

When i started i just thought that i would be stocking pens and loading printers but that qas no where close, on my first day they had me sign a gag order but after all of this i need to break that. After i signed it they took me under ground and we walked in and i saw it, i saw hundreds of ""people"" but they didn't look like us they looked weirder and i will ve honest i knew they were aliens and they asked me questions all day like where was i born and then stuff no one could ever know like why did i kill that bird when i was 6 but i answered all of them and then i went home.





The second day we went to a different building and it was full of thousands of people at desks just watching people from their phones and computers and it was terrifying and they told us about how they watch people and that was when i knew that i had to find out more.





Now i have been there for 10 years and i have been doing scientific work for them, testing stuff that the ""people"" bought me, well i was fine with it because we already knew they were watching us but when they brought me something last week, they brought me this kid maybe 9 or 10 and he was alive but all of his blood was gone, they told me i had to link him to this computer and they turned him around and there were ports in his skull and i was very uncomfortable but i had to do it thats what anyone would do, right?





When i linked him up the computer lit up and the video player popped up and it started play his whole life, from birth to the incident, apparently he was able to crack a hole to another dimension and got in and then when he tried to get out and ended up in the basement of this building, but when it was over they ran out with him and i was just standing there and thats when i decided to leave 







For the last week i have been running from the cia but they have found me, right now im in Virginia writing this to tell everyone whats happening, in Germany there is a gate to a hole another dimension and they need a catastrophic amount of blood to open it and right now they are harvesting it, you are not giving blood to people you are giving it to them, your loved ones are not dying of cancer they are being harvested, please dont just ignore this please listen to what i am saying because they are getting close to filling it and if that gate opens we all will die



The cia is getting close now, i wish i could tell you more but it seems my time has come and i will be harvested for the gate, goodbye"

So I have been very go with the flow for my whole life. I just sort of let things happen to me because I used to figure what is going to happen will happen whether I want them to or not. That way of thinking has a very religious backing. And because this way of thinking kinda sucks, I really need to get out of it.

I graduate from college in about 3 semesters, so December of 2020 or Spring of 2021. Yes I did go to college. I am getting a degree in Psychology because the classes are cool and a minor in professional writing because writing is the only thing I actually like lmao

The issue comes in when I think about how in like a year and a half I’m going to have to be doing something with my life. As of yet I can barely even get a proper job by myself. (See I’ve mostly worked under the table and through the school throughout college, so that’s the entirety of my work experience. No retail or fast food to speak of. 

As for internships I have been trying to get internships over the past couple of summers and they have yet to work out. I imagine I only have to try harder. But I also imagine without that internship experience no one will want to hire me straight out of college. 

I have to think of my options now. What can I realistically do with a bachelors in psychology with the experience I have? I’ve thought of a few things, but I can’t be sure they are realistic, or if I might have more options.

* I could join the Peace Corp for a while. It is something I never really considered but for a large part of college I was really into helping people. That is why I got into the psychology field in the first place. I just enjoy being able to contribute something meaningful to the world. I gotta be honest though this didn’t even cross my mind until today when my professor told us about her experiences there. It reminded me of the softer part of myself that I had pretty much buried since I fell into a state of depression.
* I could pursue writing full time. But what good is that? I definitely want to be able to achieve that in the long run but as of now I don’t really have anything to write about. The best I could do right away is a blog and I’m too nervous to even set one up now. It would without a doubt get abandoned soon after since I don;t really have any content to publish.
* I could look for an internship around where I live but I really don’t want to stay here. I think I would be miserable in my home town long term. I knew that when I graduated high school actually so I moved out of state. I had a breakdown and had to come home. I have been here since and I’ve been quite not the same since. I’m afraid to move out again but also I feel that I have to.
* I could look for a place to intern elsewhere. Somewhere far away. That would include finding a place to live. And the internship may not even give me enough living expenses to keep myself afloat. I’ve never dealt with that before. The only places I have ever lived was in a college dorm and at home. 
* I could go to grad school. That would also require arranging living conditions which I probably wouldn’t have the means for. Furthering my degree would be a good idea, but I almost feel like I should wait a little bit before taking this route. A year or more.
* I could get a job at a college.Ideally this would pay for grad school.I know I can get into the admissions office with a bachelors, and that would be a stable job for a while. And if they let me take classes to get a masters degree that is even better.

I think that is about all of the options I have. I’m not the kind of person that can charm my way into any position, but that’s probably obvious. In fact the breakdown I mentioned earlier pretty much broke my personality and desire for human contact so I haven’t exactly had friends in over a year. That doesn’t help in the bleak outlook of my future. Thanks in advance for any advice you may offer. It was nice to write this out at least and realize I probably need therapy."

I graduated last Spring with a BS in Mech. Eng. and Physics with a 3.3 GPA in both. I conducted research and completed and undergrad thesis as well as worked with one of the world's largest clothing manufacturers designing, building, and implementing a retrofit to a critical manufacturing process; ultimately saving them 10's of thousands of dollars on the conservative end. I'm the first in my family to go to college and so missed the opportunities to start the MECOP program at my university, but I tried my best to supplement my education once I realized my mistake. I have been job searching for months on end applying to anything I think I can accomplish. I've put a lot of work into my resume, and I create a cover letter specific to every company I apply for.

I have not found ONE job that is considered entry level. Only ME 2+ positions that require years of experience beforehand. The only jobs that ever respond are tech. level positions that have minimum requirements of an associates degree or military service. I am trying my hardest to hold out for an actual engineering job so I don't pigeonhole myself and waste 5+ years of education on doing physical maintenance for HVAC systems. I have exhausted every opportunity with people I know in industry, which is very little. 

I'm sorry if this feels like a rant but I feel like I wasted my entire education, after being told that ""there just aren't enough engineers!"" Meanwhile, I see people who I know were terrible students that ran Starbucks and played video games at internships they had get jobs from these companies. Is it literally impossible to find an entry level position without having done one? How do I ever get the 2+ years experience working with niche equipment in specific industries? I've put a lot of effort into distinguishing myself from other candidates as most I know don't have research, a thesis, or even a second degree like I do.

How do I find a job!?"

I'm an undergrad student studying Biochem in the UK who is interested in getting some industry experience in any sort of area of computational biology and bioinformatics.

So recently I saw a 6-12 week internship opening for Illumina and thought that  it would be perfect to get more practical and technical skills which I lack.

I've had experience creating biological databases using postgreSQL and joining them together using Javascript. I also know the basics of R for statistical analysis and data processing although I've had no experience making a pipeline.

In this academic year I expect to use R on a mini-project to analyse genomic data and in my thesis (main project) to analyse protein networks in the Wnt signalling pathway.

Is there any tips for writing a CV and cover letter that could really set myself apart from other mathematical and computer science candidates? 

I've always assumed their superior technical knowledge would always be a disadvantage to me.

Many Thanks to anyone that can help me :)"

(Long post),InappropriateBiscuit,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dc8flv/should_i_leave_or_stay_in_my_internship_long_post/,"I’m an “intern” strength and conditioning coach at a university (I’ll get into that in a second). I took two years off college to pay for it (I have no debt now) and already graduated a year ago but so I already feel a bit old to be an intern at 26. After talking with multiple strength coaches and multiple failed applications I was told I am pretty much going to need to do more internships at the college level if I want to coach at that level. So I called the first college I did an internship with and explained that I was struggling and they called a college near me and asked if they could squeeze me into the program. They did but right from the first interview the head coach was just kind of rude. Like I was just taking up his time. Good example was when I joked that I’m glad I got there extra early because I wasn’t sure where to park and he basically gave me a “yeah you should really figure that out ahead of time...” most interviewers will usually give you a parking pass in the email or at least let you know where you should park. Whatever he’s just a tough love kind of guy. 

 Over time though it’s become apparent that he just does not like me. Every time I talk to him I’m doing something wrong. It’s just like every move I make annoys this guy. I know it just sounds like an intern that’s struggling and is upset because he’s not taking criticism well. I mentioned being an “intern” because he doesn’t call me that. He calls us all assistants but my case is different because I’m not being compensated in any way. I’m just doing this work for a good recommendation. I drive 30 minutes to and from the university 3 times a day, they won’t give me a student or a staff ID so I can’t access equipment lockers like the other interns, won’t give me a school email because I’m technically not staff or a student, and they don’t want me to workout in the fitness center because it’s not open to the public, just staff and students. But then the coach got mad at me when I asked how football did the other night because clearly I’m not trying hard to be a part of the program. If I was I’d know they won Saturday. (I don’t go to the games because I’ve got a full time job with flexible hours so I work a lot during them. Plus they don’t treat me like an actual intern so I can’t sit next to the team and I have to pay to come watch the teams I coach 🙄)

Honestly I’ve slept in my truck twice because my second job requires me to drive a lot and deliver equipment and sometimes I don’t get back until 2-3am. Workouts start at 5:30am. I do that just to get pooped on constantly. 

I want to just leave. But I had people stick their necks out for me to get me this opportunity and I really do need more experience if I want a chance at working at the collegiate level. However I also am worried that I’m going to go through 3 more months of this internship and in the end not get a good recommendation from this coach. He’s just very disrespectful and rude. There are so many times he could have just been a normal good guy but it’s always negative with him. I’ve never had this kind of problem anywhere else and I think it’s because I’m only there as a favor to somebody else. 

TLDR: things are not going well at my new internship. I’m not sure I’m even going to get a good recommendation at the end of this. 

Is it worth the struggle? I just want to further my career and have all this pay off but I have my doubts on if it’s even going to happen. Sorry for the book. Also upon reviewing this, my punctuation stinks. Sorry, I’m writing from a phone and am upset."

Now, I'm looking to find a new Product Owner job in SEA (like, Singapore or Vietnam, idk). Do I have any chance? I don't know that companies and recruiters expect from a Product Owner candidate, like 10+ years of experience? more experience managing? An actual degree? Do I have better chance looking for software developer position instead? Thank you.

Edit 1: I felt I didn't stress my experience enough, and it might be important. I started as an Android Dev intern (Java). Half a year later, I learned to be a Back-end Dev since no one want to do this (Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Scala, Play). A year and a half later, my company need a new Product Owner and then I get to become one. The entire experience had me double as a Manager, I kicked start teams like Designer, Admin, QA.

I live in a state notorious for the brain drain, so local work is probably not in the cards if I don't want to work for a manufacturing company or land an internship at one particular facility that likely doesn't have any spots available. So I want to get into freelance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can do shit like web scraping, computer vision, task automation (primarily on linux, but I could probably do shit on windows if I had to), debugging(for fellow students), some basic data analysis, and currently learning how to make websites through a few different methods. I know a good bit of languages(though I do need to brush up on SQL, so I'm not trying to advertise DBMS services) Oh yeah, and while I'm not quite to sys admin level yet, I can do just about damn near anything on linux because I spent the last for years obsessively tinkering with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

so far I set up one job on fiverr, offering to debug other students programs, but I ran into an issue... I'm not sure what I should charge, what is a reasonable fee given my level of skill and the need of the likely clientele. I basically set the price on that to $10 if I found the bug in less than 20 minutes(given that most of the people willing to pay for help are likely very new, I imagined the bugs would be pretty blatant. plus I enjoy hunting bugs so pricing wasn't a big deal), but I don't know how much I should charge for things like consistent debugging, or tutoring in CS/math, or building web scrapers, or building websites, or well anything. And other than looking at other people's post (which is not a good metric because you only know what they post, not what they get), I'm not sure how to find out how much to charge per job given that most information on people who fill these roles is on salary but not on the amount of jobs they handle in a given year. How do I go about finding out what I should charge?

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't know where to look for work outside of fiverr and freelancer. what places are good places to advertise either online or locally (because I imagine some mom&amp;pop shops need websites or want to automate aspects of their business). 

&amp;#x200B;

do you guys have any experience in this area?"

Hello,

 I'm programing since 2+ years, three months ago I switched from c++ (almost no chance for a job in my region) to c# (decent chance). I filled my git with a few projects, Dating site (my last project) is from a course but in my opinion its 1/5 stars course with many bugs and errors (every 1 h course is almost 1.5 h of debugging). It's bad BUT increasing my debugging and problem solving skills :). Now I'm looking for a first job as an intern or junior, for interns I didn't see many offers (almost zero or few in semi .net). I started sending my Resume but ATM(02.10) in my city are 4 jobs for juniors 20+ for mids and 10-15 for seniors.  Yesterday I also changed my resume from handmade in word to a generator to a lot better visual look. 

 My tech stack is now: .NET core, ASP.NET core, WinForms, WPF, Entity Framework core, NUnit, Angular 8, Bootstrap, some in TS but nothing complicated, standard html+css, SQL, T-SQL 

 What I can do now? I looked at offers and listed some tech I don't know, like: azure, aws, Nhiberante, docker, React / Redux. In general mostly cloud based things + front end. 

 I thought about web project like sorting algorithms, path finding, something to give HR's fun (if someone come to my GH)?  

 Maybe focus on my stack and increase skills waiting until someone takes me to interview and I get a job?  

Or learn cloud base things (but honestly, I don't have an idea how, only thing I can really train is ""container is on"", ""the container is off"") and try to be more flexible?  
Maybe, someone has something better to propose?   


 Also, I don't want this post look like ""crying"", I just a little bit  lost in this. Since three months, I'm programing +/- 6-8 h per day,  learning new things, increasing my knowledge, etc. But after this 3  months I fell even more overwhelmed than  on start. (on start basically, I knew C, and some of C++,  html+js+css+php -- after exams in school, and something from python).  And I know, I know, no one will decide for me but little  guidance or  idea will be mirlace for me.  

 PS if it's important in studying CS (second year now).

In this little time (1 year and half) they put me to maintain a management software for and accounting firm and develop another one for a small building company. The first one is written and documented very badly by the devs that made it, the second one that I've created using PHP old style and no frameworks (just like school taught me, now I'm trying to improve by learning design patterns and Laravel by myself).

But here's the problem: after these two experiences, the only thing that I've dealt with is editing Bootstrap templates, some SEO (audit with SEMrush, finding keywords, little WordPress fixes) and a little social marketing on FB and IG. I'm not an web designer and I really don't know shit about SEO nor social marketing (just the very basic things that I look up on search engines, to make something up that works for them).

Should I put this experience in my CV if I'm looking for an internship in software development? How can I do it? What kind of title can I use? Junior Developer?  Geeky guy who knows how to use Google?

So I figured, why not make a Python app?

If I follow along with a Udemy or YouTube tutorial, is it still OK to put that on my GitHub, or do I need to make something entirely original? 

Also, anyone know any good 'python app for beginners' sorts of (preferably YT) tutorials I could watch? I have an extremely basic knowledge of Python (bit rusty on dictionaries and probably classes tbh).

After graduating in May, I had poor prospects. I had no internships and no compelling projects on my resume. The one thing going for me was that my GPA was pretty good (3.6). Nobody was replying to my applications. So instead of wallowing in self-pity and despair, I decided on a course of action. I knew that I needed a good project to talk about in order to get more interest in my resume, so I bought some Udemy courses and got to work.  From everything I learned, I was able to build an interesting side project that I could add to my resume and talk about in interviews... but still nobody was replying to my applications.

Finally, at the beginning of this month, I  received a reply from a company for a Software Developer position. It was the FIRST time a company reached out to me about a developer position. Fast forward a few weeks and several interviews later, and I received an offer.

I have no professional experience but I am looking to a secure an internship for my last semester (January to May 2020). 

I would like advice from people who have done something similar to these options (ranked from most preferable to least):

1. Start looking for a job soon and hope that they would sponsor me, even though I haven't yet graduated and don't have any relevant work experience as of now. This seems highly unlikely but a man can dream. 

2. Apply for a skill shortages visa. If I do well on the English test, I should have enough points to be nominated (I think). But it's very expensive (I think close to $3000 AUD) and I cannot afford it currently. I would have to work for a year in the US for the money and more points, which I'm willing to do, but would not prefer. If I do get this visa, would it be easy for me to find work?

3. Working Holiday Visa. This is my least preferred, but I would do it if I have no choice. I have read that I can go there on a working holiday visa, find an internship, and hope that they like me enough to sponsor me to work for them. I'm a pretty good and dependable worker, so it shouldn't be difficult to get them to like me, but I don't know if they'll like me enough to sponsor me."

I enrolled in a CS program because my parents forced me to do it. As a result, I wasn't very motivated and my grades deteriorated like crazy in the first 2 years. My cGPA was around 2.0/4.0 at the time. There were a few students in my class that would constantly tease me about my poor performance in CS courses, as well as other things about me such as the clothes I wore, and me getting rejected by the girls I pursued. I considered this bullying and I developed strong feeling of hatred towards them. I promised to myself that I would work hard, get into prestigious companies and prove to them that I'm worthy. It was pretty toxic. I held grudges against them for over 3 years and worked really hard to get better at coding (Leetcode, CTCI, EPI, etc.) 

I worked at a start-up for my first internship, then I got into Oracle for my 2nd internship and then Facebook for my final internship. Some of the bullies interned at Big N's too while others interned at smaller, less known companies. I feel like my extrinsic motivation for working hard is solely based on me trying to prove to those bullies and feel better about myself. I wasn't too keen on salary either. I'm starting to enjoy CS more and more now, but I'm still really depressed and feel a sense of hatred every time I reflect on the stuff they said to me a few years ago.

So I could enter any university in the country. And in the summer when I was deciding the university, many of people I know because of olympiads chose university A(let’s call it like this). So on the wave of this “hype” I chose university A too(yeah, I know, i’m a fool).

But the main problem is that the university A is mainly focused on data science, machine learning, etc. And in that this university is the best in my country. In summer I thought those ML things were good for me, but now I don’t know really.

Only classic software engineering courses I will have are C++, Python, Algorithms and Data Structures, Architecture of Computers and Operational Systems, Databases Theory. And I won’t have something like Mobile Development, because education in our country isn’t very flexible, you can change at max maybe 10% of your courses.

Question: Is it enough for software engineering? Will it really affect me if I will want to become software engineer or like to get SWE internship? Should I change university to one that has  software engineering plus some ML courses? Or It’s better to take maybe online courses I want? Do they count as much as university courses in the eyes of different tech companies, when you write them in your resume?

I used SimpleTax to generate the returns for the tax years of 2012 - 2016 (inclusive). Over these years, it looks like I would have collected around **$4,000 in tax refunds from the CRA** (bolded for easier future reference).

In 2017 I got a high paying internship in the US that seemed to have burned through all my built up tuition/education credits, and I **owed the CRA around $250 for the 2017 tax year**. This does not account for the refunds mentioned above.

In 2018, I was fortunate enough to get another high paying internship in the US. I didn't understand how tuition credits worked, and had hoped that I would have enough left to offset the taxes I owed the CRA. I just found out that I'd already burnt through the tax credits the earlier year, so now SimpleTax says that **I owe the CRA just over $8,000 for the 2018 tax year** (which I think excludes any outstanding refunds due to me, or payments that I owe the CRA from other years).

What I want to know is how I should proceed with filing my returns. I would like to file them as soon as possible (without going to H&amp;R Block or something).

* I need to paper file the 2012 - 2014 returns (NETFILE restricts me from filing returns from before 2015). Can I put the returns for those three years in a single package and mail them to the CRA?
* If so, would I be fine with filing all seven of my returns (2012 - 2018) in a single package (NETFILE returns would probably get processed before paper returns, and if the CRA receives my 2015 return before my 2012 - 2014 returns, they might get further confused)?
* When I use SimpleTax, I get asked at each year's forms whether the return I'm filing is my first filed return. The 2012 return would definitely be my first return, but if I'm filing all seven returns at once, do I indicate that each of the 2013 - 2018 returns is also my first return?

For the years 2012 - 2016, I expect to receive Ontario Trillium Benefits. This is in addition to the $4,000 refunds I mentioned earlier. I can't find calculators to estimate how much OTB I might receive for other years, but in 2014 I would have received around $700. I'm assuming I'll get around the same amount for each of the years from 2013 - 2016 (inclusive), totalling to just over **$2,500 in OTB refunds**.

I don't think SimpleTax subtracts unclaimed refunds (please correct me if I'm mistaken), so I believe that after the $2,500 OTB refunds and the $4,000 of other refunds, that I would have around $6,500 in refunds from 2012 - 2016 to offset my dues to the CRA for the 2017 - 2018 tax years.

* I would only have owed the CRA $250 in 2017. If the CRA owed me $6,500 from the previous years, would I be penalized for the 2017 tax year?
* As of the 2018 tax year, I would have the $8,000 due to the CRA for the 2018 tax year, $250 due to the CRA from the 2017 tax year, and around $6,500 owed to me for previous refunds. Will the CRA penalize me on the $8,000 + $250? Or would I only be penalized for the $8,000 + $250 - $6,500 = $1,750?
* If I proceed to send all seven returns in a single package, do I pay the CRA $8,250 (plus penalties/interest) upfront when I file my returns? Or can I pay the $1,750 (+ fees/interests)?

Sorry for the wall of text. If this isn't the right place to ask these questions, I'll go about finding an accountant for help.

Thanks!"

I am a senior now and am applying this fall, so I want you guys to chance me and let me know if there is anything I can do to increase my chances of getting into the HC.

My intended major is CS @ SAS, but am also looking at double majors with CS through RBS and SEBS.

Stats :

Asian Male, Big, competitive public school from Central Jersey so am in-state.

SAT - 1540 (770/770/19), only taken once. Got a 740 on Bio-M. Taking Chem and Math II subject tests this week and expecting close to 800.

GPA - 3.7 Weighted and 3.4 Unweighted which is pretty low for HC.

PSAT - 1500. I am a National Merit Semifinalist.

I took 10 AP tests so far and am taking 4 more this year. I only took five of these APs in school; I self-studied for the rest. (five 5s, two 4s, and three 3s.). I will have around 50 college credits just from AP tests by the time I start college.

ECs - Summer Research Internship at a Medical School. Helped produce data about cell bio/ neuroscience. My prof. is working on publishing a paper.

Currently at a part-time internship in computer science for the next 3-6 months.

Also part of NJ Science League, Math Honor Society.

So basically, I’m a Junior in college and I’ve been dating my girlfriend over distance (an hour drive, but we are both students so we only see eachother on the weekends) for two years. I really do enjoy her company and I see us making a good long-term pairing, but when we are apart she has extreme separation anxiety which leads to her having breakdowns over the phone and being very cold at times. Her bad moods can really ruin my days sometimes, but when we are happy I’m ecstatic.

Im having a hard time balancing the work, school, friends, and relationship balance and I’m only starting to realize how much of a drain her separation anxiety has on my emotions and time. 

I care a lot about her so I’m always there for her, but at what point am I just sitting there being an emotional trash can for her? My friends see me as “mr. pussy whipped” and I barely have time to work on things like my resume and internships.

Any advice?

Thank you"

My current GPA is a 2.98, and I’m trying to get it just above a 3 by the end of the semester. First off, I’m afraid I won’t be successful in that endeavor (classes aren’t terribly difficult but you never know). Secondly, I’ve been applying to jobs left and right and I honestly don’t know if my current GPA (.02 away from a 3) is torpedoing my applications. My first ever coding interview I bombed but there’s other fish in the indeed pages. I just recently took IBM’s coding test and that went... ok but idk if they were expecting it to be perfect. Either way I’ve become extremely concerned about my GPA and have been beating myself up for not trying just a little harder. 

So I guess my question is how much should I stress? Am I in a tight spot? I’m not trying to work for a major company right away but in 15 or so years I hope to work at SpaceX or a similar company. 

Furthermore, I have some projects on my resume (major school assignments that I felt were complex enough to put on there) but not a lot (4). I’ve also never held an internship. 

I’m honestly considering trying to get into grad school to 1) get better prospects and 2) get a second chance at a good GPA where I’ll take it more seriously. Is that a good idea or should I just work straight away? I’m fairly confident that with proper effort I can do well on the GRE. Tbh I’m at a real crossroads between grad school (if I can get in) for better prospects or sticking with my bachelors."

I'm a senior in high school, and my school is pretty shitty (as most high schools are). Along with that, most people are shitty. Junior year, my friend group was a close circle of me and 2 other girls (me, L, and T). T and I had been friends longer than we had each been friends with L for. L had some shit going on at home and in her personal life. She fell into a pretty dark place and me and T couldn't really get to her. This other girl, S (I had my reservations about her initially but we're chill now) was the only one able to cheer her up and get her going again. So me and T thought, oh that's good, and we all started hanging out again. Dynamic was pretty odd most of the time; T would shit talk S to me, L would shit talk T to me, S would shit talk L to me and so on. I ended up getting kinda close to S because we shared a similar mindset but still, kinda wondered who was shit-talking me, yanno. I had more important stuff going on that time of my life so I didn't pay that much attention to it. S and T both ended up graduating early bc they didn't like our school and started community college instead. By the time the school year was over, S and L had stopped being friends over some guy drama and other fucked up shit. T went on vacation and I started a summer that was pretty busy with classes and an internship, etc. I talked to S at another friend's birthday party later that summer and everything was fine but she seemed superficial like she used to back before I actually became friends with her.

So that is the history part. Moving on to this year...

L and I haven't talked at all since S and her fell out. She basically cut herself off from everyone and is basically going rouge. Beginning of school year was alright, trying to figure out who I should hang out with instead. I have really bad social anxiety so in short, this shit has not been good for me. Although I have other friends, none of them have really welcomed me to sit with them at lunch, etc, or even hang other than like one person (F), who isn't always sitting there at lunch and its just kind of unreliable. I've ended up just kind of going to the library and being alone in there, but my appetite is always changing and weird bc of some health problems so sometimes I just HAVE to get food. I ended up eating at a table with F's friends (not really with; they were kind of just there, and F wasn't, and they moved away from me when I sat down) one time, and then in a bathroom stall. I really try to avoid having to get food but sometimes I really can't. This really triggers the hell out of my social anxiety so it is really emotionally draining for me. I feel really salty that my friends just decided to up and leave me, basically.

Other than that, here is actual shit-storm storytime.

T and I were hanging out at the mall one weekend. Her parents are super protective but especially hate me (didn't find out why until recently; she told them I hit my dab pen in her bathroom even though I didn't, just had it on me). She can't lie to her parents for shit. She has ADHD and some other anxiety disorders that were really taking a toll on her. I suggested CBD for it (I take CBD and it helps me). There were some legal issues to it that kind of left my brain when I was telling her about it and ended up giving her a pill. Later that night, her dad calls my parents saying I gave her prescription medication and my parents, although knowing it was just CBD got really mad at me for giving it to her when I wasn't supposed to. I can't really handle my parents being mad at me, and basically my whole life I've finessed all the shit I'm not supposed to do, so it really upset me. My parents were apologizing to her shit stick of a father (who is hella abusive and just dumb as hell in other ways) for giving her that pill. I was mad and didn't talk to her for a long ass time after that. Then I was like alright, whatever and I texted her and she apologized, etc.

Since then, her dad has been hella problematic about me hanging out with her. Even though I never peer-pressure her into anything, was probably the only friend of hers who does well academically and actually was stable (compared to her other friends who are complete messes), he doesn't like me (which is just really hypocritical at this point considering the kind of person he is). So I see her hanging out with so many other people on snapchat and stuff, she doesn't even bother talking to me a lot and I just always feel like that one friend who has to chase people to hang out or talk, etc. She bailed on me for homecoming, so now I'm not going. Her dad wouldn't even let her be my guest for homecoming and she was going to go as someone else's guest which just pisses me off. I don't know what to do because even though I have social anxiety I'm pretty extroverted and I need to spend time with people and things like that. I just feel really isolated and it's getting to me. I want to be able to actually enjoy my senior year but its getting hard. Every friendship I have, even if we're (best friends) no one puts in a similar amount of effort into the friendship and is always just chasing short fun moments with other people even if they're crappy.

TLDR; my ""best"" friend's dad hates me and doesn't let her hang with me, I lost all my other friends and IDK what to do."

I will start my final semester from January 2020 and I will graduate around May 2020. I want to spend my final semester in a foreign university doing an internship (maybe under a professor) or as an exchange student. 

So I was searching for Spring 2020 opportunities at foreign universities that start in January 2020 and would span between 3-6 months. I'm interested in Deep Learning (DL) and Computer Vision (CV) areas. It would be awesome if the university has a good reputation for research/industry projects in DL and CV (*CMU, University of Michigan, Cornell, Berkeley, Columbia University, University of Washington, Georgia Tech, UC San Diego, University of Massachusetts Amherst, John Hopkins University, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, Penn State University, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, California Institute of Technology, University of Wisconsin Madison* and other biggies). 

Can someone share a list of such popular programs? Or please share the programs you know below.

PS: If there are internship opportunities, I can finish my final semester studies by this December itself (we have a fast track course for this purpose in my uni). If there are student exchange opportunities, I can continue normally and transfer my credits from host uni to my uni."

Hi, I recently (\~3 months) graduated  from a prestigious university with a decent GPA( 3.4) , and I am in Asia . Currently working at IBM as a Software Engineer with a Data Sciences team. I took this job when I was having some psychological issues at the time which did not allow me to focus on my career .I took the decision to take this job so that I have some time to focus on my healing, and now my therapist asked me to evaluate my career and my satisfaction with it , and that’s when I realized that I do not want to continue working in the same role here, and want to pursue a Masters in CS .

I do not have research experience under a professor at my college, but I have done research (NLP) projects at one of my internship and done a lot of research courses at my college. I had a decent GRE score so no worries for that, but I want some academia recommendations for entry into a Masters or a PhD program, so I want some research experience under my belt .

I am looking for advice regarding my next step, whether I should apply immediately for a program , or any other ideas or suggestions that the community has .

Some background first: Junior in Bachelors (21 years old) IT major data science concentration
I have been recently looking for an internship over the next summer and have been asked a rather difficult question, to which I genuinely feel companies don’t like my response. 
I started a business 5 years ago( which I still run remotely, and have slowly built in systems and put people in place so I no longer need to be involved ) and while I am passionate about it, I no longer need to be involved with it all the time. I am looking for an internship, but because of this often I get asked: “ Why do you want to leave your company and join us?”
My answer is simple, I want to do cool things and grow as a person and gain more knowledge and connections. ( of course I word it a bit more sophisticated than cool things). Im even willing to leave my business entirely in the capable hands of my managers and family to pursue these opportunities, but  companies are very apprehensive about it, it seems. 
I was looking for some advice on how to perhaps really seal the deal as a candidate that is passionate and wants to stay with and work with the company for the summer and years to come. 
Any advice is welcome thanks!

Many of the posts I see on r/programming and r/cscareerquestions are from people who go to ""big"" or ""prestigious"" schools, although obviously people can be successful in this career choice from all walks of life.

I am currently in my second year of community college, and am getting my CS associate in Spring of 2020. I will then be transferring to a medium sized 4 year university, not Ivy League but not a crappy school, either (apparently their computer science program is top 5 in my state of NJ for a few sites I've checked), and I am choosing now between minoring in Mathematics or getting a concentration in either Software Engineering or Data Science. The school isn't my first choice, but they're what I can afford and all of my credits pertinent to my major are guaranteed to transfer based on their agreements with my school, so they're about my only option. I have been told that for the tri-state area, name recognition for schools aren't that important, but for moving out to the West Coast or to the Midwest like Austin, Denver, etc, it is more important.

So far, to separate myself from the crowd, I have maintained a solid GPA (3.4, not great by STEM standards but decent enough) and am currently working on a UGR project. I also am looking at internships for Summer 2020 and working on my resume and sending out applications (as a side note, if anyone has any tips for building a resume as an undergrad, I would really appreciate it). I also attend networking events, but I'm pretty shy. I've been trying to break out of my bubble more, I even made a LinkedIn and a GitHub although I'm not quite sure what to do with either of them.

So my question to you all is this: for those of us who goofed off too much in high school or just never had the means to go to a large school, are we screwed? What can we do to get our names out there in what is possibly the most competitive field of our generation? 

I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read through this, any feedback will be a huge help not only to me but anyone who comes from a similar background and has wanted answers to a question like this. Thank you in advance for your help and time :-)."

I  graduated in 2018 with a B.S. in CS from Vanderbilt. I basically  started and completed my major in two years so I only had one  internship, and it was at a small, local firm doing CRUD stuff. My only  project that I could put on my portfolio is an incomplete mod for a  Source game.

After I graduated, I  worked as an account executive (sales) for a cybersecurity company that a  relative co-owns. It's a unicorn, well known in our niche and the tech  scene of our city but outside that, not really.

I  now want to switch careers. I'm thinking of quitting my job, hunkering  down, and studying 24/7 until around April of next year (will have  freelance job during this period but I don't really need to work  anyways, I've saved enough). I'm planning on having a project complete  by then, so I start sending out applications April and hopefully by  September I have a job.

How hard  will it be to get my foot in the door, i.e. invited for on-site  interviews? Could a coding boot camp help (preferably not because that  would be nearly a third my entire savings) even though I already have a  CS degree?

I'm really good at interviews if I really want the job."

**ECs**

My primary extracurricular is marching band, specifically as a member of the drumline. I joined our school's Indoor Percussion Ensemble my freshman year, which is essentially a sub-entity of the marching band with a season that starts after marching band ends. I joined the marching band the following year and continued both that and the Indoor percussion ensemble for every year following. My Junior year I became the tenorline section leader and my senior year, I became the drumline section leader.

During my sophomore and junior Summers, I worked as a Junior IT intern for my school district and helped to set up hardware and prepare classrooms and laptops for the beginning of the school year.

I also volunteer at a local fire station which helps fulfill my NHS service hours requirement.

**Other Accomplishments and Enrichment**

The Summer of 2017, I was in Johns Hopkins' CTY Program for Computer Science (Java).

Learned more about Java programming from my neighbor (A computer science professor at a university).

I contributed to a research project with my neighbor and helped prepare data to train a machine learning model that could identify arthritis from MRI scans.

*Extra background info for each college in case it's helpful:*

Cornell ED Acceptance Rate is \~24%. Roughly 15% of the school is Asian. SAT Subject Tests for Arts and Science is written as ""not required.""

Carnegie Mellon ED Acceptance Rate is \~26%. Roughly 29% of the school is Asian. SAT Subject Test recommendations for the school of computer science is a math subject test and either physics, chemistry, or biology (Which I do not have). Carnegie Mellon is the only university of the three that requires me to send all scores, so I don't know if my low U.S. History score will be a detriment when they're considering for computer science.

Johns Hopkins ED Acceptance Rate is \~31% Roughly 31% of the school is Asian. SAT Subject Tests are optional.

**Edit**: New Question, Between Carnegie and Cornell, which one is the most difficult to get into for CS and are my chances high enough for it to be worth the ED or would it probably be a waste if I ED to CMU or Cornell (Would it just be better to ED to JHU)?

dcv4ie,2,2019-10-03,Significantly higher starting salary mistake?,BBoyPen,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dcv4ie/significantly_higher_starting_salary_mistake/,"So I just got a job offer for 90,000 dollars per year even though I was really expecting like 60,000 dollars. I always heard the typical entry level offer was 75,000 dollars and those are the people who work on the main business line. However, I expressly told human resources that I was not interested at all in working the main business line and that I was only interested in facilities engineering (like waste side and emissions or compliance).

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'm really confused why I would get this much and should I say something at the risk of sacrificing that much money. I actually don't know how much I'm worth as an employee: I really only have about a year of engineering experience and a master's degree. The only other factor I can think of is the work I did as an intern last summer, where I did computer stuff (website and automating spreadsheets) in addition to normal engineer tasks and got the highest intern score possible in most categories (adaptability, customer service, attitude)."

Just started an internship,latin_beuty,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/dcvkuy/whats_the_appropriate_time_to_leave_the_office/,"I just started an internship at a big international company. It’s a requirement from my school in order to graduate, in total it’s 3 months and not payed. 

I’ve noticed that the company culture here is to work long hours. People arrive around 8-8.30am and leave well passed 6pm. However the company itself seems pretty relaxed, very casual dress code and overall atmosphere. 

When I did the interview, the woman that would become my manager said that I should work from 9-6pm, but every time it’s 6pm, in ready to go but nobody else really leaves. I want to make a good impression and do a good job, but I do feel that 9hrs a day is more than enough, specially since I’m not getting payed. This is my first week and first time being at an office job. So far they haven’t assigned me that much to do, mostly reading ppts and doing some translations. 

Is it ok that I leave at 6? She said that was fine but I feel weird leaving ‘early’ and don’t want them to think I’m not putting enough effort. Maybe just overanalysing things but I’m curious for input. 

Thank you!"

dcvy2a,25,2019-10-03,Lawsuit Against Hospital after Belongings Were Given Away,throwawayb567e,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dcvy2a/lawsuit_against_hospital_after_belongings_were/,"I've posted on another account regarding this situation, but am taking a new approach.

For background, I was living in Chicago this summer for an internship (I'm a college student). I was hospitalized for one night, and upon entrance, they took my belongings (phone, wallet, keys, clothes), put them in a bag, and locked them in a cabinet. When I was being discharged, I was informed that the security guards gave away my belongings to the wrong patient, who had the same initials as me. I had no phone, wallet, car or apartment keys, and the hospital gave me clothes from the lost and found so I could get on my way.

I had no idea how to get home as I was in a city that was foreign land to me. The security department asked for monetary value of everything I lost and assured me that I would be reimbursed soon. The hospital gave me a bus card and said it was good for a one way trip. After eventually finding my way home and climbing through my bedroom window (as I had no keys), I immediately logged onto my laptop and canceled all my cards. $1800 was spent on my debit card in 12 hours, while balances on my credit cards were increased by about $2000. I immediately filed a police report at the nearby station, and one of the officers drove me back to the hospital so I could get these fraudulent charges added to my reimbursement.

At the hospital, I spoke with security and informed them of these charges. They again assured me I would be reimbursed, and gave me a contact for patient relations for me to call the next day. I asked one of the security guards to call my phone, which he did, and the patient who received my belongings answered. He gave us a location on Michigan Avenue to meet him at, and when we arrived, he had dropped off my phone and keys, but no wallet.

After an entire summer of constantly calling patient relations, the hospital security department, and my bank, I have received only $322 in reimbursement from the hospital for the lost clothing, and this took three months to be processed. This took so long to process because they received the money from the security agency. This did not include the cash in my wallet, the gift cards I had, the cost of getting a new license, or any reimbursement for fraudulent charges. While the credit card companies credited me for the charges, my bank, a local national one, refused to reimburse me as these charges were ""pinned."" I  stored my PIN in my phone which was given away, so the purchases seemed like they were made by me. I've reported the bank to the OCC and spoken with the president of the bank, and both organizations have come to an agreement that I will not be getting my money back, despite the fact these charges were made while I was hospitalized.

I have decided I will be suing the hospital for these charges and damages I incurred over the summer. I am a student and cannot afford a lawyer, but currently this is what I see as fair claims to sue for:

$800 for lost work after my visit. I didn't have any money or a drivers license and had no way of driving to work in the suburbs for an entire week.

$1800 for charges on my debit card which were not authorized by me, and were made as a result of the negligence of the hospital staff and violation of protocol.

$200 for failing to reimburse me for the cash and gift cards in my wallet.

$150 for lost work the week after my three month lease ended. I came into the hospital for a day and spoke to patient relations and asked if there was any way they could provide reimbursement after three months of nothing. I had no where to stay and spent a week with a fellow intern before he left for college. He returned to college and I was going to live in my car if I couldn't get reimbursement to afford a hotel or cheap air bnb for the next two weeks of work.

$800 again for lost work. I drove home after a week of living in my car because the hospital would not provide me reimbursement quick enough. I missed out on the last week of my internship because I didn't want to spend another week sleeping in my car with all my belongings packed inside.

$500 for flight and court filing fees. I assume I will be flying to Chicago after the lawsuit is filed for the court case.

Additional things to note:My credit score has gone down 150 points since this has happened. Investigations on fraudulent charges, a loss of $2000, and inability to make payments on cards are all results of this event.

My summer was basically ruined. I was extremely depressed and hardly left my room. I had to sell my tickets to Lollapalooza to buy food and pay bills. I was paying to live in the city, and paying for my apartment back home, and I needed money to save for the semester so I had a place to live and this severely affected my budget.

Does this seem like a reasonable request from the hospital, or should I include more? And should I call the hospital/security department first before filing a lawsuit? What kind of evidence should I need? (I have police reports, reports from my bank, the OCC, and the ending of my lease). And would it be worth it to contact an attorney if I cannot afford it? Should I also mention contacting media outlets?"

I want to make sure that it reaches as many people as possible, hence the repost. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

(For those of you considering applying to colleges in the US)

Please note that my views about this might be different than advice you hear from other sites or even other posters on this subreddit. My philosophy is that it’s good to hear different thoughts and ideas, and then you can make decisions about what works best for you.

**ADMISSIONS JOURNEY TIMELINE**

**JUNIOR SUMMER** ☀️

GET INVOLVED WITH STUFF:

Yourself (exercise healthy habits , personal hobbies and projects, READ real books, practice mindfulness and meditation). Your family (help with sibs, grocery shopping, clean up around the house, take care of dinner one night a week). Your community (community service—can be totally individual projects and/or organized group projects).

GET A SUMMER JOB.

Just an old fashioned summer job. This will give you all sorts of skills you won’t gain by volunteering and also demonstrate leadership, diligence, a willingness to step outside your comfort zone, and determination.

PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE PSAT.

You take it in October and it helps you qualify for national merit if you score high enough.

PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE ACT and SAT. Take a couple of practice tests and see which one feels better to you and which one you score higher on. Then move forward with that one. Consider taking one in December of junior year. Definitely take one in early spring semester. It’s nice to have testing completed before you start senior year.

TAKE SAT SUBJECT TESTS especially if you are considering applying to highly selective schools. Take one or two in August that fit with classes you’ve just studied.

ENJOY YOUR SUMMER. This is super important. You need to take time to recharge your batteries. That’s part of being Involved with yourself. Be sure to just take some time completely off from school and college admissions stuff.

START YOUR RESUME. If you haven’t already, make a list of all your activities you’ve been involved in since freshman year. Keep in mind that basically anything you do outside of class time, homework, and test prep counts as an EC, so that includes old fashioned summer or part time jobs, home and family responsibilities, elderly and child care, personal projects and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to the more traditional research, internships, and in and out of school clubs and sports. If you use coalition app, you can start on your locker. Keep this list updated throughout the next two years.

**JUNIOR FALL**🍁

Pretty much all of the summer stuff applies still. 😁

Add to that:

TAKE THE HARDEST COURSE LOAD YOU CAN. Colleges say that your course rigor is more important than your grades and test scores. Remember they evaluate you in the context of your school. So don’t worry about classes that aren’t offered.

GET TO KNOW YOUR TEACHERS. Visit them at office hours. You will be asking them for teacher recommendations later.

KEEP UP YOUR GRADES.

READ 📚READ 📚READ.

Reading will improve your test scores and your essay writing.

Stay involved with everything I listed for summer and also get involved with your school. Join a club or two that interests you. Create a club if you don’t see one that interests you. Or just do individual activities that add to your school environment.

Keep prepping and practicing for ACT and SAT. Start testing in the late fall or early spring.

**JUNIOR SPRING**🌸

LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION Ask two or three teachers who know you best to write your letters. I encourage you to ask junior year teachers who teach you in core academic subjects.

COLLEGE VISITS Start visiting colleges if you can. Look around in your city or town.

Visit large schools and small schools. It doesn’t matter if it’s a college you think you would consider or not. Just go to start thinking about what feels right to you. Just hang out on campus. You don’t have to do a tour or info session if you’re not ready for that yet. Then, if you can go on College Visits for schools you might find interesting, do so. Be sure at this point to sign in and go on the tour and info session, but also just wander around. Sit on a bench and eavesdrop on conversations. Do you like what you hear? Talk to students. Ask them what they’d like to change about their school. Or what they do on a Wednesday night? Don’t be shy. They remember what it was like to be a prospie and even if they are annoyed by your questions, who cares? They don’t know you and won’t remember you. Just move on and find a kinder person. Check out the dining hall and the gym. Look for the area near campus where kids hang out if there is one.

Lots of kids try to go on spring break trips to visit colleges if it’s affordable. If you can’t afford to visit out of your area, at the very least check out the colleges near you to get the feel for the kind of vibe that works for you.

COLLEGE LIST Start thinking about what you want in a college and compile a big ole list. It’s ok to have a ton of schools on this initial list. As you explore yourself and the colleges more as you go through the admissions journey, you will naturally begin to filter schools out.

COLLEGE FIT

*Financial*: will you need full financial aid? Will you qualify? Will you qualify for any aid? Do you need full merit aid? These are important considerations. You and your parents need to spend some time thinking about this and going through net price calculators on various college websites.

*Geographic*: what areas of the country appeal to you? Open your mind here, too. I can’t tell you how many kids say no Deep South or Midwest without really thinking about it, and in doing so, they are depriving themselves of some amazing options and merit aid. Also, do you want urban? Do you want rural? Do you want an enclosed campus or one that’s incorporated into the cityscape? Do you want beaches? Mountains? Corn fields? Do you wanna get out of your comfort zone here or stay with the familiar?

*Weather*☔️☃️☀️: also important. If you really really hate the cold, then moving to Boston or Chicago or Maine might not appeal to you. If you have to have four seasons, then the Midwest or the northeast might have good options.

*School Culture and Vibe* : are you looking for that stereotypical American big college experience with the big game on the weekends? Or are you looking for the quirky school ? Or something that has it all?

*School Size*: do you want a big ole state school with loads of options? Or are you looking for something smaller or even mid sized? Do you want discussion based classes where you can develop strong relationships with your professors or are do you want to be in big lectures where you can take notes or go to sleep?

*Potential Major*: if you don’t have one, don’t worry. You have plenty of time to figure that out and it actually frees you up a bit. If you do think you know, research some schools that might be strong in your major. Maybe touch base with a professor or two.

*Your Stats*: Where do your grades and test scores fit in? Are they right there in the middle? I like my students to be well above the 50% for most of the colleges they are applying to.

This requires putting a lot of thought into what you want out of your experience and about who you are and who you want to be. It doesn’t require pulling out USNWR and listing the top twenty schools.

NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE 😶 Make a No College-Talk Zone in your house. At my house it was our dining room table. This will help you and your parents keep your sanity during the next year.

NEW COLLEGE EMAIL ADDRESS Make a new college only email address to use for college applications and communications. Make it appropriate! This is important because then all your info from colleges wont get mixed up in your other emails, and I encourage you to allow your parents to have access to it if you feel comfortable with it. Be sure to check your junk, trash, and spam inboxes so you don't miss important info!

CHECK IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR.  
They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way.

COLLEGE INFO SESSIONS If a college comes to your town or close to your town or your school, go listen. Make sure you sign up and sign in.

COLLEGE FAIRS go to them! Talk. Ask questions. Learn.

**SENIOR SUMMER**

All the same stuff as Junior Summer. (So, rising seniors, read the junior summer info).

Finish up testing. SAT, ACT and subject tests

SUMMER JOB

BE INVOLVED

RECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES

Take time to care for your mental health and your body. Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Breathe. Listen to books or podcasts. Hang out with friends.

WRITE.

Write like a motherf\*cker as one of my favorite writers, Cheryl Strayed says. Write about yourself. Don’t worry too much about the essays just yet. Just write. Everyday. Get used to your voice. Figure out who you are. Use themostdangerouswritingapp.com to force yourself to just get words on paper. This will help you get that Personal Statement ready to go by October 1.

THINK ABOUT AND PRACTICE WRITING THE PERSONAL ESSAY

Remember--no matter which prompt you choose or which kind of vehicle or conceit you use to relay your message, the topic is YOU. Just focus on teaching the admissions officers about who you are. Don’t worry about being unique; worry about who you are. Don’t worry about standing out; worry about sticking with the reader. You do that by creating connections and bonds. Those are created by opening yourself up and letting them inside. Let the reader know what’s happening inside you. They want to know what you think about, what you believe, and what you value. They don’t need to hear a whole lot more about what you’ve already told them in other areas of your application. Focus on More Expressing, Less Impressing. If you’ve read this far and you’re interested in some more materials for creating a less-stress Personal Statement, you can send an email to me at [dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com).

MAKE COMMON APP ACCOUNT

Start filling out the details like activities, family info, and educational background.

UPDATE YOUR RESUME

SIGN UP for information from any college you’re interested in —even if they’re already sending you stuff.

VISIT COLLEGES if you can.

START YOUR COLLEGE LIST: Start narrowing down your list—including a wide range of selectivities.

Make sure you have a SFSS (sure fire safety school)

This is one that guarantees you auto admission based on your stats, that is a financial fit for you, and in a place where you can see yourself. Don’t take this lightly. This is a very important school--maybe even your most important one.

KEEP IN TOUCH WITH COLLEGES

Sign up to ""request info"" from the colleges if you haven’t already. Also, I recommend that you follow the admissions offices on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for your colleges on your list or potential list. They often put out a lot of helpful information for what's happening in their offices. I suggest following Common App, too. Also, it’s ok to contact your regional college admissions officers or the general front desk with questions.

**SENIOR FALL** 🍂

All of the above....

Finish up any college visits especially for Early Decision possibilities.

COLLEGE LIST:

Begin to narrow your college list. Make sure you have one or two surefire safeties that you love and that will be good financial fits, and then a collection of matches/reaches.

COLLEGE SPREAADSHEET

Make a spreadsheet for all your colleges. Add application deadlines. Supplemental Essay topics--and look for overlap. Testing info. Contact info for your regional officer. (contact me for a blank version if you like)

EARLY ACTION Try to apply to as many schools by Early Action as are available. Make a calendar of deadlines and work through them one by one.

LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION

Check back in with your recommenders. Send them a reminder email and stop by if you can. Be sure to give them a big thank you! (Also give them a resume and ""cheat sheet"" if you haven't yet.)

YOUR HIGH SCHOOL GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

Check in with your guidance counselor or college counselor if you aren't in regular contact.

SAT/ACT/Subject Tests

Finish up any testing you have left to do.

ESSAYS

Start writing your essays. Focus first on your Personal Statement. Then categorize your supplemental essays by due dates. How many Why College Essays do you have? When's the first one due? Then, organize the Why Major Essays and the ExtraCurricular Essays. Think about whether you want/need to write an Additional Info essay. And then group the others. Try to get the Personal Statement done by October 1.

INTERVIEWS

Be sure to check your email (and trash and spam folders for interview invitations). Every school has a different method for signing up, so read the website carefully. Some you are automatically signed up. Others require you to sign up yourself. In most cases, they are optional and sometimes you might not be given the opportunity. Don’t worry (as long as you’ve checked your trash and junk mails). I do suggest that you do them though—even if they’re optional and you’re nervous. Lean in to your fear, admit it to them, tuck in your button shirt, comb your hair and wash your face, and go.

LOCI

If you are deferred Early Decision, be sure to write a LOCI (Letter of Continued Interest).

SENIOR SPRING 🌻

Finish up applications

SURE FIRE SAFETY SCHOOL🔥

Make sure you have a sure fire safety school. If you don't, look for good fits for you that are still accepting apps.

GRADES UP

Take time to care for your mental health and your body

Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside 🌳 and walk or run. Listen to music 🎧. Have dance parties in your room. Waiting for those acceptances can be brutal. Breathe. Just acknowledge that once those little baby applications have flown away from your computer, you no longer have control.

EMOTIONAL PLANNING

Plan for the worst 😢, but hope for the best. Acknowledge that many colleges you might be interested in are extremely selective, and even if they're not, they might be holistic. Don't get too connected to any college except for your surefire safety.

GRATITUDE🙏🏾

Think about what you are grateful for. What are the good things in your life? Try to make a mental list every day.

Enjoy these last few months of high school. Connect with friends and family.

Whew! I think I'm done! You can also find this post as a blog on my website: [http://admissionsmom.college/mindfulness/wait-what-do-i-do-when/](http://admissionsmom.college/mindfulness/wait-what-do-i-do-when/)

I do have both a trunkline and mile marker layer already, which has similar fields to what I listed above (Trunkline, control section, mile marker etc.) So without coordinate/location data, how do I visualize my lines from the Excel file without hand drawing (too many rows)? 

I think what I’ve gathered from browsing around is that I need to ‘join’ (?) the Excel table to my trunkline/milemkr table and visualize it that way? How do I get my Excel “into” ArcMap?

Also, how do I draw lines from a specified point to another specified point along the road line layer without hand drawing? (Say I have a state highway and want to show a line from mile 56 to mile 67 without hand drawing) 

Thanks for the help you can give me. I’m trying to learn GIS as much as I can and don’t have anyone immediately above me I can ask help from."

Now before you jump on the flaws in my job search process, I've done one other decent CS internship before, I've followed the advice of more successful friends in regards to my resumes and cvs etc, gone to the fairs, reached out to the recruiters and of course done the mass applications. My last internship search experience was the same. I thought having that first experience would give me a boost in my second round search, but no. Ultimately I think it comes down to the fact that given the quantity and quality of people entering this industry, I am just not good enough. My GPA isn't good enough, my technological skills aren't enough and my projects aren't enough. Each time I job hunt I feel like a hungry animal fighting for scraps of food with a million other hungry animals. At fairs recruiters literally sometimes yawn inattentively when I describe my portfolio probably because they've heard the same story hundreds of times, before telling me to go ahead and apply on their job posting which got over 300 applications in 3 days. I am aware there'll be many making comments like ""just try to stick out and do unique projects"", and they're right but it's far easier said than done and despite my best efforts I can't seem to stand out. I'm seriously questioning whether I'm cut out for this industry at this point and given how much of my degree I've already completed I don't know if I can turn back. CS is still great for the talented, but the bar is already very high and keeps getting higher by the day and I fear a dark future ahead for myself."

I wrote another post like two weeks ago asking if it is okay to look elsewhere if my current position isn't good for me. I'll give you my background: 24yo, Bachelor degree in electronic engineering, been working 4 months in this international yet very local automotive company as an electronic designer. I've also other small experiences while being a student in high school.

I'd like to be more into a sales role, which I think suits me more than designing stuff (which is really cool, don't get me wrong. It  just isn't for me). My colleagues are basically perfect and my boss is an enjoyable person. My HR manager in the other hand... isn't that great. Like, she lied several times to almost every guy in my office.

Now since I'm doing an internship, I could in theory leave when I want, but of course it wouldn't be great for my colleagues. I'm currently looking for other jobs and I've found out that companies are in need of people like me (next week I have 3 job interviews).

How should I put this to my boss and my HR manager? Should I talk with my boss first and then with HR?

I'm a software developer who graduated 5 years ago but my skills have stagnated, my confidence is low, and I'm in a small team where it's just an intern, myself, and a top top software developer.

I'd like to run a lunch and learn to gain skills in presentation and confidence, however, there is nothing I currently know that I feel confident or comfortable presenting.

I was wondering if there were any modern Java technologies or frameworks, that would be possible to learn in about a week or two, and then hold a \~30-60 minute lunch and learn session on? The process of learning it and presenting it would be very valuable, but I just don't know what I could pick that would fit that scope.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Sorry in advance for being very long winded.

I graduated from college with a BBA in Computer Information Systems in May. I graduated with a pretty good GPA (3.8), went to my career center at my college to work on my resume, and started applying around 5 applications a day from January all the way to my graduation date and ramped it up to around 8-10 a day afterwards.

I’ve been applying mainly to entry level analyst positions and help desk jobs. I’ve read help desk jobs are a good way to get yourself to a programming job a little further down the line (please correct me if I’m mistaken here).

It is now October and I’ve received very few replies, all of them being negative. I’m wondering if there’s anything specific I could add to my resume or tweak in my job search process to help me be a little bit more attractive to employers. Some more information on me to help anyone reading:

-	I’m in NYC
-	I’ve done an internship lasting about 6 months the semester prior mainly focusing on data entry and analysis using Excel, VBA, and SQL.
-	The internship wasn’t at a technology company but rather a financial company so I’m not used to working with the former’s workspace/workflow
-	I do include a recent personal project uploaded to Github on my resume that showcases knowledge of python, web scraping, and HTML on my resume
-	I’m mainly proficient in python 
-	I have worked with HTML and CSS in the past

Should I consider getting some certifications to make myself more attractive? Should I increase my presence on Github? Or should I hone the knowledge I already have and re-examine the jobs I’ve been looking at a bit more and aim much lower?

I’ve been getting a little bit desperate and depressed lately in regards to this and have been considering something like Revature to help me attain a job. After reading the posts regarding Revature here, I’m thinking against it and would like to instead reinvigorate my job search with some help. Any and all advice would be appreciated, thank you in advance."

To be honest, it's a good fit for me. Just, it seems a little odd to commit for 4 years. I'm a senior year student so, they're hiring me on part-time basis for now (until I graduate in '20)

Edit: They'll keep me as an intern for 3 months. Then a part-time member which will turn into full-time commitment after my graduation. Here's where the 4 year bond comes in.

dd7k7x,1,2019-10-04,My mental health is ruining my life,Throwaway2006200,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/dd7k7x/my_mental_health_is_ruining_my_life/,"I'm a 19 (M), I just started my second year of University and my life is in a shambles right now. I have always had low self esteem due to a rough childhood and bad parenting; I would spend the majority of my childhood playing video games with minimal social interactions, thus developing my social anxiety. 

My social life eventually started getting better as I turned 16, where I was in my last year of secondary school, I had just taken off my braces, and I started getting my haircut in the barbers. During this time, I had many close friends, I was doing excellent in school, I was also getting a lot of female attention and I started going out almost everyday with my friends . The truth is that although I was developing my social skills during that period, I would intentionally avoid engaging in any intimate relationships, using studies as an excuse, whereas in reality I was just scared of talking to girls. 


After this period, my life started going downhill. In the UK, after you finish secondary school, students get a 3 month holiday period before they start their A-levels. During this time, all my friends went on holiday's with their family, whilst I reverted to my old habits of staying indoors and playing video games. During these 3 months, what I would classify as one of the main reasons of my depression occurred. Hairloss. By the end of the Summer holiday my hairline had significantly receded, and to make matters even worse, my hair started balding aswell. I had lost all the confidence I had gained over the past year in no time. My hair was my defining feature, which made up for other shortcomings such as my height (5'3) and my facial features. 


I fell into a period of depression during my A levels, as my hair was continuously getting worse, in addition to this I had to deal with family issues (you can read my other post if you want) . Along with my friend group at the time who were incredibly bad influences, I would skip class, and my grades started declining. By some miracle, I managed to make the grades I needed to get into the Uni of my choice to do a Computer Science degree, however my life would only get worse. 

I made it through the whole first year of Uni without making any close friends. TLDR, I was very insecure about my looks, I did not mesh well with my first friend group, overheard them speaking about how awkward I was (which was true, I could not hold conversations and I also had this uncontrollable tremor which would occur whenever I was anxious). I stopped turning up to lectures and only attended labs. Again by some miracle, I passed first year with a 2:1.

During the summer holiday period, I got a job at a petrol station, which I was practically working full time (40-50 hour shifts). At first, I was an anxious mess, and many of my colleagues felt uncomfortable around me (I was quiet af and didn't know how to interact with people). However, as months went by I became a more social person, I made friends with most of my colleagues and customers. Despite this I could notice that both customers and colleagues would look down on me. 


During the last month, I decided to cut my hair short, as my hair had receded so much and became so thin, you could see the scalp. Since then there hasn't been a day where I've gone outside and not received either cold looks or people laughing at me. Over the past month there, have been numerous occasions where I would be restocking any shelves, customers would walk in and laugh in my face. Whenever I would serve tills I realised that 80% of people would make remarks on how I look. For instance, I realised that most women I serve would either make scoffing noises at me, give me funny looks or where straight up horrified by how I looked. Most men I served  would either have a smug grin, or straight up laugh at me. 


Fast forward to last week, my second year of Uni started. I've been feeling so shitty that I have straight up not attended Uni once. I would simply go to my local library, watch the lecture videos, and do the work there. However, even in the library people would make fun of me. Yesterday, a group of girls walked in and started laughing. As they sat down they started talking about how ugly I look in Bengali (I'm bengali btw), thinking that I wouldn't understand them. It has gone to a point where I don't enjoy living anymore (I don't feel suicidal dw), and I avoid going outside by any means possible. This has happened to me in the worst possible time, as I am in second year and I need to secure an internship for summer ASAP."
dd80de,144,2019-10-04,I've gotten to the point where I cant figure out what I actually do for a living anymore?,Caitlynnecole,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dd80de/ive_gotten_to_the_point_where_i_cant_figure_out/,"To help understand how I got to this point, and where my confusion lies: I'm 31F, and I have a trade certificate in Drafting, no degrees because I'm dyslexic (I do want to try again). I also have no experience outside of the company I work for. 

I started in a small company that has grown about eight years ago as an intern, working in the design department and call center.  Over the next few years, I became a drafting and sales assistant. I then focused solely on Drafting. I developed the drawing office around the companies needs. After about 3 years, I found myself in the position of drawing office manager, out of ease more than ability probably. I was allowed to hire a couple of intern draftsmen, and they became so capable that I started to have a crazy amount of free time. 

I started providing illustrations, and renders to our marketing department as they were looking for a freelancer to do this, I taught myself using freeware, without costing the company anything. The technical guides at the time were elementary, so I started creating documents and illustrating them to help sell our products more effectively. The CEO started using me for his own projects, and I started communicating with suppliers and assisting with developing products offshore. I stopped drafting entirely and had to hand over the drawing office to someone else.

After about 5 years in the company, I was promoted to a product manager, and given a specific line of products. The only other person assisting with this was one of the executive's very capable cousins. About 2 years ago, we hired an R&amp;D manager, who happened to be the sister of one of the Executives. We get on like a house on fire, and she had several years of corporate experience, a masters in her field and helped me polish up professionally. She has somehow become my unofficial manager, though none of the higher-ups wants to say it out loud. I'm happy with it, the entire department runs smoothly owing to her.

The problem lies in that we are under-resourced. It's just the cousin, manager and myself as well as a few strategically placed offshore colleagues.  They keep threatening to hire more people but never do. My manager started using me for product design and rapid prototyping owing to my history with drafting skills, adding to my workload. Then she tackled the technical documentation process, and I suddenly became the liaison between our department and marketing, developing these documents. Including outlining the content, writing, illustrating, researching, data collection and sorting. She edits and we have a back and forth over the document until its ready to send to marketing.

So now I'm managing and developing a product line. I'm designing products outside of that product-line, providing technical support and writing as discussed above, and after all that, my pay-slip actually says R&amp;D manager.  The only thing I don't do other than editing is manage budgets, which the CEO does himself.

So what am I? A Product Manager? R&amp;D manager? Or am I really a Product designer? Maybe a Technical writer and illustrator? By trade, I'm a Draftsman. Do they fall under some all encompassing job title. Do Product managers or R&amp;D managers usually do this stuff? 

A job title seems like such a small thing, but I want to go back to university, it is not going to happen with the workload. I also want to renegotiate my salary. Not because I necessarily want more money (which I do!), but because I if they keep getting the milk for free, why buy more cows?  I adore my job, but my current salary is along the lines of a mid-level draftsman, which doesn't reflect my (perceived) value to the company or based on my official job titles, regardless of the qualifications.  Can I even make comparisons given that this all is so dependent on the niche I've created for myself within the company? And the company has done so much for me as well but after 8 years, at what stage do I stop paying it forward to them and start focusing on myself without been ungrateful?  If I could just figure it out.

Thanks."

So, this all started happening two weeks ago. I started my college internship this week, on wednesday and Thursday. When I was informed of the actual days I was going to be doing, two weeks ago I realized I had a doctor's appointment and blood work scheduled for days I was going to be interning. So because I hate to miss stuff I went to the hospital to re-schedule this.

A few days later I got a call from the place I'm doing my internship telling me that the day before the start of the internship (this Tuesday) I needed to go there to get my access card. After I hung up I went to my phone to schedule it on google calendar and I saw that I had the blood work the same day I needed to go there so I called them back and asked to go a little bit later.

Fastfoward for this week, I got really sick on Monday, throwing up all over the place and I was kind of worried about the blood work that I had the next day because the results may not be very trust wordy since I was so sick that day. I couldn't eat our drink all night because I was throwing up so I went to bed early. I woke up in the middle of the night with a headache, hungry, thirsty and needing to pee. But because I had blood work in a few hours I could eat or drink (so I couldn't take a paracetamol for my headache) and I held my pee because I needed to pee in a cup first thing in the morning... I barely slept the rest of the night what didn't helped my headache.

My appointment was at 9:30am and I went early to see if they could fit me before that hour because I was so thirsty. I arrive at the hospital at 9am and as I am walking in I go to get my appointment paper and opened it to see ""changed to 8/10 at 9:30am""... I opened my google calendar and sure enough it was schedule for the 8th...

I don't know what happened when I look at the calendar before but my appointment it's only next week :(

I went to my car and eat a piece of bread and drank a bottle of water...

 TL;DR I thought I had blood work this Tuesday, almost didn't sleep because of that, only to realize when I was already in the hospital that the appointment is only next week"

I keep hearing from this subreddit and r/compsci that a strong understanding in DM/DS is essential to being a strong programmer. But no one really explains why it's important and exactly what is important (since DS is huge and different unis cover different topics).

At first, when I was learning sets, universal quantified statements, functions, recursion I was really motivated and it was fascinating to be able to break down logic as I could totally see myself using this way of thinking like a programmer. But now I'm at number theory and mathematical induction and my godawful professor has essentially taught us in a way that emphasizes memorizing formulas as we blaze through the material. Furthermore, I don't see how any of this has to do with programming/CS any longer and I'm finding it very very difficult to stay as motivated as I was in the beginning (this may perhaps be due to the fact that I was studying/going for class 60 hours a week at first due to the pace of my Uni and am burnt out). I still keep up with the classes and am able to answer 75% of assignment questions, but I've lost any motivation of mastering the material due to it being difficult, dry and seemingly pointless. This is especially problematic because I have no motivation to revisit these topics before exams. How do these proof techniques help me as a programmer? I keep hearing something along the lines of ""oh it helps you INDIRECTLY think like a programmer"" without specifying exactly how. To me, that's like someone telling a mathematician that they should take physics because it helps them indirectly think of math better; sure maybe a mathematician would benefit slightly from taking physics - but it seems like an incredibly inefficient way of strengthening their math.

If you have any insights as to why this is important to master, I would sincerely appreciate hearing them. I've heard people say it helps with understanding algorithms but again do so without expanding exactly WHAT helps with algorithms and data structures (so at least I can hone in on those aspects). And I've met programmers who landed internships at B4 companies via Algo whiteboard interviews who weren't good at DM/DS.

I enjoy all my programming modules so far and don't see myself taking any in the future that are extremely math heavy (eg Machine Learning). My maths background is good but far from stellar.

Long story short I couldn't find a job for months, not even a  basic help desk position. About 6 months ago I got my first IT job  working for an outsourced IT company (I believe that is the correct  term) that does pretty much does everything from head to toe. I  originally applied for an internship to get experience (to find a good  paying job elsewhere), but they ended up just making me an employee  because the hours were so odd. While working for this company and from  past IT experience, I concluded I want to be a system admin because I  didn't like networking all that much (honestly because it's harder).  What would be the best way to go about this? I was thinking MCSA Server  2012 and getting my CCNA before February. I feel like that combo would  make me marketable and give me a descent foundation.

My professor offered to pay me $12/hr and I could also apply for LSAMP (gives me a $900/semester for a year) starting spring semester. The research is in Computer Networking which I'm really interested in. With a co-op after commuting fees I'd make on average around 13/hr doing test engineering (basically QA) which I'm not so passionate about. I do already have a nice internship for the summer lined up and did research last summer as well. The pros of the co-op is having more industry experience under my belt and the fact that they have a tuition assistance program (although it seems restricted since I'd need to pay first and then they'd reimburse me so it's not like I'm getting a check). I don't really want to do something that would make me miserable (a lot of time commuting, lowered GPA, tuition assistance being as restricted as I thought). I currently have a 3.62 GPA and I don't want to ruin :P. Has anyone been conflicted on research vs co-op?

It makes sense because they want their interns to end up working full time for that company (interns are an ""investment"").

I reached out to a few companies recently at the job fair and they all seemed interested in me. I am okay with interning at the same company again, but I think I might have better opportunities with the other companies. 

One thing holding me back is pay, the other companies pay their interns a few dollars below the company I worked for (which may not seem like a lot but it's about a 20% difference). Is this something I could negotiate? The most I would ask for is for them to match it.


I also owe Uncle Sam some years after university because of military so the way I see it, I'm only saving my previous company money (since internships are their way of getting full time employees and I wouldn't be able to work for them until I choose to get out of the military, which might be 5 or 20+ years).

I've searched Infosys on this subreddit and they have a pretty horrible reputation but they offered me a ~55k salary with benefits which is honestly better than I expected (I was expecting 45 with my stats). 

Do you guys think that I will have a chance with a slightly better environment or would it be best to just start building experience with Infosys?

Throwaway because of known main account

For the first time as not a full-time student I am looking for a job and I’m having some trouble not being pushed into Junior roles for what seems to be the date on my degree?

My Freshman year in college I did lots of part time and freelance work which really helped me grow as a programmer. Following freshman year I did an internship that was pretty typical, an isolated project to learn some more skills. While looking back I didn’t learn much or come very far it gave me confidence to apply to more advanced internships/positions other places. 

My sophomore year I did more freelancing of just basic web dev stuff but I also started putting some data skills on my resume since we were learning them in my other STEM degree (dual major). Starting in the Spring of my Sophomore year a company that I built a website for offered me a position as a “Software Engineering Intern” in order to do some simple data stuff (grab CSVs and process into some emails mainly). This went very well for both of us as I could keep working on their website along with some background data stuff to learn new skills and in the following summer to my surprise they offered me a full-time role. 

I took the position and began to help them build out a platform for communicating between a few of the inventory and sales systems they had and built some dashboarding. They accepted that I still would continue with school and work a bit of a wonky schedule but at a reduced cost to them compared to what they would need to pay a real full-time software engineer and I got a ton of experience with no real technical management. 

This continued through graduation where I was offered a promotion to Product Engineer as I would still be working on the application but by now it had expanded and they were bringing in a remote team to help as they wanted to begin selling this to other similar companies. I helped integrate the external team for a few months before the previous CEO left after some disagreements with the owners of the company and was replaced. The replacement and I didn’t seem eye to eye as a 21 year old being the guy in charge of their product and after trying to make it work for a few months it was kind of mutual that the external team would take over and I would leave with a few weeks of severance. 

Now I am 6 months after graduation with my CS degree and working towards my Masters part time along with ~2.5 years of experience being called a SWE. Each time I have interviewed with a company for a mid level position (not junior but not senior) they have seemed to focus on my graduation date, as in I have heard in their voice when looking at my resume on screening go “Oh and you have only graduated *this* April” and then they begin to push more towards a Junior role. 

I am not necessarily against being in the position of a learner and would appreciate some mentorship actually at this point in my career. But it seems like a set back in terms of *actually* being titled a Junior and the listed responsibilities for a Junior at some places compared to what I have experience with. 

I guess I am looking for some advice, do I settle for something with an official title of Junior? Do I keep looking longer for something more associate level? Am I over selling myself or just being chopped down because I am a recent grad? Any advice would be appreciated!"

I've dealt with depression/anxiety for 10 years and chronic pain for about 5. Probably had chronic pain earlier but y'know. I've been in my current job for 2 and a half years and I filed for FMLA about a year ago. With that I worked 30 hour weeks for a few months until my pain management was better, and since then I've worked 30-40 hours with usually taking unpaid time. I accrue about 3 hours of sick time every two weeks, and my vacation is gone for the year.  
I only worked in the engineering field for an internship and the pace and stress were too much for me. I currently do IT/Tech work but the pay is comparatively low at my current job.

I feel as though I got burnt out bad after 2 years in my first job after college, but I was making enough money to kind of afford quitting outright. Money went FAST though, and it took me months longer than I intended to find a new job. Things were sort of stable for a bit but lately I've been having more fatigue issues. I'm feeling burnt out and done. When I try to make up time and work 9 hours, I'm fucked the next day. I feel forced to be dishonest about the hours I actually work because I just can't do it.

I worry about losing my job a lot, or I worry I'm just going to feel forced to quit because of my health issues.  I couldn't find a part time job when I looked for one because I can't do a lot of things physically. I ended up as a dog walker for 20-25 hours a week for 3 months but my paychecks were horrible. Couldn't even pay my rent let alone health bills. Has anyone had success living and working part time? My experience in college was that with part time I was always exhausted anyway..."

Company 1 is bringing me in for an interview early next week where I will sit down with three directors. This is my first choice, if it was offered. Company 2 is going to have their executives meet early next week to make a decision. They have called my references and run a background check on me. This is my second choice, if offered. Company 3 just put in an official, written offer via email. This is my fourth choice. (My third choice hasn't contacted me back in a while, and I think is ghosting me).

In addition, I have several interview lined up next week and companies I am waiting to hear back from regarding next steps. But none of these are far enough along in the process for me to seriously consider in this discussion.

My questions are 1) How can I feasibly delay company 3 without potentially losing a job (again, I am currently unemployed)? 2) Should I tell company 1 &amp; 2 about company 3?

I have seen a lot of back and forth on this online, and was interested to know what people have tried before and with what results. Company 3 is a good opportunity, but I see more potential for career growth with Company 1 &amp; 2.

Title: **Poltergeist**

Posted by *Crimson* on January 05, 2012

On October 03, I decided it was time to get off my ass and visit this haunted school I have been anticipating see. College classes have been a pain and didn’t let me have the time to go, but I had that free weekend to get the job done. The area was far, around one hour away from home, but the possibility of me scoring another good hunt justified all the trouble.

My parents were out for a wedding, I had no school nor stupid commitments. The day was perfect for my little adventure. I remember I waited for it to be 7:00 pm, I grabbed a cheap gym bag and threw in a flashlight with 4 extra batteries, a printed copy of the prayer glued to the back of a small bible (for good luck I guess), and a bunch of plastic containers..but nothing special really. It fells like winter, the fucking place is out in the open and it gets extremely chilling out there. Add the coldness to the change in temperature when a true ghost is present...you would probably start to experience Raynaud’s syndrome. I decided to take my leather jacket to at least keep myself warm enough and not look like a total fool in a hoodie wandering around the land. That was about it, there is no rocket science when you deal with spirits as far as I knew back then. All I had to do was get to location x, cite the prayer and the last thing you know is that the evil spirit is getting dragged to another dimension by an unknown force. 

I was walking back and forward, downstairs to upstairs, until my alarm hit 9:00 pm. I saw through my window and it was extremely dark outside. I stopped rehearsing my chant, left and locked the house. It indeed took me around one hour to get there in motorcycle, it was foreign land to me. 

I saw a big old house that had an unusual yellow paint on its roof as the local ghost-buster stories tell. That house is where the owner of the land lives, and he has the key to the school gates. The house lights were off, so I supposed he was asleep at this time. Outside of town was windy, not many trees but more of what a rural area should look like. Many private acres of land owned by different people and a very crappy road filled with cow shit and insects. Stupid insects were all over splashed in my helmet, so I had to take it off and put in the bag making it heavier. 

I got to the yellow roofed house and there was a man outside locking the gate that leads to a large concrete building at a distance. The old man looked at me and with an irritated angry voice yelled at me to go away, that he was fed up of constant “ignorance” he said. He was ranting but sounded very tired, and to top it off he said he was going to call the cops if I was going to be a nuisance. I really didn’t want to push my luck, so I just turned back and left...yeah...I just went around his territory making the less noise possible and parked a bit outside his land. 

I “hid” my motorcycle next to a yellow car and a very **OLD** truck. The darkness did not let me see clearly too much of both vehicles, but they caught my attention. What were they doing here? Do these belong to another landowner? Questions like that popped in my mind so naturally I was curious. At this point I looked like a thief because I was glancing to see the dirty red Ford; there was a glossary on its rear mirror and the paint job on the truck was already coming off, other than that, the seats looked ripped and rough. On the other hand, the small yellow car looked brand new and had a bunch of junk food inside and beer bottles. 

Crickets were loud that night...the bird noises, the insects, the land was alive. It almost felt like a warning to keep humans away. 

I sort of knew where I was positioned, I knew the direction where the school building was, and it looked like the people from the truck and car were also heading that way. The ground was muddy, and there were footprints that pointed East were the school was. I could tell there were at least three people, but I just followed a small pair of shoes. As I got in the grass territory, I lost the other pair of footprints, it looked like they went another direction. At this time, I regretted not having brought any water on me, my lips were drying off quickly and was beginning to feel thirsty. I began seeing the building now closer, I stopped following the footprints and began walking towards the school. It felt like something was staring back and the ambient just made a knot in my throat. Branches were snapping as I walked over them, and the insect noises were growing louder to the point I felt I was listening to distant roars white the birds over me where moving the tree branches along their leaves.

After a short walk I was finally besides the infamous “Golden School”: a three-store building, made of concrete, vandalized, broken windows on the second &amp; third floor, a big wooden door entrance and a very humble playground on the side. I did not get any closer though, I leaned on the tree behind me and sat down. I wanted to make sure the old man did not see me from wherever he was at, so I remained hidden for a while.

It was around 10:40 at that point, I think. I opened my bag and made sure the flashlight worked by replacing its batteries. I had my phone in my pocket and the bible fitted in the pocket of my jacket. The school was a creepy yet fascinating sight, very hypnotizing in my own opinion. However, there was this sense of uneasiness when looking through the second floor’s broken windows, it gave you a very menacing impression, something was not right in that building. I was feeling nervous as hell, I had experience dealing with spirits in abandoned houses, but that school looked straight off a horror movie. Last thing I fucking wanted was to almost get a heart attack when I saw how a guy looked out of a window laughing and fooling around. I jumped out of surprise and cursed him in silence. He looked like a teenager and I began hearing the laugh of a girl that was probably behind him. They were alive (I am sure) and messing around, playing in the devil's den. 

*Jesus Christ-* I thought.

I could not get inside and perform an exorcism with those two in there. Primarily because they would talk to authorities or expose my work or identity. I don't want publicity...so I just waited, and eventually fell asleep. It was a very peaceful atmosphere if you closed your eyes and relaxed. To me it passed around 10 seconds before yelling and screaming woke me off as running individuals passed near my spot. 

“JOE WAIT FOR ME!” the girl desperately screamed at a distance. Her and the guys running footsteps faded as the angry wind blew my dizziness away. 

I checked my phone to see the time and it indicated 3:02 AM. How was it possible that I was unconscious for that long? I was confused but still I dragged my body and picked my bag, flashlight on hand, and began walking towards the school. The school seemed bigger than before, not only that, the playgrounds seemed…alive? The swing sets were moving as the wind pushed them and the different wooden playsets were also to some extent moving by themselves. As I finally got near the front door, two figures emerged from the other side of the building walking towards me.

*For fucks sake-* I thought out loud.

I could not handle losing more time and was already very annoyed when I saw these two people, one was holding a very colorful green water gun as I pointed the flashlight at it. At first glance I thought they were part of a church since I saw their outfit first, notice how I said OUTFIT instead of uniform. Those outfits were straight from a Halloween costume store, there was a girl wearing a blank mask, dressed like a nun, her pale hands and legs looked like there were meshes in the dark concrete walls. While the guy, taller than her, the same mask, was wearing a pastor outfit without sleeves.

“You got to be fucking kidding me” I told them in a soothing tone.

“What are you doing here” both the guy and me said at the same time. His voice was calm while mine was irritated. The still dark night didn't allow me to see him and her perfectly, I had to turn off the flashlight because I wasn't sure how long it was going to last, and recharging would cost time. The guy walked closer to me and I noticed he was about my height and looked somewhat jacked.

“Look bro, just give me 20 minutes inside here, after that, you and your girlfriend can do whatever you want in there” I told him trying to dismiss them, I was hurried because I did not know if my parents were coming today or tomorrow and was not in the mood at the moment to make small talk. 

“Who the fuck are you?” his voice grew louder and more confronting too. We got closer and began arguing, none of us truly said what exactly we were doing there. I was telling him that it was none of his business and I was saying nonsense at that point. The girl beside him was off though, she never said a word, instead she was looking up the whole time and zoned out of our encounter. After a couple seconds, she touched the guy’s arm grabbing his attention and she signaled him to look up. 

We paused, both of us looked up and I was petrified to see a large humanoid shadow with very long hands and deformed face looking at us from the second floor. It was meters away from us but it still felt that it was very close to me and it could grab me and crush me if it wanted. Its expression on its face was not visible, but something inside me said that it had a big wide smile in its disproportionate head. It quickly went inside after all three of us noticing it. My throat got colder, and my feet did not want to move, that second of seeing that shadow felt like an eternity engraved in my mind. The guy looked at me back again, I looked at the eye sockets of his mask and said to him sincerely in the best tone: “let me handle it”. He also lowered his guard and I guess he saw through me. He said that they were there for the same reason, that we could do this together. I did not see a problem with it, I believed him or wanted to believe him at that point, I can be very hot headed but three is better than one. I do things alone, but that monster, I did not want to do it alone.

I opened the door and got inside, the two of them began walking towards the door after checking their backpack but the door closed very quickly by its own. Out of shock, I began walking backwards facing the door... that door sound really hurt my ears... not to mention my heart pounded all the way up my throat. If I had noticed something in all my experiences with spirits or evil, is that silence is their key weapon to make you feel uneasy. Although the windows were broken, you could not hear shit inside the building besides your own breath. As I walked towards the stairs to get this whole nightmare over, I was hearing how something was mimicking my footsteps on the second floor. The second floor was made out of wood, it was squeaking old wood, the thing or whatever that was... it was directly above me, moving towards anywhere I was going. 

I walked three steps, stopped, it also stopped. I began quickly walking towards the end of the hall and it also followed me. Halfway there, a staircase in front of me. I stopped and grabbed a concrete piece at the side and threw it above me to the ceiling, I was extremely annoyed. The chant does not work until I have visible contact with the spirit, otherwise it doesn’t seem to work in case you are wondering why I was not doing anything other than walking towards that monster. A moment of silence followed the rock when it fell back to the ground. During that moment, I noticed how ALL the rooms in the school were not completely shut, they were opened a little bit, enough for someone to see you through the thin visible line between the door and the wall. My bravery flew away from my soul as I began hearing how “it” above me started running towards the stairs, it was running towards me and my whole body froze in time. I pointed the flashlight at the stairs and the stomps of the ghost were getting closer and closer, all the doors in my floor closed while this thing was going down the stairs until it stopped. 

Nothing, other than a cold air glued to the surface of my skin. I looked around me. The hall was dull, but I felt the presence of something observing me. 

I climbed the stairs, they were dusty and needed maintenance, who knows how old that school was. As I reached the second floor, I felt that I was back on the first floor again. Everything looked similar, but there was no big wooden door behind me. The hall was similar, but the classrooms were all closed except for one. I took out my phone to see the time but it didn’t turn on, my phone wasn't working and was very hot to the touch. I walked towards the classroom with the door opened knowing that sooner than later the motherfucker would appear. 

Chairs were spread around the classroom, leaving the middle empty, where some clothing was laying around the floor. I imagined it was from the clowns that came earlier, the clothes didn't seem to be old or dirty...but were very cold. On the teacher’s desk there was an old photograph, it showed a middle-aged man holding a diploma. He was smiling but there were pen marks that drew horns and a mustache on his face. On the back of the picture it said in very messy handwriting “Pig”. I settled my bag behind the desk carefully so that the glasses don't break. I took out the small bible but as soon as I pulled it out it was taken away from my hand and landed on one of the corners of the room. As I looked back, the chairs began moving towards me slowly. A bunch of air entered the room from the broken window and the whole damn building felt like a freezer. I began citing the prayer, but the chairs began launching at me, they were made of wood and hit the walls hard. One of them managed to hit my arm and it hurt like a son of a bitch. I ran out of the room and closed the door, leaving my bag behind. 

Even though I did not see what was going on inside, I felt the chairs hitting and stacking behind the door as I was pushing with my whole body holding the door until they stopped. I laughed out of relief, but not a moment passed after I felt something grab me from my jacket and threw me with all its force the other side of the hall. I landed on my shoulder and did not even had the chance to react before I got dragged from my feet back to the classroom door that was now open. I tried yelling the prayer once again but a chair that was now out in the hall launched at me as a projectile and I covered my face. I had tears in my face, not going to lie, the thing stopped grabbing me and I tried standing up. 

The shadow was now more visible, it was humanoid and had a marked grin in its deformed face. It grabbed me again and pushed me from wall to wall, I felt like fainting, it would not let me speak at all. It finally stopped and was just holding me up in the air pushed back to a wall, its long hands that were so damn cold were around my neck. I was pushed against the wall, I saw its face, the eyes completely black, the skin melted and stitch marks around its mouth. It was mad...yeah, I could tell that it was angry... 

I realized that this was the end of the road for me...I smiled at it, spitted blood at its face and gave him a chuckle. I wasn't scared, I had accepted my fate anyway. The adrenaline of that hunt was rushing in my blood, I wanted to live but I ran out of luck I thought. I closed my eyes as life was leaving my body, and once again I heard my grandmother praying, and I tried to pray with her out loud, but the spirit pushed me again harder to the wall. I was silenced, and everything was blurry.

A few drops of water hit my face, and I was let go from the force holding me up. I landed on my ass and began feeling all the pain resonating in my body. I saw the priest shooting water at the spirit, it looked very dumb but somehow the shadow was retrieving, and all the chairs began coming out of the classroom. The other classroom doors were making noises as if the other chairs were also trying to get out. The priest threw the water gun to the floor and began citing a chant that was different but had the same kind of familiar Latin tone. The chairs began launching at him and at me too. I began moving dodging and got on my feet despite the pain. I could not yell but I tried my best at citing my own words.

Another figure came up the stairs, it was this time the nun, holding a crucifix on her hands yelling the same prayer the priest was saying. The shadow threw a chair that hit the priest’s leg making him drop down. I got closer and one of the chairs hit the nerve in my elbow. It hurt so bad that I got REALLY mad. I began screaming so loud the prayer I knew. The spirit began twitching in pain, yelling a three-dimensional scream, the whole building felt like it was vibrating. The chairs were now sloppy, and the spirit felt weak as it was twitching on the floor yelling in anger. All three of us continued praying until the spirit launched to the ceiling and then dropped with the same intensity to the floor. I knew it was that force, it was trying to drag it to another dimension. The spirit was yelling in pain, but there was sorrow in its voice. It was saying “it wasn't me, don't let me go please, it wasn't me”. It launched into the air again and then got dragged down with such force that the floor trembled. I think I saw bright sparks and the smell of something burning as the spirit got dragged to somewhere else. A bunch of goo spread to the hall as the spirit splashed to the floor one last time. 

Bingo, I was so damned relieved, but I could not move too much as I felt I had a couple of broken bones. I looked at the priest and he looked back at me, we both laughed like maniacs. 

The nun came running to the priest very preoccupied, she had a very soft voice. The guy told her something and she left downstairs. I got up and went for my bag with all the soreness in the world. Once I came back, I dropped to the floor and began taking out the flasks to get all the ectoplasm in. The priest looked at me confused of what I was doing, but he offered his help. I didn't care at that point, after all... the flasks were filled except for one. I crawled to the wall to stay seated straight. He got up and told me that I had to go to a hospital, but I didn't want to. Not to mention trespassing criminal charges, but also the trouble with my parents. I didn't want to get pass that. Somehow, I knew that visiting the fortune teller was the right idea, but I was in no position to ride a motorcycle. All of this was going in my head until the priest broke his silence:

“I’m Mick, what's your name?” He said offering me a hand to stand up.

I opened my mouth, but I chuckled a bunch of vomit. 

“Take it easy man, that was a hell of a poltergeist” He tried to get me on my feet, I got a good look at him. He had taken off his mask and I saw a very young man with ginger hair and blue eyes. His long hair reached his chin, but despite a big scar on his mouth... he had a very friendly face. We went to the classroom and I sat down in one of the chairs.  I picked up my small bible and got in in my pocket. The nun soon entered the classroom as she followed Mick’s voice. She was no longer wearing her mask nor the veil. As she got closer to me to also give me a pain pill, I noticed she had long brown wavy hair, brown eyes, a very pretty, round and angelic face but was giving me a killer stare. She quickly turned to Mick, saying that she felt there was no longer any presence in the building. I asked them if they were hunters too. But they looked at me again confused. Mick said that they were vanished exorcist from a secret catholic order. They made a living by exorcising ghosts or any type of spirits that cause trouble in the United States. 

Mick got closer to me as he grabbed the picture that was on top of the desk and handed me a bottle of fresh water that the girl had in a bag. I began drinking like there was no tomorrow.

He said that her name was Mary, she was his sister by blood. Both had been raised to become exorcists from a very young age but did not tell me why where they vanished. I did not want to ask. He asked me if I was also an exorcist, I just answered “sort of”, that I just wanted what the ghost left behind \[as I pointed at my bag filled with goo flasks\]. He laughed and said that ectoplasm does not make a good souvenir. It quickly disappears or just looks like a spider web if it doesn't get conserved right. Mary was looking outside the window and said that the lights of the old man's house were on. That we should leave before cops came just in case. I grabbed my bag and Mick helped me get to the motorcycle safety. The land was quiet, peaceful, the freezing loud wind had gone away. The birds and bugs were making noises again. 

They got me into their truck, it smelled like cherries in there, but there was no source of smell as far as I could see. Mary began driving and was constantly changing the radio station and the truck stumbled on the stupid road. The seats were as rough as I thought and were grasping my back with each bump in the road.  Mick had asked me where to take me, and I gave him the directions of the fortune teller, just to give her all the shit we had gathered. My gut was telling me that that was the right thing to do. The clock indicated that it was 6:50 am, I checked my phone to see if it was working, and now it was working.  When we got to the fortune teller's house, I noticed the damn cat was outside on top of the billboard. It quickly jumped towards the house and got inside by an opened window. We got out and rang the bell, the door opened, and the woman looked very distressed after seeing how fucked up we all looked. She began asking me what had happened, you know...all that sort of stuff. Mick explained that we went against a poltergeist and explained everything that happened. 

She looked very mortified, as if she was deciding what to do and eventually got a small flask, she had inside a lock-box that she hid in one of her drawers. She said that she owed my father too much, that is only paying a debt she had. Once I drank the liquid thinking it was some sort of medicine, I began feeling so much pain in my bones and in my throat. It was burning inside me, I wanted to scream so loud but held it in. It was unbelievable. I let out a couple tears because it did hurt inside really bad. After a couple of seconds, all the pain went away. I mean ALL the pain got away. 

Mick and Mary looked at me in shock, speechless. The woman got a mirror and showed me my face. It was me, my mouth was covered in blood, but I had no marks. It just looked like I was wearing Halloween blood. I could walk like nothing; I wasn't sore no more. I do not know what sort of shit this was, but it was incredible. 

She smiled at me and said that it was a potion. A very potent one that uses very specific materials, ectoplasm being one of them. I was so grateful, I also told her that I brought more of that goo. She was surprised but told me she could not pay for it. Mick asked how much it was worth, while Mary began playing with the cat on the other side. I felt that I owe Mick and his sister that much, so I decided to split the earnings of whatever I was going to gain. However, Mick said not to worry about it, they had finished their contract and will not leave town empty handed. He offered me to take me back to my motorcycle, but I refused. We stayed a little longer, the fortune teller told us that she is a retired alchemist. Apparently, there are sorcerers, alchemists, and witches walking among us, they are actively working with materials in order to use for forbidden magic. I was directed to a sorcerer in another town that is very far from here. His name is Joseph, he serves as a transaction medium between a secret market and other sorcerers. He would be willing to buy and was looking for people to give a contract if I was interested. 

By now I should tell you that the fortune teller’s name is Lisa, she was nice enough to take me back to my motorcycle. I could not help to ask what she meant by owing my father too much. Lisa only said that they were friends since high school and that he had supported her ever since he discovered she played with magic. Other people made fun of her and he defended her in the worst of cases. Noble, but I felt she was lying or that there was more to the story than that. Anyways, all of that just to come back home empty handed. I thought that that was the end of my extracurricular activities. I realized I could not do things alone, I could get myself killed if I encounter another poltergeist, who knows, maybe something worse. 

I was staring at the flasks of goo, I wanted to pour them in the sink to leave this life behind. But my doorbell rang. I came to the door and opened it. Motherfucker Mick was there now in normal clothes looking happy to see me. He said that he got the money from his contract and wanted to share. I refused and was just confused on how the fuck he got to my house. Apparently... Lisa told him. He asked me if I wanted to go to visit the sorcerer, him and his sister were going to that city in case I want to tag along, they could use my help.

It's been a month since that happened. Lots of shit has happened ever since: I have abandoned school and moved out of the house. I told my parents I got and internship in medical research out of town, that I would be away for a long time. I know it’s a lie, but I don't want to tell them the truth. I still keep in touch with them, but I know this lie won't hold up forever. Working along with Mick and Mary has been a very fascinating experience, there is more to the church that what books tell us. Poltergeists, wraiths, ghosts, spirits, animal spirits, everything is nuts. We are making good money out of this too, maybe I can convince them to ditch that old shit truck for a pair of motorcycles. 

While we are traveling together, we do not live together. We settle in motels; I always go for a different room and each one of us has a different bank account where we split our earnings. We have shared strategies and exchange information on the types of ghost we have encountered. The prayer I say apparently is Hebrew, not Latin. Mick has been a really good friend, he plans everything ahead of time, unlike me. They don’t talk too much about their family nor their past, but neither do I. We are a good team despite his sister Mary not talking to me at all. She and her brother are well coordinated, but she works mostly on her laptop researching about whatever she researches. Not bothered at all, really.

It's been good writing this, I’ll post whenever something out of the ordinary happens since ghost stories are boring in my opinion. By the way, Happy Birthday Lisa."
ddhkqh,12,2019-10-04,I have been fired from 3 jobs in a row and I don’t know what’s wrong with me,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ddhkqh/i_have_been_fired_from_3_jobs_in_a_row_and_i_dont/,"Since March, I have been fired 3 times in a row. I got fired yesterday. Here’s what happened with each:

Job 1 (9 months of employment) - Argued with an intern about her attitude. Her uncle is a big shot billionaire. She then cried to my boss threatening to quit. He “laid me off” the following Monday because he “needed to protect the company”. I was a web developer and designer as well as part time project manager. I was training her to be a project manager. 

Job 2 (1 month of employment) - Fired for using my phone. Took the job out of desperation because I couldn’t find any web development work at the time. I run a small web design business on the side. They didn’t like my constant back and forth emails / texts with current and potential clients, so they fired me. No warning, just fired. 

Job 3 (3 months) - No idea why I was fired. I was a temp to hire. The week before I was given a date to be interviewed to potentially come on full time as an actual employee of the company. On Thursday, I came into work and my badge wasn’t working anymore. I go to security who then hands me a box and tells me I’ve been terminated and asked me to leave the premises. No reason given. Tried getting in touch with my supervisor, no response. Tried calling HR, they can’t tell me nor my recruiter at the staffing agency due to it being “confidential”. 

What is wrong with me? I had lowkey anxiety all the time at this 3rd job because I didn’t want to get fired again. I worked as hard as I could. I worked in a call center doing IT and I had the best numbers in my training class. I got good surveys from callers. I got along with management. Then I’m fired. No one knows why. Multiple co workers reached out and asked how I was doing. There’s rumors why I could’ve been fired, but all have been disproven. 

The first firing, it is what it is. Don’t lecture interns apparently. The second time, my fault. I’ll accept that. But the third time? C’mon. What am I doing wrong? I have an interview Monday with a company doing web development work again and I’m really excited to do that. I really want to. I just am terrified of a few things: 1) how do I explain working at this company for only 3 months and 2) how do i not get fired again 

Everyone says I just need to get over it and move on, but how can I move on? I’m the only person with this issue. No one else is getting fired repeatedly without warning. I was never spoken to about anything at any of these jobs. Never once was I told I need to stop doing something. They just flat out say cya. 

How can I be a better employee? How do I not mess up all the time? I am a grown 20 year old man and honestly I balled in the parking lot that 3rd time. I feel like I have to always be on my heels because I’m just going to get fired without warning any day. What am I doing wrong? Why am I so unemployable?"
ddhp6x,0,2019-10-04,Should I quit my internship?,Getsumei1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ddhp6x/should_i_quit_my_internship/,"Hello! So I want to be a data scientist in the future. Currently I am a senior Computer Science Cyber Security student and I will graduate in May. I have been working as an intern at my current company for one year now. The team consists of two groups, data scientists and data analysts. We primarily use Tableau and Alteryx for all visualizations or manipulating data. I get paid fairly well for my area at $17 an hour.

Here are the problems. Most of the team is fairly new due to a very high turnover rate in the last few months. My boss quit along with several others. They have been “looking” for a replacement for my boss for the past 3 months and still nothing. Now due to so many people quitting, I am one of the most “senior” members on my team. I feel that I cannot learn much more from the team. I have been tasked with more so teaching new interns and new analysts rather than being able to continue doing interesting work. If I am not teaching, then I am just doing the easy but time consuming work for the analysts as they are already stretched thin. I have been told this is a good thing for my career as I am proving myself to the company and showing I am valuable. The thing is that I don’t feel the company actually cares. If they did, everyone else wouldn’t have quit. The last thing that worries me is that our team uses no R or Python. I feel I am falling behind as I want to be a data scientist and not just a data analyst.

If I quit, I doubt I will get another internship to replace this one. Although, I am working as a paid researcher at my school. I don't know very much about what I will be researching as I was recently hired. Would your recommendations be to stay at my internship as it will be more experience on my resume or quit? If I quit, I can focus more on school and my research. I could also self study more to more prepare for my future. If you would like more information, please let me know!"
ddhtpr,1,2019-10-04,Will college help me as a web developer?,RisingFromNada,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ddhtpr/will_college_help_me_as_a_web_developer/,"So I got accepted to a two year school where I can pursue an AS in computer programming. On paper it looks solid in terms of the ground covered. Visual studio, C#, HTML, CSS, JS, SQL and more are the requirements. There is potential for an internship at the end which I like. I also am not sure if the finances will work when I also have a wife and kids but that's something time will tell. So this may or may not even be an option.

I know some people are self taught, or they had the potential to be at one time and get in. Supposedly web devs just start their careers by building portfolios and showing off what they know by nature etc. But it's hard to imagine this alone will get your foot in the door. How do they even know I'm not essentially plagiarizing or having a friend do it for me in my name? No credentials or anything to back it up...

I mean, I can currently dedicate about two hours a night to self studying while I work full time. Maybe a little more on days off. Sometimes less if the kids have a freak out or something when they're supposed to go to bed or some other thing comes up. I don't believe I can juggle all work, school and parenting at once, or that it would be effective to do so. It's basically one or the other as far as I can tell. To some extent maybe work study is an option. Something like help desk at the school or something with their computer lab while I'm in school for maybe 10 hours a week. I'm pursuing a comptia a+ as well.

I do believe the school can work with me, and a part of me wants to go to school to relish the experience and the community. But at the same time, I see posts here and there or hear about stories where it wasn't necessary. Any tips or insight appreciated. Thanks for reading."

i have covered the other topics but i am struggling with these 2. i would need at least 2-3 weeks to prep.

**my main question is: do the tier 1 companies give graph/tree questions for their online tests like hackerrank or is it only array strings etc?**

&amp;#x200B;

i think i might have a chance at tier 2 companies like jpmorgan blackrock since theyre online is arrays and strings and then onsite i can learn quickly.

i am just dissapointed that i wasnt able to cover the graph/trees this year..."

I know even before writing this post that this might get long so I'll shorten things up here and explain everything in detail later below.

Summarized to one sentence is that I don't know how to cope any more with the feel of inadequacy from people surrounding me. Namely, I don't know how to copy with the fact that I'm weaker cognitively, be it being slower or dumber.

Context: I'm studying CS in the top university of my country. I'm doing well, well at least in the spectrum of academia and work life. I'm now a second year student having GPA of 3.88 and a good internship under my belt with recommendations. So all is well in the kingdom right? Wrong. During my so far one year of studies I've met all kinds of people. Smart, hard working, motivated, normal and so on. And with my merits you can safely say that I'm at least one of the type listed before. Yet, there's one guy in the circle or friends who's general intelligence is absolutely astonishing: He can pick *anything* in any subject and become proficient at it as he pleases. I've never met anyone who has the same level of aptitude for so many things. He's funny, he's fast and more importantly, he's extremely good at problem solving. Be it anything, he can find and apply general patterns really, really fast. It probably doesn't come as a surprise that he's pulling easy 4.0 GPA; I can safely say that I work at least twice as much during the week to only come close to the person in question. 

And before you say it, no he doesn't have any programming or CS related background. That's probably one of the most frustrating things about him; the man doesn't realize how incredibly gifted and intelligent he is, so he just laugh off any of the harder assignments by ""look, even *I* could do it"". For his record, he does always help whenever someone gets stuck.

And again, before you might say it, he doesn't play down the amount of work he does. Everything is just so easy to him that he can have a lot of free time, normal free time, be it hanging out with his friends, GF, playing games, watching netflix and so on.

Even if my free time currently consists of only about few hours per day (1 when waking up, and  \~1 at night) and I literally do nothing except study and exercise every day, it's okay to me. It's the level I'm at and I can only try to be the best me possible.

What eats my soul away every waking minute of my life is the realization that no matter how hard I work, how hard I practise solving problems, applying patterns, mathematics, programming I can never, ***never***, even imagine being to the man I've spoke of. And the current culture of education, namely growth mindset, adds insult to injury as in the realm of GM, if I work hard enough I can be/do anything. So it must clearly be that I'm not working hard enough. Or better, my personal favourite, given ***enough*** time (lim n -&gt; infinity) I can learn/solve something: ""You go bud! Even if you might learn the thing you are learning or solve the thing you are solving at your deathbed, you've  still learned/solve it! Yes, it took you a bit of time, but hey, think of a brain like a muscle and it helps :) Stay motivated!"".

If this latter part seems like nonsensical rambling, the context is that I with two of my friends (other being the one I've spoken of so far) took a part in a programming contest and all things considering did okay. I struggled a lot, couldn't keep up with my team mates and contributed a fuck all the the overall result as my other team mates were the workhorse, but we did okay.

Peace!"
ddr0ag,4,2019-10-05,Should I take the offer?,robertttt12325,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/ddr0ag/should_i_take_the_offer/,"Tldr at the end. Thank you in advance

I am a second semester junior in the Midwest, and recently got a summer internship offer from a Big 4 (a). It fits my timeline because I'm doing my MAcc, so I'm still two years out and I figured a summer internship is way better than doing summer leadership as it gets your foot in the door earlier and you get paid for it.

I did recruiting this fall and 2 Big 4 stood out to me the most (mid tiers did not want to offer me a summer internship). I applied to both and for the first one I went through two B2B interviews and did okay (couldn't even get on Google Hangouts and had to do it over the phone), but surprisingly enough within 2 hours I got a callback from the first partner giving me a verbal offer. The written offer came two days later, and It's due the first week of November.

I loved the people from the other Big 4 though, met partners from Bay Area and they were great, the local recruiter was the best. Thing is, last week she let me know that the recruiter from NYC had ""accepted the referral"" and was going to reach out to me and that she didn't know the details, but that they'll probably fly me out for the next round interviews (I went through the pre-recorded interviews just like everyone else). The recruiter hasn't called or emailed me, so I'll text the local recruiter this Monday to ask her if she has any updates, BUT if they are going to fly me out in November that's still way too late for me to have both offers on the table and choose one...

As I've said, I went to all the socials and both Big 4's people were the best one in my experience, but the second B4's recruiting process is making me anxious. If anything, it seems just a tad unorganized but I get it they have a lot of people to interview/deal with. The first B4 gave me a ""buddy"" before the interview, and she kept up with me and texted me to congratulate so that was nice, and the process was extremely quick. The summer internship is for NYC though, and I heard the second B4 has a better office lol. In all seriousness, I don't know what to do. I'm thinking I should let the second B4 recruiter know I have other offers on the table but I really want to get to know EY, and if it would be possible to expedite the process, but that might be a bit too much... especially since i haven't heard from the EY NYC recruiter yet...

Tldr: Junior but I'm 2 years out (+MAcc). Got a NYC summer internship offer from one B4 (a). Big 4 (b) recruiter said Big4 (b) NYC recruiter would fly me out in November for interviews and she would reach out this past week but she hasn't called. Big 4 (a) offer due in November (so way before Big 4 (b) interviews either way). Both were nice, don't feel too strongly about one or the other"

Situation: I worked for 16 months full-time at a company with full-time responsibilities. The only issue is that this was an internship meaning my official title was software engineer intern.

Issue: What do i put on my resume?

\- on one hand, my title was technically intern so how can I display that this was full-time responsibilities?

\- on the other, if I worked as a full-timer, why not just make my title software engineer, and then either

* mention it was an internship (e.g. Did X, Y, Z as part of internship)
* leave off internship period and just bring it up during an interview as, well i worked full-time with full-time responsibilities, as part of a science internship course through my school.
* if applying for new grad, user intern title resume, if applying for something different use software engineer?

So I recently graduated college with a Bachelor of Science in Individualized Educational Studies (it's a teaching degree for people who have no clue what they want to do in education, like me) I took my last year of college to figure out what I wanted to do instead of do student teaching, and I got some amazing research and internship opportunities that led me to discover I want to work with PK-3 (sidenote - NOT what I initially went to college for). The stars aligned for me, and I was able to get a job as a Pre-K Lead Teacher for a neighboring county's Head Start program. I'm very fortunate that the curriculum and classroom management techniques align with my overall teaching philosophies (it's play-based and uses Conscious Discipline), and all the staff for the program seem delightful.

I'm excited to start, but also scared. Does anyone have any advice for a new Pre-K teacher? My research was in play-based learning, and I looked into what Conscious Discipline is, but is there anything I should know for Monday? Thanks!"

As the title says, I'm a Jordanian-American living and studying in Jordan (Computer Engineering major in my 3rd year), I have a couple of questions about how to apply for internships in the US, also keep in mind that I spent my whole life in Jordan not the US.

1) Would companies in the US consider me for an internship in the summer? if so, what's the best way to approach it?

2) Related to (1), what do I put in the phone field? I'm afraid if I put my actual (non-US) phone number they'll just throw away my application.

3) I noticed that most deadlines for summer internships are in mid-October, so when are the interviews conducted? (I'm assuming they are done online)

4) How much do internships in IT/data science and relating fields pay?"
ddua4b,9,2019-10-05,no friends/what am I doing with my life/feel stagnant,[deleted],socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/ddua4b/no_friendswhat_am_i_doing_with_my_lifefeel/,"I have no friends in college. I'm a sophomore and its ridiculous because last year first semester I was having the time of my life with no friends and no one to impress every day. I've never necessarily liked summer, but this summer was the worst of my life. I had no idea what to do, while all my high school friends were doing internships or full time jobs I went into a full blown depression. I felt useless. I felt like a failure. I felt trapped in my house. Every day was painful. second semester last year is when my roommate really started complaining about her not having many friends either, and this is when I really started reflecting on my own life. I was really happy being alone while everyone else around me was struggling having the worst year of their life finding friends. And now i'm going through that but a year later and with social anxiety. 

I have struggled with SA my entire life. I remember walking into PRESCHOOL with the same feeling I experience today: my heart racing and life just passing in blurbs instead of continuously. Like i'm not actually there and everything inside me is telling me to freeze like a deer in headlights. Like any little twitch I made would be made fun of until the day I die. I feel like with SA it prevents you from being 100% there in the moment. My entire life I haven't had many friends because of my extreme trust issues and being practically mute. I would take things wayyyy too personally and if someone ever told me to 'stop' or tell me I said the wrong me I would basically feel so shit and retreat back into my shell forever. I had a group of friends elementary/middle school but we drifted apart bc we could never hang out outside of school. My mom never let me invite people over so that kinda dropped a lot of my confidence. Like I was semi outgoing despite my anxiety growing up and I would literally go up to kids houses and ask to hang out and it would be chill. But then I would feel bad when they would come to my house to hang out and I would have to say no and I would feel scared of my mom if she would get mad at me/try to beat me for inviting people over even when I didn't. 

My home environment very much gave me anxiety. My mother was very negative/hyper critical of me. I remember thinking as a kid ""what can I do to be a good kid? What am I doing wrong? I'm trying so hard"" she would get angry at me for things like spilling my juice or things that I can't help doing as a kid. She would get angry at me for talking to my brothers. My brothers basically traumatized me by ganging up against me and bullying me and making fun of me for literally everything I did to the point where I absolutely hated everything about myself and was so self-conscious about everything. Everyday I came home to them pointing and laughing at me. It got to the point where I genuinely dreaded coming home everyday because my older brother would just torment me until I cried. My little brother was embarrassed to be seen with me in school and if I ever said hi to him in the hallway he would tell my mom and I would get in trouble. My mother had to drop off me and my little brother at separate stops because he did not want to be seen getting out of the same car as me. He once told me, completely serious, after a fight ""either you die or I die."" He asked me to kill him. I have been begging my mother to get him therapy since I was 13 and she has not done it. 

The outcome? I hate myself. Every single inch of myself. I feel like I don't deserve the air I breathe. I feel like I am a waste of space. I feel like all I do is inevitably pass on my own depression to other people and make their days worse even though I have such a big heart and all I want to do is make other people happy. I recently thought I briefly gained control of my confidence until yesterday I saw my family, and I made a joke about my older brother's juuling and all he said with a smirk on his face was: ""do you want me to roast you?"". And I told him he always becomes like this and I know what he's going to say. He knows where it hurts. He says that I have no social skills and no friends. And he looks at me with that crazy look on his face, like tearing me down is his own brand of crack. He knows how to make me suffer and keep me down and I don't know how to make it stop. 

I am a positive person. But for this past year I have felt this overwhelming sense of helplessness. I have tried so hard, in the past I have lied to myself that I have no problems and thats how I got by. But now I can't escape what's right in front of me, whats literally preventing me from making connections with people and reaching normal milestones like having my first kiss/boyfriend. My dream is to be outgoing, although I accept myself as introvert. My dream is to do the things I've always wanted to do, the things i've known i've wanted to do since I was little which is things like theatre and entertaining. I love being funny. Like I hate going out because I just feel like everyone is staring at me and its aggravates me. It's like I love talking but at the same time I completely despise it. Ever since I was little I've always had this duality in my personality. Me at school: silent and doesn't say a WORD and freezes up when someone tries to have a normal conversation. Me with my CLOSEST friends: super loud and annoying and wants to be the center of attention and doesn't stfu. Recently with such limited friends I've forgotten who the real me is because I have no one my social anxiety believes I can ""trust"" to express that to. But I feel like everyone including myself is asking myself to be real and just accept the facts: you can't talk to people, and have a panic attack whenever you are the center of attention of people you don't know EXTREMELY well or can trust 20000%. 

Basically I feel like an outcast. I feel like in high school I could hide behind the quiet, shy, nerdy archetype of a person. People used to say ""she doesn't say much, but when she does its really funny!"" and that was basically the source of my confidence/what was keeping me going. I feel like I can't do that anymore in college. I feel like in college being quiet and shy isn't cute anymore, you have to be confident/be able to network/create a brand for yourself. And it is just so hard to talk to people in college when everyone has an rbf and is so confident when you're not. People really aren't friendly and thats funny because thats absolutely the thing I loved about college when i first came here that I wasn't forced into so many social interactions but now its completely the opposite because over the summer I came home to my high school friends all having their own huge friend groups from college and me now feeling soo lonely after coming back to school. Its funny to think that last year after first semester I would confidently say that that was the happiest time of my life even though I had no friends lol(i think it was just bc I finally escaped my family lol). Anyways I don't know what I want because what I truly want to do I cannot because of my social anxiety. And that is ruining my life because then what am I doing in college. Right now I'm on the edge between deciding to go do something like science that other people can see me doing as a ""nerdy, quiet girl"" or something that truly excites me like film but would actually scare the shit out of me and that my family would like never support.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways thanks for reading the struggles of a random person on the internet, this made me feel slightly better writing this.  if you're reading up to this point I really appreciate that tbh I hope you have a wonderful day bc ur pretty awesome."

community could help me out with (I apologize in advance for the lengthy post
^ _ ^ ). Before we get into the issue I think it might help if I briefly introduce
myself. I am a software engineering student at The University of Texas at
Dallas and am expected to graduate by the end of fall 2020. By that time I
would have done my undergrad degree in 2 ½ years with my only experience being
a summer internship that I’m currently trying to get (hopefully lol). I also
have a certain scholarship that will allow me to get a masters completely free of
charge due to the short duration of my undergrad degree (it’s an undergrad full
tuition scholarship). My career goal is to become a senior software engineer
and then eventually move into a PM type role. The program that I am looking to
study is the [Masters
in Systems Engineering and Management](https://catalog.utdallas.edu/2017/graduate/programs/jsom/systems-engineering-and-management/ms-sem) that offered at the same school. My main
motivations for this specific grad program is to:

-       
Get a masters degree for down the road career
progression 

-       
Learn about building complex systems from a
higher level perspective

-       
Get away with not having to pay a dime whilst
never needing to come to school again (for a masters anyway)

-       
Not have to take the same SWE classes I took just
prior to entering the program ( &amp;lt; 1 yr ) Side note – our masters program for
SWE is very similar to our undergrad in terms of difficulty and knowledge
covered, so not really a step up in terms of personal growth

I would like to also mention that once I’m in, I plan to do
a summer internship and fall coop between the first two semesters of grad
school to get more experience. That being said, I wanted to ask if I would be
hindering my job prospects specifically as an entry-level SWE if I were to go through
the aforementioned path. I’m also not exactly looking to join a company at a
higher pay grade than undergrad SWE’s either, I just want to start as a SWE as
opposed to a Systems or DevOps engineer. 

(If you want you can check out the specific classes for the
program through the hyperlink above)

Thank yall for reading and I appreciate the advice.

So I did an internship last year for two months in the summer. While I was there, one of the employees became an unofficial mentor figure to me, and even though she wasn't my actual supervisor I worked with her a lot. When I left, I got the email addresses from a lot of the employees, including her, but I only ever contacted her (I just wasn't sure what to say to everybody else/didn't actually have anything to say). A couple months after I left the internship, I contacted my mentor asking for recommendations for graduate school, which she provided (she sent me the letter too--she said wonderful things and was super nice). We emailed back and forth for several months mostly about recommendations and me asking how things were going at work (they were going through a big transition while I was there).

In April, she sent me a link to an article related to the kind of work she does/the work I want to do, and I responded with something like thanks for the article and also told her that I had decided on my grad school and thanked her again for her support. She never responded, and now I don't know if I should email her again to keep contact or not. It's been so long now, and I have no idea what I would say if I did email her. But I don't want to lose her as a contact because she's an awesome person and has worked in the industry for decades and knows a lot. 

So should I email her again or just let it fall away naturally? If I do email her, what in the world do I say? In general, how often should you email professional contacts to keep the relationship going?

4.0 UW, 5.4 W

Top 1% of my class

AP Scores: World (5), Human geo (5), Bio (4), Env Sci (5). My school only offers 2 APS (I self studied bio and env sci)

SAT: 1540 (800 math, 740 reading) (the average SAT in my school is 980)

SAT subject tests: Bio (800), Physics (800), Math II (800)

I am currently taking the most rigorous courses in my school. I am the only person in my school taking Calculus 1 and college physics (I took dual credit trig and pre calc in summer before junior year). I will be planning to take dual credit chemistry, calculus based physics, calc 2 and 3, and discrete math. (I'm the very first student to ever take calc based physics and calc 3 in my school)

Main EC's:

1. Science Olympiad (President): extremely involved in this ever since freshman year, I have won a couple of state and regional awards. I have also raised almost $3000 through funds and contacting businesses. This takes up most of my time. I also helped the team win 1st and 2nd place in many regional competitions. 
2. UIL Science (Captain and founder): started the first UIL Science team sophomore year, won 1st place as a team every year at district. I started a team from scratch and I help with study resources and meetings. 
3. Rocketry: made rocket motors and various rockets throughout my time. I did a research project with an Arduino regarding the impulse of various rocket motors and their grain geometries. I also learned python, AutoCad, and SketchUp for these projects. 
4. Pennyplanes: a very unique extracurricular I have, requiring A LOT of my time. Basically, I create large balsa plane that weigh less than a penny but can fly for a very long time with a single rubber band (like 7 or 10 minutes). This is probably a niche that can set me apart from most of the applicants. 
5. Science NHS (founder and president): I helped start the chapter for our school. I also created the website and application for it. I plan the weekly meetings, maintain the website, and look for volunteering events. I was also able to get people in the STEM field to come talk to the students.
6. NASA Internship: it was a high school program thingy, it wasn't too big. I did a couple of engineering stuff. 
7. Local engineering internship: it was a good paying job I had during the summer, I learned how to use AutoCad and various engineering tools.
8. Math Team: competed in many competitions. I also helped introduced AMC to my school. 
9. School Ambassador: I get to represent the school by volunteering in many school events

I enjoy all of my extracurriculars and they are truly my passion (especially the rocketry and penny plane stuff). 

Awards:

1. Science Olympiad: bunch of regional and state medals 
2. USABO semi finalist 
3. UIL Science District 1st place overall
4. UIL Science Regional 1st place Biology 
5. Qualified for AIME

LOR:  (probably one of the strongest parts of my app)

Chem teacher: I knew him since middle school and he wrote my LOR for my NASA Internship. He was my Sci Oly coach and he knows a lot about me.

World History teacher: very good also, I was the only one in his class to receive a 5 on the exam. He is also my UIL Social Studies coach. We talk a lot about politics and current issues, I also talk about engineering and science stuff with him. 

Counselor: probably one of the very best recs. She knows that I am very motivated in my classes. We talk on a regular basis and she knows that I want to go to MIT.  I also managed to get a couple of classes approved by the district as dual credit. She is also the head of the student ambassadors.

I've done a cs internship (full time), I programmed in a robotics team, and I taught basic programming classes to kids (though only freshman summer).

I took a basic ""Exploring Computer Science"" class in freshman year, and got an A in both semesters.

I took IB Computer Science 1-2 in sophomore year, and got both As.

But the problem is that I got two Bs when I took IB Computer Science 3-4 in junior year (it was a serious struggle). Does this heavily influence my application, when I'm applying to major in cs?"
ddysm0,1,2019-10-06,How can I reach a content place in life when I lack independence &amp; confidence?,crangismcbasketballs,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ddysm0/how_can_i_reach_a_content_place_in_life_when_i/,"  I‘m 23 &amp; don't feel where I should be at my age. For starters, I have 0 independence. I live with my parents &amp; I don’t drive or ever leave my house. My dad is a hothead &amp; is quick to lose his temper. He never listens to me or talks things out which has made it difficult for me to stand him anymore. He was on the phone with my sister one day &amp; couldn’t figure out the classroom she described she was in at school (which I graduated from &amp; knew well). When I told him the exact room she was in, he screamed at me to shut up &amp; that I didn’t know what I was talking about. It made me upset so I yelled that I was just trying to help &amp; he called me a bi%$h. I’m a comm major in college so being unable to articulate how him lashing out is unnecessary makes me feel defeated. I know redditors are going to say I’m ungrateful because I live in my parents house, but it’s not like I am taking up any space or like it would be different if I wasn’t here. I live in the attic and keep to myself.

I also don’t drive or have a car because my parents didn’t take the time to help me &amp; when they did my dad screamed at me if I made a little mistake which I believe gave me a driving phobia. 

**I also have social anxiety &amp; have no idea how to start a convo with strangers, so I feel awkward &amp; anxious all the time in social situations. The only thing that gets me through social gatherings is alcohol because when my inhibitions are gone, I don't care. I feel remarkably happy when I’m drunk because of the newfound confidence it gives me. I don’t want it to be a crutch, but I have noticed when I am anticipating a wedding, party, etc. I feel the need to drink.** 

I dated an narcissist on/off for 4 years. He also never listened to me &amp; always thought he was right. Although he was bad to me, he gave some meaning to my life &amp; helped fill my free time. I planned on moving in with him but, instead, decided I would have been so much more miserable with him. I was, however, excited about moving in with him because it meant I could finally grow up. I would have had an apt. &amp; probably would have driven more (out of obligation) by now. I probably would have been miserable with him, but at least I could say I was acting like an adult. I so badly want a partner too but what partner would want me? I am also afraid to commit to someone again because I don’t want to get hurt. People have told me how pretty I am and how guys must be all over me but it’s not the case.

I listed these things because I feel that they led me to where I am right now. I feel cursed because I know I have the potential to do all these things, but I just can't. I’m finishing my last semester of college and am working a remote internship, but I just can't see anything after this. I have no money to buy my independence (home, car, bills). I want to get out of my situation, but it just seems impossible. My ex was the only time I saw a way out. I’m so in debt from college &amp; barely make any money with how little time I have. I was so proud of myself to get this internship but after 2 months, I’ve lost motivation &amp; it’s showing in my work flow. I feel like these things help excuse my inability in acting like an adult and just don’t see what will happen after I’m done with them.

**I feel lost &amp; stuck. How do I get out of this when my life feels so hopeless?**"
ddzpug,0,2019-10-06,Inverviewed by same person in a short period of time,stayjae,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ddzpug/inverviewed_by_same_person_in_a_short_period_of/,"I recently had interview for internship position for one company at university, which I think I messed up because it was scheduled almost a day before the interview that I did not prepare well enough.

And then, I was selected for new grad role (first round interview) for the same company, happening at same location (the university).

Time interval between these two interviews are around 2 weeks which is pretty short.

I see high possibility of being interviewed by the same person since it is at university and my university is not one of biggest university.

I wonder how much my internship interview would affect me passing new grad interview regardless of how good I do for the new grad role interview.

I am quite confident that I will do better for sure since I had prepared after the internship interview.

Am I worrying too much? If the interviewer does not recognize me, do you think it is still better to mention that I did interview few weeks ago?

Also, if I get to be interviewed by same person and since it is very first round of interview, it is only 30mins. I can see high possibility of being asked same question. If I am asked same question (like behavioral question), should I reply with same answer if I think my answer is still the best answer I can give?

Thank you in advance."

I am currently finishing my master's degree in computer science and applied mathematics. Except for a year-long internship where I didn't do anything cool to be proud of, there is nothing interesting about my experience. Even worse than that, I live in Central Asia.

Today I read an article written by an experience developer from a Big-4 company where she claims that companies like Google are not very much interested these days in candidates with less than 4 years of experience or otherwise obviously valuable for the company. This, as well as the fact that I am not a US/EU resident, seems to make the odds very low for me to even land an interview at a huge company like Google or Amazon.

Do you think I should adjust my expectations and stop thriving for the ""big list"" companies? I just want to make sure that I am pragmatic and realistic enough. It doesn't mean, of course, that I am going to immediately stop grokking algorithms and practicing Leetcode problems, but it would definitely be very painful to get my expectations adjusted ""the hard way"".

Thank you!"
de4mfn,1,2019-10-06,No Big 4 Interview,sillycookies7,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/de4mfn/no_big_4_interview/,"Hi friends,

Im currently a junior seeking internships for summer 2020 in L.A.. Recruiting season for the big 4s is here and I got no interviews with the big 4s except for one, which is the only one I didnt really want b/c of other personal reasons and experiences.

I come from top 10 acct programs have a 3.8/4 gpa and recently got Tableau certified. Everyone from our school goes to the big 4 and I'm just here feeling super left out and feeling that Im not good enough. I worked at a large automotive acquisition corp during my last summer where I did internal audits, business valuation, and financial planning. I have other relevant intern experiences as well and Im not sure now if that hurts me more or helps me.

I have no idea what I did wrong and I try really hard to put my best foot forward as a well rounded and likable candidate. Just feels really bad that I cant get in for whatever reason I dont know. Yet I see some people who  dont really care (not that theyre not great or anything) and easily get other big 4 offers :/ and yes i know a lot of it is fit and personality, but I like to think Im a decent person, but idk now :(

de5mje,3,2019-10-06,"27 Years Old. B.Sc. in Psychology/ Neuroscience. Experience Path= Psych Research, Food &amp; Bev, Account Management (7-months), Business Operations (1-Year). Now Looking At Salesforce Administrator or Digital Marketing?",environmentpsych,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/de5mje/27_years_old_bsc_in_psychology_neuroscience/,"Hi All,

First off, I want to thank any of you who might be able to provide any insight here into a possible career trajectory for me, as I feel rather lost. I can send my resume to anyone if they feel what I provide below is not sufficient for guidance, or if it would help complete the picture. I will preface this by saying my goal is to do well financially (like most people), be happy with my work and derive meaning from it, *and eventually work entirely remotely (I travel a lot and being able to move around would mean a lot to me).*

**About Me:**

I am a 27-Year old living in the United States. I graduated at 24 with my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology/ Neuroscience. I continued to do Pyschology research while working in food &amp; beverage. I mostly focused on Lifestyle Medicine, and using everyday behaviors &amp; habits to achieve optimal states of well-being and performance. I still focus on this personally, but am not doing psychology research with anyone or any institution.

**My Work History**

I had a variety of jobs through college, nothing really noteworthy, with the exception of my gig as a radio personality to an FM station where I spoke about health psychology, optimizing performance through habits/nutrition/nature/social relationships/ etc. I did psychology research through college, and for a little after. I ended up with a published paper in my school's research journal. I even traveled down to Peru on a health psychology apprenticeship (receiving school credit) where I studied herbal medicine under shamans of the Amazon. After graduating, I helped doing research/ permission acquisitions for the publication of a new Positive Psychology textbook as well (paid).

I also started many different side-businesses via WordPress websites that I made throughout and after college. None were successful (I never made any money), but I learned a lot in customizing premium WP themes, using all the social media platforms, running ad campaigns, leveraging random softwares, writing content- that stuff was fun. With my psychology research background, I also enjoyed manipulating little pieces of an ad or site to increase effectiveness/ alter human behavior. I had a site that was a compendium of knowledge in functional medicine, I ran an herbal retail shop with my own herbal formula for brain performance (never fully launched, but I built everything up to the marketing), I built a business that would have helped people become digital nomads while abroad and I curated their travel itineraries (once again, never fully launched, but fully built and organized up to the marketing campaigns). I did freelance writing on Upwork for a little bit, and still have some published papers around the internet in the sphere of neuroscience. I also joined &amp; helped grew a crypto investment group- I grew it from 60 to 900 members, but never reaped the monetary benefits due to me not setting boundaries that I should have. On that last note, I left the crypto stuff for my job in the next paragraph. Now I am working on a new site with a friend- a community forum for a niche group of people, and a compendium for resources as well as educational courses.

Around 25-Years of age, I began a job at a call-center'esque place doing Account Management and Inside Sales on behalf of Google Maps. I used a lot of Excel and a lot of Salesforce daily. I stayed in this position for 7-months, I did very well. I have a strong phone presence, my clients loved me, and I over-attained on my quota each quarter at about 200%. The pay wasn't amazing though (about $13/ an hour, with a $2,500 bonus potential every quarter). After 7-months, several co-workers were leaving for another place of employment that was establishing a new healthcare hub here. The pay was $26/ hour, which was enticing. I had also been applying to other jobs, as at the time I didn't see how valuable the experience in account management/inside sales actually was.

I was pitted between the $26/hour job (more money than I thought i'd ever make, honestly) and a digital marketing/ growth hacking job. The digital marketing job was going to be a 3-month internship at $9.62/hour for 40 hours (with extra money doing side projects through the week at another 10-20 hours a week - so working 50-60 hours a week for little pay). There was an opportunity to be brought on at a higher rate after those 3 months. I took the healthcare job in business operations doing contracts for $26/ hour. In this job I use a lot of Salesforce daily, do a lot of research in various other programs, and coordinate frequently between sales, service, finance, and business analysts.

**The Present**

So now, I am thinking about my future. I don't want to do contracts for the rest of my life, so I'm thinking about what I want my life to be. A pivot that would make sense from where I am is Salesforce Administrator- the pay would be good and I have a fair background to leverage in attempts at getting my foot in the door if I get the certification. I am also thinking about trying to get into digital marketing, but I have 0 relevant professional experience. Only personal entrepreneurial endeavors that I have little proof existed (except for my current project/ website) as I stopped paying for the hosting and let the sites/content disappear... I was but a mere broke college student who wasn't thinking long-term. I have some remnants from those past projects, but nothing really for a portfolio.

Would digital marketing be as hard of a pivot as I am thinking? I don't *really* want to take that significant of a pay-cut, as I have $40,000 in student loans (eek) and live in an expensive city. Would pursuing the Salesforce administrator route make me able to do things related to digital marketing? Are there any other jobs that come to mind through reading my history?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for any advice- love you all.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr-** Did Psychology research through college and after, have made several attempts at entrepreneurial ventures through sites/business ideas i've built (made no money off any of them). Worked 7-months in account management/inside sales (used salesforce), now 1-year in business operations/ contracts (using salesforce), and trying to decide the next move for my life professionally. Could I be considered for digital marketing jobs? Would Salesforce admin be my best bet for financial success? Any suggestions for how I can pivot to do well financially, derive meaning from my work, and be able to work remotely? I'm chasing time. Thank you."

Thing is though, while I will be mid-junior, I will only have taken two CS classes and not even into the 300-level courses yet. Would that be something that impedes me ability to get an internship, or what kind of things matter the most?

deayyv,299,2019-10-06,I just signed an offer letter - Thank you!,Childish_Ansari,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/deayyv/i_just_signed_an_offer_letter_thank_you/,"I wanted to say a big and sincere thank you to everyone on this sub. I've spent the last year reading all the advice everyone gives during my job hunt, and it has finally paid off.

I graduated with my M.A. from a top-tier school in Fall 2018. I had a decent amount of experience, internships, contract jobs in my field, etc., but damn was it still hard as a new grad. I applied to 221 jobs over the course of 10 months. I had 19 phone screenings, 9 phone interviews, 3 video interviews, and 2 in-person interviews. I was applying to out-of-state positions, so they companies had to fly me out for my in-person interviews.

I signed my offer letter today. I'm making 65k + covered moving costs and flexible work hours. This job is my dream position and I am beyond excited. I'm moving to a new city this month and start shortly after.

My biggest regret during the experience were the times I would stop applying to positions because I was over-confident that I was going to get a position I was interviewing for. Definitely a mistake doing that, so if you're still on the grind, don't stop applying. I was offered a position early on, but they offered \~30k with not a lot of chance to advance. That was a hard no from me. I'm glad I waited.

Thank you r/jobs.

EDIT: Just wanted to mention that this company is one had previously told me no for whatever reason, but they called me a month or so later and asked if I was still available. I'm glad I sent thank you emails to everyone after the interview. I think it made a difference."
debe2i,7,2019-10-06,Coworkers with underdeveloped skills,KendrburyTales,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/debe2i/coworkers_with_underdeveloped_skills/,I was hired into a full time developer position after an internship at an IT company. One of the other interns was hired at the same time as me. They had very minimal development experience but were placed on my team because they expressed heavy interest in developing. I spent a lot of my first few months training them but have had to teach them very rudimentary things multiple times. I'm getting frustrated since we have the same pay rate but I've been doing their work as well as my own. I dont want to be not a team player or anything but I really don't think this person has the skills necessary to be a full time developer. What can I do here? Mentioning it to our manager seems like it would fall more negatively on me than them. I also don't want to just stop helping them because that seems like it would fall negatively on me as well. Any advice is appreciated!

What makes me a bit worried is that most of the work is based/focused in Excel, with ArcGIS being only used for the visualization aspect. I’ve worked with Excel for most of college, but I am worried about needing to do specific functions that I may not know. I am used to doing calculations and such within JMP.

I couldn't come up with anything else to name this. I am currently a jr in college. I am double majoring. I also have a minor in marketing.

My first major is integrative studies. It is a degree created using three areas of study. My areas are information science, business, and information science. My plan when using it on my resume is to list the title of it and the part that is related to the job. I would talk about other course work as needed in an interview or a cover letter.

For example, if it is a marketing job, I would list Integrative Studies with a focus in Business with a minor in marketing.

My second major is my backup plan. It is in technical communication. It is currently pays well in my area and my school has a 90% employment rate for graduates. 

My current problem is learned about two opportunities that I could do. They would throw my current plan. 

Orginally, I plan to get an internship during in marketing research, any marketing internship, technical communication internship, or just any internship. After graduating, work for 4-5 years and then go back to graduate school for a master's in marketing analytics. I want to work in marketing research.

Now I have learned of the McNair program. I could do undergraduate research which would be paid. I would get training/prep for applying to graduate school which I need because I am first-generation and know nothing of the process. But they want me to say that I am applying to a PHD program. I can also apply to master programs as well. I also will not be able to internships because I will be focused heavily on research. Another is that I don't know how much the stipend will be. I don't think I can work both my jobs and do my volunteer hours for my scholarship that gives me in-state tuition. I would also have to decide whether to do research with the marketing department or the anthropology department. Anthropology is one of the areas of my intergrative studies degree. I have taken a course in business anthropology and design anthropology.

My other option is an undergraduate fellowship. I would get to do research but it would get only get 500 dollars for a stipend. I will not get any help with figuring out graduate school.  However, I will be able to work my jobs and get an internship during the summer.

Should I stay with my orginal plan or just I try and jump on those other options? I don't know what to do. This is keeping me up at night."

&gt;It seems this server is behind NAT. What is its public IPv4 address or hostname? We need it for the clients to connect to the server.

Now, I'm new to systems administration and networking (still in school and just an intern, lol) and I know what a NAT is and I know how to find the public IP of my client devices, but since this server is running as a VM on an ESXi host, how do I go about configuring this? Which public IP do I use to make the VPN connection from outside my network? The one on my wireless router that is pointing to internet traffic?"

I realized my interest lie towards computational science and engineering. I see myself inclining more towards being a researcher.

The problem, however, is being able to afford the living costs and blocked account. I don't know much about that, and it'll be really helpful to get the details regarding that. Also, any details regarding scholarships would be really nice.

Next, I need to know what things i should keep in my mind if i want to plan on living there for long-term even after masters?

* Country of Citizenship = Pakistan
* Destination Country = Germany
* Education (formal) = Bachelors in Mechanical

I have found a Bachelor of Computer Science degree directed towards mobile and web development on Coursera which would allow me to study online and only go to a city near me to take the exams, the total cost of the degree would be around 20.000€

I could afford to do that but I was wondering if it would be worth it, or if those 4-5 years would be better spent building a nicer portfolio and getting certificates in more theoretical areas like Algorithms and Data Structures to make up for the absence of the degree. That would also allow me to put less financial strain on my wallet and not to work full time while also studying, which would be quite tiring. Any advice?

With that said, there is a potential opportunity for me to do a Project Management internship abroad in Shanghai (I'm from the US). 

I was thinking going abroad for project management would give me a little bit more breadth out of college. However, I'm not sure if I really have enough IT experience yet. Also if I go abroad, I will not be making money while I would if I stayed here.

What is your guys' opinion on this? Is being in the field of IT still more valuable than going abroad for project management?

If you need more information, I will gladly provide it. Thank you for the help!"

Every client can find the PXE server just fine, but when it is initializing, it takes a very long time and then gives me the 0x102 error. I have googled the error, and everyone is saying it is associated with DHCP options 60, 66 and 67.

I have an offer from company A, which is my last choice of all of the companies that I am interviewing with at the moment. I also got an offer from company B very recently, and at this point I have just over 24 hours to accept or reject it. I prefer B over A (better pay, new city, more exciting job). However, last week I interviewed with companies C and D, and I have an interview scheduled with company E later this week. I prefer C, D, and E over B. I have emailed C and D about my deadline to see if I can get an offer/rejection before the deadline but they have not responded yet. 

I absolutely do not want to accept B with the intention of later accepting an offer from C/D/E and basically cancel on B. I’m not that kind of person.

So should I take my chances and hope that C/D/E give me an offer, and worst case they don’t and I end up at A? Or should I just be cautious and accept the offer from B? Please feel free to ask for more info in the comments."

I was planning on continuing to teach myself during the excessive downtime at my job and then trying to land an internship, but I don't think I can bear through this job any more. It is miserable for so many reasons I don't want to go into in this post, and this city (NYC) is completely exhausting, dirty, and just makes me feel depressed. I have a communication degree with a cocentration in digital production and I feel like I completely fucked myself over, because it'll be so hard for me to find a job outside of LA or NYC while I continue to teach myself coding. Also no other job would give me the same downtime for certain. 

I live with my boyfriend and he gets stressed out from work and takes it out on me. He's extremely mean to me out of nowhere when the work week starts. I'm done and I need to get out of here without moving back home (a state away) or having another retail or food service job again.

I really want to live west somewhere like CO. It's my dream to live somewhere that I can be immersed in nature (and have some city close by) and I want to do it while I'm still young (26). 

My question is, should I just go back to school somewhere where I want to live? Should I just bear moving back home and getting a shitty temporary job while studying by myself? What's the smart move here? I'm currently so unhappy with my life.

Perhaps somewhat foolishly I did a 12 month internship in large business working in their IT department as a junior Project Manager. I deployed software company wide, I helped on large life-cycle projects. I helped and observed many little projects occurring and I used my spare time to get a PRINCE2 Cert and I've read numerous books on Business Analysis, SCRUM Master and even got a fair way through PMP and CCNA (I've ONLY got a PRINCE2 Cert, I'd not done the others, just read the books).

I'm searching for junior PM roles in what is a fairly large city in the UK and there is nothing that'd be considered entry level. I only have 1 years experience and any IT PM job I see asks for 3+ years.

Anyone have any advice how to even get onto the ladder for this type of job. Similarly Business Analysts tend to be hired via agencies and no agency is hiring an inexperienced Analyst. Seems like I wasted a year getting familiar with this job. But how do you get experience when there isn't even jobs I can do as internships anymore?

I'm considering simply just doing a internship as a Software Developer. But graduating and continuing to work for free was not what I had in mind."

The plan was for me to continue working as an intern the rest of my senior year and then be offered a full-time position upon graduation. 

Problem is, I recently realized that I have to take 3 more classes plus the 5 classes I'm already taking next semester. This happened because we need 3 liberal arts credits to graduate and I thought that the liberal arts classes I had already taken counted as both a liberal art elective and a core class credit (ex: I thought my history class counted as both a liberal art credit and also the history credit at the same time). In actuality, the class can only be applied to one of those credits.

So now I'm concerned that my company will let me go because I won't even be able to move into a salaried position for at least a whole year from now and I haven't heard of interns staying as interns that long (1.5 years) with companies. I'm not sure what will happen and I'm wondering if anyone has been in this kind of situation or if there are any managers who could tell me what they would do here. I plan on telling my manager very soon, but I wanted to confirm that all this is accurate with the academic advising team at my school, thought I'm pretty sure I'm right about my situation."

Ever since I graduated, I've had 2 Internships and 3 Full Time Software Engineer jobs. I have not been able to pass the probation period on any job I've had so far. 

1st Job I got laid off for being too junior and requesting constant help.

2nd Job again I was too junior and it apparently turned out to be a senior role. 

3rd Job, I was again laid off for not having the basic programming knowledge. But I did, and although I finished the project on time. They called me in for an apparent project update. But instead gave me the termination notice. 

I just graduated 2 Years ago in summer. And now I'm looking for a new job. And the first things these employers see is the short periods at my previous jobs. 

And usually as soon as I become available I get flooded with Recruiters. But so far since last week where I started applying for jobs again...it's been very quite.

Like I've not stayed at a company for more than 6 Months. I NEVER choose to resign, I always get the boot.

Should I give up on my life or is this normal?"

1. I'm going to graduate with a Finance degree from University of South Florida at the end of 2020. GPA should be a 3.3. I have not completed an internship. I have no network. I know no one. 

2. I can instead, pursue a Computer Science degree.  This would push my graduation to 2023. However, I'm very confident I can do well and maintain a similar GPA.

I should add, I don't mind being in school for the additional time since studying for the CFA or getting to 150 hours for the CPA would probably take the same amount of time.

Which degree, given my school is not targeted by anyone or anything, would yield the most job prospects that pay at least $50,000/year? I'm thinking I should stay in and go CS.

My other two LoRs should be pretty solid as well. I’m taking the GRE in a few weeks and I think I will do great (at least in Quant) given I’ve been practicing like a maniac. Also, my GPA hurts from my first two years but my last few semesters I’ve averaged a 3.7GPA.

dercvj,0,2019-10-07,Towing Company Drama,moltenQuartz,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dercvj/towing_company_drama/,"Hello,

I was in a fairly serious accident in the desert of Nevada about one month ago as I was relocating across the country back to school after my summer internship (that is to say, I have no connection to or in Nevada). I was at fault for the accident, and I only have liability insurance (so insurance won't be covering anything). My car was towed by highway patrol to get it off the road and I wasn't informed where to or given any information at all. The car was an old junker and is now totaled.

I recently received the bill from the towing company. The charges are about $1000 for towing and fees and another $1000 (and growing) for storage. They're charging me more for storage of scrap metal per day than I pay to store myself in my apartment.

I can't afford to pay what they're charging me, and that I've tried negotiating with them to pay for the cost of towing and related fees (what I see as services rendered). However, they've refused to negotiate and have threatened with auctioning the car in November (which they're welcome to do and which won't get them anything), as well as send the bill to collection (which will be around $4000 by the auction date).

I've been reading Nevada towing law and searching through other sources, but I haven't found many clear answers. The main question I'm trying to get answered is this: **what are the potential consequences of not paying?** As best as I can tell, the towing company is within their rights to sell the lien on the car - which I'm completely fine with. However, this will not approach covering the massive bill that they are claiming due. What I've tried to convey to them is that I, financially, have no other choice but to let them hang on to the car until the world ends if they aren't willing to come to the table. Further, auctioning the car and selling the remaining debt to collection will net them significantly less than what I'm willing to pay.

Any advice, resources or past experience would be welcome. Thank you for reading."

I just walked out of my first midterm, in a class that is supposed to be easy, knowing that I completely failed it. Super-duper failed it, actually.

My life plan is to graduate with a CS degree (for job security/money/knowledge), hopefully get into a Peace Corps position, then work in humanitarianism or go into startups, or even write novels (but that is not a sure way to make a living). Thing is, I have no motivation right now, no friends and three midterms over the next week-and-a-half.

I was thinking about taking the rest of this semester off, joining the Americorps (for 10 months) then coming back and finishing my degree.

(Long post)",Across_The_Carbs,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/dettjj/22_yrfemale_very_inexperienced_unsure_and_not/,"Hi there. Well I'll start with a little bit about myself. I just graduated college this past May with a degree in Communication studies and I did really enjoy it, but am so extremely lost as to where I am to go now. Due to family health issues as well as my own deep anxiety and depression at the time, I was never really able to do an internship in what one may think of doing being a Communication studies major. I did one internship that was focused on medical/healthcare administration, but it was very much administrative work and I did it because I thought I had wanted to go into the healthcare field. I've had one another research job as well as an admin. job for one of the departments at my school where I was doing a lot of admin work, but also dabbling in customer service occasionally. I don't know what I want and my parents are thankfully not pressuring me too hard, but do want me to get some sort of job to get my foot in the door/have an income which is totally understandable and is something I want as well. The problem is that every time I try to search for jobs thinking ""Oh I'll just apply for this admin job!"" I get stopped in my tracks because I feel like I should be doing something greater. Maybe if I had had internship, I would have more direction, but we're here now.

A little bit about myself is that: According to my Myers-Briggs, I am an ISFJ (pretty accurate, but don't make too many assumptions about me because of this haha), I am a very empathetic person with great listening skills. Although introverted sometimes, depending on the situation and people, I can definitely be more extroverted. I've discovered that I'm not too bad with customer service (I think?) and do genuinely enjoy talking to people. I truly value genuine conversations and helping people. Presentations and numbers though? Not so much my forte as public speaking gives me a great deal of anxiety (I know, ironic for a Comm. major), but I know that just comes with the job and depending on what it is I'm talking about or the situation at hand, I'm not that bad. So many people (and the Internet haha) have told me that I would be a great nurse bc I would have great bedside manner, and I honestly think I would be, but I am way past the point where i could do that and also, needles and actual medical work make me squeem a little. I think I would probably be good in non-profit, but sometimes I don't know if that's what I really want because to me, it's a safe option and I think I could push myself to do something beyond my comfort zone as scary as it is?

I did a ton of service/volunteer work in college and my school had an emphasis on social justice so sometimes I feel a pull towards doing something in that sector, but again, I have no idea what! I'm definitely not fit to be a lawyer...BUUUT a lifelong dream of mine is to work for Disney. It just seems so so far away and I don't even know what I would do. HR? PR? What else can I be?! I took one PR class before and it wasn't my favorite, but I would still try it again  (if I was qualified) if I was able to work for Disney. I just don't know what steps to make towards working for a huge company like that. I feel unfit for a big corporation like that, but I would still love to try. I know many people consider Disney a greedy, money-eating monster which sometimes I feel like is the opposite of the things I said I am and what I value above. But ah what can I say? I agree, but they got their reigns on me and I would kick myself in the butt if I didn't at least try to work for them. But besides them,  I don't know if I feel inclined to any other big corporation, but that may just because I am extremely inexperienced. So what type of jobs do I then go out for right now?  What steps do I take right now as someone who doesn't have much experience under her belt? Who will even hire me? I know this was a lot, but I appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this and has any suggestions or comments. It really means a lot to this extremely confused and lost gal right now."

So here's my situation in summary: Triple Major (Math, CS, Econ), senior, 3.9+ GPA, top 20 CS school (top 10-12 in AI). I am an international student F1 visa. Doing some academic research with some respected faculty in RL/AI. 

Here's my predicament, 0 internship experience (completely bombed all my interviews last year so got none + already extremely hard for international students), probably gonna bomb all my interviews this year too (I just can't get myself to pass any of these interviews, partially because I am underprepared, mostly due to the fact that I am not a good ""fit"" for any of the roles and I generally cannot say something that I do not believe in (answering questions like why work for us, blah blah)) &lt;- feeds in to not having any internship experience or significant coding projects (only course work). I feel like I should highlight that I rarely ever hear back from any tech company applications (had Google reply to me last year) the rest are for roles that aren't tech related (consulting, quant, etc...)

So this is my predicament, what do? I ideally would like to get a job although the aforementioned may make it seem like I don't care; problem is I believe that I will probably never be selected due to no experience + no fit for this year. Now, what are my options? Go into grad school? Would this give me a better chance at getting a job or is it the same thing over and over again (no internship experience no job/no fit)?

Would appreciate any serious advice/guidance on my potential ways forward...

df06ce,477,2019-10-08,Infinite Loops are Edge Cases?,NeppyMan,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/df06ce/infinite_loops_are_edge_cases/,"This is a request from another thread.  I posted an anecdote about a Twitter bot run by a company I used to work for, and was asked to make a full post out of it.

So here goes...

At the time, I was working as a NOC tech for a company known for math software.  They run a Twitter bot where you can submit code snippets by tagging the bot, and the bot will parse the code, render a graphical result, and post it back to Twitter.  It's a neat little tech demo for the product.

The bot lived on a VM in the production environment, and the guest didn't have a lot of resources allocated; it didn't see too much traffic, so even though it was doing some potentially computationally-intensive work (3D graphics were a very common thing to render), it wasn't in use enough to warrant a lot of allocation.

The code for the bot was also a bit on the rough side.  Its logging was particularly noteworthy; it logged all activity - without timestamps - to a single file, and had no rotation set up, either on the application or OS level.  It also didn't have any checks in place as to who it was replying to; there was a moderation team responsible for removing the occasional troll post where people would tweet to it with offensive usernames, or similar.  There was also a problem with the bot replying to itself; if you included the bot's name in the message, the rendered result would be picked up by the bot and queued for another reply.  We had discovered this by accident, and the developer said that it wasn't a big deal (big mistake).

Despite all of that, it worked well enough, and was spotlighted sometimes by news articles, and the occasional contest run by the marketing department.

Well, one day, the marketing department went to drum up some publicity, and posted a tweet from the main company account, tagging the bot's account.  Then they send a follow-up tweet from the bot's account, quoting the original reply.

This results in a tweet with two mentions of the bot's name.

And this goes about as well as you might expect, for not-polished code without proper error checking.

The bot fires off a response to itself, rendering the result. Which triggers a response, and another render, and... well, you get the idea.

The guest VM running the bot, having never been provisioned for this kind of capacity (rendering several tweets every second), goes absolutely haywire.  It maxes the CPU and memory consumption quickly, which starts to generate errors.  The single (very large, at this point - on the order of several GB) log file starts to bloat.  And the VM environment starts to hang because of all of the traffic (it wasn't designed to handle that kind of I/O).

Thankfully, we managed to kill (almost literally; Force Stop and the VM's disk ended up moderately corrupted because of it) the VM guest before it got too out-of-hand.  And Twitter actually suspended the bot, which also put a stop to it.

A poor intern still ended up having to delete - by hand! - several thousand tweets.  It took them a few days.

The bot developer, meanwhile, learned a valuable lesson about what constitutes an ""edge case"" (and why you don't ignore them).  And ""error handling""..."

I got the following e-mail on 9/30 

""Hello! Congratulations - your interviews went well and I would like to move forward with our recruiting process for our Financial Analyst Internship to start on December 27. Our HR team will be in contact with you for any additional steps to be completed. If you have any questions, please let me know and again - Congrats to you!!""

It was difficult to discern if this meant I was getting an offer or a next round of interviews. I reached out to a friend who held the internship previously, and at first he said it was an offer, but then after a few hours he said the spoke with someone else and there was a new cognitive test I still needed to pass. 

How long do I wait before reaching out to the person who sent the email? I know 8ish days doesn't seem long but for some reason I am worried.  Other applications seem to be dropping like flies, and I would love to have this offer in my pocket for a bit of a confidence boost for other interviews in the coming week. Any advice / knowledge would be greatly appreciated!"

I’ve liked my cs classes so far, but I don’t know whether I’m cut out for this competition for internships and jobs.

The thing is, I just landed my first full-time job at quite good IT company.

During my years of studying I never worked or even had an internship due to personal related health issues.

However, now, here I am, and I am in some state of shock.

How can it be that after all these struggles and years of studying - this office full-time job IS the ultimate goal that about which we should dream and fight to reach?

How can anyone willingly sell 5/7 of their lifetime away... just, I don't know, sitting at desk, sharing stories with colleagues near cooler and all this stuff?

I'm also experiencing some anxiety-related physical issues right now, so that may be clouding my jugment.

It's not that I don't want to work. I realize that is absolutely neccessary part of life. I always loved studying, doing stuff... It's quite okay to me to spend most time of the day just working hard.

However, this inflexibilty, having to sit at my desk from 9 to 6 even if there is nothing noteworthy to do... It just drives me crazy.  


So, can anyone share, why having a full-time office job is.. good?"

I decided to reach out because I've just started my junior year and I'm thinking about what to do for the future. Before we start, here's my ""resume"":

Top 20 engineering school in US; Chemical Engineering; 3.84 GPA; Relatively highly involved with extracurriculars in my first 2 years; Currently doing undergrad research in 2 labs; Did an engineering-related internship back in my home country for summer 2019.

Like most juniors, I've recently started actively applying for positions for summer 2020. However, I realized that most engineering companies unrelated to CS/software are unwilling to hire international students. Even for companies that indicate they are willing to sponsor, it seems that getting accepted as an international is extremely difficult based on what others have said. That being said, I have some questions:

1. How realistic is it for me to land a Chem Eng related internship in the US? I understand that most internships to internationals are mostly located in CS fields but unfortunately I'm not strong in CS.
2. I'm planning to go to grad school. Will grad school help future employment prospects in the US?
3. Or should I focus my job search in other countries, considering the difficulty of working in the US for foreign nationals?

I appreciate any advice. Thank you."

The easiest thing to do would be just getting a job close to where I live. But I can't get the thought off my mind to go somewhere abroad like USA or Australia - not for long, just a few months, maybe a year. But is that even possible? Will any employer in those fields take me for that short amount of time? Maybe as a trainee, does that make sense? Or an internship? But those don't really make sense when you've already got a master's degree, at least that's what I was told.

I’ve never been a family oriented person. My brother and I don’t get along. My parents and I have had issues but we’ve been doing better lately and I love them despite our rocky history. Only my maternal grandparents are still alive but my grandpa had  a stroke a little over a year ago. My whole life I’ve been eager to get out of the house and go to college in a different part of the country, partially for independence, partially to see a different part of the country/culture. 

Last fall, I went to a school in the midwest and it was great until I had to medically withdraw. But now I can’t go back for reasons that don’t matter here. 

So I picked another school I was accepted to, this time on the east coast. They have everything I want academically, the website lists all but 1 extracurricular I want, and I’d have internship opportunities I couldn’t get in where I live. 

Because of new medical issues, I applied to a school near home as a safety net. But now I’m wondering if I should seriously consider it. It has what I want academically. It has some, but not all, of the extracurriculars I want. It doesn’t have the internship opportunities. But it’s only an hour’s drive from home. 

I’ve been realizing that, if I get the job I want, I’ll be lucky if I get to see my family once a year. There’s no promise I can be home for holidays, weddings, funerals, anything. My college years are likely the last years I can consistently see my family. 

I’m hoping to get in the job I want through a highly competitive fellowship so I really need to make myself stand out while in college. I don’t know if the school close to home will help with that beyond getting good grades. 


So with all that information, what do you all think? Do I go to the school that feels pretty much perfect for me but is literally on the opposite side of the country, or do I settle for less so I can be closer to my family while I still can?"

df81vb,8,2019-10-08,What can I expect at the Computer Science Night?,OlayColay,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/df81vb/what_can_i_expect_at_the_computer_science_night/,"I'm a first-year CS major that has no relevant work experience (worked as a lifeguard for a couple of years). I'm thinking about going to the \[computer science night\]([https://www.facebook.com/events/ucla-ackerman-grand-ballroom/ucla-computer-science-night/2392615810776219/](https://www.facebook.com/events/ucla-ackerman-grand-ballroom/ucla-computer-science-night/2392615810776219/)) to look for potential summer internships.

What should I expect if I go? I know that freshmen don't usually get summer internships in CS and that they don't really need to, but is it worthwhile to go anyways?"
df83wt,0,2019-10-08,Negotiating return offer for APM position,lancer_moyen,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/df83wt/negotiating_return_offer_for_apm_position/,"Hi, after a summer internship at a decently large tech company in Austin TX,  I just received a written offer for an Associate Product Manager position for post graduation (CS major). I've done some research on negotiations (Kalzumeus, this sub, etc) but most resources weren't exactly addressed for new grads and wanted to ask some specific questions here. I apologize if this comes off as redundant, just very green in the industry but wanted to get this right. The offer I received is as follows:

Base salary: 90k

Signing bonus: 10k

1st &amp; 2nd year anniversary bonus: 10k ea.

RSU after 3 years: \~50k

**My main points of ""leverage"" would be that**

A) An APM from a previous year received the exact same offer as a new grad hire (didn't intern), and he was able to negotiate 5k more in signing bonus. I read that intern-&gt;full time candidates have more leverage compared to a blind hire (less risk, less resources to train etc).

B) Currently interviewing with two other large tech companies with reputation for high offers, but I won't get the final results before this current offer expires. Would say something like ""If I can get X% increase I'll sign right away"" (I'm aware this is not much of a leverage).

My goal is to be able to bump the signing bonus from 10k -&gt; 25k.

**My Questions:**

1. Are my points of leverage valid/reasonable (mainly point A) in regards to bumping my signing bonus to 25k? Is it even appropriate to bring up that I know this information?
2. Is it unwise to lead the discussion in terms of signing bonus, or must I speak in terms of ""% increase in TC"", and negotiate where how that will come about after? (Signing bonus is the most appealing to me since APMs get promoted to PM in about 2 years anyways, and I could use it to pay off loans).

Thank you very much, appreciate any insight/feedback."

I am currently a senior in CS and will graduate in May 2020. I am also in a program at my university that allows me to take 500 level classes as an undergrad and complete my masters in just one additional year. This leaves me in an odd period of having a CS degree and then returning for another in a short span of time. I could try to gain a research position at my university, but I think I'd rather continue to build roots in the industry to perhaps secure a job post-graduation.   
The problem is most internships aren't for graduates, and most master's internships aren't for people who haven't technically started their masters.

Any recommendations? Anyone go through something similar?"

I am current a software engineer in the data engineering team at a large retailer. The position I am looking at is a CI / CD Engineer for a small consultant company that has a contract with the DoD. It would be 1 year in length and the work revolves around deployments and containers. The pay would be 90k in Texas and I would get healthcare and 401k(no matching). It is a half onsite, half remote so I would be in New York during the days I would be remote. My questions are would this hurt my chances of working in one of the big tech firms. I heard that government development work doesn't look that good to recruiters in big tech companies. I am also wondering if job jumping often looks bad on the resume? All my positions that I had in the past were either internships or contract based positions so they were relatively short term (All were less then a year). I am interested in this position because I think the experience and technologies learned may be valuable I'm not too sure. Thoughts?"

Exactly as the title states.

I have an internship and classes right now and my work is so late for my internship. 

I keep on making excuses and I’ve handed in half of what I’ve needed to but holy shit.


My head is so full of fucking noise I feel like I’m gonna break down and cry.


It’s almost unbearable. 

I’m white knuckling it and clenching my jaw while my brain just jumps rapidly from one thing to the next and it’s torture.


I haven’t been able to sleep because something in my head is always screaming for my immediate attention and I’m a slave to my impulse to either get up and walk around, or look at my computer, or make my bed three times or start tomorrows work RIGHT NOW even though I haven’t finished today’s.



The worst part is how embarrassed I am. 

I’m sure my bosses and friends and professors all think I don’t give a shit about my work.

I keep on telling them that I’m so sorry, that I really am trying, that I am passionate about my work but I know my actions don’t show it.


I just need some words of encouragement and any advice you may have; I’m on ADHD medication and it usually works but every so often I have spells like this."

Right now, Im not doing the best I'm school. I know internship opportunities are a great thing to do for the experience and getting a job in the future. But I also know that grades and learning the coursework is also one of my priorities. But again because this job sounds like something I really want to do in the future. I feel conflicted if I should try to pursue this opportunity. 

Do you think I should spend the effort to try interviewing with the company or do you think it is better in the long run to just focus on doing good I'm school? 

I'm also thinking maybe I will message the person who reached out to me and tell them that while I am grateful they reached out to me, and I would love to do the job since it's what I want to do in the future, I don't think I can work in the school semester. But that I am free in the summer, and by then, I should be ready to perform full time and have even additional skills. 

Thanks everyone"

Everyone in my family expects me to go to Princeton and it’s a lot of fucking pressure and I just want to chill out with my friends and listen to music and read and code and girls and do what I love to do and not have to worry abt this existential threat anymore. But yeah. Chance me.

Demographics: Male, White, Connecticut, Private Junior Boarding School, Princeton legacy (mom went there)

Intended Major(s): CS/Math though I love literature and French so subject to change

ACT/SAT/SAT II: 1600 SAT, 800 Math 2, waiting on Literature score but think I did well enough

UW/W GPA and Rank: School doesn’t do ranking or weighted GPA’s, but I have a 5.85/6.00 where 6.00 is 97-100 and 5.5 is a 92-96.

Coursework: Have 7 APs so far and am taking 4 more this year. All 5’s (Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Statistics, BC Calc, English Language, Computer Science A) except for one 4 (Euro History)

Awards: Brown University Book Award, School Computer Science Award, Cum Laude Society, NMS Commendation, AP Scholar with Distinction

Extracurriculars: 
1. Run my own business similar to door dash using day students to deliver food to wealthy boarders for a high fee (coded backend, chatbot, website). Last two terms generated nearly $25k revenue ($5k profit)

2. Play a lot of piano, though no awards to show for it; this is generally a passion I found in classical music on my own and I don’t like to perform much b/c of nerves and the fact that I only ever want to play pieces infinitely too hard for me like Rach 3 (i’m insane)

3. Code a lot and have multiple projects to show for it, including financial strategy backtesting system using my schools Bloomberg Terminal, a sneakerbot I sold briefly, and other small projects within and without school

4. Président of Finance Club and Coding club. In finance club I generally talk about tech stuff and in coding club I teach students how to code and make their own projects like a chatbot for easy access to their attendance and online homework. Also on the math team, but i’m cheeks at competitive math

5.  In terms of athletics I played squash and soccer in the first two years of high school and plan to pick up squash again this winter, but I was on thirds and JV so they’re more of just fun things I do with friends

6. Do math and science peer tutoring every Friday night for 2 hours. This is my school job but it’s the meager community service I have so...

ÉDIT: Forgot to add in that I had a paid internship in California for this entire summer at a simulation software startup. That goes somewhere near the top of my list of EC’s.

Essays/LORs/Other: 
LOR 1: English teacher junior year, gave me brown book award and walked me through new exploration of reading when I found Proust. Calls me the « answer key «  so should be okay 9/10

LOR 2: CS teacher junior year, I already code copiously in my free time so that class was a breeze for me and I spent a lot of my time helping others. The teacher gave me the CS award and called my code truly « beautiful » in his speech  so 9/10 again I’m guessing; my college counselor says both are good

Essays: Common app portrays my interest in creation stemming from when I was a little kid and built a blog to share papercrafts (an art type thing I used to do). Tie it into how I now influence others as the person who introduced me to papercrafts did 8 years ago. Very unique at least and people seem to like it, but can never judge based on what friends &amp; family say. Teacher likes it a lot though. ??/10
Supplement (question with the quote) I wrote about how reading Proust changed my life (Majorly difficult topic to not sound like an absolute snob, had to layer on the self deprecating humor). More humor and personality and shows more of who I am, especially how I like diversification. Again, people seem to really like it but who tf knows ??/10

I've been in an internship since early this year and now do part time with the internship and full time with school. I have been going to college for 6 years now and I have worked a bunch of low pay labor jobs until this first internship I have. 

I've been noticing an extreme decline latley in my performance in class and at work. I literally just noticed a math assignment that was due 49 minutes ago. I can't seem to think about complex problems because my mind does everything in it's power to function low. Whether this is some regular expressions or solving a bug in my applications at work. When I do try to tackle it, it usually takes forever and I feel like my brain isn't even learning, I'm just trying to solve the problem to move on.

I have been missing out assignments in my math class and in my engineering class I completely forgot to do some extremely vital steps in one of my projects which caused a huge grade decline. I don't know what's wrong with me. I literally have to force myself to get out of bed just to go to class. It feels like I'm not happy at all. I struggle financially because of the low paying internship which adds huge stress because of the finances. I've been broke for so many years my mind has just given up. I don't care about college anymore and I'm trying my best just to keep it together so I can graduate in two months.

I'm just worried what if I'm doing something I don't love. What if I'm done and tired with programming? Deep down I don't believe it because I think it's just my body reacting to me being stuck in a situation for years of being a student and no income. I want to believe when I graduate and land a good role that it might spark my interest and passion back up for coding and with the money paying back debt will free my mind and snowball back to happiness. I don't know, what do you guys think?"

After 2 internships and an on campus job, I just feel like I'm in the wrong field. I don't hate it but I also don't love it anymore. 

Another problem is that the IT program at my university was kind of lackluster (at least from what I can tell) so I just feel like an imposter going with the flow all the time.

I didnt get any reply so after 2 weeks I emailed them again but this time I only asked if there were any openings. I still didnt get any reply. Is there something that I am doing wrong?

dfezw7,1,2019-10-09,The company that I work in is undergoing layoffs. Got any tips for someone with great soft-skills that wants to stay in the tech field?,LilYungThrowaway,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dfezw7/the_company_that_i_work_in_is_undergoing_layoffs/,"Hey hey people.

I could use some advice. I started working in this company (Europe) 1 year and 1 month ago. I came in as an intern, after 4 months I was promoted to Support Agent and 5 months after that I was promoted to a role that benefits a lot from my soft skills - let's call it DM.

Due to financial concerns, I couldn't finish my Communications degree. I've always been a little bit lost regarding what the hell I want to pursue as a career, but after I got promoted so quickly, I felt pretty good with my position and the way that the company valued me.

Now, however, this company is undergoing layoffs, and they're going to get rid of the DM role in the company and they want to reduce overall headcount on site. Personally I wouldn't enjoy at all going back to Support, since I felt anxious most of the time due to lack of general knowledge of IT - I know a lot for a normal person, but not that much when compared to my peers. Also, I'm not even sure if they would even want me there, considering that I was very much in the middle of the pack when it came to KPIs.

Therefore, a big question comes to mind: if I do get laid off, where do I go to? I've been dabbling with Project Management a bit in the DM role, and that seems like the ideal path for me, but with no academical background and only an ITIL certificate to back me up, I'm not sure I can get it.

Any ideas?"

Every internship seems like it was worse than the last, either making employees lives harder so management can circle jerk about production numbers or automating the work of six people to a single robot, not a single day has ever been spent as an engineer where I left work feeling I did anything that was worthwhile and didn't make me a piece of human garbage. 

I also have a computer science degree, but I never used it because I love computer science and programming and as such, hate actually doing it for a living. So I'm stuck with one degree I love so I won't use and one degree I hate and don't want to use. 

What I am concerned about is possibly in the future if I ever stop wanting to blow my brains out on a daily basis and by some miracle of God manage to find someone stupid enough to start a family with me, I'd like to use the engineering degree to make money even if it means hating living second of my life. But will graduating and never having actually used the degree for anything throw any major red flags when I try to actually use it in 5+ years? I know I've been told my computer science degree has ""expired"" because I never used it and the knowledge is too different for people to consider hiring me with it now. I'm concerned the same thing will happen with my engineering degree."

currently i’m balancing the difficulty of two majors, which limits courses on the cs side (i wouldn’t want to take cmsc412 with a hard math course, for example). 

but, since i already almost have 120 credits, i’m considering dropping math, which will allow me to take harder cs courses, which will let me do the cyber security specialization, which will help w my career, compared to math, which i don’t think ill do anything with.  or, i could take easier cs courses and then graduate with a math major, and i’m only three classes away

*Profile*

- 3rd year at semi target, doing 4.5 years so I still have SA 2021 on the table

- Well above 3.5 GPA

- Some mid office legal and compliance work at a very well respected institutional asset manager, so in that sense I already have a good ""name brand"" on my resume

*The outstanding offers*

- Mid/Back Office Fixed Income Trade Support at upper middle market bank

- Front office (business development and execution) at a very recently founded start up investment bank

I really like both of the offers, and both sound really interesting to me, so I feel I'm in a good place, just conflicted. Long term, I'd much rather do client facing front office work.

*Waiting*

I am waiting to hear back from a well respected Economic, Litigation, Restructuring consulting firm (like, just a step below if not equal to Brattle, Analysis Group, etc), I have already pressed them to try to get back to me ASAP. There's a chance that they won't by the time I need to take/reject the offers I have on hand. So far, this is my top choice. I'd essentially be doing the work of an analyst/junior associate in litigation/disputes consulting from my understanding.

I am a third year Oxbridge student. I'm studying Physics but I am interested to see what it is like to do algorithmic trading/quant trading/quant research and I would like to do an internship over the next summer in a trading company. I am interested in probability, statistics, coding, machine learning and application of these in finance. I have done a spring week in a large bank and a summer internship focused on ML at Big N company. In previous two years I was in top 3% of students regarding final grades at my university.  
So far, I have seen interesting programs at Jump Trading, GSA Capital, Two Sigma and Citadel. I wonder if anyone could suggest any other companies to look for? I would like the internship to be a mix of coding/research and math and of course a lot of exposure to the real business. I prefer companies in the UK but if there are any willing to sponsor visa I would consider going to the US as well. Also, any experience or advice would be highly appreciated either in comments or in pm. I don't know much about interview processes and topics I should practice. If you have done internships at some of these companies and are willing to chat with me I would be really thankful!

I was unable to fight it of course because I was under probation so they let me go and their reason was “you are so new we just don’t want to risk keeping you here”. 

I have never been in trouble or would do something so stupid to ruin my career. I’m now stuck in a house I can barely afford and can’t break my lease for another 6 months. I had to give my dog to my parents because I’m now working 2 jobs to stay afloat and trying my best to make time for my new girlfriend and keep a positive attitude. I have never been suicidal or anything but I’m starting to see how spiraling really messes with you. ( I’m not going to kill myself don’t worry). 

I now work as a security officer and run into people from my police department, it’s pretty humiliating, and I have applied to so many jobs trying to get an internship for my major.Because I took a semester off and now I have to explain why I was let go from a police department it’s next to impossible. I just feel like it sucks to literally be a decent human being and just have life completely poo on you for the last 6 months. Anyways thanks for reading guys feels good to share."

They had nothing setup in terms of Github, no standards, no code reviews and it made sense since it was only 1 guy. When I joined I was in charge of the frontend for a major web app for internal use while the other guy did the backend. As time passed we started adding more guys to the team and I introduced Github so sharing and working would be easier. Now that we have 8 guys, our productivity has tanked due to no uniformity, testing, code reviews, and everyone working on everything(You can create 1 function today and by the end of the week, it would have looked completely different due to 3 other people editing it). Before this, I was part of a 3 team startup as a intern and I learned about some features like code review before merges, using Jenkins to automatically deploy your tests and unit testing as a whole. 

Can anyone give me some tips or places to learn more about managing our team and projects internally? I know there must be so much that it might be its own career field outside of programming but I want to start learning to implement it into our workplace to make all our lives easier and more productive."

I work at a Big N tech company with a lot of Research/Applied Scientist and PhD requiring roles and we've been talking a little bit about my experiences (I do not have a PhD). She is thinking about going in to the industry rather than academia, and I can only offer so much perspective on the matter. So, I have a few questions:

1. What is your perspective on industry vs academia for new PhDs (preferably if you have a PhD and have gone through this)?
2. What companies and areas would you say are best (specific companies, but general category can help too) based on her background? This is taking in to account CoL and interestingness and opportunities in areas to live (currently she's on the East Coast but open to moving to most places) and in terms of companies, workload and culture for researchers, compensation for someone of her situation, career path or advancement opportunities, what kind of work is done (how interesting/cutting edge she could work on after getting hired), and any other metrics that are relevant?

My school has a dedicated IT school and something I've noticed are people putting certain programming languages as skills on their resumes. To give further background, A lot of these student put languages like python, R and other languages as they're used in some of the courses. The program BARELY touches on programming and as someone who came from CS, I can say that barely any of these students actually know how to program. For example, I was talking to one of my friends who put python on his resume. I asked him what his experience was in the language and he cited the ONE introduction to programming class in the school that I'd say someone in CS would learn in about a month. I took a few programming classes in CS so I know that the majority of the students in my major definitely don't have enough proficiency to be putting these languages on their resume. 

Am I wrong in any of this at all? I don't put any programming languages under my skills section on my resume because I know that what I know is just the basics of each language. Should I be putting those languages as skills on my resume even though I'm a beginner at them. I barely consider myself a beginner in programming so I often wonder what my peers consider of themselves. Also, A lot of these students seem to be hearing back more from internships than me, so I'm wondering if I should just put stuff on my resume anyways. What do you guys think of this?

I see two options for this, either I continue working in this multinational company and apply to be transferred to the US, or I apply directly to american companies from here.

The problem is that I won’t have an american degree/education, this has raised some issues already as I had to pass the TOEFL test to go on an exchange program in Italy.

So do you guys know anyone in a similar situation? Should I just apply for jobs normally and add to my curriculum that I’m american and won’t need a visa? If you guys also have any tips, I would love to read them :)

I am a student in my 2nd year of my bachelor’s in CS and I am asking myself questions whether CS is really for me and I was hoping to get a little insight from you guys.

I am going to be honest, I chose CS because I didn’t like my other job which was very “customer-service-y”. I find dealing constantly with customers is draining and I need my space. I preferred all tasks that I had to do once the customer left (fill in forms, do verifications, a little manual work). I figured CS could be an option since the job environment seemed nice (lots of perks, get to be with people that have a similar personality to mine, not constantly dealing with customers, doing my own thing, etc).

The thing is, I don’t know if I’m smart enough for the job. I had an internship in web development and I felt constantly lost in how to get things done. I know that I need to give myself a chance and that it is only the beginning, but I’m really wondering if it will get any better. 

You know how they say to be a good programmer you need to be a good googler? Well, I definitely search online daily, and I find myself having trouble even understanding what I find online and that definitely scares me for the future because I know this will be constantly part of my job. I very often had to ask questions to my supervisor and sometimes he would just send me some links to the documentation and I felt ashamed of saying I don’t even understand them. I felt like I can’t be independent and I hate it. However, the change of environment is definitely for the better, I prefer it a thousand times better, calm environment with friendly coworkers and no drama like my other jobs. Just chill people. 

In Uni I have very good grades (only A’s up until now), but it is definitely not because I understand things easy. In fact, in some classes I don’t even understand what I’m doing. I am just a very structured and organized person, I take the right notes and I manage my time well, I partner with good teammates, I study and memorize like crazy and I am very detail-oriented.

Considering these strong points (organized, methodological, good at following specific steps), would there be a good job in CS for me? Even if not in CS, are there some types of jobs that would suit me better? I am considering data analysis, QA or UI/UX for now, but I honestly don’t really know them that well and I don’t know if they are code-heavy or good for me."

It's big and well-known in the Bay Area. One option is to play it safe and take the return offer.

But I'm also in my third year of college, and I'm kind of curious about other companies, as well as other jobs.

But my parents are hinting that the economy, tech included, is headed for a downturn around the time that I graduate, and that I should try to get an offer now before it's too late. Something ominous like that.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are as follows:

* Can people change companies/jobs after they graduate without extreme difficulty? Thinking about early/mid 20s, maybe late 20s?
* Are internships meant to be a way to get a full-time offer, or a way to try out different jobs? What's the best way to approach them?
* Would turning down the company's offer negatively affect my relationship with them in the future?

I'm a 21 year old ECE student. I'm studying in Dublin, Ireland. Whilst I'm in second year, I'm only being introduced to much of the EE field this semester due to first year being a ""general"" year, after which you pick your specialty. 140 students last year, now there's 25 doing ECE.

My program is focused on Electronic &amp; Computer Engineering. Basically, at the end of the year - if you pass - you get a number called your passlist number. It's basically an indicator of what place you came in terms of grades in relation to the rest of your class. I'm quite intelligent, and after repeating first year (Was 19 when I first came into college, became addicted to coke and spent some time in a rehabilitation center) I want to do the best I possibly can.

So I've made that a written down goal. I **will** get number one on that list. I have smaller goals to go with it, such as hitting the gym five days a week (going good), regular study fitting a timetable and so on. What I'm here to ask is:

How should I balance my study time vs actually building things? We do a lab on linux every week for programming, we have a lab every second week on networks (such as using Wireshark to analyze packets) and most weeks (starting next week) we'll have a lab on building digital (and analogue) circuits.

My subjects are: Networks, Maths, Circuit Analysis, Digital and Analogue electronics, Operating systems.

At the moment what I've mainly been doing was learning the theory. Exception for Operating Systems, most of which I learn using my laptop. I'm not sure where I'd start - we get our kits next week with logic gates etc. I might get some ideas, but anyone have any recommendations on easy things to build from which I could learn some valuable lessons? I need to do good this year, as it'll decide just where I can go for my internship."
dfv64v,0,2019-10-10,Internship troubles!!,tkmdx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dfv64v/internship_troubles/,"Hi all

So I've been going through old posts on this subreddit trying to see if I can find anything relatable to my situation , but virtually all of them involve people here assessing resumes and such. 

So I wanted to reach out and see if anyone can see any issues or red flags that I'm just not seeing regarding applying for internships. I can send you my resume / GitHub / website / etc by request.

A bit of background about me, I'm a third year CS student ( just transferred from a community college ), and I seem to be having serious trouble just getting to the interview stage. Out of the seemingly hundreds of applications I send out I seem to 70% of the time not even hear a thing back ( sometimes I do but it's months later ), 20% of the time I get a direct no, and then the other 10% I get to a coding test stage where it usually seems to stop there with the exception of one time with Google.

Now here's the real catch, as a first year student I had this same trouble but ended up finding an internship about a few weeks before summer started to some web startup. I ended up doing very well there and they gave me a full time position with a 70k salary and benefits, all while willing to work with my school schedule as I went through community college.

I worked at this place for a year and a half until management changed and they no longer allowed remote work, and thus I had to let the job go just this past August.

So here I am with a year and a half of full time experience , tons of activity on my GitHub and side projects that have been ongoing since even before the internship, and I am still going completely unnoticed.


I truly do not understand it, what more do they want? I don't think I know or have met a single student that has also been a full time employee doing software development in all of my years of school, what is it that I'm doing wrong? 

I don't know if this matters either but I've been doing hobbyist programming since I was in middle school over 12 years ago. I mention this in my cover letter but again, I don't know if this matters much, it sure does not seem to.

A while back I thought that's really nice and that I want to do it, I even already had plans to go to a specific country. Now my gf is gone for a month because of an internship she has to do and I have to say that I already miss her. And all that reminded me of when she was gone for over half a year which was a tough time for me. As I would be gone for \~4-5 months, that really made me think if I really want to go abroad for such a long time. In that case it wouldn't be only my gf that I don't see, but also my family and friends and I don't know how I would handle that, but the thought of it makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm not someone that get's to know people easily (and that is even a quote of my best friend that knows me forever). So I'm not someone who would step in the new university or go out and meet new people immediately to hang out with and do stuff. And I feel like I'm really not the guy who enjoys doing this. I kind of fear to be really lonely on the trip. Even at home I only really have one really good friend that I know forever and I don't miss anything. I'm fine with it and don't feel like I need more than that (I do have colleagues from university and work tho, I just don't really spend much time with them outside of that and wouldn't call them ""friends""). What I want to say is that I'm not a social weirdo (at least I hope so), I'm just really shy and a silent type of person.

Another point for me is that I like to be at home. I know that this sounds stupid, but I like my own home and my own stuff. I don't know if it's clear what I mean by this and I really don't know how I could explain this... Vacation is fine with me but then after 2 or 3 weeks I really like to return home and have my own bed and stuff. I know people who are the same and I'm curious if we're alltogether weird or if there's more people who feel like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have talked to a lot of people and many of them told me that a semester abroad is an unique experience that I shouldn't miss out on, it's a unique chance to do this, it forms your character, it's a lot of fun, and if I have the chance to do it, why not just take it? Well I don't feel like I want or need any of this in my life and am really not sure what to think about this. It really does feel like some kind of peer pressure, that because so many people like the idea, I have to like it as well. Many people weird out when I say that I'm not interested in studying abroad.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really like to hear your advice. Am I being childish, or do you think these are valid reasons to not do the semester abroad? I mean there are many people that didn't do it before, it's not like everybody on earth does it, so why would it be that important to do it, when I really dislike the idea? What do you think about this all?

Maybe I can tell you my thought on solving my issue, so these are the things I considered to do about this:

1. Obviously I could just do the semester abroad but you already read my reasons not to, so...
2. I could do the semester in a university that is technically abroad, but is just 100km away from where I live right now (I live close to the border of another country), which would mean that I wouldn't have to leave but would get my semester abroad. I would stay at home and go there the few times a week that I would need to to visit lectures and pass my exams. So I would basically keep everything how it is right now. (still have to figure out if this really works that way)
3. Last option would be to change to another university that does not have an obligatory semester abroad."

I don't know where I stand. I'm a ME with electrical and physics experience. I did two internships at my university's physics labs during my junior year up until I graduated. One lasted a little longer because I was able claim it as work study. There, I was able to do a bit of everything as the labs didn't have enough manpower. Projects I dealt with had a mixture of ME, EE, and Physics elements.

I've attended the career fairs at my college and have gotten different feedback from explaining my experience. Some said my part-time internships don't count and others said I'm over qualified for entry level. This is were I get confused. Should I be applying to entry level positions or more experience positions?

The furthest I've been able to get in applying, is four phone interview out of the hundreds of applications I've lost count of. My resume has changed a great length to what it is now, but I was more successful when I had small paragraphs instead of bullet points. Two of the phone interviews I was able to get threw recommendation from my classmates, but I bombed those. :(

This is my latest resume from the last job I applied to. I tailor each resume to the position I apply to. Frankly I'm getting tired of tailoring because I keep getting rejected by the ATS. I do use jobscan to see how I fair up and I can never get pass 30%.

Honestly I'll take anything at this point that has engineering in it. I've been looking for 2 years now and I'm mentally exhausted. I quit my last full time job so that I could have time to applying to grad school for something in computer science.

Thank you for any feedback.

I'm a college freshman at the very start of nearly everything IT related. I'll have time to study for certs and take internships. However, there is one thing that significantly hinders any career I pursue: Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. I naturally wake up around 6 PM and go to bed around 10 AM, and sustaining any ""normal"" schedule like 9-5 is impossible. I can get by with slightly adjusting my schedule a few hours back so that I wake up in the afternoon, and [chronotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotherapy_(sleep_phase) works for short periods of time, but these are not optimal. In general, night shifts work so much better than anything else.

I'm curious as to what career options I have. I did some searching both here and elsewhere, and mostly see data center and NOC jobs get brought up a lot. My biggest concern is, how is the career mobility? I don't want to get stuck in a dead-end job that only pays slightly above the Southern California low-income line."

My ultimate goal is to manage a hospital/practice. I plan on going for my Masters in Healthcare Administration, however the programs I am looking at require 2-3 years relevant experience.

I currently have little to no relevant experience. I worked previously at a daycare, which I wrote on my resume that I would help with taking payments, answer phones, basic customer service, training staff, and following licensing and daycare policies. I currently am interning at a government office (local government and my internship had to be government related since it's for credit). At my internship, I wrote that I have experience with computer skills, like using Word, Excel, data entry, etc.

Now, I am currently looking for a job for December. All ""entry"" level jobs in Healthcare Admin. seem to require experience. So, I am just trying to find any job that would give me the experience and pays decent. The pay part is where I'm having the most trouble. 

For example, I just got an interview scheduled for a small company. It's not exactly what I'm looking for in healthcare, since this company provides caretakers for the elderly, but it's a start. However, Indeed tells me it pays $11 an hour. I'm looking to move out within the next few months with my boyfriend, who is also starting out, and I don't feel that $11 is enough. Is this reason enough to turn down a job? Sure, it might get my foot in the door, but if I take the job, I'd feel required to work there for at least 1-2 years and I just don't want to be pinching pennies for the next two years.

I understand I won't be making a six figure salary or even close to that anytime soon. But, the lowest I want to go salary wise is $35,000 a year and that's the absolute lowest. My ideal would be $40,000.

Am I asking too much?"

I'm asking because I don't own a suit and I was planning to go business casual (shirt, tie, khakis, quarter zip, dress shoes).

2) Is it worth it to go as a sophomore who has no prior internships?

I don't have any past internships, however, I have a decent amount of personal projects that I created either by myself or with a group of four people. I also finished Data Structures, both Discrete Structures, and I'm currently enrolled in Computer Architecture and Principles of Info and Data Management.

3) Which companies attending are generally more open to hiring people with no prior experience?

I decided I can't be picky with what internships I want to take on as I mainly just want to have some industry experience and to learn software development through an internship. 

4) Is it reasonable to talk to at least three representatives in an hour and 30  minutes.

I'm asking because I went to the fair last year and saw huge lines.

Ultimately I want to do research in these fields and so I'll probably end up in a PhD program later down the line even if I only enter a Ms program now. My concern is that even though I've spent a ridiculous amount of time reading up on schools, looking at requirements and preparing to apply I feel ill-informed about what to do.

# My questions:

Does anyone have any recommendations for **schools that offer a good AI or ML specialization**. I'm interested in reinforcement learning, computer vision (especially generative models), but I feel very open to a lot of other sub-fields as well. I'm aware of a lot of the really high-tier ones but my concern is that I'm not sure I'd necessarily get into them.  I'm having a really hard time figuring out what schools I could reasonably expect to get into that also offer exciting research opportunities in my field of interest. I also am not sure how many schools I should apply for.

My current top school is the University of Alberta (I'm impressed by a good number of their CS staff, especially the most recent additions.) I am looking in particular at the thesis based masters program with perhaps a statistical machine learning specialization. **Am I a competitive candidate for this program?**

Given that I know I want to do research, I'm also considering applying directly to PhD tracks in the US as I'm assuming I'll end there anyway. Currently my plan is to apply for PhD in the US but masters in Europe (because of how much the price difference is for masters studies). Is this a reasonable thing to do? Is my one year of research internship that isn't even complete going to be enough for a PhD application? I did a research based thesis for my Bs in reinforcement learning as well, but that was only 12 ECTS units.

**What makes a good writing sample?** I do not have any published papers, but I am doing research at my current job and might be publishing something in January. I did my bachelors thesis with an amazing adviser and the research was fun, but my group could have done much better with regards to setting up the experiments properly. Looking back at it, the paper isn't awfully impressive and I'm not sure if it's something I'd like to include in an application.

**Should I keep my involvement in the youth council of a political party on my application or not**, should I specify the party? It is to the left of the Overton Window, especially in the US. Does this kind of experience even matter on a grad school application?

**Should I seek out and talk to specific professors** about their areas of interest/openness to taking on new students as advisers/current projects before applying? Do I need to have completely decided what I want to research before making the application?

I'm sorry if these are stupid questions, I've never had to make a ""real"" application before. : ("

I started out in my degree behind everyone else because I didn’t test high enough in math so I started in algebra. 

Talking with other engineers around me it feels as if they don’t struggle half as much as I do. If someone else studies 2 hours for an exam I have to study 4, and they still end up with the better grade then me. Things come easier for others than it does me. No one else seems to struggle as much as I do. 

My GPA slowly started to tank but I have now gotten it back up to a 3.0. I applied for internship after internship with no luck, until this past spring. I landed a co-op with a very reputable company. I thought I was set after that. I’ve applied for more internships around my area with no luck.

I have looked at online branches of B&amp;M, but cost and time is a big factor. So here it goes, as I'm trying to gather as much information as possible.

1. Would employers discriminate against a WGU graduate when it comes to jobs, or would you as a hiring manager be willing to interview and/or hire a WGU graduate? It is after all an accredited institution, and it's not like I'm trying to take the easy way out, because I do want to pursue my masters at a B&amp;M.
2. Traditional universities have networking booths and summer internship opportunities. This is naturally harder at WGU. What can a WGU student do to maximize their career opportunity after graduation? Hypothetically, I would be looking at cloud security."

I'm a college senior/4th year undergrad looking for some opinions on pursuing a PhD after I graduate. 

I am in an engineering field in the UK for reference.

I'm trying to decide if I should complete a one-year master's program next year before finding a job in industry, or if I should pursue a PhD instead.

This is my current situation and I'd really appreciate any insight from people who may have been in a similar situation before!

\- I've always been academically gifted (currently top of my class of approx 70) and have always been interested in the idea of research, however, sometimes I feel like I'm not creative enough to come up with new technologies, but that may just be my insecurities talking? How much of a PhD/research career is really 'coming up with new technologies'? The more I learn, the more I feel that creativity is not the most important factor at play

\- I have completed an internship in a research position in industry. I enjoyed this, but don't think I would be qualified for a similar job without a PhD - 2/3 full time engineers i worked with had PhDs, one research masters + a lot of industry experience. A typical engineering job in quality/operations/etc doesn't interest me at all. 

\- I know I would be sacrificing substantial earnings for \~4 years. I live a simple life and could easily support myself with the typical stipend, but how tough is the emotional turmoil of ""all my friends are getting promotions and i'm still living on a miserable salary"" in reality?

\- I'm not sure yet if I could see myself working in academia or industry. What kind of doors does a PhD open for either of these? (Obviously required for academia, but how difficult is it to get a good job in academia if this is a route i decide to pursue?)  What kind of postdoctoral work would I be looking at upon PhD completion?

\- Most importantly, I have spoken with a researcher at my university who has told me she would be very interested in interviewing me for a PhD position. It is a really exciting opportunity in a really interesting field, working with some top researchers in the field. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand this is probably a bit disjointed, but really I am just looking for some impartial guidance!

A bit of background about me, I’m currently a cs major in my sophomore year of college and I’ve been working at my internship location for about a year now. While I initially started my first few months working with python, the past years or so I have been working with older legacy software and a rather outdated language(think COBAL). First I want to say that I really appreciate the opportunity to get to work in the field doing actual development while still only a sophomore. But, I would like to switch over to newer tech or at least something a bit more modern. All things considered, at my current role with the work I’ve been given , I feel like I’ve performed pretty well all the task that I’ve been given( taken on multiple stories/breaks, worked with people from other teams to complete task)I’ve talk about this in the past with my manager and she say that it really doesn’t matter what language/technology you’re working on. “Once you learn one you should be able to pick up anything”.  That may be true, but, I feel like I’m gonna get stuck in my current role and as time progresses it’s gonna be harder for me to leave. I feel like since I’m still technically just an intern I don’t have as much pull to be able to switch over to other teams like an actual full time employee would. I have set up a 1 on 1 meeting with my manager next week to discuss this. How would I go about trying to convince my manager to allow me to move to a different role?"

I am a senior with a focus in cyber security, but only have one internship under my belt and no certifications. For my internship, I built a pen test environment for the company, along with learning about various tools/frameworks and did some CISO work alongside them. 

The only other jobs I've had tech related were doing computer and phone repairs, along with various other duties like mass hard drive wiping. I am currently building a sudo homelab out of some spare parts from previous computer builds I've had and tried to go for an A+ cert over the summer, but due to me needing money I didn't have the time or funds to do so. 

I have tried to become a member of our cyber club on campus, but the others in the club were way over my head with their knowledge and I often sat on the sidelines. I haven't gone to any CTFs either because I'm worried my lack of knowledge might set the group back and embarrass me. Recently I've started opening up to them however so they might be more inclined to include me idk.

I just had an interview with GE and they almost immediately turned me down through email after we were done. I know that's definitely shooting high and I feel honored they even considered me, but I am worried about where to go from here. All the companies I applied to at my school's job fair have yet to get back to me about any possible jobs/spring internships and I really hate my current job (repairing phones), so tdlr I have a few questions:

1. What certifications should I go for as a cyber security specialist who either wants to be an analyst or pen tester and in what order?

2. How to study for a cert and how difficult is the A+ exam? I've already studied a lot but I don't have much info on how the test actually goes and what it's contents are.

3. How should I optimise my job searching? I try using LinkedIn and Indeed but I seem to never find anything that's isn't across the country.

4. What should I include on my resume/how do I nail a job interview, I've gotten better through my attempts but everyone always tells me different things.

5. Any good guides to creating a homelab? While I have experience through my internship, I didn't do much networking so on that I am not sure where to go.

6. What sort of things should I be learning related to cyber once I get a lab up and running? 

7. If all else fails and I can't land a job in my field right away, what is the next best thing? Help desk work? 

8. How open are CTFs? Are they inclusive for beginners? Should I try to join the cyber club again now that I've started to make friends?

9. Anything else I missed?

Thanks ahead of time, hopefully my internship company will hire me since they seemed to like me. I'm going to a cyber conference tomorrow morning, wish me luck, hopefully I can find a lead!!"

I hope this doesn't come across as a meaningless brag, I would really appreciate your sincere input.

Quick summary:
- BSc in Economics, Management, and Computer Science. Strong foundation in Statistics, courses in CS, Programming, and Machine Learning at top economics/business (I know it could be a deal breaker) school in my country (very well globally ranked too);
- Exchange student at CMU starting from January 2020. Unfortunally at School of Business, but I'll be allowed to take courses from other departments as well, which I definitely plan on doing;
- GPA 4.0/4.0 if converted to US scale;
- GRE 164V/169Q, waiting for AWA;
- IELTS 8.0 (R9, L9, W6, S7);
- 3-month long experience as Operations Intern at Amazon, where I was allowed to implement data analysis ideas (also ML) quite freely;
- Multiple MOOCS in CS, Data Science, Deep Learning, etc.


I consider my profile to be respectable up to this point, but here come the problems:
- Little (basically none) research experience: Bachelor's in my country are 3 years long and not exactly research focused, so I didn't have neither the time nor the opportunity to undertake meaningful research projects until last September. This is exactly why I'm applying for a MSc: I want to spend 1-2 years in an exciting learning/researching environment before deciding if I'm ready to embark on a Stats/ML PhD journey; to be fair, since last September, I've been Research Assistant for a Computational Finance Professor and this role is allowing me to further explore NLP techniques (""accidentally"" close to getting state of the art performance in a particular task) as part of a Finance research project that he deems very promising; additionally, I'm about to get started with my undergraduate thesis, also focusing on Deep Learning;
- Should be able to get two (maybe very) good LORs from research and thesis supervisors, and I can technically ask for the third one to some ""big name"" at my school.

So how high could/should I aim? 
My dream program would be CMU's MSc in Machine Learning or Computational Data Science, but I'm worried that my academic/research background would immediately disqualify me from getting admitted.

What other school would you suggest?
I am most definitely applying to ETH Zurich, but the US are tempting. Maybe Georgia Tech is a match? 
I'd be okay with an unfunded admission, if the program is worth the money.

I am eager to hear your suggestions, everything is welcome!

Cheers to you guys and sorry for the lengthy post!"

Couple of months ago I've uploaded my first app on Play Store. My plan was never to make money out of it nor to advertise my app so people can download it, it's just for my portfolio. It's really niche app only in one language available, but it got some 50+ downloads and most of the reviews were 5 stars, but also a few negative reviews, for no reason.

It's really bummer and I can't seem to handle bad reviews, I don't even know what is wrong so I can try to fix it. I've been working on my second app, which is much bigger code base, also for my portfolio before starting to apply for internships or jobs, but I'm getting feeling I'm not suited for app development because of this, but programming's really fun again for me because I was getting tired of web dev."

Wanted some recommendations from more experienced people if possible :) 

So here's been my career path so far -- I've been with the same Accounting firm for the past 5 years (will be 6 in March)

&amp;#x200B;

For the first two years I was an Intern in IT -- pretty much a lot of Helpdesk and some projects.

The second two years they gave me a full-time position as a SysAdmin -- again, lots of Helpdesk but they included me in more projects with some security here and there (because they knew that was my interest)

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, this year in March, I was re-positioned to Application Security Administrator. I've been extremely happy with the job as my role finally changed and I had finally moved away from Helpdesk. My daily days look like this: 

\-Managing Carbon Black Protection (Application Control / Application Whitelisting)

\-Using our Endpoint Management to push out updates

\-Managing Microsoft Intune for MAM

\-Manage Mimecast Administration Console, create policies for spam filtering, etc

\-Working with our InfoSec Manager for new policies &amp; procedures 

\-Work with our external SOC team to respond to any alerts / suspicious activity

\-Also learning Carbon Black Defense (Next-Gen Anti-Virus) -- just a little unfamiliar with common TTPs.

Basically lots of stuff I'm really interested in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have recommendations on next steps for me? I definitely want to stay in Security / Digital Forensics. I'm also currently going for my Master's in Forensic Computing. 

What should my career path look like and what certs does everyone recommend? I currently have Security+. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance! :)"

I ask a question that I have in my mind for long time: I’m beginner developer (although I have been programming for a long time, I still consider myself a beginner).I have seen many languages ​​during these years (Java, C #, Python, some Javascript, HTML, CSS, a little PHP and the various MVC architectures, APIs , networking and a little SQL and MySQL).But even though I’ve seen all these things, I’d like to create something, even to find a job and prove to myself that I can program (sometimes there are days that discourage me because of my skills because sometimes I consider myself logical 📷).My problem that I saw a lot of sites even for freelancers and I saw that there are so many people who know how to do many things and have many years of experience so I am very discouraged by this as I won’t be able to find a job (I’m currently in an internship, but I don’t like it).I asked for suggestions about it:-What languages ​​should I concentrate on? (I am now adoring Python and I’m also looking at some Javascript and Golang)

* What principles or architectures should I look further? (aka MVC)
* What projects should I consider to include in my developer portfolio?
* What are the steps to becoming a full-stack developer?If there were any suggestions on paths to take before becoming a good programmer are welcome!(Sorry for long post 📷)P.S Sorry also for my bad English, but It’s not my first language ( I’m Italian girl)

With all of this information in mind, should I dedicate a large portion of time to studying for the GMAT while doing these two classes? Since I’ll have three internships to my name, will it hurt me if I spent that semester just focusing on school? I would be willing to work a part time job/internship; the only two options I have in mind is Best Buy and the place I interned with originally, but both would involve a major pay drop (I make $16/hr now, will be at $33/hour for summer).

I saw that the requirements for the MS CSE program is 40 units.

I'm an international student, so I have to be enrolled in at least 12 units per semester. That also means I cannot delay graduation once I'm done with my 40 units.

My plan is to spread out my time in at least 4 quarters, so that I have enough time to do at least 1 summer internship, and also I can look for full-time jobs in my last fall quarter too. I'm thinking a 12/12/12/4 units split would allow me to study in 4 quarters. Is this what most people do? Does that mean most MS CSE folk graduate in December, and usually only take 4 units their last quarter?

Also while I'm at it - would you say that the comprehensive exam at the end of the course is difficult to pass? Are there many cases where MS degrees are denied because a student has failed the comprehensive exam?

I currently am an hourly intern at a software development company and have accepted a full-time offer that I start in December when I graduate.

My company has some UI code that I'm not particularly fond of but we don't have any time to actually fix it. I really enjoy programming, specifically front-end work and want to go in there and fix the problems with it.

From a legal standpoint only, are they legally allowed to let me work on company projects in my free free time without compensating me? The work would still have to go through both peer-review and quality-control by people who are on the clock in case that makes a difference.

The reason I specify from a legal standpoint only is because I'm aware that people will think they might try to take advantage of me in the future. I have enough reason to believe that is not the case and will not be the case.

EDIT: Instead of replying to all the comments, I figured I'd just make an update. The general consensus is that legally there's nothing saying I can't, there is unnecessary liability for my employer that they wouldn't be able to justify. Thank you so much for the help!"

I am a college student studying Information Systems, and was able to land myself a part time IT position with very quickly growing Ma and Pa shop that works with my class schedule, and lets me complete a summer internship for next summer at a different company! Hard to argue with that. Anyway, I am the only ""On-Site"" IT guy in the company, and before they have had a consultant manage the environment for the past 4 years, and decided they needed someone onsite and to start an actual IT department down the road.  


Now my responsibilities are really interesting, as I have been given full admin rights to our Domain Controllers, exchange server, and will be eventually helping with other pieces of the environment so that I can try to make ""proactive"" changes for the company. I feel like I have a whole lot of technical learning to do, but I am mostly questioning how to start building rapport with all the other employees in the company. This is my very first time as a ""lone IT guy"" role in a company, or even working in a company with about 75 users in it, so I am flustered on how to build that relationship with my peers, especially so that I can know what their roles are in the company so that I can better support them.  


For anyone who has been in a similar situation, what would you recommend I do? This is probably me overthinking it all, but I figured it wouldn't hurt checking in anyway.

If you know who I am, please shoot me a DM so I can take this down. Holy wall of text, right? There is a TLDR at the bottom if that's your thing. 

**Background:** I've been out of college for a little over a year now after graduating from a University with a B.S. in computer science. I  went to community college for a year and after getting a 4.0 I was able to get into a University. I wound up getting a scholarship at my community college and then was regularly on the Dean's list throughout my 3 years of being at the University. I had to take 5-6 (4 credit classes, most only take 4 a semester) classes to finish my degree on time because of the loss of credits through transferring and overall it was relatively easy for me.

**Where I went wrong:** During my junior and senior years, a lot was made about applying to jobs early while they are looking to hire new grads. Unfortunately for me, I was able to complete all but 4 credits before may of 2018, which left me in a situation where I either come back for a class the following year, or I get an internship over the summer and it would count as the four credits I needed. So I spent that time applying for internships, but most of the places I applied saw I would be graduating and wanted to hire me full time but refused to take part in the internship process, so I had no choice but to decline interviews for full time positions.

Flash forward a bit and I finally got an internship that didn't care I was a senior, and when I went back to my school and told them, they informed me that they could instead pull some strings and get me to not need one. I was pissed and annoyed but felt like I couldn't go back on my word to the company so I sucked it up and made crap money for 4-6 hours a day for only 4 days a week and spent the rest of my time applying to jobs doing odds and ends to make cash. Internship finished, and I had a few offers and wound up taking the one I thought was best despite it paying way less than I was hoping for. I was at least able to negotiate some extra money to start.

**What I do now:** I have a fancy job title and I am referred to as a ""senior member"" of our team but I honestly don't get to do much. I'm contracted out to another company that is going through a large scale project and I do 3rd/4th level support work, application/integration testing, project planning, documentation &amp; KB writing to teach the service desk, and manage/help a small portion of the team that is overseas. I work with the architects and other high ranking people to carry out what they think needs to be done at the mid to lower level. It all sounds great, especially for someone 1 year out of school, but the project I am working on has been moving at a mind-numbingly slow pace due to the nature of it which I'm not going to disclose in detail. It is incredibly important for the company and it is their own actions over the past 20 years that have made it so difficult and slow. I am on call for most of the day when we are not in a planning phase while we move from section to section of the  project. Some days I have 10 hours of work to do, other days just two or three.

I am not a lazy person, and in every job I have worked at, even in a manual labor trade, I put my all into it and am constantly looking for more work, but there just isn't any here for me. I try to automate as much of the process as possible and make things easier for those I work with, but it still isn't a lot. The guy I mainly work with is older, and it takes him two times as long to do things as it does for me to do it and I honestly envy him at this point. I feel like a dirtbag because I find myself studying new technologies on company time when I could be working, but again, there isn't a lot for me to do when this happens.

Occasionally I help the company I work (not contracted out to) for with things outside of the project I'm on, I do some scripting here and there, and I would love to reach out to them and see if I can do more, but the problem is almost everyone else there works days + nights + weekends because of the nature of the work that part of the company does. I am really the exception here and if I wasn't on this project I really doubt that I would have ever taken the job. It is insane to me that they work around the clock almost every day of the week even on vacation, and I do not want to get sucked into it which has only compounded the predicament I feel that I am in. What  they do requires constant monitoring and I can't balance  doing that with the waves of requests from my project which expects me to be available during working hours at the drop of a dime. I find myself constantly wondering if I am being over dramatic about the working on weekends and nights because of how widely accepted it is at this company, but on this subreddit I have seen nothing but disdain and outrage about companies that operate like this. My family feels similarly about the idea of it.

**Feeling desperate:** The only answer I could come up with is that I need to continue working on this project while bolstering my resume and eventually start applying elsewhere so I don't stagnate my career. The project is approved for another year so I have set my deadline to around that date. I plan to try and bolster my resume with at least 1 or 2 certifications from AWS and maybe Net+ or something. I've been teaching myself powershell, python, docker, aws, Linux and some other stuff and have more planned to get to. I think cloud infrastructure is what interests me most currently and I'll likely have to go to the city to be able to break ingot the field, which is ok. I spend hours every night studying to make up for what I feel I am missing out on at work.

I'm not sure if I am doing the right thing, and I know a lot of people might wish for this situation, but I want to learn more, gain more experience, feel accomplished, and progress my career and I have been beating myself up over the whole thing to a likely unhealthy degree. I just wanted to get all of this off my chest and see what you guys think. I know a lot of you are overworked and will likely scoff at some of the things I said, but trust me it feels like crap.

**TLDR:** Computer science grad out of school for one year, did internship for no reason, have a decent job that allowed me to skip helpdesk and have a cool title, sometimes I get to do a lot, but most of the time I really don't, I feel lazy and worthless like I am taking advantage of the system but attempting to do work outside of my project for my company could get me stuck working nights &amp; weekends as well as during the day, been studying hard for the past month to get into AWS/DevOps/other stuff, not sure what to do."

I started a new job with a Fortune 500 company in November 2018. I was hired at the same time as another woman, and we were both hired as contract workers. Meaning, we both were technically staffed through a separate agency and not the actual company. In the interview and shortly after being hired, my boss made it clear that the plan was to bring both of us on full time, shortly after the holidays.  
  
**March 2019:**  
So, stupidly I was not officially asking about my full time employment because the woman I got hired with had not been brought on full time yet but she was keeping me in the loop about what our boss was saying and was telling me that everything he was saying applied to both of us. But March rolled along and it was announced that she was being brought on Full-Time. My boss didn't say anything to me about my employment status, and even though I had been checking in about once a month, no news came. During the meeting, my boss told me that the plan was still to bring me on and that the ""Rec Number"" should be posted in the next few days. I asked about my performance and if there was anything I could do and he always told me he was happy with m performance and looks at me the same as any other employee.  
  
**Early April 2019:**  
I checked back in with my boss about the rec opening up and he said ""Nothing yet...You are definitely on pace to be hired as soon as we get the OK"", the OK being a sign off from the higher ups. Exactly one week later, a member of our team was promoted to an outside role and that meant there was an opening on our team. I reached back out to my boss and he told me that I ""beat him to the punch"" and that he was already on top of it and should have everything signed off in the next day or two.  
**May 2019:**  
  
Our team got slammed with a huge quarter end at the end of April. It involves working long hours (as late as 2AM on some nights) and I wanted to give my boss some time to focus on that and use it as an opportunity to show my worth. I came in ready to bust my ass each and every day and offered help to my colleagues whenever they needed it. Shortly after the month end I sent my boss a long email asking him if there was anything he could do to expedite this process. I touched on the hard work I had been putting in and that I felt like I had earned full time status, once again he assured me that it was not anything to do with my performance and that he will push as much as he can for it. He told me if successful, a recruiter with the company will reach out and discuss the role further with me and after that I will have to go through the hiring process again ""drug screen, background check, etc."".  
Another two weeks passed and no traction had occurred. I reached out once again and my boss told me that ""we had a call and I am told your rec will be approved in the system *this week*. It then goes to recruiting and once they approve we can make an official offer"". A few days after this, a recruiter did in fact reach out and discussed the role with me further (salary expectations, responsibilities, etc.) and every thing seemed to be going according to plan. I was just happy that my hard work had been paying off and I would finally get full time status.  
That happiness quickly went away after my boss told me that all of the recs for the ""entire company"" were cancelled due to a hiring freeze. He told me that his superior was working to get it re-approved and that the net result is a 2 week delay.  
  
**June 2019:**  
I waited the time my boss told me and I searched in our system for the rec number my boss had given me and nothing came up, he assured me that it would be available the next day because he had a meeting with recruiting on the matter already.  
Mid-June my boss reached out and sent me a link for my rec and said ""Please reapply and let me know once complete"". I reapplied and he told me the offer I should expect from the recruiter and that I should hear from her soon. I did here from the recruiter and everything went according to plan, she asked me simple questions and told me the salary they were offering, and it seemed like everything was a go...except once again it was not.  
A week after I spoke with the recruiter I received this message, ""I appreciate your consideration of [COMPANY], but at this time recruiting for this position has concluded. I was devastated, and I thought that I had just been fired by the company. I reached out for explanation from my boss and he said ""We are investigating, standby"". He came back and told me that the recruiter was told by management to put all recs on hold, and again said it was due to a company hiring freeze.  
  
I asked for a meeting about all of this with him and his immediate supervisor to discuss everything. It was a 30 minute phone meeting where AGAIN, they said it had nothing to do with my work and that it is simply a company issue. At this point I was ready to just quit but I wanted to stay strong and hold on for the full time status that brought a great salary and benefits.

**July 2019:**  
I continued to push myself to work hard and show what I can offer the company. At this time, our company had a large internship program ongoing and our team was given two interns. It was nice because our team was short staffed and we were definitely being overworked. But one day I overheard a group of the interns talking (including our 2 interns) and they were talking about how much they were paid. One of the interns let it slip that the amount they made was MORE than what I had been making this entire time.  
I took this information to my boss and he replied back saying ""There is no way you are paid less than the interns, the interns are paid ***, it would make no business sense to pay interns more than reps."" But the amount he said interns make was higher than my current hourly wage, so I replied and said ""That *IS* more than I make.""  He told me that something is very wrong and that he would get back to me ASAP.  
  
He got back to me and told me that the staffing agency took more than they said they were going to and that he worked on a 33% hourly raise immediately. I accepted the increase and again tried to stay optimistic.

**September 2019:**  
  
Nothing major had happened since the wage discussion until mid-September my boss told me about an open position with the company outside of our team. He gave me information on the position and if I was interested he would reach out to the manager. I did just that and a few days later I had a phone meeting with the manager about the position. I thought it went very well and she even said that she ""felt good about it."" She set up a meeting with a member of her team to learn about day to day, I had the meeting and I felt it also went well.  
Shortly after a recruiter reached out and had a similar conversation with me about the position and that I should hear back soon on the decision.

**October 2019:**  
   
Shortly after the start of the month, our boss announced that two of the interns from the summer program were being brought on to help our team. That is why I decided to write this very long post. Today, I found out that both of these individuals were hired internally with the company, not with an outside agency like I had to. Now this entire time, I have not received any benefits, no PTO, no vacation time and a whole lot of other small things. For example, I have a different key card from the full time workers and I can't even get into the gym in our building. After confirming the news, I wanted advice on what to do. But that is also where things get kind of sticky.  
  
I have been applying to a number of different positions and nothing has really come from it. Had some close calls with scam marketing firms but other than that I haven't really had any traction. Further, I have a blip on my criminal record from a fight I got into while I was at college. It is only a misdemeanor but it has actually affected my work and personal life quite a bit. I am about to have a meeting with my boss and confront him on everything and especially how the interns were brought in as full time employees. I wanted advice on what I should do. I know that this company is not where I want my career to be forever but I am not sure what to do with bills to pay. I want to do so many other things and I have a degree that is basically useless. I am looking for all the help I can get and if you lasted this long, thank you for taking the time to read this.  

TLDR: Company has continually screwed me over and not sure where to go from here"

(GPA 3.4) I'm a little frustrated I couldn't spend as much time learning CS as the CS-majors. (Every quarter I've taken a CS class and Neuro class) I don't feel I have the same skills as someone who is CS or Math or Engineering. (I was out of school for a while before I came back so I struggle a bit with math. I enjoy it, but my University classes are too fast-paced for me to feel like I am thoroughly learning the material)
When I go to careers fairs, I feel extremely intimidated. I'm in a room full of people majoring in what I want to get into, and I'm a minor. I feel dumb, and in turn I try a little less I guess. :/ How do I get over this?

Also many of my CS friends have tutored or have Microsoft or Google internships. I had a small contracting job when I did UX and Front-end, but he let me go early. It's really killing me."
dgmav2,1,2019-10-11,"I'm afraid I'm not good enough for my position, is it normal to feel out of the loop?",HazRi27,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dgmav2/im_afraid_im_not_good_enough_for_my_position_is/,"I'm currently in my 2nd week interning as a software development engineer in one of the biggest companies in the world . They took me off campus after an exam and two technical programming interviews.

That being said, I was really good at problem solving and finding solutions to programs in C++. But this company is using JAVA and there's a lot of talk about things I don't know like error handling, throwing exceptions and unit tests and so on. I studied them for a bit so I know what they mean although I still don't know how to properly implement them.

So right now I'm really afraid that this job is way above me especially that my major is computer engineering so I'm bit further from programming than other interns. Is it normal to feel lost and have no idea what the hell is going on around me? And how can I practice them well and prove myself during the internship(they said good interns will get job offers when the 3 months end)?  Any help is deeply appreciated."

dgnhj4,2,2019-10-11,Having trouble deciding which job to take after graduation.,throwaway_baby12323,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dgnhj4/having_trouble_deciding_which_job_to_take_after/,"Hi, first I'd like to mention that this post is in not for humble brag. I understand I've been really lucky in getting my offers.

Now the question is, I have an offer from Microsoft and Google for a new grad position. As I interned at Microsoft, I know exactly what team I'll be joining at Microsoft and I haven't been told much about the team I'll be joining at Google.

In Microsoft, I'll be joining a security team and I've always been interested in security (ever since I can remember). I like the team and the work they are doing. On the other hand, I've been continuously told that Google is THE place to be after graduation because it has better career growth, perks/benefits and environment. I've continuously heard people tell me that Google is also more prestigious than Microsoft and that I can internally switch teams to what I like at Google.

I've also been told there are some security teams that have openings, but so far the team in MSFT seems to be line with my interest the most. But like I mentioned before, I can always switch internally to a better team at Google. I know Google has some really good security teams like ProjectZero and working there would be a dream come true, but then If I think, a bird in hand is better than 2 in the bush. Is it worth the gamble?

Here is a list of things I've heard (and by no means completely agree with them) from my friends, lab mates and professors:

1. The pay rise in Google would be significantly more over the years than at Microsoft.
2. Google has a less bureaucratic promotion system than Microsoft, so you'll rise faster.
3. Google has more intelligent people

* I disagree with that because I can say Microsoft had some REALLY smart people. I don't know what kind of people Google has if that's the general opinion.

Am I being sucked into the Google elitist crowd, or the general consensus that I've shared is true? I usually don't post on this forum but I've been stuck on this for quite a while, and I'm just looking for a different perspective.

Other Information:

\- Microsoft pay &gt; Google pay (if you don't consider the rate at which Google and Microsoft stock increases over the years).

\- Microsoft I'll be starting at a higher starting level than at Google. Probably because I did a good job during my internship (?)

Thanks, I appreciate you all taking the time to read my post."

dgo4u1,0,2019-10-11,In a pickle,AlpacaOnMars,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dgo4u1/in_a_pickle/,"Hi,

I was planning on doing a BS/MS program so when I was applying to internships, I put December 2020 as my graduation date. I received an internship offer for the summer from a good company but recently I found out I didn’t meet the GPA requirements (need a 3.7, have a 3.6) for the BS/MS program. Now I will be graduating December of 2019 instead of 2020. I already accepted the internship (and I don’t mind doing it, it’s an amazing big 4 company), but I read that you cannot do internships after graduation in general for CS and the job posting said “actively pursuing a BS or MS in CS or related”. 

I’m afraid the company is now gonna pull the internship offer because I’m graduating earlier than expected. What should I do? Am I screwed? (I know I could apply for full-time jobs but I’m an EE major with no internships at all)."
dgo6nh,4,2019-10-11,Accepting Internship offer,ha_2741,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/dgo6nh/accepting_internship_offer/,"So, in the process of applying for summer 2020 internships, I applied to this local university startup that was looking for MechE interns. They never really specified the time period they wanted to work and I kind of assumed it for was for summer. They offered me an interview on campus which was done by a bunch senior year students and then they offered me the intern position. In the email they sent to me, it mentioned a “team” meeting that will happen tmrw and during the interview, they asked about my availability throughout the semester. This makes it seem like they wanted me to begin working now (almost halfway into the semester). Unfortunately, I don’t have much work experience and this is one internship I scored. However, I can’t work this semester due to my course load and other jobs (TA, SAE) I have. So, do I email them now about it or go to the meeting tmrw and talk to them about it? Should I ask them if they can offer me a summer position instead?"

I do not have any certs and I am about to complete a homelab and start using it, which I am very excited for. I am currently doing phone repairs and I hate it, is there any positions other than help desk that I should apply for?

dgq9g6,125,2019-10-12,Camille wasn't herself yesterday,Gensi_Alaria,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dgq9g6/camille_wasnt_herself_yesterday/,"I'm a nursing student, just finished my second year. Over the summer, I've been doing a co-op internship thing where we're placed in a care setting of our choice. I don't know why, but I picked the seniors' home option. There were more ""exciting"" places to be, but they didn't resonate with me like this one did. Guess it had something to do with how I let my great aunt die. Off-topic. Anyway, the elderly have been an absolute joy to work with. One of them, Camille, usually won bingo nights. She had terrific luck I guess, but she wasn't popular with those who took bingo seriously (i.e. a lot of them). Camille could've passed for a 30-year-old with how energetic she always was. She was also everyone's unofficial ""mom"", if you know what I mean - even ours (me and my fellow interns). Camille was loved by all. We came to love her too.

Except yesterday - I don't know. I don't know what to do. I don't even know who to talk to about this. The police? A doctor?

I was setting up the dishes for breakfast when Camille walked into the hall. I'd decided to come in early so I could spend some time watching a Friends rerun on the nice big communal TV before we started our duties for the day. So there was no one else there - just us two. Camille walked oddly, like she didn't know where to place her feet. She was staring at her own hands. I got a little freaked out, so I asked her if she was okay. We're well-past a first-name basis at this point. Practically BFFs.

She looked at me and this weird look of horror came over her. She ran up to me and I nearly dropped the dish I was holding. But she didn't look like she wanted to hurt me - she was scared. Almost to tears. She rubbed my shoulders and sighed in relief.

""Oh my god, you're still here,"" she said. I was understandably confused. ""I... came in early,"" I responded, trying to make sense of what she meant. She shook her head vigorously. Gave me a long hug which I eventually returned, not sure why. When she released me, she was a lot more stoic - but I'd never seen that look in her eyes.

""Listen to me, Austin,"" she said quietly. ""Do you have a gun?""

""What? No!"" I was so not on the same page as her. And starting to get annoyed.

""You need to get a gun,"" Camille advised. ""Something small. And - don't stay at your house tomorrow night. Go to a hotel. Don't tell anyone which hotel. Or motel. I don't know. Go somewhere else - *not* a friend's house, a motel. And keep a gun with you.""

I was just about to ask her if she'd been neglecting her meds (or abusing them), when Tivaan walked in. Tivaan was a good friend of mine, doing the co-op with me. We became friends over how we both lived in the same neighborhood coincidentally, and how we both took the same route to get here, stuff like that. She decided to come in early too. I was really glad to see her because Camille had me freaked out. ""Heyo,"" I called, hoping she'd walk over. She did, but it did not help the situation, because when Camille saw her, she did the same terrified stare, like she was looking at a ghost. Tivaan squinted at Camille and tried a ""good morning,"" but it did nothing. Camille grabbed her shoulders just like she did mine.

""Oh, oh, my poor girl - oh thank god I found you - do you drive?""

Tivaan blinked. ""Do I - um... yeah? Why? Are you okay, Camille?""

""Please, dear, take the bus home today,"" said Camille. ""OH! And also - *don't use the stepladder today.* I know you folk like to use it to clean the upper walls of the clinic. *You* don't use it. Tell anyone else. And take the bus home. Got it?""

Tivaan assumed Camille was having an off day, I imagine. She just nodded. But when Camille, walked out, she gave me a look of ""the fuck was that all about?"" and I shrugged. ""She said the same shit to me,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Told me to buy a gun and go to a motel. What?""

We laughed about it. It was so bizarre. Was this Camille's idea of a prank? We weren't anywhere near April 1st. I'd never heard anything so ridiculous. It was so funny yesterday.

Except... I'm typing this on my laptop, in a motel room, with a .38 in my jacket and the lights off.

Because the rest of the day yesterday had been fairly normal. I was working a half day so I said goodbye to everyone around the afternoon. I drove home and had dinner with my parents. I got a phone call right before I was going to wrap up for an early night in.

Tivaan was in the hospital. The staff supervisor called me to let me know she'd been in an ""accident"". When I yelled for more details, she reluctantly told me that she'd slipped and fallen off a stepladder and broken something in her spine. I tried calling her cell, no answer. I couldn't sleep.

This morning, I heard news of a major pileup on the highway - the same highway I drive on every day to and from work. This crash happened last night around 9:30 - the same time Tivaan would've been driving back home. She was scheduled for a full shift.

I tried reaching Camille this morning, but the supervisor brushed it away and told me not to come in. I went to visit Tivaan in the hospital. She can't move her legs, and the doctors don't know if she ever will. I can't handle this. I didn't buy a gun... because I already have one. Which I brought with me to this cheap motel. I told my parents I'm sleeping over at a friend's house. I didn't tell anyone about this, just as Camille instructed. I should be safe... I don't know from what, or why, but I can't get rid of this feeling that this was no coincidence.

Except... something's bothering me. If Camille told me not to be at my own house tonight, then should my parents be there? I missed a call from my mom 20 minutes ago when I was in the shower. I've been trying to call back ever since. There's no answer. I don't know if I should leave the motel because of how fucking terrified I am, even with my handgun. Should I keep trying her cell? Should I go back home? Dad isn't picking up either."
dgqkn6,7,2019-10-12,The Startup Dream,CheeseL0ver,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dgqkn6/the_startup_dream/,"Hey everyone, I am a CS student about to graduate undergrad. Now my ideal job is working for a small startup company (I want to launch my own startup one day so seeing the inner workings of others will help me to decide how mine is ran). I am currently applying to various companies but I am having a hard time finding small startups.

Of the ones I do find they either want someone with a few years of experience (understandable on their part) or they are looking to hire immediately. Now it should be noted that I have worked on some really impressive personal projects and I have multiple internship and research experiences that document my resume. All that said, should I even bother trying to find and apply for them, or should I just apply to larger, more established, companies instead? I mean, all of the recruiters I have interviewed with have all liked me, but usually it is a deal breaker due to the previous reasons mentioned. 

Also, if anyone just has any advise when it comes to preparing for interviews please share. I would love to here from those of you actually in the field and those who as possibly conducting interviews."

dgsf7c,1,2019-10-12,"IT, CS, CE Majors. ServiceNow",WhoGivesADuckAbout,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/dgsf7c/it_cs_ce_majors_servicenow/,"  

This is a true story from a recent grad. I was an IT major going into my third year of school. I was, and still am, very passionate about my career. I took Szumlanski’s CS1 class and loved it. I had taught myself a lot of programming in my own spare time. 

Still, going into my third year I hadn’t gotten an internship. I’d been working remote for an SEO company all through college. I was getting pretty good at WordPress stuff, and started doing my own stuff in PHP. I ended up making a website hosted from my computer in my room that you could make an account with and log into. I’m pretty sure no employer ever looked at it.

I went crazy applying to internships. Eventually I got an interview with FIS for a Jr. Sys Admin position. Certainly, something I was interested in at the time, and at the time I would have been very happy to have taken it.

In my indiscriminate bullet spray of applications, I ended up applying for a company called ServiceNow. It was a strange application; the role was labeled as Technical Analyst. It required knowledge of JavaScript and SQL, but also good customer service skills. I really didn’t want to do help desk but at the time decided, hell, I’d be willing to settle if nothing else works out.

I ended up interviewing with them, and after the interview I still didn’t really know what was going on. Very few technical questions, they seemed more interested in customer service. After interviewing for a Sys Admin position with FIS I wasn’t taking it 100% seriously. Then I decided to look them up…

On Google, their description read “Software Company”, that got me. I’d heard lots of amazing things about working for software companies. In a twist of fate FIS and ServiceNow gave me an offer at the same time. I was split because Sys Admin was certainly a better sounding role than Technical Analyst, and I worried about the support aspect. I would never want to take a help desk role over a Sys Admin role.

After seeing the benefits, pay,  and proximity to the university, plus their promise to let me work and do school at the same time until I graduate I took the ServiceNow role. What it turned out to be was a kind of cloud computing support role. I got my own cubicle, healthcare benefits the whole 9 yards.

But when I started, I was given a headset, I was worried I’d plunged myself into a help desk job. What turned out to happen was I was taking calls from developers from companies around the world to help with technical problems. I wasn’t supposed to write any code, but I could point out the problems in theirs.

ServiceNow is a development platform. The basic idea behind it is that in our everyday lives, consumers do everything using Amazon, YouTube, Facebook. If you want to rent a car or book a flight you go online, push a few buttons, and you’ve got it. ServiceNow is a development platform with tons of APIs that makes it easy to develop similar systems inter company.

At ServiceNow I was given support opportunities, but although I was willing to do it as a jumping off point, I really wanted to be a developer. Then I did a Google search that changed my life, “ServiceNow Developer”. I found bounds of companies looking for developers in the very platform I was working in.

Most of them wanted 5+ years of experience, but I applied anyway. I found one that caught my eye though. Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory wanted a Jr. ServiceNow Developer. I didn’t have 2 years under my belt, I had about .5 years, but I applied anyway. The next day I got a call, had a short phone interview and next thing I knew I was on a plane heading to Maryland.

Interview was not so bad, got a call within a week they wanted to hire me. I took the job. 1 Year later I’m a developer at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. I work mostly in ServiceNow, doing JavaScript (front end and back) and AngularJS. It’s an amazing job and a great place to work. They send me to tech conferences and generally respect me.

My point in posting this: ServiceNow is right around the corner from UCF. Don’t write them off because of their name. The CE I know is still working form them and happy. Look into them if you are in a tech major, it could change your life."

dgukyd,7,2019-10-12,Are high-prestige CS schools worth it?,cheesegreater_,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dgukyd/are_highprestige_cs_schools_worth_it/,"I posted a similar question to /r/college last year, but I've done a lot more thinking since then, so I want to ask again.

Stats: 4.71 weighted / 4.00 unweighted GPA out of 4.0; 36 composite ACT; 1490 composite SAT; class rank 11 out of \~385; 6 AP tests so far with 3 more this year

EC: team captain / lead programmer of an FRC team; member of school's German NHS; volunteering at a local church; internship at a local startup

I am a high school senior located in Kansas attempting to get a degree in software engineering or computer science. I have already applied to RIT, RPI, UVa, and Miami. I have also been admitted at KU, which is an in-state university for me.

I've been thinking about applying to T20 schools and other high-prestige CS schools. I'm sure I will probably get accepted at most schools, but I don't know if the payoff is worth four years of struggle. Here are my reasons:

1. **I'm in a weird income bracket.** My family falls in that income bracket where we make too much for significant need-based financial aid, but too little to actually match our EFC. This might not be a problem at top schools that have more money to give, but I know that a few of the schools I've already applied to are willing to give large merit-based scholarships: RPI has given the Rensselaer Medal ($25k/year), and Miami will likely offer half to full tuition. At KU, if I get accepted into their honors program and the associated scholarship living halls, the COA will be low enough that I can graduate debt-free just off of merit scholarships and college savings.
2. **College choice doesn't seem to matter for CS.** As far as I've been told, any college with a decent CS program will suffice for getting a job. This is a field where work experience matters much more than education. If that's the case, then is it worth paying more and working more for what is effectively the same result? In addition, most of the schools I'm applying to get recruited from by well-respected companies. And in RIT's case, a year of CS work experience during college is mandatory, so I'm guaranteed to graduate with some beneficial experience there.
3. **College is hard.** I've had it very easy for the past three years, and this year of high school has been just as easy. As a result, I don't think my study skills are up to par. I might crash and burn at any college, but I fear that it will be much worse at a top university. Alternatively, I might survive, but only by dedicating most of my free time to my studies. That prevents me from pursuing internships, jobs, or undergraduate research, all of which would help my post-college resume much more than a fancier diploma.

With that in mind, I feel that the T50-1000 schools I've already applied to will serve me just as well as, if not better than, any of the T20 schools. However, most of my peers and family members would probably consider that to be a waste of my talent. I don't really know which path to follow. What's your opinion on the matter, /r/ApplyingToCollege?"

There are still a lot of things to do and sign before the start of the internship this summer. Ex. I won't know where I'm going to be for the internship until a couple of months before it starts. All of this stuff seems to happen very late with this company. What I like about company A is the opportunities for career advancement they offer to entry-level engineers, such as a fully paid masters, leadership development, etc. I also like the product I would be working on as this is an aerospace company. They do some cool stuff. The offer is fairly standard for a junior-year engineer in terms of compensation etc.

Company B just emailed me asking for a second interview later this week. I am inclined to take the second interview because this company is in the automotive industry which I have always had a passion for. It's a position I know I would love the work I do, but there aren't the same advancement opportunities as readily available as company A. This is still my ""dream company"" so to say. 

Is it ok to continue interviewing with Company B after accepting Company A's offer? I've already completed the background check paperwork and a few other forms, but nothing that says I can't go back on my acceptance. If I were to receive an offer from company B, I would definitely want to accept it. Is this ok? Will I ""harm"" my reputation in some irreparable way by going back on my acceptance? Thank you!"

This is the same company that I had an internship at and I got offered a full time position at the end of it. I didn't like working there not because of the company but because I never wanted to work at a tech company. I took the job anyway to get a couple years experience in. 

My dad passed away in August and I'm having a tough time with it. I was living with my parents when this happened and I moved out to start my job in the ""big"" city. I didn't realize how hard it was to be away from my mom and to start a new job. 

I'm depressed. I hate my job as there isn't much for me to do on the project I was put on. My mentor doesn't know what to do with me and I spend most of the day trying not to cry. I just feel like I'm not ready to be working. I don't know what I would do if I did quit. I don't know if it would hurt my career as an engineer and I don't know if I even want to be an engineer. Everyone tells me now is not the time to make big decision but life is big decision and I can't not make them. 

Tdlr: I'm sad about my dad and I don't think I'm ready to be working, but afraid of what would happen if I did quit."

Right now I'm looking at Azure and AWS as my two launching points to getting into Cloud tech.

My background: 18 month vocational school that was a jack of all trades IT course that would get me into the field which it did. From there I've had one internship with a fortune 500 company as tier I help desk guy. I then moved onto a contractor role with a project team for a network of hospitals that needed a hardware refresh and a win7 to win 10 migration in tandem. I recently accepted a full time position with a software company that licenses there products out to clients as a systems Analyst, my day to day there is Tier I issues and Tier II hardware issues which is basically shit breaks and I go to their desk and fix it but in an interview I can sell myself way better then that.

What I want to know: What cert if any can I combine with my current experience to make myself both knowledgeable enough to succeed in a more back end type role where im automating things/moving them to the cloud and will make me attractive enough to recruitment people so that I'll get a shot somewhere. Within 100 miles of NYC if that's relevant."
dh03by,11,2019-10-12,FBI Internship dilemma,kattykat09,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dh03by/fbi_internship_dilemma/,"Hello all! I hope you are having a nice day.

For a bit of background information, I am currently a freshman in college with plans to major in either CS or engineering. I am fairly new to CS, and I am in intro to computer science right now.

Recently, I was accepted to the FBI Honors Internship for the summer of 2020. It's an absolute honor to be accepted, but I don't know very much about the role and what type of work I would be doing. I also have about three days to accept the offer. Additionally, I was recently informed that I was selected for the final round interviews for the Microsoft Explore program. As someone who does not have a lot of experience in CS, and I might be interested in SWE/PM roles, this seems like an awesome opportunity!

Right now, I am very torn about what to do. I think the Microsoft internship is more aligned with my current interests, but the FBI internship is something I applied to on a whim and never expected to get and seems so cool!

Does anyone have an opinion on if I should accept the FBI internship, or hold out and see if the Microsoft one works out? It doesn't feel ethical to accept the FBI and then decline them if Microsoft works out, but maybe it would be okay? The offer for FBI is actually conditional on my background check being clean (which it should be.)

THANK YOU!!

&amp;#x200B;

edit: thank you everyone for your awesome advice-- I will accept the FBI Internship for now because I do think it is a cool opportunity and I'm not sure what I want to do with my life yet. If any other opportunities come up along the way I will be sure to take into account all this awesome advice!"

[info in post],throwaway_538941,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dh071k/have_i_reached_the_breaking_point_quit_stay_info/," Hi everyone,  posting from a throwaway account right now as my employer monitors the blind app, and possibly cscareerquestions as well. Little background about me and why I'm asking [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions) for advice, I graduated about 2 years ago with a non-cs major (still engineering related), joined a startup out of college and have been there ever since (grew from 10 to 100 employees). I've been here ever since because a job is a job, and I thought the projects were challenging - this job also gave me the opportunity to transition into the software world, as a non-cs major. My job there is as a software dev (backend). To this day, I'm still one of the \~8 or so software engineers on the team, the rest being business development and marketing (we've been short of devs this whole time). Work life balance is \~10hrs/day with expectation of weekend work for my first year here. As we grew, it started being more normalized as management (ceo &amp; cto) couldn't micromanage everyone. Over the past few years, I directly helped develop two of their main products, and became a 'senior' dev just based on my domain knowledge of our tech stack from the start. We started hiring seniors with 5-10y+ experience and I would on board them when they joined so they could get up to speed. Because covering the entire story would take too long and I'm sure no one wants to read all of it, here are the red flags + things that have happened to me that would make this company be registered as a toxic one.   

&amp;#x200B;

* First of all, there is no WLB (messaging at 9pm at night, confrontation about coming in 30 minutes late, everyone needs to report if they are going to be late) and rarely any company events (1 a year). We have summer hours (leave at 3pm on fridays during Summer), as that is becoming more common at companies in my area. The devs would have internal meetings scheduled at 5PM on Fridays. Management works 7 days a week expecting employees to do the same otherwise being called 'lazy'. Normal for a startup? Maybe.  
* When I make mistakes or have questions, I get compared to the seniors by the CTO (""Why can't you be like &lt;name&gt;?"", ""&lt;name&gt; could do this in 5 minutes""). The CTO would constantly belittle coworkers, by saying bad things about their code, and saying ""don't do what &lt;name&gt; does"". Instead of trying to invest in his devs and help them understand.
* Turnover rate is over 50%. For a company with 100 employees right now, I've seen over 100 people leave/get fired over the past 2 years. About half would join/leave within the first month. 
* As we were growing, there was a bad review posted on glassdoor for the first time. CEO went batshit crazy. Pulled a dev into a room and accused him of writing the review. Turned out to be a different dev who quit the following week. 
* We would have these meetings where the we would report how hard we worked that week (say a number out of 10). Management would agree or disagree with the number. 
* I was threatened to have my pay lowered for making a mistake on a big project that I was managing myself. 
* Two of the founders have quit in disagreement with the CEO already. They were exited without a single word to the company. You would have expected a celebration or thanks, but instead I was told some pretty hateful comments about them.
* Whenever anyone leaves, they get deleted from Teams immediately and there is radio silence. People just disappear and no one ever knows. A new employee joins every other week, but we also lose someone at the same rate. Management calls them unworthy and undeserving of the 'golden opportunity'.
* CTO is constantly looking for people to blame whenever there is an app-breaking mistake due to lack of an official code review process. 
* There is always constant pressure to deliver projects as management and biz dev over promises release dates- as a result, projects are rushed to be completed and more likely to contain bugs. Queue the devs that work until 3 am every night for a week just to get a demo ready and not broken.
* An intern for fired last year for accidentally deleting a production table that was recoverable. This was because she had raw direct access to the prod database. 
* There are always inappropriate life-death analogies that are made whenever someone makes a mistake. Won't go into specifics, but morally questionable statements are always made internally.
* I didn't know you could do this, but all the negative reviews about the company have been deleted on glassdoor. Gives me chills to even think about.
* There a highly experienced recruiter that has worked at most prestigious companies that joined and quit, saying that management ""wasn't human"" and that it was ""illegal"" how they were treating employees.

I'm understating a lot of these topics because going over the specifics would be just me ranting about my personal experiences. This hasn't been happening to just me, and the people that it happened to or is happening to now, are either thinking about leaving or already left.  

Here's the catch - I'm in no means a CS expert, I'm OK at algorithms as I just started studying last month. My pay is competitive to top companies in my area. I've been told to just study on the side and last as long as I can because, income is income and it's decent income. However, I was just told by the CEO a few weeks ago that I wasn't who I was when I joined, overachieving and doing more, and that I shouldn't be wasting their time if I didn't enjoy working here anymore. It would honestly be a huge hit to the company if I left, but management will always make irrational decisions and comments that puts us farther behind. After all that's happened to me, I can't go and fake that emotional attachment to the company anymore. I'm still doing my work, but every day is such a burden on my emotional state of mind- I just feel so uncomfortable even sitting in the office. It's hard for me to focus on studying after work because of how I'm feeling throughout the day.

Everyone says to not quit before having a new job lined up. I've been grinding for 2 years and have more than enough saved up to pay for rent and living expenses for several years. My parents keep saying that I should be grateful for a job and I'd be crazy to quit, but they don't really know how abusive these people are. Am I just complaining or is there really a breaking point where you should just call it? Should I take a break? I love software and coding, but after constantly being told I'm no good and being in this environment, it's becoming a love-hate relationship with software engineering for me.  


Anyways, sorry for the long read! I was hoping to get some help from maybe some of the more senior people that lurk around this subreddit :) Appreciate any advice I can get though!"

dh11x4,2,2019-10-12,Cyber Security/Risk Analyst/Consultant Internship - What can I expect?,ChocoRiceBowl,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dh11x4/cyber_securityrisk_analystconsultant_internship/,"Hi All,

I just received my first internship offer of the semester and would like some insight from people with similar job experiences and maybe some advice on career planning. First, I'd like to share a little background about me for context.

&amp;nbsp;

**Educational/Internship Background (If uninterested, skip to 'Current Situation')**


I have about two semesters left in my Undergraduate Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Over the last few years in this program, I received decent grades with an average of A (86-90%) but the field never clicked with me or motivated me to learn outside of class. I guess the main reason would be I was too busy with the boring theoretical course work and never got to experience the magic of engineering.

Up until now, I have done two internships:

&amp;nbsp;

**1. IT Support/Help Desk Analyst**


I managed to secure an IT Support/Help Desk Analyst position for my first internship. The first internship is always the most difficult to find and I naturally gravitated towards this role due to my interest in technology and sufficient literacy in computers. After extending my internship to 8 months and completing that, I continued work in the position part-time until my second internship. I gained the typical IT position experience in this job: software troubleshooting, hardware troubleshooting, identity management, help-desk call center, issue ticketing, technical documentation and customer service. 

*It was also at this point that I realized I was already straying off from my program path and joined a engineering club to gain some experience.*

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Cyber-security Risk and Compliance**


This time I was trying to find a Electrical engineering internship to gain some work experience that was relevant to my degree. I only applied for such positions. Due to a combination of the heavy course load in 3rd year (hardest year in my opinion) and a lack of motivation, I received very little interviews this time. However, as luck would have it, I somehow ended up with a interview for a Cyber-security position in the utilities industry and got the job. I later found out that this company puts up a generic engineering position every semester and their HR will funnel relevant resumes into internal intern positions provided by different departments. Most likely, I was funneled to the Cyber-security position due to my IT experience. Otherwise, I would probably not have made the cut or even applied to such a position in the first place. I took a chance on this position and it really got me interested in Cyber-security. It ultimately made me realized I wanted a career somewhere in this exciting industry. Although this was not a very technical position, I learned a lot about Cyber-security in relation to business and about the world of Cyber-security from a more holistic view. A lot of this position was working on policies, processes, compliance tasks, recurring reviews and supporting the main team with more important tasks such as risk assessments and violation reports.

Me wanting to explore this field led me to try the Cisco CCNA Cyber Ops course offered by a local technical school. I am still currently taking this course and find it to be an excellent course taught by a passionate teacher who worked in the industry. It also motivated me explore topics that interested me and I frequently found my self researching, reading and listening to related information in my own time.

&amp;nbsp;

**Current Situation**


I am currently look for internships for the next semester and received results I would have never dreamed of in the past. I applied for a variety of cyber security related internships and got interviews request from many of them. The current offer on the table is a Cyber Security/Risk consulting role from one of the big 4 firms. Honestly speaking, as a ECE student I had no idea who these guys were at first. Additionally, I just recently completed round 2 interviews with a couple reputable Banks, Insurance companies and another one of the big 4 firms. I feel quite confident about them and should be hearing back soon. Now I feel like I might need a third pair of eyes to provide some advice, direction or facts to help me make a informed decision.

*I guess my end goal would to be learn as much as possible from this position so I can have a better shot at an entry level job when I graduate.*

*I am not sure if I want to lean more towards the business side or technical side of Cyber-security so I am willing to explore.*

&amp;nbsp;

**1. I think the job description is sometimes not reflective of what actually happens in a position. Does anyone have experience or know what a Cyber-security Risk/Security consultant would do? I heard they work you quite hard at these big 4 companies so I am hoping they will give me real responsibilities that pushes me to grow.**

&amp;nbsp;

**2. The banks are offering positions with more focus on operations and developing technical skills compared to the insurance and big 4 companies. What type of new graduate jobs allow more opportunity to pivot around the cyber-security industry to explore different facets?**

&amp;nbsp;

In the end, maybe I am overthinking everything and should just take the job I am offered and stop being so indecisive. I would also welcome any recommendations to a learning direction and quality resources I can consume in my own time.

**Essays/LORs/Other:** 

Common App essay: 

The super-short version is that I was born prematurely had an absurd amount of health issues (periventricular leukomalacia, spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, apnea, largely unresponsive to stimuli, etc.). Doctors told my mom I wouldn’t be able to retain information. Low expectations meant me getting put in a pre-K for the physically and mentally impaired. I remember being frustrated when none of my questions about the simplistic things we were learning were taken seriously and, before eventually being put in the appropriate class, taught me that you shouldn’t wait for you education to be handed to you so think about things for yourself and don’t be afraid to pursue things on your own and outside of school.

LORs: 

Counselor: 10/10. Talked to him first day of school freshman year and have filled him in over everything going on in my life over the years. We're really close.

**Intuit:**

\- in San Diego (which is a great city to live in)

\- housing/transportation is taken care of

\- 12 weeks (will probably make more than amex at the end even though the pay is less)

**Amex:**

\- in New York (it's always been a dream of mine to live there)

\- will have to find my own housing and figure out transportation

\- pay is higher than Intuit, but I'll likely have to cut into some of the pay for housing since the housing stipend won't be enough and the internship is 10 rather than 12 weeks"

For a bit of background on me, I'm a senior cs major, had 2 swe internships and a devops internship, and currently working as a remote sre while I finish my last year of my degree.  I picked up the three associate certs for AWS at my last internship, and I plan on picking up the two professional certs this year before I graduate.  My friend has a similar background, but already has his professional certs.

Curious to know if this would be at all feasible as a side business, has anyone here had success doing independent AWS consulting?"

What should I do?,jstruggling,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dh53ys/i_feel_like_im_too_lazy_for_this_career_path_what/,"Like the title says, I don’t have the best work ethic. It’s been 5 months since I graduated and I can’t find a job and I’m now realizing that this might not be the best path for me. I went through my degree thinking despite my lack of memory retention and knowledge that I’d be able to get by because I can understand things fairly quick and I’m always on the computer anyways. Well now I realized that this path is too vast and I don’t think I can keep up with constantly learning especially with how lazy I am. I tend to procrastinate and can’t really get my mind to focus unless there’s an actual deadline that will impact me. 

I never had an internship and I don’t know much besides what I was taught in classes (which I skipped for the most part). I have a gpa of around 3.4-3.5. I feel burnt out already (partly because I’ve been rejected so much and because my parents are stressing me out) despite not having done much. What should I do? At this point I just want a job where I can just work 40 hrs a week with a suitable income so I can enjoy my hobbies (sports, games, music, stocks) with the time leftover. 

Some things that might help with some ideas of what I can do: I enjoy working in team environments, I don’t mind working in front of a computer all day, I’ve only really lived in small towns so I’m not use to living in cities but I know I will have to relocate anyways so I’m open to anywhere in the US.

Wanted to give an update on the situation and see if anyone here had any last minute advice. I was able to negotiate a 120k starting salary and 15k signing bonus for an SA position at Capital One, which I thought was still kinda low for my experience but pretty good for that level. Plus after the last thread , I was slightly leaning towards C1 anyway. So this week, I went to give my notice to leave my current position for the C1 job. In the 11th hour, my current company decided they didn't want to lose me and made a counter-offer of 118k salary, plus an opportunity to work on a machine learning project with another team. Now I'm completely torn, as I don't think an increase of 2k is enough to justify taking another job. Help - what should I do?! Here's the pros and cons list I wrote up:  

*Health Insurance Company*  
**Pros**:  
- Higher annual bonus vs. C1 (~7-9k vs ~4-6k)  
- Can get machine learning experience in 2020, though knowing the other engineers working on it, the quality of the work will be questionable  
- Super laid back corporate culture, extremely good WL balance (2 days/week WFH, almost never on call)  
- More senior position, with better relationships / respect from higher ups / BAs / testers. Don't have to fight to have my contributions recognized  
- Have my own cubicle (not a huge fan of open office)  
- Mentorship opportunities with junior devs    
**Cons**:
- Tech stack is legacy or niche technology - enterprise Java, Websphere, Spring (but not much Spring Boot), not even starting with cloud development until 2022. Big project for 2020 is to phase out or convert our remaining mainframe processes.  
- Struggling to switch to Agile, with a lot of internal resistance from older employees. Deployment process is also terrible - slow turnaround time on defects.  
- Slow pace can get extremely boring, and I feel my skills atrophying. Nothing I do here (besides the machine learning project) will make me marketable to tech companies.  
- Accepting a counter offer from current company can always be risky. They could be trying to replace me as I type this.  
    
*Capital One*  
**Pros**:  
- Big signing bonus, slightly better 401k match  
- Unlimited sick leave  
- Modern tech stack. AWS heavy. Spring boot, kafka, maybe even Angular experience. Full stack experience (coding / testing / deploying). HUGE learning potential.  
- More opportunity for advancement down the road (could get promoted next year if I do well)  
- Fully agile team (Kanban) will prepare me for working at other tech companies  
- Will probably work with better engineers, and won't have to deal with nearly as much code base bloat  
- C1 probably looks better / makes me more marketable  
**Cons**:  
- It's a downlevel responsibility and title wise, no question about it  
- Politics &amp; stack ranking more prominent. Have to start building new relationships. There are a lot of horror stories on here &amp; Blind about C1, although mainly at the intern / new grad level.  
- Open office  
- WL balance probably not as good (only WFH some Fridays, seems discouraged)    
    
*It's a wash*  
- Salaries are close enough  
- Same PTO  
- Commutes are more or less the same   
- Both my current and ""future"" manager seem chill / calm"

Honestly she's also the worse person to go to for career advice. Can't speak English, and no computer skills, etc. The whole reason she even told me to do computer science was because her friends and family told her that it was a good field. And then she was told by other family members that I was in a good field.

I recently finished my undergrad from a selective public school and developed a strong passion to go into the computer science field. Wish I could've realized sooner so I would've majored in it during college :). Anyways, I completed a double major in biomedical engineering and statistics with a 3.8 gpa. During college I wrote software programs for biomedical research and contributed to embedded software for an engineering project. I did an internship writing optimization algorithms and now work as a data scientist. 

HOWEVER, I've never taken an official course in a computer science department. The closest is some courses on signal processing, numeric methods, and programming for statistics. I'm currently taking the Stanford Algorithms specialization on Coursera. I have also used Python and C++ for projects. 

Should I use a MOOC (like Udacity) for foundational courses such as Computer Architecture and Operating Systems, take courses through my local community college, or are there other options? What do you all advise?

Thanks!"
dhegqa,42,2019-10-13,Anyone have experience working under a developer who ... seems to not be good at their job?,bits_and_kibbles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dhegqa/anyone_have_experience_working_under_a_developer/,"I've been struggling a lot the last few weeks dealing with one of the newer hires on my team. Our team was recently simultaneously working on like 3 different small-ish projects, so people were a bit siloed when he came on as the most senior technical developer. Now that we're all back together and planning for future work, it's come up many times that he might just not know what he's doing at all. Some brief examples:

1. Doesn't understand that a browser makes requests after the initial document request for external scripts/stylesheets etc. He has on at least two occasions shown this lack of knowledge, and I have had to correct him both times. This concerns me because he's supposed to be helping design the new iteration of our system, and I can't always be hovering over him to tell him he doesn't understand how webpages work.
2. He doesn't seem to be able to think of anything at a high level. His solutions to problems are like those I would expect from a junior developer - never consider the big picture, just the first thing that works.
3. He can't split out work into smaller pieces. Any work he prescribes doing is a huge, vague clump of 20 actual tasks, and it ends up taking forever because it should have been broken up.
4. He works basically all day, every day, I guess to help mask the fact he couldn't possibly complete a senior's level of work in a normal work-week. In spite of this, it takes him about 5x as long as it should to do a task. Some of this can be attributed to onboarding, of course, but the most recent thing he spent over two full weeks should have taken a day - max two - for someone of pretty much any experience level.
5. Despite taking forever to do things, he doesn't ask for help.
6. In our most-used language (and the one he listed second on his resume), he makes egregious errors that can be caught even at a cursory glance. Things he should never write, and if he does, should catch them before asking for a review and/or probably catch them when he tries to run his code.
7. He suggests random potential ""improvements"" to our systems that don't make sense all the time - ""Have we ever considered doing X?"" - no, because that LITERALLY MAKES NO SENSE TO DO. I suspect this is him trying to contribute as a ""big picture guy"" but it always just shows he has no knowledge whatsoever of the problem domain. Also he does this in other meetings where the point is ... decidedly not to throw out random ideas?
8. Perhaps the worst thing of all - he is happy to answer ANY question with a long-winded and confident explanation. And I mean ANY question. This coupled with the fact that he seems borderline useless is extremely tiresome, to have to correct him while he is explaining things to our interns, developers on other teams, or stakeholders ... it ... yeah.
9. Oh, no - this is the worst thing - he \_privately\_ messages team members to ask them questions about things. In some other public channel, you will find him relaying that information to someone else (usually a higher-up) as if the answer came directly from him. This. Literally. Happens. All. The. Time.

I'm honestly exhausted. I have brought up concerns to my manager 3x now, but clearly not as direct as I have in this post. (i.e. I didn't say ""This guy is useless"", it was more like ... ""I have concerns because of X event""). Basically all this succeeded in doing was having me also invited to a bunch of meetings with him, thus increasing my workload and also increasing my exposure to him.

Another thing that bothers me is I'm not sure if he 1) knows he's not pulling his weight and is just trying to fake it or 2) is one of those people who is blessed/cursed with undeserved confidence.

Part of me just wants to ignore it and just do my job, but this stuff permeates my every day, and will eventually have me working on things that make no sense. He makes my day out to be so much more of a struggle than it has to that I dream of just leaving my job behind so I don't have to hear him try to explain something incorrectly to me for the 40th time (when I didn't ask him to).

Has anyone ever had to deal with something like this? What did you do? What happened? Where are they now? Please give me hope.

Edit: thanks for all the advice. I’m gonna start making myself less available to him and try handing off some CRs to other people so that it’s not just me handling it."

I am a current HS senior who has completed AP Computer Science A, an internship with Microsoft, and is currently taking a post-AP computer science projects course. I like the subject matter. It's fun. Realistically, I should be able to make a decent life for myself, one without too much regret. I am competent in the subject matter (not a wizard), but I strongly believe I will be able to keep afloat at a CS program like the University of Washington's (Cal Berkeley or CMU is another beast).

However, I've been telling myself and those around me that I want to go to med school up until, well, last week. I've always thought little bits of anatomy were cool, medical home-care books were the ones I would always pick up and try to read as a little kid, and I've volunteered in a hospital environment and interacted with patients. I like the atmosphere of a hospital, and  to be completely honest I think its a noble and super-f'ing-cool thing to have a complex understanding of the human system. 

But I'm realizing I'm tired now. That I enjoyed the free atmosphere of Microsoft and the people in tech. That odds are, if I get accepted into my planned ED school (Duke) I'll get weeded and end up with a biology degree that lends itself to lab research, which I am pretty sure I do not want to do. I've put myself in a position to possibly get into Duke ED, but not good enough of one to thrive at such a top school like Duke if I were to get in.

Is it possible to get a CS major, fully pursue it, and still get enough studying and pre-reqs done for med school applications without having a total mental breakdown? That way, I am still pursuing my dream, but then I have a fully fleshed-out backup plan (yes, I understand CS shouldn't be a ""backup plan"") and a skillset that I believe would make me promising to med schools and potential medical advancement. I've done some preliminary research and cant' find much about this. 

So, I'm considering not even applying ED anywhere to give myself time to sort through this. Would this be possible?  
And if I try this, would going to a school with a strong CS program be the best bet?

My reaches I think might work with this plan are currently Duke, Cal Berkeley and UCLA, and the University of Washington's CS program.

I honestly cannot think of another place at this moment since I have much more research to do. I just want to see if this is feasible.

Quick stats if helpful:

1560 SAT, top 1% class rank (5/488), 3.975 UW GPA, okay EC's (Microsoft, hospital volunteering, club co-president, over 300 hours logged volunteer hours, three varsity letters, school orchestra principal player), good letters of rec, AP scholar w/distinction,"

I have posted a few times looking for advice on my personal statement. The program I am writing this letter for is through a genetics program at University of Washington. They will grant my admission, and I will later apply to a computational molecular biology multidisciplinary program (that's the plan anyways). The program's website doesn't say what to cover in the letter, so I've followed the advice of people here and tried to cover my academic and research background leading me to want to pursue this field of research, potential research interests, and why I want this program. The limit says 1-3 pages (not sure if double spaced, if anyone has input for that let me know but I'm assuming it can be either way if it's not specified) and I'm at about 2.5 pages here without a heading and such. I received feedback [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/deb9lc/grad_school_letter_of_purposepersonal_statement/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/dessm6/phd_application_personal_statement_looking_for/) if you want to see what other people have said or where I started from. I will also seek input from other people, I'm not just relying on this community, and I know my background is a bit more wet-lab, but I am trying to transition to a computational bio/bioinformatics field. 

&amp;#x200B;

So any feedback would be appreciated. I am in the US, so this letter is not written to a specific PI, but to a program where I will do lab rotations for my first year, then choose a project. If these posts are detracting from the point of this community let me know and I will bring it elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, one final question: I have two letters of rec confirmed, one from a professor and one from a professor/research advisor. For my third, I was planning to ask one of the PhDs/directors at my current place of work, since that is my first full-time industry position. However, I could also ask one of the people at a former research lab I worked at, but I left that lab over a year ago, and I think the person I would ask no longer works there, and she was not a PI but a lab manager. Any thoughts? Thanks!

&gt;What interests me most about researching genetics is the capacity to remove elements of randomness confining human advancement. Many individuals are shackled by afflictions inherited at birth that will prevent them from fully enjoying the wonders of the modern age. Still more people are plagued with evolutionary simple but existentially menacing pathogens. Many more are subject to malnutrition and food insecurity. A greater understanding of human genetics and the genetics of the species we most interact with will grant more agency over our existence. I want to dedicate my time to understanding the code of life and using advancements in genetics to resolve crises preventing human flourishing.

As an undergrad I explored research at three labs in distinct fields of biology that shaped the direction of my career goals. I condensed my degree acquisition to three and a half years so I could secure an open position at a local biotech institution where I was an intern. I continue to work at \[WORK\] as a biological technologist. I have grown quickly within the company. Four months after hire, my quick proficiency in my department granted me the responsibility of training new arrivals on our technologies and practices, and I became the leader of a team of technologists analyzing genetic data through restriction digest gel-electrophoresis visualization. My aptitude in my department allowed me to expand my skillset to all steps of the DNA examination process from wet-lab extraction and amplification to high-throughput multiplex analysis techniques. Since graduating, I have used my free time to pursue independent learning of mathematic and programming skills I did not cover in school. I have focused on learning Python and worked with data science libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn to work with large data sets and machine learning. I am also learning linear algebra for application in programming and machine learning. I wrote a few scripts automating repetitive tasks for my workflow at \[WORK\] to save time and reduce error. I continue to practice python using problem sets at Rosalind (a platform dedicated to learning programming for bioinformatics). I intend to continue practicing programming and learning more about the tools of computational biology, as well as refreshing my knowledge of statistics. I have found immense satisfaction and potential with the efficiency and accuracy of computational analyses, and I want to apply computational approaches to biological questions and the advancement of the human condition.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have been fortunate in my early academic career to explore several research settings. Each experience had different unique skillsets, but overall principles of research were conserved and fortified at every lab. At my first research lab at the WSU Sleep Research and Performance Center, I had to quickly adopt methodical experimental execution and data collection. I learned how easily data’s narrative can be sullied by unconsidered variables or omitted records. I gained thorough data collection and analysis skills working with the most unpredictable and noisy systems (humans). My experience whetted my appetite for research, but I knew I wanted a more involved role, and I looked to gain more research experiences to pave my way to grad school.  
&gt;  
&gt;My next research experience was at the NDSU Agriculture Research Outreach Center. Attention to detail was further reinforced, as most of my daily activities revolved around experimental treatment application and data collection. I also learned the necessity of sufficient scientific communication. They were in their busiest season, so I functioned mostly autonomously, and I had to be sure I fully understood the conditions I had to meet. Departments at the center had different backgrounds and research goals, but they had to share resources and information to help other projects be conducted properly. I attended weekly meetings where researchers discussed resource allocation and projects so others could work around them. They also had several public presentations of new research findings to local farmers, many of whom had little or no higher education. I saw that successful scientists need to have clear exchanges with researchers working on the same project, scientists in different fields of study, and the public to which they are responsible.   
&gt;  
&gt;Later, I worked with a professor at \[SCHOOL\] in a self-directed research testing a parasitic fungus for biocontrol potential. Since I was directing the studies, I learned the importance of asking meaningful and novel questions in a scientifically testable manner. Asking sufficiently probing questions required innovative synthesis of concepts, and distinguishing what is assumed or ignored from what is known. I also had to construct unique methods for my tests by parsing techniques from other studies. The species I was working with, *Pyrenophora seminiperda*, was not yet well characterized. I got to experience working on the cutting edge of scientific knowledge: for many hypotheses, there were not obvious predictions. This led me to experience failure. Most of my predictions were not significantly supported. A bitter blow after much data acquisition, but it helped pave the path for future researchers to advance the understanding and utilization of this biocontrol. I presented my research at an undergraduate conference, where students and faculty from all disciplines asked about my research in small group settings. I had to tailor vocabulary and level of detail based on my audience to keep their attention and affirm understanding. This was the most comprehensive research experience of my undergraduate career, and it further reinforced my desire to direct scientific inquiries.  
&gt;  
&gt;At my current job, my role is mostly executing established procedures for data collection, but I have been given some research and development responsibilities by directors at the company. The research mostly involves developing new disease screenings or improving outcomes of existing tests. Since I know the quirks of the existing tests, I provide input on the optimization of conditions for new ones. I also run validations of new tests so directors can approve new tests. In a busy clinical setting, the directors and I don’t interact constantly, so clear communication of goals, protocols, conditions, and results have to be transmitted in short briefings. Informal communication in this manner has greatly strengthened my communication with scientists working in similar settings.  
&gt;  
&gt;My interest in this program results from my admiration for interdisciplinary scientific fields, my passion to advance human flourishing, and my recognition of the exponential potential of computing power for human development. My passion for human flourishment led me to study the life sciences with the intention of working in health fields. I explored neuroscience and worked in a human sleep and performance lab. I discovered that working with in behavior research was too uncontrolled and the neuroses of the mind were too unpredictable. I wanted more actionable results. I redirected my attention a field with more directly impactful potential for global human advancement: agriculture. I worked at an agriculture research facility and later with a plant-ecology focused researcher at my school. Towards the end of my undergraduate career I transitioned my focus to genetics, still with an interest in agriculture and food production. I learned of the immense potential of gene editing and quantitative genetic analysis. I became captivated by the wonderful opportunities of understanding and manipulating the building blocks of life. I also learned about the power of meta-analyses and the potential for algorithmic approaches in problem solving to cause exponential growth in scientific advancement. I decided I wanted to learn more about and manipulate the code of life. University of Washington offers all of the opportunities for learning I want to apply in my career. If I am admitted to your program, I plan to pursue interdisciplinary research through Computational Molecular Biology program and/or the Big Data for Genomics and Neuroscience Training Grant.  
&gt;  
&gt;I want to couple the analytical power of computational problem solving with genetic toolkits to address humanity’s greatest afflictions. Specifically, I am most interested in GMO agriculture, but I have interests in identifying genetic and epigenetic markers for disease, human genome editing, and antibiotic alternatives. My diverse background in several fields of research has taught me skills in scientific questioning, meticulous experimental execution and data collection, and clear scientific communication. With my skills in the lab with all stages of DNA analysis paired with my affinity for programming, I hope to bridge and direct the best modern tools to the biggest modern problems. Through advancements in genetics via computational analyses, I see the next chapter in human development: one where we can leave behind the limitations of our birth and the randomness of the world around us to create a happier world for all."

It was time when I had to look for an internship. I even got an offer. The first day wasn't that bad. The second day I found out it was an extremely pressurized environment. I don't know if it was really pressurized or if  I felt so. It's always difficult for me to work in such environment where I feel I am dominated and have to listen and do what the other one says. It was enough for me to imagine the future consequences and my upcoming horrible schedule. It gave me anxiety to even go to that place. I always overthought everything. I then resigned from the internship the very day. Now I feel like I can't work under someone. If somebody forces me to think and work on something they want, that doesn't really motivate me. I want to have the freedom of thought and do whatever I feel like doing at the exact time. I feel like I can never stick to a job. Maybe have a freelancing job but it's tough and having my own company is not feasible right now. Don't know how to cope up with the feeling of being pressurized. Just can't deal with the feeling that someone else is benefiting more from what I did."

Just to preface this, my parents can afford it, but I don't know if I should etc.

Student here, kind of conflicted about university choice. To keep things private I have university B, the one I'm at right now and university A the one I didn't attend but want to transfer to, and the main campus of the university system, so transferring is easy, and I could do it next semester if I want to?.

B is around $30k per year, small town: I basically spend nothing except for transport and if I go out on weekends. Everything is very close by and easy to get to, and because there's not much to do, I find it mostly easy to take much more classes - I might be able to graduate a little faster?, self-study whatever I want to, and still have some free time for myself.

A is around $50k per year, much closer to a metro area, and I have family and friends near there, who are telling me to transfer. Getting internships, besides summer ones is also easier there as I have contacts and there's just more there.

I'm doing a Economics degree, but may switch that to Computer Engineering depending on how I feel. Or I may do both. I don't know how accurate this is, but based on online sites that list alumni salaries, B will get me around $60k, and A will get me $70k-$80k.

Should I transfer? Or any advice?"
dhl3bj,27,2019-10-13,How much better does it get post-graduation and post-job search? Does it ever?,CaptionDog,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dhl3bj/how_much_better_does_it_get_postgraduation_and/,"I'm currently a junior at a competitive school and I hate everything that results from being a computer science major: the stress culture, the internship application process, the LeetCode grind... I even hate being a student at times--but perhaps that has to do with my school itself, rather than my major. And seeing everyone else's success in the internship process, and at the same time, looking at my failure to secure anything, has started to take a toll on me.

Ever since coming to college, I've been depressed. There's tremendous pressure on me to perform well because I'm a low-income student and I want to be able to support my family in the future, but I just can't keep up. I started mental help around last year, and although it has helped a lot, I don't think I can ever truly be happy until the root cause of my depression is gone from my life.

But this subreddit makes it seem it doesn't get better, that the rest of my life will basically be a battle between me and the bullshit bureaucracy that surrounds computer science tech companies--layoffs, poor team management, etc.

I'm having a lot of doubts about my future, especially considering how oversaturated this field is becoming, and I just can't help but feel down about things. I feel like a failure.

Did anyone else feel the same way? Any personal anecdotes would be appreciated."

We're all pretty active on the social side of work, the entire company is sort of like a large family.

I've been working here for nearly a year (started at the beginning of 2019), at a pretty low salary, I had no job experience prior so I wasn't expecting any more than I'm on. However, my friend recently got a graduate position (big companies hire a bunch of recent uni grad students for basically paid internships), and he has told me that he's going to be earning far more than I am, while doing far less (my title is software dev, but I'm basically in a full-stack role, with some included security engineering, his is basically just front-end web dev), he agrees it's a bit odd, so I don't feel like I'm just whining. So I thought I'd ask for a raise, but after talking to my boss about salaries and whatnot, he basically told me to not even bother about asking for a higher salary until I have sat and passed the exam, which I've recently just passed (woo). 

Basically, I want to ask him for a raise, but I have no idea how and no experience with it, and I absolutely despise talking about money (I'd usually just cry internally instead of asking for money). I have a yearly meeting coming up at the end of the year and thought I could use that as a ""pay review"" type meeting too, but really just hope someone with some experience could help. I'm basically classed as a beginner in the role, but I have years experience during school/spare time, what I do is also my hobby, and am doing more than someone who's worked here for 5 years.

LOR's should be excellent (9/10), one of the smartest kids in my class

I also have an LOR from my employer, who talks about my excellent communciation and job skills, which I think should help.

Essays I'm working on them lol, should be pretty good. It's basically about how my parents' struggles in life influenced my decision for college etc etc (8/10)

Supplements (7/10) will try to write something not cliche.

dhq7ob,2,2019-10-14,Has anyone on here ever dealt with a database with transactions that does not store prices of the product in the past?,wesje97,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/dhq7ob/has_anyone_on_here_ever_dealt_with_a_database/,"Right now I'm doing an internship at a company where they have certain appointment types and I'm asked to compare the revenue from the register to the revenue that was planned according to the appointments that were booked for that day. Sounds easy enough, but the problem is that an appointment type currently has a static price that does not represent this price in the past.

there is also a problem with that there are sometimes prices that are randomly deviating in the cash register for example, I can have appointment type 12 which is an appointment that rarely happens and normally would have a price of 15 euro's. But in some random cases it deviates and goes to 20 for or one appointment and at a random other time to 10.

The problem with this was that my idea was that for each date I would log the most occurring  price and tag them when that price is different from the previous date. But these deviations ,and there are many, really pollute the data. This will happen when logging the price for each day and even for each month with the less occurring appointments while the main occurring appointments are fine.

So I'm wondering if anyone of you has ever dealt with a problem like this?"
dhqb34,2,2019-10-14,Next Steps for Me?,dkatsougrakis,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dhqb34/next_steps_for_me/," Hey everyone,

Wanted some recommendations from more experienced people if possible :)

So here's been my career path so far -- I've been with the same Accounting firm for the past 5 years (will be 6 in March)

For the first two years I was an Intern in IT -- pretty much a lot of Helpdesk and some projects.

The second two years they gave me a full-time position as a SysAdmin -- again, lots of Helpdesk but they included me in more projects with some security here and there (because they knew that was my interest)

Finally, this year in March, I was re-positioned to Application Security Administrator. I've been extremely happy with the job as my role finally changed and I had finally moved away from Helpdesk. My daily days look like this:

\-Managing Carbon Black Protection (Application Control / Application Whitelisting)

\-Using our Endpoint Management to push out updates

\-Managing Microsoft Intune for MAM

\-Manage Mimecast Administration Console, create policies for spam filtering, etc

\-Working with our InfoSec Manager for new policies &amp; procedures

\-Work with our external SOC team to respond to any alerts / suspicious activity

\-Also learning Carbon Black Defense (Next-Gen Anti-Virus) -- just a little unfamiliar with common TTPs.

Basically lots of stuff I'm really interested in.

Does anyone have recommendations on next steps for me? I definitely want to stay in Security / Digital Forensics. I'm also currently going for my Master's in Forensic Computing.

What should my career path look like and what certs does everyone recommend? I currently have Security+.

Thanks in advance! :)"

dhqcxf,36,2019-10-14,How I changed my mindset and leveraged the university’s extra-curricular programs to land my dream engineering job.,wscuderi,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/dhqcxf/how_i_changed_my_mindset_and_leveraged_the/,"I remember reading threads about fellow students finishing up their studies and wondering what that day would feel like when it was my turn to burn the books. Well, I can say that I have now successfully completed my 4 year ME degree and landed a gig in a field I’m passionate about.

It wasn’t easy though. I went through countless all-nighters, questioned whether I’m in the right major, worried about the fact that other students were getting more industry experience than me and frustrated that other students were able to grasp the more difficult concepts far more easily than I could without having to invest as much time into it.

It took me a while, but I worked out what the problem was - I was comparing myself to my peers. By focusing on what others are doing you lose the connection to your own story. You have to start filling in the pages in that story though. That means events. That means meet-ups. That means working extra. For free. One of my favourite quotes applies here - “You can’t be what you can’t see”. If you aren’t exposing yourself to what people whom you idolise are working on, then how can you fit yourself into their ecosystem. Go to these uni events. They could be anything. Entrepreneurial events, club/society events, product launches. Anything. Even if your interest is only XXX engineering and not HVAC, Aero, consumer tech etc. Put them in your calendar. You never know what you may end up falling in love with. There’s usually a bonus - free food, free drinks. So go for financial reasons. At first they seem abstract, you may be outside your comfort zone. But here’s my favourite piece of advice I like giving people. You SHOULD be comparing yourself. Constantly. But not to your peers, not to other people at all. However, you absolutely should be comparing yourself to who you were yesterday, and to who you were last week, and to who you were last year. Is that person closer to becoming the person you want to be?

But what if you don’t know who you want to be? That’s where the events and meet-ups come in. Some day someone will tell you they’re working on xxx project and they’ve got xxx far and you’ll think ‘fuck that’s mad’. It’s at that point that you’ve set your first goal to work towards and can start modelling your career/life direction. I can almost guarantee the first time that happens, it won’t be the career you’ll end up wanting. There’s no way it can be. There’s way too many variables in your life that will sway your path in another direction. But it doesn’t matter at all because you’ve now been given an additional gallon of fuel to fill your motivation tank. You’re still young and haven’t fine-tuned your passions yet, all that matters is that you’re going in the right direction and getting slightly closer, and getting slightly better than the person you were yesterday.

Once you have that general direction you’re ready to start. At the bottom. That’s the best place to be. It’s here where you can look around you and see everyone in their amazing internship whilst you’re contemplating whether or not to let the auto-play timer roll-over to the next episode on Netflix. It’s here where you accept who you are, where you’ve come from, and how much you have (and don't have) to offer the world. Come to terms with your position and where you’re at. Have a look at your test scores. Maybe they’re great, maybe they suck. Guess what? It doesn’t matter. Only one thing matters. Your mindset. How you see yourself becoming the person you’ve decided to be right NOW. Don’t base your self-esteem on how smart you are or what marks you got on your Thermo midsem. I’ve got news for you. We’re all dumb. And it doesn’t make a difference to anyone or anything. I had to work 2-3x harder than the next person to get the same result. I don’t enjoy memorizing anything and I don’t like putting an enormous amount of pressure on myself to do 1000 examples of a bending moment calculation to help me finally understand how to solve one. Understand that the only thing that’s important about solving these problems is that you have the capacity to solve and understand them should you ever need to one day. But you probably will never have to because there’s simulation software that does it 1000x faster whilst providing a far a nice UX design that just needs you to input all the variables in. So where should your self-esteem stem from if it’s not your grades?

What’s engineering to you? To me, it’s not problem solving. I see it as problem understanding. People don’t know what they want. But they can sure tell you what they don’t want. This is because they’ve experienced what they don’t want but they haven’t yet experienced what they do want. So what does this mean? As an engineer, you should try to understand the ‘why’ behind everything. Keep asking why until you get to the base feeling of the problem. Is the problem causing frustration, anger, angst, etc. Back on track, many courses at uni focused too much on solutions, and understanding how to reach them given a set of constraints. Never giving us the opportunity to understand the higher level decision making behind these constraints. So we have a problem here - the coursework wasn’t giving me the capability to become a well-rounded engineer. We have a second problem - I’m not very good at memorizing the content that will give me good marks to pass the course. That snowballs into more problems - resentment towards the coursework, procrastination, doubt.

This is around about the time I was unsure about what it was I wanted, and it’s hard to work so hard towards something when you don’t even know what that something is going to be. Looking around, many people had jobs in project management, process auditing, engineering asset management. None of that sounded interesting to me. If students that had better marks than me were getting these sorts of internships, what chance did I have? But I didn’t even know what it is that I wanted. I thought about what I did enjoy doing and what it was about engineering that made me happy.

Working in a team that had all eyes on the same goal. Pretty simple.

I did my best work when I was around a good team building something together. This is where I learned the most and this is where work was no longer work. So I needed to meet more people that wanted to work on more projects. It’s not as fun by yourself. Once again, this is why meet-ups and events are so important. There are millions of people looking to work on something awesome, and just like you, are wanting to meet people to do that with. Go find them. Whatever your current direction is, go deeper into that path. If you take a detour you may find specifically something that itches your passion even further and suddenly you have a new ambition and new future vision of who it is you’d like to become. Don’t say no. If someone asks you to go to an event, don’t say no. You may somewhat extinguish their excitement, and you may miss an opportunity that influences the future you.

So you’ve started attending events and have started meeting new people that are interested in learning new skills. You’re working on new projects and you’ve ended up liking some of them and are slowly fine-tuning your passions. You know what you like doing and you know what you don’t like doing. Take photos of everything that you do. Document all of it. You’ll need it later.

Great, but you need money right? You need a job that pays you money to perhaps fund some of these projects, and maybe some dinner money too. There’s no get-rich-quick scheme. But that’s a good thing, because it means you have to earn your position - whatever it is. I know I complained about particular jobs earlier, but any opportunity is a good opportunity, if you don’t end up enjoying the work well that’s great because you know it’s not for you. Keep looking. But don’t stop looking. Especially for your first job. Getting rejected? Good. That means you are at least hearing back from a company. Heaps of them don’t even respond. Hundreds of them don’t respond. Every time I got a rejection I would screenshot the email and put it in my ‘Rejection Poster’ image folder for when I finally did land a gig - and I believed I would, always.

When they didn’t respond at all I would put their logo in that folder. As a reminder. The best things are always hard to get.

It’s a bit of a numbers game here, but it’s not just quantity, quality helps too. Tying in your passions from your projects, tying in your media and documentation of those projects, tying in your understanding of the problem rather than the solution, tying in your improved communication skills as a result of working on these projects and speaking to people about them, you’ll have purchased more tickets in the lottery that is finding a good engineering internship/graduate position. When you do get to the interview stages, talking about your projects and all the things you do outside of your coursework and how passionate you are about them causes a reaction in the interviewer - they start ticking all sorts of boxes on their checklist, because you have shown a key skill that is rare to find in grads: intuition and knowing how to do something without having to be told. Understanding and solving problems without being told to do so. If your marks aren’t good enough to land interviews then this is where your projects help you. The more you do and the more people you talk to about them will grow your network and you will start meeting people that know people that will hire you based on how excited you are about what you do.

Checkout what your university offers. It probably has an entrepreneurial or startup community. Go have a look. All the people there are passionate about problems. As an engineer, this is where you were made to be. Understanding the market and developing a product that ‘fits’ that market is not taught in engineering school, but the skills you learn in engineering school are perfect for developing that product. The amount of non-technical stuff you end up doing is up to you - usually the startups are always in need of more tech people - it’s a buyers market. Otherwise do it yourself with your engineering mates. Have a crack at something. It could be anything, you may end up liking it or you may end up hating it. But whichever it is, you’ll learn more about yourself, and you will have bettered the person you were yesterday - and that’s all that matters. Perhaps the set of skills required to develop that product are outside your set of tech skills. Here’s a chance for you to learn them if you were ever interested. What your major is doesn’t matter - get outside your comfort zone and try something new, you may end up liking that more. You don’t have to change your major, but it will benefit your career in one way or another. Lots of ME jobs for example want PCBa design experience, this wasn’t taught at my uni, but I learned it myself because I BECAME curious and it was required by the project I was working on.

As an engineer in Australia, there isn’t much of a manufacturing industry here to support engineering careers outside of civil projects. The jobs in PD we do have are highly competitive. In my final two semesters at university I spent 50% of my time doing my coursework and 50% of my time applying to jobs, filling in applications, doing the self-recorded video interviews, doing the psychological surveys they get you to do, all the other bullshit questionnaires. I had to outsource some of my coursework to have the time to focus on applying to jobs.

Because that’s all that mattered. Prioritise what matters.

You learn on the job, much more that you learn at uni. Focus on getting to that stage. For me, I used a project I was working on while I was at uni to get me my grad job in PD. Talking about that project showed the interviewers that I was genuinely passionate about making things, and love working with a team. A year later I have transitioned from being a student/graduate to an engineer, and that project I was working on has actualised into a crowdfunding Kickstarter campaign. I’m more excited about what I’m doing now than ever, and I still don’t know exactly what it is I want, but I feel the direction is right and I am getting a little closer to becoming the person whom I want to become. I can see I am moving away from all the uncertainties I had as a student, but reading through here brings back those feelings. I hope this post can bring some confidence to you that the future and your career get a lot better if you let them.

Hope this helps some students here."

1. For those enrolled in the online bachelor of science in Information Technology, what has your experience been like with the program? Can you speak to internship opportunities (while in school) as well as your success with job searches, especially taking into consideration it is an online program?
2. If I were to get in touch with an advisor, could I get a transfer credit evaluation of some kind  done before I apply so I know which of my current university credits will transfer?
3. Do out-of-state and in-state students pay the same amount of tuition for the online campus? Or, being a Virginia resident, do I need to pay out-of-state tuition? I did do my research, and could only find a per-credit hour charge, nothing for in-state/out-of-state.

* If you work professionally in a specialized field in Python, how did you get there? Tell us your story.
* Now that you're there, what would you recommend as the best way of getting to where you are now?

Long Version: I absolutely love Python. I have a pretty solid understanding of the basics of Python and taught it to myself after getting my CS degree. I spent countless hours on HackerRank, Codecademy, I have a github with a bunch of fun projects, some I've worked on tirelessly for months: [github.com/crawsome](http://github.com/crawsome) (Feel free to open issues and criticize if you're feeling generous). 

However, I am lacking so many of these highly-desired *Employability Artifacts* in areas I rarely touched. I graduated in 2017 from a decent, but aging CS program that trained us on C++98 / Java / low-quality database class / no web training / no APIs training / mostly IT Operations work internship). My current job is in IT operations and coding training is hard to obtain on-the-job.

I'm starting to look at the job market, and all jobs seem to require at least one of these:

* **Django / Web Development**
* **APIs**
* **Approaches to Unit Testing**
* **Machine Learning**
* **Networking**
* **Data Presentation / Visualization**
* **Databases / Enterprise-Level DBM**
* **AI**
* ""We're an *Agile shop*""

How did you get to where you are now? I personally work best with hands-on scenario-based tasks/projects.

dhwqzh,29,2019-10-14,"For those who have moved up to director roles or above, how did you get there and what was the most difficult step?",whatdoesitalladdupto,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dhwqzh/for_those_who_have_moved_up_to_director_roles_or/,"Let me start out by saying that this was the first subreddit I went to when starting at helpdesk and it has helped me tremendously in so many ways. Right now I feel like I've been stuck in IT project management and really unsure how to move up besides staying with a company and hoping a spot opens up. For starters, I love PM in IT, but I would of course like to continue moving up the ladder. I've been both a project and program manager, along with a lead PM role in my last job and I think the weakness on my resume is only being with a company for 2 years max. (Usually leave after hitting the ceiling.) To give you an idea of what my resume looks like, it's something like this,

Bachelors in business admin

PMP cert

Work experience,

IT analyst (3 months) - IT analyst II (6 months) - IT analyst Lead (1 year) - IT Project and Program management (4 years) - IT PM lead (2 years)

Early on I was fortunate enough to find mentors at the helpdesk level, and when the lead finally decided to leave I was able to grab his spot. From there getting into project management was a breeze as I was already heavily involved in projects. As a PM lead, I could definitely improve more of my soft skills when conducting meetings, and maintaining communication/control, and perhaps be a bit more confident. I know when I started at my job as the lead, some thought I was an intern until I got to work, which if I'm being honest definitely broke my confidence a bit and made it difficult to try and carry myself out as a lead(especially when the other PMs were the ones who thought I was the intern! lol, no idea how that wasn't communicated out.)

I worry that my scope of knowledge for IT may not be sufficient enough for director level, as right now I only know the outer level of all sides of IT. (Basically enough to know who to involve and what a realistic timeline for parts of a project is.) I know I'm shooting for the stars a bit, but to me it's what makes working and growing fun, and I'd really like to try and take my next big step. **For those of you who have reached those roles or above, what mostly helped you reach that position and what was most difficult? Also, given my situation, what would you advise I focus on if I were to look into reaching a similar role?**"
dhx4hr,2,2019-10-14,Considering dropping out of my alt cert program and resigning at the end of the semester (vent sesh and BIG kudos to all you certified teachers out there),clementine7,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/dhx4hr/considering_dropping_out_of_my_alt_cert_program/,"Just as the title says, I'm currently a couple of months into the school year/an alt cert program and I'm considering putting in my resignation for the end of this semester. 

I decided to go into an alt cert program because two years as a certified teacher are required to become a school counselor (or admin, or even a school librarian) in Texas. I've never really wanted to become a teacher but have always wanted to work in schools in a different capacity to help kids succeed. I thought I could bite the bullet and get through two years to achieve my ultimate goal. Now, less than two months into my first academic year, I'm completely reconsidering my career plans.

I'm currently working at a small title 1 school that is on an improvement plan. I've been told multiple times that this district is ""different"" and that this job is insane even for a seasoned and disciplined certified teacher. It's a high-turnover campus and I've heard word that multiple certified and experienced teachers are also considering leaving. I knew that the added requirements for teachers outside contract hours were demanding, but I didn't really understand the extent. I'm constantly behind and drowning in work. I struggle with mental health and have a really hard time getting any work done in the evenings and on weekends and subsequently, I'm even MORE behind. I love the kids and have formed some pretty good relationships with them, but I really don't feel like I'm cut out for this particular profession. I don't have the instincts or the drive to plan and manage a classroom or attend to all of the extra demands. My mental health and my temperament just honestly are not a good fit for the position. I'm actually in the process of scheduling a psychiatrist evaluation so I can be properly diagnosed and medicated for the depression and anxiety I struggle with. 

Even once I'm medicated and evened out, I just really don't feel like I want to continue with the profession and desperately want out. All of last week, my anxiety was so bad that I felt like vomiting on my way to work. We recently distributed a unit assessment and the scores were so alarming that I had multiple admin in my classroom making observations and my instructional coach has basically had to make managing me her-full time job. I appreciate the surprisingly wonderful support (especially since I understand that most teachers are not fortunate enough to receive it), but I really have been feeling disillusioned, incapable and generally like a failure. I spent half of the last week crying and started searching up other job options as well as contractual obligations in the case of resignation. 

I spoke with some other admin on campus about my struggle and it seems like I may be able to be amicably released from my contract if I can make it to December. They're incredibly supportive and recognize that this is a difficult district and that I don't have the background knowledge to support the demands. 

I'm just worried that I won't financially be ABLE to quit due to fees or repayments. My alt cert program may force me to pay the remainder of my balance even if I drop out and I'm already liable to repay the district a stipend that I received earlier in the year. I don't feel like it is ethically fair to force me to remain in a job that I can't adequately do and that is causing my mental health to flounder. I do understand that I signed contracts and agreements and I do understand that my mental health will cause me to struggle with any stressful position if it remains untreated. I just feel that as an uncertified intern, I should have some sort of an ""out"" if I truly decide that this career path isn't for me, rather than being forced to continue on with it to the detriment of my students. 

I just felt like I wanted to vent here because I've seen a lot of similar posts and knew that someone else could probably relate. My car broke down on my way to in-service today and I honestly felt relieved. I just want to be in a place where I'm disappointed when something like that happens because I'm truly excited to go to work (or at least not gripping the steering wheel in dread).

If anyone read this novel, I appreciate it. Unlimited kudos to every classroom teacher on this planet. This profession is *truly* metal and you all are incredible humans. 🤘



TL;DR- I'm floundering in my intern year as an alt cert teacher and I'm really strongly considering putting in my resignation. Mental health and simple incompatibility for the job are the main culprits. I'm feeling like a failure and also panicked about possibly of being trapped in the position due to contractual financial obligations. Just looking for support/a space to vent."

So here is the story, I am an international student at USF now but turned in my application for Spring 2020 at Tech, major in CS (very nervous ab that result comming in two weeks). Anyway, I got an internship offer for summer 2020 and planned to apply for CPT at Tech. However, from what I've read on the website, they say that 1 year of full time study is required before being eligible to obtain CPT, but they didn't say how that rule applied to student transferred in Spring. In that case, if I get in, I only have 1 semester at Tech before my internship and afraid that I won't be able to obtain CPT. 

DO THEY COUNT THE STUDY TIME AT THE PREVIOUS INSTITUTION TOWARD THAT 1 YEAR RULE?

dhy4j7,1,2019-10-14,Graduating Senior Unsure How to Proceed,UnderwaterEmpires,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dhy4j7/graduating_senior_unsure_how_to_proceed/,"  

So, I'm graduating this school year with an undergrad degree in computer science. I've had 3 internships over the course of my academic career, and the one I worked at last summer is offering me a full-time position for when I graduate. On paper everything seems to be going well. My parents are happy for me, and all my friends have been congratulating me on my return offer.

However, I’ve been apathetic and miserable about this whole thing. I got into CS because I really enjoyed building software. It seemed like I could create anything if I just had the knowledge and skills to do so. However, after getting some work experience, I've become jaded to software engineering and CS in general. One problem I have is the work is often boring. It usually just amounts to fixing bugs in legacy code, which isn't bad necessarily, except a lot of the time I'll suggest a better solution only to be shot down. This is usually because they're skeptical of the technology/framework, or they feel the rest of the team would be unable to understand what I'm suggesting. Also, even when the work gets somewhat challenging, I've found it can be hard to motivate myself. Either I don't care about the product or feel it doesn't have a big impact.

I've tried ignoring all this, but it's becoming impossible to do so, and is starting to negatively impact me. During my previous internship, my boss called me out on my seeming lack of enthusiasm, which he said several teammates had noticed. More recently, I've ignored several interview requests, because it doesn't seem worth the effort interviewing for a position that will probably be very similar to the ones I've had already. I'm just wondering if anyone has ever been in a similar situation and has any advice on how to proceed. I know most of this sounds like whining from someone who hasn't even had a full-time job before, but I'd appreciate some advice. Some of the things I've considered doing are:

1) Graduate School: This could potentially open the door to some interesting careers, but it means another 2+ years of school and more student debt.

2) Freelancing: From what I can tell, this would give me far more autonomy &amp; flexibility on what work on, but it's less stable than having a full-time job, and there's no perks like company provided insurance.

3) Sucking it up and just accepting my full time offer: Not my favorite option, but at least I'll be making money.

4) Start a company: super, super, risky, but I'll get to build software that I want to build.

TLDR; I've become jaded towards software engineering and computer science and am unsure what to do after I graduate."

dhz050,61,2019-10-14,Hunting for an Entry-Level CS Job as an International Student,cs_opt_throwaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dhz050/hunting_for_an_entrylevel_cs_job_as_an/,"Hi, everyone.

Recently, there was a post by an international student expressing their anxiety and hopelessness. Reading the comments, I realized that most people don't know where OP was coming from, what led them to such a bad place mentally, or just how limited their options are. There were many, many assumptions. I also saw suggestions that were well-intentioned, but would make the situation worse and I even saw a few suggestions that were illegal. I wanted so badly to respond to certain assumptions, but there were too many comments to respond to, so I'm making a post. This post will be long, because immigration laws are complicated.

A lot of international students are in STEM, specifically CS, so it's likely that they read/post in this sub. I am skipping over the following categories: working on-campus while still in school, working off-campus pre-graduation, H1B and employment-based green card. Each one of these is a separate category with their own challenges and many different restrictions that affect one's ability to get a job, but if I went into it, the post would be insanely long. It'll be too long as it is.

DISCLAIMER: My experience is not reflective of every international student's experience, or the hiring practices of every company. Additionally, please keep in mind that when I say 'job' or 'position' I am referring to entry-level because that is the type of position most recent grads apply for.

**OPT: POST-GRADUATION EMPLOYMENT**

I've met a lot of Americans who assumed I was on a work visa because I graduated. This is not true. Post-graduation employment is called OPT. It is an extension of F-1 (student) visa, which is an entirely different visa than H1B (colloquially known as the work visa). It also has absolutely nothing to do with a green card.

The process is the following:

\[1\] In your last (or last 2 semesters) start looking for a job for post-graduation. (Pre-graduation rules are different.)

\[2\] A few months before the graduation date, apply for OPT with the USCIS through snail mail. You can apply for OPT for up to 90 days before your graduation date and not a day sooner. Keep in mind that that it'll take at least a few weeks for your application to reach USCIS.

\[3\] Graduate.

\[4\] Wait for the USCIS to issue your employment authorization document (EAD card) for 3-5 months. 3-5 months starts from the date your application reaches USCIS, not the date you applied.

\[4.1\] You are not allowed to work during these few months, because working any job anywhere in the States in the period between graduation and getting your EAD card is illegal. Budget appropriately.

\[4.2\] Even if stars align and you are able to find a job, you're not allowed to work until your EAD card arrives, and you will have to explain to your prospective employer that you can't start until months down the road. This often results in retracted offers or not getting an offer in the first place.

\[5\] Your EAD card arrives and you can start working. It is incredibly rare for international students to score a job before their EAD card arrives due to conditions specified above, so you most likely will still be job-hunting.

\[6\] Your OPT is valid for only one year. In that whole year, you are allowed up to 90 days of unemployment (holidays and weekends included). Most people interpret this as 'you have 90 days to get a job', which is not entirely accurate, but is a valid interpretation.

\[7\] You are only allowed to work in your field. Getting a job outside of your field is illegal.

Essentially, in most cases you have to get a job in your field in 90 days as a recent graduate, otherwise you're kicked out of the country. Under the current administration, your field, AKA 'positions related to your major' are interpreted very strictly. This is the position you start from, which means you have no leverage, not to mention how stressed you feel due to financial difficulty your involuntary unemployment period created and the severely limited time for your job hunt.

Every single job posting in the States is required to ask: 'Do you need sponsorship now or in the future?' on a job application. International students on OPT do not need sponsorship now (only H1Bs and green cards require it), but they will in the future, so you have to say yes. The second a prospective employer sees that you said yes, they most likely toss your resume in the trash, especially if they are a small or medium-sized company. I've had recruiters literally hang up on me and the same small to medium-sized companies deny me an on-site interview based ONLY on that fact - I heard it straight from the company or the recruiter. I felt helpless and I was in a dark place for a long time, because this is not something you can change. No amount of resume polishing, internships or people skills can change the fact that you need sponsorship.

I learned that companies generally do not know or care that OPT and its STEM extension do not require sponsorship and  treat every international job seeker who says 'yes' to the question above like you need sponsorship now. In practice, that means as an international student, you should aim to apply to companies that sponsor, because they won't deny you an interview based on your status. That includes, but is not limited to big Ns, wealthy start-ups in large cities, as well as large non-technical companies. They will not deny you the chance to interview if they think you're good enough, even though your legal status is a hassle. Your ability to get an interview there, fail or pass is based on your own merit, which is freeing. That's essentially all we want: an opportunity to fail.

To illustrate just how bad our odds are, I'd like to tell you about the last job/career fair I attended at my university. There were 150+ local companies there. No big Ns, but large companies in other fields were present, as well as some successful medium-sized tech companies. Of the 150+ companies present, 4 were offering sponsorship. Out of those 4, 2 were in my field.  In the past, this number was larger, but now it is incredibly small. (Don't forget the whole '90 days to find a job' thing.)

If I had to generalize, I would guess that close to 80% of available entry-level CS positions are unofficially closed to international students (I say unofficially, because no company will come out and say it, but they will show it in their hiring practices). If the number was even higher than that, I would not be surprised. In a lot of the positions where we do have a chance, the competition is insane since everyone and their grandmother is trying to get in. This whole setup creates an incredibly vulnerable demographic that some large companies, both domestic and international prey on. When job-hunting, you have to watch out for those kinds of job postings as well so that you don't get burned.

Down the road, H1B and employment-based green card make this process look like a cake walk. Taking everything above into account, as well as things I don't have space for, some of us end up in a very dark place mentally. The worst thing is not the rejection, it's the helplessness you feel when you realize rejection is not due to skill, but rather due to something that is impossible to change. An entry-level CS job is difficult enough to find for the average job-seeker, let alone a job seeker who has been crippled in additional ways.

The goal of this post is to try to present challenges that are specific to international students job-hunting CS positions in the States post-graduation. It was inspired by a recent post and the resulting comments. The process is long, draining and can severely affect your mental health. What I presented here is just the tip of the iceberg, there are a lot of other factors that compound over time and lead you to a hopeless state with a large serving of helplessness. I hope at least some things in this post were helpful in correcting assumptions and answering questions. Next time an international student posts about their anxiety over job searching, please do not assume they are chasing big Ns for money, think some jobs are beneath them, have unrealistic expectations, need to take a walk, talk to a therapist or just get a hobby. Their situation is entangled in complex legal and practical matters and their reasons might be entirely different than what you'd expect.

To all of the people who had an uplifting word on the recent post, thank you very much. To all the international students out there, I hear you, I feel you and I'm sorry. Don't give up. You are in an incredibly difficult position and this is just the start of the struggle, but it's not impossible. Also, if you post on reddit asking for advice, double-check with an immigration attorney as well as your friends in the know to see if that advice is helpful or even legal. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

TLDR: Be kind to one another."

di00m6,1,2019-10-14,22 and moving out of my parents house... but they have no idea.,ohmygoditsbeautiful,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/di00m6/22_and_moving_out_of_my_parents_house_but_they/,"Hello everybody, so the title pretty much says it all but I will give a little background to my situation.

I graduated from my University in April, moved home and worked at a bar for a few months while looking for full time jobs and then was offered a contract position at a large company. I panicked and took it (afraid nothing else would come around for a while), and I hate it. It makes me miserable, and I was pretty much lied to about the job description (supposed to be event planning, I am literally just an office assistant). I am so bored, learning nothing, have no room for growth, and my coworkers are all at least twice or three times my age, making me the youngest in the office by MILES. My anxiety and depression has never been worse than it is now. Every day seems long and dreadful and I can barely make myself get out of bed. Weekends are not much better since all my friends are elsewhere. I am not the kind of person you can put in a cubicle and give monotonous work. I have been told the position won't change, and that solidified my decision to quit as soon as I could.

I have always hated where I lived growing up, and realized I am my absolute worst when I am there. I live in a very wealthy area, and the emphasis on money always bothered me. I constantly felt pressured to be someone I am not, mostly by my parents. My whole life they have made me feel bad about the person I am, made me believe that everything I did reflected (badly) back to them, and were really never there for me when I needed them emotionally and simply cannot comprehend mental illness and deny that mine is real. I am literally better off on my own. My mom and I have always butted heads about everything from clothes to my friends to the fucking food I eat. She is controlling and tries to give me curfews (I am 22...) and constantly wants to know where I am and what I am doing. She screams and throws tantrums when things do not go her way and makes us feel entitled to doing things for her because of ""all the money she spent on us"". They are not this way with my sisters, only me. I overall feel stifled and that I cannot grow as a person. Not a healthy environment and never has been. 

I went to college across the state. Here, I thrived. I got involved on campus, found things that made me really happy, narrowed down my interests and passions, made my first real, true friends in my life, and worked my ass off both in school and in my many jobs and internships I had throughout my four years. I LOVED being on my own, being in charge of my own path without any immediate pressure from my family. I was so happy. Not to mention I feel in love with the City. Ever since I was a sophomore I told myself (and my parents) that I wanted to stay here after graduation and get a job. I had no intention of moving home, but they guilted me into it almost immediately after graduation. Over the last two months, I have become increasingly vocal about my decision to move out and how unhappy I am here - to the point that I let them know I will not be living here by the New Year at the latest. They fail to understand, fail to believe me, and overall keep trying to convince me that I will make the wrong decision if I choose to move. They continue to push their local connections on me and offer me ins at other large companies in my area, pushed me to join the family business (in due time I will, just not now), and are doing everything in their power to make me stay. They tell me, in typical boomer fashion, that I just need to tough it out and get over my sadness and that a lot of other less fortunate people would be elated to be in my position. They try and guilt me into staying by telling me how much of my life they have paid for, how much they have done for me, and that I cannot do it and will not succeed and am making the wrong decision by quitting this comfortable job and moving out and thinking I don't have a long term plan. They tell me I am doing this for all the wrong reasons. Nothing they do or say can convince me otherwise. 

So I took matters into my own hands. About two months ago, I decided I was sick of being controlled and guilted and told that I was always wrong. At this same time, one of my best friends got a job in this City, as suggested we live together. So under the guise of visiting friends (which I was, for the most part), I started driving out to my college City to look for apartments. After a few weeks we found one, and put down the deposit. My parents have no idea. Not a clue. The lease is signed, the apartment is ours. We can move in in three weeks. I have thought long and hard about this decision and I need to be on my own right now, and far away. I am actively working on finding a new full time position before I go, but am also 100% comfortable  and happy bartending for a bit if nothing materializes (they hate this idea - makes it look like I am a failure). I have the money to do it (both saved up from this current job and over the past five years of working), but it is in bank accounts that they share with me, and monitor. I am going to take out enough for a year's rent and go. I am ready to take this risk on my own.

My question is this: how do I tell them/how do I handle the backlash? How do I get them to understand that this is the best decision for me right now? I am afraid they will take away my car and lock my bank accounts, or something else crazy. 

TL;DR: miserable at home, moving across the state in 3 weeks. my parents don't know. worried about backlash once I tell them."
di00re,2,2019-10-14,Looking for feedback on personal statement for genetics program,astronaut_bear,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/di00re/looking_for_feedback_on_personal_statement_for/," The program I am writing this letter for is through a genetics program at University of Washington. They will grant my admission, and I will later apply to a computational molecular biology multidisciplinary program (that's the plan anyways). The program's website doesn't say what to cover in the letter, so I've followed the advice of people in the bioinformatics sub and tried to cover my academic and research background leading me to want to pursue this field of research, potential research interests, and why I want this program. The limit says 1-3 pages (not sure if double spaced, if anyone has input for that let me know but I'm assuming it can be either way if it's not specified) and I'm at about 2.5 pages here without a heading and such. I received feedback [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/deb9lc/grad_school_letter_of_purposepersonal_statement/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/dessm6/phd_application_personal_statement_looking_for/) if you want to see what other people have said or where I started from. My background is a bit more wet-lab, but I am trying to transition to a computational bio/bioinformatics field.

So any feedback would be appreciated. I am in the US, so this letter is not written to a specific PI, but to a program where I will do lab rotations for my first year, then choose a project. If these posts are detracting from the point of this community let me know and I will bring it elsewhere.

Also, one final question: I have two letters of rec confirmed, one from a professor and one from a professor/research advisor. For my third, I was planning to ask one of the PhDs/directors at my current place of work, since that is my first full-time industry position. However, I could also ask one of the people at a former research lab I worked at, but I left that lab over a year ago, and I think the person I would ask no longer works there, and she was not a PI but a lab manager. Any thoughts? Thanks!

&gt;What interests me most about researching genetics is the capacity to remove elements of randomness confining human advancement. Many individuals are shackled by afflictions inherited at birth that will prevent them from fully enjoying the wonders of the modern age. Still more people are plagued with evolutionary simple but existentially menacing pathogens. Many more are subject to malnutrition and food insecurity. A greater understanding of human genetics and the genetics of the species we most interact with will grant more agency over our existence. I want to dedicate my time to understanding the code of life and using advancements in genetics to resolve crises preventing human flourishing.  
I graduated \[SCHOOL\] in the winter of 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology awarded summa cum laude. As an undergrad I explored research at three labs in distinct fields of biology that shaped the direction of my career goals. I condensed my degree acquisition to three and a half years so I could secure an open position at a local biotech institution where I was an intern. I continue to work at \[WORK\] as a biological technologist. I have grown quickly within the company. Four months after hire, my quick proficiency in my department granted me the responsibility of training new arrivals on our technologies and practices, and I became the leader of a team of technologists analyzing genetic data through restriction digest gel-electrophoresis visualization. My aptitude in my department allowed me to expand my skillset to all steps of the DNA examination process from wet-lab extraction and amplification to high-throughput multiplex analysis techniques. Since graduating, I have used my free time to pursue independent learning of mathematic and programming skills I did not cover in school. I have focused on learning Python and worked with data science libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn to work with large data sets and machine learning. I am also learning linear algebra for application in programming and machine learning. I wrote a few scripts automating repetitive tasks for my workflow at \[WORK\] to save time and reduce error. I continue to practice python using problem sets at Rosalind (a platform dedicated to learning programming for bioinformatics). I intend to continue practicing programming and learning more about the tools of computational biology, as well as refreshing my knowledge of statistics. I have found immense satisfaction and potential with the efficiency and accuracy of computational analyses, and I want to apply computational approaches to biological questions and the advancement of the human condition.  
I have been fortunate in my early academic career to explore several research settings. Each experience had different unique skillsets, but overall principles of research were conserved and fortified at every lab. At my first research lab at the WSU Sleep Research and Performance Center, I had to quickly adopt methodical experimental execution and data collection. I learned how easily data’s narrative can be sullied by unconsidered variables or omitted records. I gained thorough data collection and analysis skills working with the most unpredictable and noisy systems (humans). My experience whetted my appetite for research, but I knew I wanted a more involved role, and I looked to gain more research experiences to pave my way to grad school.  
My next research experience was at the NDSU Agriculture Research Outreach Center. Attention to detail was further reinforced, as most of my daily activities revolved around experimental treatment application and data collection. I also learned the necessity of sufficient scientific communication. They were in their busiest season, so I functioned mostly autonomously, and I had to be sure I fully understood the conditions I had to meet. Departments at the center had different backgrounds and research goals, but they had to share resources and information to help other projects be conducted properly. I attended weekly meetings where researchers discussed resource allocation and projects so others could work around them. They also had several public presentations of new research findings to local farmers, many of whom had little or no higher education. I saw that successful scientists need to have clear exchanges with researchers working on the same project, scientists in different fields of study, and the public to which they are responsible.  
Later, I worked with a professor at \[SCHOOL\] in a self-directed research testing a parasitic fungus for biocontrol potential. Since I was directing the studies, I learned the importance of asking meaningful and novel questions in a scientifically testable manner. Asking sufficiently probing questions required innovative synthesis of concepts, and distinguishing what is assumed or ignored from what is known. I also had to construct unique methods for my tests by parsing techniques from other studies. The species I was working with, *Pyrenophora seminiperda*, was not yet well characterized. I got to experience working on the cutting edge of scientific knowledge: for many hypotheses, there were not obvious predictions. This led me to experience failure. Most of my predictions were not significantly supported. A bitter blow after much data acquisition, but it helped pave the path for future researchers to advance the understanding and utilization of this biocontrol. I presented my research at an undergraduate conference, where students and faculty from all disciplines asked about my research in small group settings. I had to tailor vocabulary and level of detail based on my audience to keep their attention and affirm understanding. This was the most comprehensive research experience of my undergraduate career, and it further reinforced my desire to direct scientific inquiries.  
At my current job, my role is mostly executing established procedures for data collection, but I have been given some research and development responsibilities by directors at the company. The research mostly involves developing new disease screenings or improving outcomes of existing tests. Since I know the quirks of the existing tests, I provide input on the optimization of conditions for new ones. I also run validations of new tests so directors can approve new tests. In a busy clinical setting, the directors and I don’t interact constantly, so clear communication of goals, protocols, conditions, and results have to be transmitted in short briefings. Informal communication in this manner has greatly strengthened my communication with scientists working in similar settings.  
My interest in this program results from my admiration for interdisciplinary scientific fields, my passion to advance human flourishing, and my recognition of the exponential potential of computing power for human development. My passion for human flourishment led me to study the life sciences with the intention of working in health fields. I explored neuroscience and worked in a human sleep and performance lab. I discovered that working with in behavior research was too uncontrolled and the neuroses of the mind were too unpredictable. I wanted more actionable results. I redirected my attention a field with more directly impactful potential for global human advancement: agriculture. I worked at an agriculture research facility and later with a plant-ecology focused researcher at my school. Towards the end of my undergraduate career I transitioned my focus to genetics, still with an interest in agriculture and food production. I learned of the immense potential of gene editing and quantitative genetic analysis. I became captivated by the wonderful opportunities of understanding and manipulating the building blocks of life. I also learned about the power of meta-analyses and the potential for algorithmic approaches in problem solving to cause exponential growth in scientific advancement. I decided I wanted to learn more about and manipulate the code of life. University of Washington offers all of the opportunities for learning I want to apply in my career. If I am admitted to your program, I plan to pursue interdisciplinary research through Computational Molecular Biology program and/or the Big Data for Genomics and Neuroscience Training Grant.  
I want to couple the analytical power of computational problem solving with genetic toolkits to address humanity’s greatest afflictions. Specifically, I am most interested in GMO agriculture, but I have interests in identifying genetic and epigenetic markers for disease, human genome editing, and antibiotic alternatives. My diverse background in several fields of research has taught me skills in scientific questioning, meticulous experimental execution and data collection, and clear scientific communication. With my skills in the lab with all stages of DNA analysis paired with my affinity for programming, I hope to bridge and direct the best modern tools to the biggest modern problems. Through advancements in genetics via computational analyses, I see the next chapter in human development: one where we can leave behind the limitations of our birth and the randomness of the world around us to create a happier world for all."

di265s,28,2019-10-14,"Current and future CE students: If you wanna become a programmer, don't do CE",Alvaroszi,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/di265s/current_and_future_ce_students_if_you_wanna/,"Current CE junior, taking ENEE350, ENEE303, ENEE222, and CMSC330 as well as going through the very time consuming process of applying and getting internships

I want to warn any current freshman or student in high school thinking about majoring in CE here at UMD, I want to do you a favor, so please listen to this post (that some people might think is a rant, but I don't care, I don't want anyone to go through the same bs that most of my CE friends and myself have gone through).

Unless you want to do embedded systems, chip design or anything that involves hardware, forget about majoring in CE.

If you want to pursue a career in programming, just do CS. I've met a few dozens of CE students, and all of them (including myself) had 1 thing in common: they wished they just majored in CS.

Now, why is this? Well, all of the people mentioned above except 1 (which happens to a close friend of mine) want to pursue a career in programming, and why shouldn't you do CE if you want to do that? Well, if you are CE your semesters will be something like this: You will be doing your CS projects, but often times some stupid ENEE course will have a midterm coming up, for which you will have to spend a decent amount studying since the material for these courses is fairly challenging, if an ENEE course is not taking your time away then it will be a natural science course, physics or chemistry for instance, and after studying for that you'll often find yourself stressing over whether you'll have time to do anything on top of those classes and CS or let alone finish your CS project.

If you were CS on the other hand, you wouldn't have to worry about all these pointless classes, and you could put more time into developing the skills necessary to become a good programmer, as well as having more free time due to having easier electives.

Now, some pretentious CE major might tell you: ""well, CE majors have a higher entry salary blah blah blah"". Well, guess what, those super high salaries that apparently CE majors enjoy, are mostly from programming jobs, so you could end up with a job like that even if you graduated with a CS degree!

At this point in my career, it does not make sense for me to switch to CS due to the amount of credits per semester that I would have to take to graduate in 4 years, but if I could go back to the beginning of sophomore year knowing what I know today about the major, I would change majors without hesitation, so if you are on of those people trying to understand whether you should switch from CE to CS, please consider this post, don't make the same mistake I made.

Edit: Forgot to mention, as a CS major you get to take 7 400level CS courses, while you get to take 1 as a CE major, 2 if you decide to do CMSC412 instead of ENEE447, so you will probably graduate from college having a wider knowledge about advanced CS topics if you are a CS major than if you are a CE major, which also saddens me to admit, but it's the truth"
di26ol,5,2019-10-14,GitHub Internship Application Process,shareitworks,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/di26ol/github_internship_application_process/,"So I received an email from the recruiter today saying she wants to have a quick video chat with her concerning the internship. Does anyone have any idea about the internship application process at GitHub ? Are the internship interviews hard ? I made a quick research on Glassdoor, and it seems like they do not have the traditional Algorithm &amp; Data Structure interview for intern applicants.  Im wondering how selective they are in selecting interns."
di28a6,1,2019-10-14,Kicking bad habits but I'm afraid its already too late for me,Kal947,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/di28a6/kicking_bad_habits_but_im_afraid_its_already_too/,"I'm 25 and a recent graduate. I was an IT major and I've two internships in my field. One went well one didn't end so well. I can blame my porn addiction for my poor performance now because I know better and I'm doing my very best to break that habit. I had no idea how badly it affects your mind until recently. It could be a big cause behind my social anxiety, brain fog,  memory problems and other things. Problem is, some former bosses won't respond to my emails except the CIO and I asked them to take a page down that I had written for them so if I needed to exclude it from my resume, I could. All you need to do is look up my name on google and theres the page I wrote. Not taking it down

After graduation, I also had a contract position in my field I was let go from because they weren't happy with my performance even though they barely trained me, I couldn't ask questions, and I wasn't even a month into it. With all this considered, I'm just scared I won't get another opportunity. I had to go back to my crappy old job which will cover me a bit for now. I really hate running into people from high school who are all getting into their careers especially my dream girl who has seen me doing said crappy work. It was embarrassing to say the least. I feel like such a failure."
di2mj3,4,2019-10-15,Navigating career decisions with debt - is there any way at all to pay off debt and still have work-life balance?,theheeltear,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/di2mj3/navigating_career_decisions_with_debt_is_there/,"I am 27, earned my degree in HR management in January. I hadn't pursued any internships or anything because towards the end of completing the degree I decided I didn't want to pursue the field.

I am starting to reconsider this however. I've been waiting tables for years and sick and tired of it. I have 37k in student loan debt, 5k car, 6k credit card debt. I need to earn more money. Thinking about either pursuing HR after all or trying a sales job. On the other hand, I thought of pursuing a trade like electrician.

I want to pay off my debt and achieve financial independence. But at the same time, I've spent a lot of time researching, including reading all of the top posts in this sub, and I don't want to be chasing a carrot at the end of a stick. Sure I can try to hustle and pay off my debt by my early thirties (ideally). But then I wasted my prime years when I could have been using them to build lifetime connections and having fun experiences.

I don't want to chase this life of more and more money and higher status. I don't want a stressful life. My dream is to be content and eventually have a family - a long-term partner and dog at the very least. I don't want to work any more than 40 hours a week, if that. I want to have time to breathe and relax and enjoy life. I had a lackluster social life growing up, so it is extremely important to me now.

But it seems like any salary that would allow this lifestyle will never allow me to actually pay off debt, and so it will be hanging over my head for the foreseeable future, making any low salary I accept even lower as a portion will go to payments. I don't want to struggle to pay bills for the rest of my life.

Is there any known solution to this? I haven't seen any discussions about this exact conundrum. I feel extremely stagnant and need to make a move, but not sure what direction to take."

di345v,0,2019-10-15,Do I have any realistic shot a Blizzard internship?,Grimnak,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/di345v/do_i_have_any_realistic_shot_a_blizzard_internship/,"Hi there!  I sincerely apologize if this is posted in the wrong sub, but I found other posts related to this topic in here from years past so I figured it'd be okay.

In a nutshell, I'm a junior at a fairly competitive university in Computer Science/Engineering.  I've played Blizzard games just about my whole life and am very well-versed in the main IPs, I'd say.  I wanted to some opinions from people about whether I stand any real chance of being selected for an internship this summer, keeping in mind the fact that they choose &lt;1% of their applicants and I've never really done any ""personal projects"".

Notable things I could talk about/expand upon:

\- Team of 4 at university created a robot from scratch designed to navigate an obstacle course and do certain tasks.  Fully documented experience online for Blizz to look at.

\- A friend and I created a video game for the blind in under 24 hours in a ""hackathon""-style competition.  You had to navigate a maze that you couldn't see, and instead had to rely on sounds and vibrations for cues regarding your position (hitting a wall, getting warmer/colder, etc).

\- This previous summer I interned at NASA where I teamed up with another intern to build a 3-D, navigable simulation of planetary data from scratch.  We did it all in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the end result was capable of reading in tons of data from MATLAB, render a full scene with planets, satellite orbits, the Sun, and ground stations all positioned exactly where the data said to position them.  It also had a full-on UI, was capable of taking images and videos, and was completely open-source (this was basically a requirement) meaning no external software outside of MATLAB was needed.

&amp;#x200B;

That's about it.  Like I said, no personal projects to speak of.  I've done lots of research to try and figure out what it is exactly Blizzard would value over other things but I can't find much.  I don't have a LinkedIn profile, either, which didn't hurt me for NASA apparently, but I'm not sure if it's critical that I get one set up full-blown or not.  In either case, thanks for reading!"

di4wjm,45,2019-10-15,Nervous about interviews? Some tips for those of you that get real nervous and perform poorly at interviews.,solrose,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/di4wjm/nervous_about_interviews_some_tips_for_those_of/,"First things first, it is important to remember that **We ALL get nervous** to some degree.  

If someone tells you they never get nervous to any degree, THEY ARE LYING.  Part of overcoming this nervousness is a bit of understanding of why we get nervous.

So here are the three main reason individuals get nervous:

- Fear of the unknown
- Lack of control
- Lack of self confidence

With these reasons in mind, here are some steps one can take to help mitigate the issue and start to improve their performance.

**5-Step Action Plan To Help Tackle These Nerves**

1. Map out the route to the interview location - Seems simple enough, but many people are so afraid of showing up late that they don’t sleep well the night before. Therefore, I recommend that you map out the route and time the travel. If necessary/possible, make a dry run a few days beforehand. Worried you’ll oversleep? This is another fear that keeps people from having a good night sleep. I recommend you set 2–3 alarms and make sure that one of them is across your bedroom so you have to get up and won’t be tempted to hit that snooze button. Also, keep those shades open so the natural sunlight will slowly start to wake you.

2. Pick out your clothing the day before - Running around looking for the socks that match your pants or realizing you have to iron your shirt is a crappy way to start the day. Get it all ready the day before and set out and ready the night before.

3. Research questions &amp; Prepare answer - As I mentioned in my interview mini series a few months back, there are some standard questions that come up at most interviews. By preparing a general answer to these questions beforehand, you can make sure that you cover all of the important part of your skills &amp; background that answer that question. It always sucks to think of something you want to add to an answer while you are travelling home from the interview. So have he answer prepped beforehand to avoid this issue.  In addition to these standard questions, try to reach out to anyone you know who has interviewed with this specific firm. Find out some of the types of questions they ask and also get an understanding of of what is important to them. Then you can gear your answers and highlight your specific skills that are important to them. Have a look at that mini-series for more on this specific topic - Here’s the link to the first article in that series - Crushing Your Engineering Interview (Day 1/5) - Tell me about yourself, your failures &amp; successes *Link removed for Reddit posting, but feel free to PM me and I'll send it over.*

4. Tailor your skills &amp; experience to this job - When you read the job description, what was it about the job that made you say “this is the job for me”? Over the years, you have likely gained some great skills and knowledge from your classes and internships. The key is to pull out the important ones that apply to the job that you are trying to land. This is important for two reasons. First, there is limited time at the interview to state your case and you don’t want to waste time giving details that are not of interest to them. Second, you want them to remember the applicable skills/qualities and not have their decision blurred by items that are not relevant.  Do some research beforehand by reaching out to others with similar roles (even in other firms). Ask them what skills/knowledge they use most often or perhaps which ones they wish they new more about. Then you can use these to guide your answers.

5. “Know” your interviewer - So much of the job search depends on personal connections. If your interviewer can picture you as a good fit for their team, then you have a much better shot at landing the job. Therefore, take some time to research the individual(s) that are interviewing you on places such as LinkedIn or even search for articles they have written. Try to see where you might have similar interests and ensure that they are discussed to improve the personal connection.  Also, this applies to knowing the company as well. Try to research their culture and the problems they solve for their clients. Once again, having a match here shows the interviewer that you can be a good fit for their team.

I hope this helps set you on the right path.  Feel free to be in touch via PM or leave a comment if you have any questions or need some guidance."

I've just started my degree in Computing ([TA312](https://www.it-tallaght.ie/index.cfm/page/course?code=TA_KACOS_D)) and, long story short, want to get an internship (in Dublin) by the next summer (3-months).

No prior coding skills or projects, however, as I'm at the beginning, I think of focusing on building a website as a portfolio. At the moment, I'm getting familiar with HTML, CSS, Python, and Flask (I study extra outside classes).

I've been roaming around LinkedIn, Indeed and job platforms as such, and as far as I can see, Amazon has lots of positions.

For anyone who has had an internship with Amazon before, how do you think, not having a real-life experience + [AWS SAA](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) certificate (or any other associate) + a website as a portfolio + good grades in school is real to get me a job like [this](https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/jobs/949571/cloud-support-associate-internship-2020-dublin?dclid=CM3vq_KLnuUCFcxjFQgdUlQEIQ&amp;iis=Job+Posting&amp;iisn=Indeed+%28Free+Posting%29&amp;mode=job&amp;utm_campaign=all_amazon&amp;utm_content=organic&amp;utm_medium=job_aggregator&amp;utm_source=indeed.com)?

If not, what would you suggest to aim at in order to increase my chances of finding an internship to land my first job in IT?

Any piece of advice is appreciated. Thank you for your time."

Now I want to learn about collecting, analyzing, preprocessing and manipulating data. Partially because I really need that stuff (my final/dream project to do is something like online automatic web scraping NBA results, organizing the results and then feeding that data into an ML algorithm to make predictions) and partially because I think I might be better off starting as a Data Analyst intern (not Data Scientist intern) because I am only 17 (well 17 in 2 months) and it is gonna be hard finding a company who would accept me with that alone but I am not giving up.

I digress, I learned some SQL and SQL+Python implementation but I wanna move on to Big Data with Hadoop, because (at least I suppose), that is how people in companies do data manipulation and collection. I watched an introduction to Hadoop, and TBH I don't have a clue what I should do, there is so many software to choose from Hive, Spark, Storm, Pig, Oozie, Zookeeper, Presto, etc, etc.

I would be so grateful if someone could point me to somewhere, I really don't wanna learn a bunch of software and then to find out it is not relevant or not used.

And also, related to that job finding, does anyone from Belgium has any experience with a company that might accept non-major interns?"
di7v5f,3,2019-10-15,Feeling Tension/Pressure to Hire Someone,HardKorvax,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/di7v5f/feeling_tensionpressure_to_hire_someone/,"Location is US.

Currently in a senior management role and in a situation where I need additional resources to help with tasks I don't have time for.

I initially requested an entry level person I can train quickly to take some tasks off my plate and it was approved by exec team but  the hiring process dragged on so long my candidate (was intern) wound up leaving to do something else.

In the meantime, someone in another department is pushing their own candidate now, for this role, with nearly the same amount of experience I have, and has been derailing my hiring effort by getting into the execs mind that we need to hire someone with this amount of experience.

I feel this would not only be a waste of resources, but would produce tension in my small department as we would have two cooks in the kitchen, instead of me training someone to do a great job.

The other catch is, the person pushing this candidate and the candidate worked together in sales/marketing at another company, which wound up failing financially. This is public knowledge, but the executive team may not be aware of this.

I don't want to sound like I'm being paranoid, but I don't want conflict and I don't want two people in management positions ganging up on me.

What is the best way to approach this?"

I am trying (It might already be too late this year) to break into the Wealth Management sector of J.P Morgan. Currently, I am in 3rd year of college and I am seeking an Internship for the summer.  So far, I've kept up to date with a few analysts from the certain branch I am trying to get into and I am trying to make more connections within the firm so I can get an Intnerhship if not for my junior year, then hopefully FT my senior year. 

Here is the thread of messages that I've had so far with a campus recruiter for the Wealth Management division of J.P Morgan: 

* \[Me\]: Hello (recruiter)! I'm a student \[at university\] and I would love to have a chance to speak with you over the phone. I won't take too much of your time. Really, I want to know about your experience in WM and what I can do to put my best foot forward to ultimately land an internship. Thanks for any attention to this.
* \[Recruiter\]: Hello! I’d love to chat. What does your schedule look like Wed-Fri this week?
* \[Me\]: Hi (recruiter)! I am available to talk on Thursday from 1:00 pm-3:00 pm and all day on Friday.  Does Friday at 9 am work for you? If not, I can work with whatever time is best for you as I know you are very busy recruiting and traveling.   I hope your week is going great. Eager to hear from you! 

What do you think I can do to put my best foot forward when speaking with her? I know this is a small step but I want to make sure I can make the best impression possible especially since it's a phone call. 

Thank you for any and all the help."

Because I'm retaking that class now, my GPA won't be back to above a 3.0 until December, when this semester ends. On the online application, it didn't require me to put down my GPA or send any transcripts and I didn't have it down on my resume either, so I'm worried that it's going to come up in the interview tomorrow or any other potential future interviews with them. I'm scared that, if I do well in the interviews, they'll end up asking for my transcript right before they decide whether I get the offer or not.

di9o82,3,2019-10-15,"New undergrad strongly considering starting in Public sector due to fear of failure in a high intensity, fast-paced environment. Is this a bad idea?",throwawaysonataferry,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/di9o82/new_undergrad_strongly_considering_starting_in/,"Let me preface my post with the fact that I wish to work in software development.

My background: I don't have a CS/engineering degree (instead, it's a math degree). My experience with programming (C/C++) has been mostly self-taught. I've done 2 relatively small software projects and an internship where I programmed in C/C++. However, I know I am a weak programmer/candidate when compared to the other people who have either years of experience/the right degrees.

I graduate in May 2020 and I just can't help but feel like crap in the sense I know I have a lot of self-studying to do but I can't get myself to stick to my plans (I just laze off). My plan is essentially to start in public and utilize the slow environment (aka free time) to self-studying and improve my skills. I know that if I start in public sector, then it will be extremely tough to change to private later on if I have a change of heart. However, when I recall my internship experience (start-up), I felt an extreme amount of pressure despite that there was low expectations of me. Additionally, even though I learned a lot, I feel like I didn't accomplish much in the short amount of time I spent there (less than 3 months). Keep in mind that I worked 45-50 hours per week during my internship and every day after I got home, I'd feel really tired and couldn't force myself to study after work.

I have a strong eagerness to learn and am passionate about this field but I know one of my biggest weaknesses is that I hit ""depressive"" states where I just don't stay focused on my goal and doze off to something irrelevant. Does anyone have advice/opinions on this?"

I was working with someone from HR (let's call them X) in some paperwork I had to fill. This other HR employee (let's call them Y) was responsible for my hiring process and sent me and email to get in touch with X for the paperwork. 

However, that's where my problems start: she sent it to my previous email. I had configured an automated response on my previous email, but apparently I didn't do it properly and the message was never sent to her. Y then proceeded to send me and email with a very aggressive tone basically saying ""look, you need to work on the paperwork otherwise you'll have to quit the company"". Mind you, I was already working on it and had sent everything to X, but never got an answer on it, so I emailed X asking for an update. Apparently X forwarded my email to Y, who then sent another email on my older email with more aggressive language.

 The only reason I saw those emails was because today she sent me an email (all nicelly worded as my manager was in copy) that I never got on my current inbox, so I guessed she may have sent it to the wrong email. And then I saw it.


Of course, it's my fault for not checking if the auto message was working and I understand she was stressed because she never got an answer and wasn't aware on where we were in the process. So I thought about sending an apology for the mistake. On the other hand, she was very not so nice to me in private and I was baffled when I saw her emails.

What should I do?"

The work scope and depth is really taxing on me, but that is not enough as my boss really makes bad decisions he'll just accept New projects and set unrealistic deadlines with customers where it clearly we don't capacity to take more projects, I told him this clearly multiple times that it's poor management and we have either to stop accepting projects or hire More people which he's against -he actually wanted to layoff some of the team to get More people for cheap - so he's hiring interns with no pay to take the new projects.
The thing is in my country interns and fresh graduates usually don't have real experience and colleges really don't prepare you for a job, so they would start working excited for New challenges and they often miss up or quit because of the pressure and off course I have to clean up mess, I feel like I'm not happy or developing myself and my salary is really low and he doesn't pay me overtime. 
I would quit if I can and I'm constantly looking for other jobs but the situation is really difficult for me to find a job here and I need the money.

Since accepting offer #2, I have gotten an offer to fly out and interview with a third company that pays much, much more and works with a more modern tech stack. I’m worrying I’m starting to do too much. 

What happens when an intern accepts an offer to just months later take it back and say they can no longer work?

I have zero experience with this field. But I wish to go into information technology because computers fascinate me and interest me. My current major is “computer support AAS” at my local technical school because my local university doesn’t offer an IT degree. So my question is is this liable to start learning. I really want to but have no idea what will be there and I have no experience in that type of enviornment. And the pay at my current part time job is hard to get away from. I currently make 16$ a hour at my current part time job. So what is typically offered for this internship and is it a sound job? I would need this job to last a long time because my current job is fine in terms of me thinking I’ll be jobless

(3.2) i’ve been applying to a ton of jobs recently and hearing nothing but rejection or companies that are interested, but looking for someone to start immediately.  I have an engineering internship at a large EPC, research experience, design experience, and leadership experience. Additionally, my resume was well received by companies I talked to at the career fair and by the company I interned for. 

My peers on the other hand are having a much better time. They’re all going from interview to interview with big companies while I’ve yet to have an interview. Most of them have only sent out a few applications this school year. Their GPAs are higher than mine (3.3-3.4) though I have more extracurriculars. I’m usually the positive one among my friends in the job hunt and they’re all down cause they are only applying to a few places. 

Many of the companies I talked to at the career fair are not actively hiring(???? Why come???) i did seem to leave a positive impression on a few companies though.

Currently on course for a 2:2 (about a 3.0 GPA I think) after a poor second year where my attendance was atrocious (complacency) and I in general had no idea how to effectively study, since then I've worked to rectify my study habits and I'm attending all classes. With the reality settling in that I need to have a strong final year here to get myself a 2:1 (around 3.3+ GPA) I'm struggling with the idea that maybe I am just not smart enough to make it in finance. Stuff like my brain going blank when the professor introduces a formula just makes me feel more and more like I shouldn't even be here. Everyone else in university seems to have their shit together and then there is me with no internship, non-target and struggling just to make a 2:1.

Does anyone else feel like this as a student? I don't feel remotely capable of going out in a year, getting a job as say a credit analyst and being able to perform adequately without serious training."

dih5g3,182,2019-10-15,A Dead Woman Followed Me Home,alyssagalloo,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dih5g3/a_dead_woman_followed_me_home/,"I’m an archaeologist; a childhood dream of becoming Indiana Jones finally realized. It’s my honest to goodness dream job, and After 4 long years of studying and identifying skeletons, and each bone in the human body, I finally did it; I landed my dream job at an estate in Charleston, South Carolina. 

My first few days on the job were as expected. I was shown around the grounds, shuttled from director to director where I had to politely smile and shake hands. I smiled so hard that first day, my mouth was sore for a week. After week 1 of introductions, I was introduced to the most important section of the plantation, the thing that I had waited so long for; The Pit. 

Now, it’s not actually called “The Pit”. This isn’t some 1980s horror movie for young and unexpecting anthropologists. When conducting an archaeological dig, we dig what is commonly referred to as a pit. It’s a large section of earth that becomes uncovered, and is where we’re focusing our archaeological efforts at the moment. This particular site wasn’t of much importance. It was just a spot of land in the middle of what used to be a cotton field. But the owners of the plantation decided they wanted to expand and build with all of the newcomers to the south on plantation tours, and they hired us to make sure nothing “important” happened where they want to build. It’s pretty dismal actually; they take a place with such rich and excruciating history, and make sure nothing historical actually happened there. If it were up to me, every square inch of this plantation had something historical happen to it, but it’s not up to me.

Day after day, I arrived in the morning, gathered my tools, put on my hat, and got to work in the pit. We’re a pretty small team, so for the most part, there’s only one archaeologist working on digging at a time. The others are busy classifying and washing artifacts that were dug up. 

I had just bagged my 57th oyster shell of the day (think coastal south carolina), and I found it. It was a small metal box, with pretty extravagant ornamentation throughout the lid and sides. There was a gold clasp, sealed with an incredibly small and dainty gold lock. After brushing it off, and carefully lifting it from where it lay, and making a note of where I found it, I slipped the box inside of a specimen bag, and really started to take a look at what I had found. 

I know from my studies that certain types of metal have specific life expectancies once buried underground, with the shortest being tin with a life span of about 50 years. However, stronger metals could last easily upwards of 200 or 300 years without showing signs of decomposition. So without testing, I have no idea how old the artifact in my hands is from first glance. However, when I was brushing a bit of dirt off of the lid in my excavation, I did see the initials “L.F.” stamped into the lid of the box. 

Naturally, I took the box back to examine. This is probably the best part of the job. With risk of sounding like a nerd, there is absolutely nothing better than finding an artifact where you have absolutely no idea what it is. It involves research, local lore, and first hand witnesses until you’re able to find out what you’re dealing with, if you even find out at all. I still have artifacts from my previous internships that haunt me because to this day I don’t know what they were. 

With gloves, lights, and a climate controlled lab, our team took the box out of the bag, and started to wash it. It’s really amazing what a toothbrush and some water can do, this box was sparkling in the artificial sunlight within minutes once we polished it up and removed the years of dirt. We ascertained that the box was made of aluminium, which didn’t do much to help us figure out how long it had been buried; aluminium has a life span of roughly 500 years without decomposition. 

What really helped us make a break in the mystery though, were the engravings on the outside of the box. The L.F. that I saw on the outside, actually was “L. Fisher” written in very fancy cursive on the lid of the box. We figured that we had to see was inside of the box in order to efficiently do our jobs, so after proper documentation; that’s what we did. Carefully, we removed the lock and opened the box, and I for one was confused by what I saw. Inside, were shattered fragments of bone.

Now, this is what archaeologists are made for. I’ve never seen a group of people move so quickly to remove these pieces and lay them out on a clean table. And it turns out that not only were the bones human, but each fragment came together to form a complete human skull. The skull was male, and beyond that, we’re not too sure who he was or how old he was when he died. 

We all went home with visions of historical explorations filling our heads, as we struggled to figure out who L. Fisher was, and who the man in the box was. 

I didn’t have to remove myself very far from the site to notice that something was off. I had been seeing a dark black splotch on the corner of my peripheral vision, but I figured I was just staring too intently at a bright white light. But even as I moved into the golden light of the retreating sun, I still had this splotch in the corner that wouldn’t go away. 

Each time I would move my eyes from left to right, the splotch would follow, but it’s almost as if it couldn’t keep up with me. I’d move my eyes from left to right, and the patch of darkness would almost hover in my vision for a minute before darting back to the side where it belonged. And this wasn’t just one eye, this was both of my eyes, it was like there was something lurking just out of sight. 

I didn’t put much stock in it, and went home with my dark splotch accompanying me. I got home, made dinner and took a shower settling in for bed, when I noticed it. There was a human figure staring at me from the dark corner of my room. I ran to turn the lights on, but of course, there was nothing there. I backed up toward the lightswitch, keeping my eyes on the dark corner, and flipped the switch so I was in darkness again. Nothing was in the corner. But that’s when I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Someone whispered in my right ear “Hello Sweetie”, dragged their fingertips from my right ear, across my shoulders and down my left arm. A piece of my hair was tucked behind my left ear, and I screamed so loud my neighbors had to come check on me. 

I told them it was nothing; I told myself it was nothing. I had a long day, and an overactive imagination. I got back into bed, shut the lights, and shut my eyes even tighter. If I didn’t see anything, they couldn’t see me back. 

I was on the verge of sleep, in the sweet spot where you’re vaguely aware that the world around you exists before drifting into dreamland, when I saw it. A blonde woman, with her hair tied up on top of her head, in an old purple dress, dancing through my bedroom. She wasn’t just gliding as if without feet, she was dancing. She was completing thorough dance moves complete with twirls, curtseys and she held her arms out as if holding a partner in her arms. She danced for a couple of minutes while I sat incredulous on my bed. 

She promptly finished her dance, and her gaze followed something to the floor, and she lifted her left leg, and stomped it on the ground with such violence that I thought for sure one of my neighbors downstairs would be back. But she didn’t make a sound. She stomped as hard as she could, straightened her dress, and slowly lifted her head to make direct eye contact with me. She immediately disappeared, and all I heard was her whisper reverberating through my head “you’re next sweetie”. 

I don’t know who this woman is or what she wants with me, but I know she’s not the man in the box. She has to be connected to him somehow though. I have every single light in my apartment turned on, and I think it’s important to write down each encounter so that I don’t miss a thing. There could be a pattern here that I could easily miss. This mystery woman must be somehow connected to the man, or the box itself. It’s no coincidence that the day we accidentally disturb a final resting place, is the day I take home a ghost from work."
dih5mz,3,2019-10-15,"Crashed and burned in a post-bac semester, need help picking up the pieces",horridmistake,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dih5mz/crashed_and_burned_in_a_postbac_semester_need/,"TL;DR: I'm a Chemical Engineering degree holder with over 50k in student debt. I have to do a semester withdrawal after failing to adapt well to working full-time during a post-bac degree program. No option continuing to pursue CS seems fiscally responsible at this point but I do not see myself as an employable chemical engineer either. Is betting on myself by enrolling in a bootcamp (that doesn't charge until I get a job) really a much worse idea than taking CS classes at a snail's pace until I qualify to be an intern?

I'll skip explaining why being a chemical engineer didn't work out but after 1.5 years, I don't feel i know enough to remotely succeed at finding a job in that field.

I started working part time while in my degree program, taking a hit on income/debt hoping to start doing paid internships/co-ops after Data Structures and Algorithms (Spring 2020). The first semester was a breeze so my family/friends pressured me into taking a full-time job in a research lab I reluctantly agreed because I wanted health insurance. Bad move. 

I prioritized my lab work because they relied on me doing my job to do theirs, fell into depression when I couldn't balance everything, and am now looking at a semester drop which means no financial aid next semester, which means I can't afford to quit this job but also can't afford to retake both courses next semester with this pay, pushing DS&amp;A to Fall 2020. 

I've thought about my options and the only ones that make sense are:

1. Medically withdrawal to get money back and improve mental health. Take a short time off to prepare for a bootcamp (maybe app academy or hack reactor), save for NYC rent, and try to actually build something with my time. Bet on myself big next Summer and hope to start working ASAP even at an exorbitant short-term cost. Assuming I make close to the salary they advertise, 60,000 after their cut is still more than twice what I make currently. 
2. Follow my original plan but pay for only one course per semester until I qualify for internships. This leaves little time to do any personal projects and also I'm taking a ""loss"" on potential earned income. 
3. The same as the second except I take next semester off to try to build something and maybe do some CS research to build my resume.
4. The same as the second but apply to masters programs once I'm qualified so I can get financial aid and put my full attention into my degree. 

The last three sound lovely but I'm 25 and am 50-60k in debt already. If I were guaranteed the ""average"" App Academy job I wouldn't care if they took HALF my first year's salary. I want to work hard and I want to pay my debts as soon as possible but I am trapped by my poor choices and am not seeing a light. I am having suicidal thoughts, and while I'd like to get help with that, it turns out this full time job is OPS and doesn't have health benefits after all. Any advice?"

dihlyg,2,2019-10-15,Rambling,Snipe3down,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dihlyg/rambling/,"Alright so this is gonna be a bit long. So first I am a graphic design artist just recently graduated, and one of my first aspiring goals is to become and art director and go from there. Right, so back in May right after graduation I didn't wait around to look for a job, I was hunting online, going to offices and asking around, even my former teacher tried helping but nothing and I got super depressed, and anxious cause I just spent a few years and money and I'm starting to second guess my self. Now at the time and at the end of that semester is when I met my true set if friends, like I mean true friends and they've always been there to support me. And at the same time I was chasing after a girl and over that summer even though I was down, when I was around her I pretended my problems did not exist. At the end of the summer though a company I talked to said they would take me on as an intern and instantly I took it, it was one and only shot and a for sure ticket ya know. When I started my boss asked about my goals and I told her. The day I started she came to me and said ""we usually have two designers at a time, but since the other dropped I will not only train you as a graphic artist, but to be an director as well, and when the internship is done I will put in a referral for you to be a director."" And ever since she have truely been the best, but in the first two weeks I got an offer out of state, and ice always wanted to work out of state because where I live now isn't exactly the best for graphic design. Now the girl I mentioned before we were close to dating but when I told her my goals, she flipped and it turned to an argument, and we parted was, I won't talk about what was said because it no longer has relevance. Now we get to the part where I need help. So the same night, a friend of mine comforts me over what just happen, and I've known her for a while now, but never seen her other than a friend. And since then we've hung out like every day and talk all the time, and when we talk there's this energy and it's never negative. So for a while I just focused on my self, but a few weeks ago we were talking and she brought up the words "" her boyfriend"" and before that moment I never seen her other than a friend, but when she said that I got mad, because how she said he treated her and just uses her. We talked and got past it and things were normal, until Sunday. We talked again Sunday but this time, I couldn't keep my feelings inside, and neither could she. She didn't exactly say she likes me, but I think that is part in her being in a relationship, but we said all these things about each other, like how we are our true selves with each other, and how we want to spend more time together. And since it's been very different, and now it's good morning, goodnight, how's your day, what are you doing ect. And we went out last night and it's was soooo different we couldn't stop looking at each other, smiling talking or anything, but there was a moment and maybe I'm reading too much into this, but she ""compared"" hand sizes and hesitated like she wanted to hold hand or more, but she pulled away as if forcing herself. Now I'm stuck and don't know what to do."

dij4yq,4,2019-10-15,Got an Interview (Tech. Support Analyst)! Looking for Advice,forerunner23,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dij4yq/got_an_interview_tech_support_analyst_looking_for/,"Hey guys! Some short background: I currently work at and attend (IT Major) \[higher education institution\] in the IT department as a student assistant, and we have a person transferring to another team in the department. I applied for the full time position, got an interview, and that's next Tues. I'm looking for any advice/tips you guys might have, especially when it comes to salary negotiation. I've heard from some coworkers that recent hires they've been trying to somewhat lowball (not by insane amounts, but yano).

&amp;#x200B;

I have background in IT (couple internships, work experience, homelab, some competitions in blue team) and feel I'm already a pretty good fit for the position, since I know our systems and know how we do things here. I did find out today from my boss that there were 10 applicants, 4 got interviews and someone pulled out, so it's me and two others. One piece of advice I got from a coworker seemed like a good mindset to be in: show up like you've already got the job; the interview is you keeping the job. I think for interviews, that instills a lot of confidence and makes sense IMO, but I'm curious what you guys think and if you have any other advice."

dijzae,7,2019-10-16,Drop out of college to learn CyberSecurity my own?,NewbieCasanova,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/dijzae/drop_out_of_college_to_learn_cybersecurity_my_own/,"I realized that college is such a waste of time and money. I took 4 courses related to my major and didn't learn a lot due to my computer history. I completely suck at math, that's holding me behind because it's a required course.

I've had this thought for quite some time. That's dropping out of college to self-teach or attend primarily Cyber security classes instead of spending 3 more years in college... Many redditors claim that a degree is not required for this field, but will definitely give you a boost especially if you have internship experience.

One reason I want to attend college is to build connections. But not sure if these connection are really beneficial.

&amp;#x200B;

Should this route be avoided?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

Thank you guys for all the comments. It's really eye opening to see perspectives from many different people experienced and inexperienced"
dik27e,4,2019-10-16,No luck with internship or CO-OPs.. 3.5 Gpa Senior ME student..,ChaimaaM,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/dik27e/no_luck_with_internship_or_coops_35_gpa_senior_me/,"So I transitioned into engineering my sophomore year and I had a rough start with a 2.61 GPA and made it to senior year with a 3.51. I have an extra semester in the fall which gives me room for an internship this summer. 

I apply to internships and CO-OPs when I have free time and i rarely hear back for interviews. I had one interview two weeks ago. Last year I only had two interviews. I feel like I need to graduate with industry experience, otherwise it will be hard to find a job. 

My only work experience on my resume is research over the summer, and being a teaching assistant for an introductory engineering course during my junior year. I’m also a research assistant right now for another project and I’m an engineering tutor for two courses. So, I’m pretty involved during my academic year. 

I’m just confused.. everyone seems to be getting internships easily."

GPA: 3.4UW/4.1W - easily the worst aspect of my application. I don't have any excuse for it being low, I was just lazy mostly during my sophomore year and got two Cs, one in each semester. I take pretty much only AP and Honors classes though, with even a few CAPP and PLTW courses.

&amp;#x200B;

Been a business major for 2 years, doing well with a 3.7 GPA. However, after doing research into the job market, I was really demotivated by a lot of the salaries, specifically for marketing.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been interested in programming, and I finally started learning Python. Since then I've been obsessed and have been spending all my free time learning and creating new things. I decided I want to make this my career.

I wanna switch majors to CS to be more appealing in the job market, but this would mean I'd be in university for an extra whole year. I've considered just minoring in CS, but I'm not sure that I could still be qualified enough for an internship with a big company.

&amp;#x200B;

My end goals are to make 120k+ a year as a developer working for a big company, and eventually I'd like to be an upper-level manager and potentially pivot to a CTO at a startup. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth switching majors now to be able to get into a big company? Or do I still have an almost equal chance as a business major with a CS minor?"

I have a 4.0 W and 3.7 UW with a mid 1300s SAT (should be raised to at least a 1420 soon). I have some great ECs including a TON of volunteering every summer to help foreign kids learn english, as well as being captain of my HS basketball team, student council president, and a summer (non paid) internship at a publishing company- worked on their online book store (coding and stuff). 

My dilemma is that I don’t really know what to study. I know i want to make a lot of money as soon as I graduate to help my single mom and my younger sibling, but i don’t know exactly what to study. After my internship, I thought that I would enjoy Computer Science or even Computer Engineering but now i’m leaning more towards Bioengineering or Biomedical engineering. 

I’m not a hardcore math guy (calculus rn is pretty challenging). I feel pretty well rounded in all subjects due to the way I was raised up and brought up in school. I know CS involves some math but what engineering majors involve the least amount of math (or the easiest math)?
What should I put on my applications regarding my intended major? Is anyone else in the same boat as I am? Are there other majors i’m not even thinking about right now? What did you major in and how did you decide?

I'm currently a junior and was a SWE intern at a Big5 tech company last summer (think Google, Facebook). This is my last internship summer before going to full time. I have SWE offers at Big5 companies and smaller/startup tech companies. I also have a PM offer from another smaller tech company (5k employees) who seems to be doing pretty well. All offers are pretty competitive, based in Bay Area.

Note: the internship is actually project management rather than product management. I think I want to do more product management, but also unsure. The company said they would be willing to let me do some product related stuff.

I'm not sure if I should try the PM internship or return to SWE (at either a Big5 company or the smaller company). I've always had some interest in PM, but am not completely sure if I want to pursue that path fulltime. 

Some of my concerns are:   
\- wasted my time not developing my software engineering skills if I end up not enjoying the PM internship.  
\- less prestige than doing SWE at a Big5 company?  
\- not having a secure fulltime SWE offer (would likely have this if I go to Big5 company as SWE)   
\- not having a chance to try SWE at a startup company 

Has anyone gone through something similar or have thoughts that could help me decide? Much appreciated."

dioku2,211,2019-10-16,Finally got a Summer Analyst job in a top U.S. Bulge Bracket. Some thoughts.,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/dioku2/finally_got_a_summer_analyst_job_in_a_top_us/,"Hi everyone, casual lurker here who's managed to secure a summer internship for 2020 in a US BB. This is my second year applying (I took an offer to intern outside of IB this summer but in investments) and I've finally got the offer. This is just going to be a very brief write up on my current thoughts, feelings and what I feel made the biggest difference in the quality of my applications over the past year.

&amp;#x200B;

Feelings and Thoughts:

&amp;#x200B;

Anxiously waiting for the offer call, I kept dreaming of how good life would be if i got the offer. Its actually insane to think about retrospectively. I would have no pressure, be able to live my final year of university to the fullest etc. Once I received the call from the MD who congratulated me, I was absolutely elated for LITERALLY about half a second before it dawned on me that nothing had changed. I called my mom and told her and she started crying. She felt far more emotion than I did and this was the equivalent of a 'dream' for me. I almost questioned why I WASN'T crying tears of joy. I tried to get myself hyped. I thought about me and my friends all in the city interning and getting smashed, the adrenaline pumping pressure of a client deadline, the camaraderie of working with your colleagues past midnight. It all felt so dry and boring. I quickly realised that I had put investment banking on a pedestal and (although I probably will enjoy it when I do it and meet tons of new people), the offer did not make me substantively happier.

&amp;#x200B;

I was at a networking event for the bank I got the internship for last night, as I was asked to come. That was an extremely insightful evening for me because I could truly see how desperate everyone else looked as they corralled the MDs for fast tracks that almost certainly weren't happening. I realised how much I glorified getting an internship, and how much these freshmen/sophomore did too. Only after getting an offer did I realise that it is almost certainly not what I want to do in the long-run. I wish I had made the realisation earlier considering how hard I had to grind for techs and making cover letters etc. Cest la vie.

  
What made the biggest differences in my applications:

1.) Making specific, tailored cover letters for each application. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can go on their annual report, the website for culture examples, proxy cards etc. My interview rate really skyrocketed when I did tailor CLs and Application questions. They should ofc follow the same structure of (brief intro, why ib, why firm specifically and lastly, why me).

&amp;#x200B;

2.) I treated each interview as 'Practice for Blackstone'. 

  
This really helped to calm my nerves and make sure I could answer extremely competently on the Fit questions. I feel i am quite an 'interesting' person and half the game is getting them to like you

&amp;#x200B;

3.) I don't go to the best school, so I try to stand out through my extracurriculars.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not super incredible at a single sport, or a visionary in something else. I do have a lot of hobbies (like singing open mics, sports, charity work etc) which cumulatively, add up to being 'incredible' at a single sport. I marketed the fuck out this 'alternative perspective' in my interviews and it worked well. I found common ground and made sure to be funny, outgoing etc. The thing is, it should be natural. You aren't born an extrovert - you can become one by putting yourself in more social situations etc.

&amp;#x200B;

4.) Technical Questions are VERY important, and you should have a STRONG conceptual understanding. I stopped memorising answers.

&amp;#x200B;

Resources I used were a pirated copy of Wall Street Training, M&amp;I and Youtube videos. Last year I knew how to calculated ULFCF (Nopat + D&amp;A - Capex - Change in Working Capital) for example, but my understanding of WHY we treated working capital as such as beyond me. I just spent 5 minutes or so more learning why and dug deeper into the accrual accounting etc and now I can answer it competently without going back to memorise answers for interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

5.) Become a confident, competent and easy going guy/girl.

THe intangible benefits of this on your performance in interviews and more importantly, everyday life is incredible. I have met genuine life long friends through networking events whilst others circle the employees. Chill, its uni :))

&amp;#x200B;

And there you go. Happy to answer any questions or PMs within reason."
dipb1m,55,2019-10-16,How do I professionally warn one of our interns that her attitude may cost her future employment?,frankmusings,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dipb1m/how_do_i_professionally_warn_one_of_our_interns/,"One of my duties at work is to supervise a group of paid interns under a specific department. I do not deal with their hiring process directly, but they’re supposed to report to me on a daily basis. 

This is the first time I’ve had a bit of an issue with one of our new interns. We’ll call her Dora. At first, she came across as highly-motivated, reliable, and proactive. She helped come up with solutions to daily problems in her area. I praised HR for finding her. However, in the last month, we have received complaints from other interns that she is hard to cooperate with. 

Upon investigating, it seems that Dora had appointed herself as the “lead intern” after she trained a few of our new hires. She started micromanaging the work given to them as a group, and assigning specific tasks to herself and therefore the remaining dull tasks to the rest of the group. 

I can see Dora intended to be proactive, but she does not have the authorization to demand her fellow interns to complete the work she did not want to do on her scheduled days. 

I met with her recently to ask her for feedback, and to listen to her first before assuming she was trying to hoard certain duties. She told me directly she found the duties given to be “pointless,” and that she “would prefer not to do them, since someone else could.” She also mentioned how she would leave “to-do lists” on some of the interns’ workstations telling them exactly where to pick up work she left off the prior day. This explained why some of the other interns would visit my office confused, thinking *I* had been leaving those notes.

I tried to explain to her that it’s not about someone else being able to do it, but being equitable to all interns, and having everyone participate based on their schedules.  If she was not to participate, our schedule would be affected. She still reiterated she wanted someone else to do her other duties. 

Then, she went above me to speak to my boss about her responsibilities being modified. This is where she messed up. I was trying to solve the situation internally, and now my boss is aware and has asked me to be more strict with the interns. He also said she will be let go by the end of the year if she keeps her confrontational attitude. 

So now I have to meet with her again, and warn her. I don’t want to say “you may be let go” and crush her motivation. She would be a great employee, but I believe she just needs to work on her attitude. I’m hoping to come up with a way to motivate her to be more cooperative and also make sure she knows if things don’t change soon, she will not be referred.

(For context, most of our prior interns have been a joy to work with and are referred to work in their area of interest)

Any advice?"

diqcc4,71,2019-10-16,In the 1970’s the observatory in my town was abruptly closed by the FBI,MatgamarraAlt3,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/diqcc4/in_the_1970s_the_observatory_in_my_town_was/,"When I was a kid me and my family lived in a very isolated small town called Jeremy’s Coffin, in the innards of Pennsylvania. You won’t find it in Google Maps or in any map at all. The city’s name has changed some fifteen years ago, and sincerely, I’d rather die than going back there. Sadly, I think I’ll have to. I write this not as a testament, but more as a confession of my past sins, which all came back to doom me and my family. I just hope we survive the deadly and feasible implications of my negligence.

My name is Abraham Sehen, and I was born in the aforementioned town of Jeremy’s Coffin in the year of 1953. My father, Isaac Sehen, was a astronomy teacher, and he worked in the local observatory, which was the sole reason for the existence of our small city. My mother, Sasha Sehen, was a housewife, but she was graduated on finances. She just didn’t like to work, I think. 

Jeremy’s Coffin is a strange name for a city, but it made sense on the context. Jeremy Sailor-Head was a nineteenth century famous engineer who had an enormous estate there, before the city was built. He had a special passion for the stars, and created an enormous particular observatory inside his property. Also had an entire forest, a lake, tons of buildings, and a personal library. Sadly, Jeremy never had any children, and died when he fell from the observatory’s spiral stairs at age thirty-six. Because nobody legally owned the lot when it happened, his former employees literally settled around the place, and quickly a small city grew along Jeremy’s Coffin. All buildings were invaded by the new residents, all of them but the observatory, which remained closed for years.

In 1922, the city of Jeremy’s Coffin was formally created, and the observatory was nationalized and re-opened by the new mayor in the following year. It wasn’t by any means the best or the most advanced observatory even in Pennsylvania, but it was important for the inhabitants because of it’s historical and cultural value, and a few tourists even came to visit it every now and then. 

In 1946, my father was employed as one of the lead scientists of the observatory. I don’t know in which projects he worked exactly or what they researched there, he never told me. I only know that almost every month the local school made a field trip there and he gave lessons on astronomy. As a child I had some of those lessons, and I remember how excited I got knowing that my father was the almighty scientist teaching us all those amazing factoids about the sky. 

Well, Jeremy’s Coffin wasn’t exactly a big city. In fact, we had only about 20.000 citizens by the sixties, and only my father and three other scientists and one janitor worked in the observatory. And as every small town, we had our fair share of eerie stories. I know it seems off-topic, but you’ll need to know all context before I delve into my personal story. 

In my youth, I had a bit of interest on the paranormal. Not only me, but my friends as well. On the vacations, we would meet in my friend Carl’s ranch next to the city’s lake and tell ghost stories. 
Obviously, most of our stories were made up, but sometimes our parents would join us and tell their stories too. And holy shit, their stories were really scary. Probably false, but scary. We were just kids trying to create horror tales, they were grown ups that had been through a lot and knew how to scare. 

I must had been around ten or eleven years old when this happened. After I got so freaked out by a story told by my friend Lala’s mother that I peed on my bed, I decided that I’d learn how to scare too. Look, I’ve never had been a huge fan of reading before this event, but I’ve had been to the old library a couple of times because I needed to research for my homeworks, and I remembered that there was a session on the library that I’d never go. The “Dark Zone”. Jeremy Sailor-Head had interest in occultism, parapsychology, and bizarreness in general. His books were still there, even more than fifty years later, and nobody dared to rent something from there. At least not openly. 

I entered the library and went there. The session was as dusty and dirty as it was empty. I doubted if they had ever cleaned it since Jeremy died. Ironically, I became addicted to the old creepy books. Maleus Malefikarum, the Goetia, the Codex Gigas, there were copies of several pieces of bizarre literature there. Soon my afternoons turned to researching forbidden knowledge and learning some Latin. Carl Joffrey, my friend who belonged to the family who owned the ranch, soon joined me in my explorations, and we kept reading there every day for a few months.

Until we decided to try a ritual by ourselves. We were both twelve, and after one year or too secretly learning occultism, we thought we were already expert magicians. Oh, how dumb we were. We decided to talk to Jeremy Sailor-Head. 

It was a saturday evening, and the place wouldn’t open on weekends at the time. We secretly entered the observatory using a key I had stolen from my father, turned on the lights and went up to the place where the founder had accidentally fallen from the stairs, and prepared ourselves with some purification rituals and prayers. Soon we were ready.

We carefully put the Ouija board we brought on one of the steps and began the whole thing. I don’t remember exactly how it happened, it was a very long time ago, but I remember that after some good fifteen minutes without answers, we were greeted by an entity that called itself “The Gravedigger”. 

“Hello. I’m The Graveddiger. I’ll answer three questions peacefully. If you want another one, I’ll take something in return.”

Obviously that scared the shit out of us. I even suspected that Carl was messing with me, but he seemed quite scared too. We exchanged looks, and “decided” with a nod that he’d make the first question.

“Are you a spirit, a ghost?” He asked, trembling.

“NO.”

“Are you Jeremy Sailor-Head?” Carl questioned.

“NO.” We were about to make another question, but we saw the thing moving toward the words by itself. Also, I remember in this exact moment the lights started flickering. “But he died because of me.”

I thought of getting up and running away, but I was too scared to do anything. Carl’s voice was stammering, but somehow he had the guts to ask his final question: “Why did you murder him?”

“I didn’t. He killed himself.” 

“You convinced him to kill himself?” Carl realized he had made a fourth question and his face became completely pale. “I am... I’m so sorry Abe...” He muttered to me. The air got very, very cold, and the lights turned off completely. Except one. The shining moonlight that came from the huge telescope on the upper end of the stairs. I stood still, paralyzed by the fear, as he climbed up the stairs without saying anything and looked through the telescope. That was the loudest scream I have ever heard. Carl climbed down the stair running as if evil itself was behind him, and even with my screams trying to calm him down and with no light at all, he continued. He stumbled on the Ouija board and... Well, you guess it, he... He fell down from eleven and a half feet and hit his head very hard on the floor. Immediately after the accident, the lights turned on, and I carefully climbed down the stairs and went to where he landed. The Ouija board was right to his side, and a small amount of blood had covered the “YES”. Obviously Carl wasn’t well, and I’m not in any way trying to justify what I did. But please know that I was just a child that thought I could play with something FAR beyond my comprehension. I thought that if I stayed there or tried to help my dad would forbid me of going to the library or talking to Carl or even going to the observatory again. I didn’t know what to do, so I ran away as fast as I could, locked myself in my room and hid under the bed’s blankets.

I only woke up at noon on the following day. My parents asked me about Carl, and I had to lie that I didn’t know where he was. Turns out he never went home, and his parents were knocking on all his friends’ doors searching for him or information.

Guilt corroded me, but I managed to hide what I had done the previous day. I stayed most of that Sunday in my room, praying for him to be well.

Carl was found when my father and his co-workers entered the observatory on Monday’s morning. Still alive, but unconscious, and with several exposed fractures, including one in his spine. He was taken to a hospital in Philadelphia and was kept there for months. He never walked again. I was scared he was angry at me and didn’t want to see him, but my mother took me anyways on Wednesday. 

My friend was completely covered in plaster, could only move his head and left arm, and had a very visible scar that commenced on his forehead and went down to his chin, passing through a eye (Which also was “removed” in the accident.) But if that wasn’t enough, his brain suffered an extremely serious trauma, that almost completely incapacitated his ability to talk. He couldn’t formulate full sentences anymore.

“I’m so sorry, Carl.” I muttered to him when my parents went to grab a coffee with theirs a few minutes after I entered the room. He grabbed my arm firmly, and with tears falling from his only eyes, he whispered: 

“Kill.” He pointed at himself. I looked him in the eye. Despair. Fear. Bleakness. Pure horror. I could only see those emotions on his eyes. That single look scared me more than everything that happened before. Carl didn’t want to die because of his new condition. Or because he feared the “Gravedigger”.

What he saw on that telescope scared him forever, so much that dying was the only way of fleeing from whatever he’d seen.

I didn’t kill him. I tried to tell him that all would be ok. But I knew it wouldn’t. I never saw Carl again after that. The next Friday he finally got able to use his other arm again, and he grabbed a pen and plucked his remaining eye out, before he penetrated his forehead with it so hard that they only removed it with surgery. The doctors saved him, but Carl basically gave himself anencephaly. He died two or three years later when a rat decided to live in his innards and ate his functional organs.

This occurrence made me immediately lose all interest I had in the occult. In fact, I grabbed all my magic diaries, Ouija boards, amulets and things related to occultism and buried it all in a box on my backyard. I started consulting myself with a psychologist and acquired a severe fobia of the observatory. Even talking about it sent chills down my spine. Needless to say my relationship with my father was severely affected. He always talked about astronomy. Seeing him reminded me of the observatory.


Several years later me and my therapist started an specific treatment to eliminate my fear from the observatory, which got so critical that even looking to the sky was making me cry in fear. I began to confront my fears by studying astronomy. I ended up becoming a man of science, and going every time I could to the observatory with my dad and looking at the stars with the telescope. 

My memories of Carl, occultism, The Gravedigger, and the stars were repressed, and I somehow ended up forgetting everything. Carl was a childhood suicidal friend who went to the observatory to kill himself. I once had an interest on magic or something, but magic didn’t exist. The only thing that I believed now was science. And I didn’t even know what a Ouija board was anymore.

At age seventeen I went to study astronomy in New York, and a few years later, was officially an astronomer. My father easily arranged for me to have an internship in Jeremy’s Coffin, and of course, I went there to work with him. The observatory was no longer in any way a spooky place, but a house of cosmic contemplation and science. We even frequently joked about the two tragedies that unfolded there. We jokingly called the spiral stairs “THE SPIRAL STAIRS OF DOOM”.

One or two years after I was officially hired as a member of the observatory, the janitor succumbed to old age (He was at least 70 years old) and we began doing the cleanup ourselves ‘cause we were affording to buy some new equipments or something, I don’t remember very well. 

What I do remember are the events that happened on the twelfth of august of 1977. It was 6 PM, our work shift was done, and me and my father were turning the equipments off and preparing to leave, when two of the other scientists, Spencer Collins and Victor Gustafson, decided they’d turn on the huge television we had on the main room and eat some barbecue. It wasn’t atypical of them. Victor and Spencer did that every weekend. They invited us, and my father agreed to join them, but I got charged with cleaning everything that day because one of the other scientists was traveling to Italy, and was too tired. I ended up going home. 

Two or three hours later my father called home. My mother picked up the phone and gave it to me. Dad told me to get some beer for them on the nearby supermarket because they had found a fun red board they were playing with or something. I didn’t correlate the things at first. I wish I had. I wish I had told them to stop playing and leave the fucking place immediately. But my memories of what happened were buried for nearly ten years. It all happened in less than fifteen minutes. I went to the nearby supermarket, bought two packs of beer, walked to the observatory, and entered.

I was greeted by a vision of Spencer and my dad trying to immobilize Gustafson. The poor man was trying to stab his own eyes with the steak knife they used on the barbecue. In front of the TV lied the Ouija board. And then all memories that I had carefully repressed for so long came back to my mind.

“Please, let me die! Please! I don’t want to see it anymore!” He screamed in horror. 

“Abraham, come here, help us!” My father screamed, clearly struggling to hold his colleague. It was a weird sight. Victor Gustafson was always very skinny, short and at that moment was barely 60 kg, while my father and Spencer were both a bit fat and significantly taller than him. Yet, he was clearly about to outmatch them. I dropped the beers and went to help them.

“Did he use the telescope?” I asked, shivering and hurrying to where they were. My father simply nodded, still not fully comprehending what was happening. Whatever had killed Carl years ago and Jeremy decades ago was back. Whatever it was, it waited for years, without attracting any attention, and then striked. It waited for the time when I’d have completely forgotten it. Memories came to my mind from all the years I had worked there. The Gravedigger had always been there. All my life. Even my years in New York, he was right at my side, stalking me and observing. That day, so many years ago, I was supposed to die. But I fled. 

“Calm down Victor!” I shouted, as I joined efforts with my father and my colleague. I looked into his eyes. The same look that I saw on Carl’s eyes that tormented me for so long was there. He had seen The Gravedigger in all it’s dreadful glory. Like Jeremy Sailor-Head. Like Carl Joffrey. This terrified me so much that I for a moment hesitated, and Gustafson freed himself, severing his hand in a brutal move and kicking me and my father away, before cutting his stomach and letting his bowels fall to the floor in a gory mess.

“Oh my God, Abraham, call an ambulance, please!” My father screamed, as he removed his own coat and tried to use it to stop Spencer’s bleeding. I ran to the observatory’s telephone and immediately called the emergency services.

“911, what emergency services you require?” 

“I need an ambulance! There are two people very wounded in the observatory!”

“Calm down, Sir. Where are you right now? Was physical violence invol-“ All lights on the building turned off, and the phone did it as well. 
“It’s all your fucking fault, Abraham... We talked with Carl. You knew about The Gravedigger. You always knew...” Spencer muttered even tough he was clearly losing his consciousness.

“Shut up, Collins! Blame yourself for playing with ghosts like it was nothing!” Dad said. I saw he was having a hard time breathing. The kicks had probably fractured one or two ribs.

“Dad... Did you look through the telescope?” I asked. 

“No, I didn’t. Neither did Collins. Just Gustafson here did.” 

“Ok. Please, do not look through it. Help Spencer, I’ll call for help.” I asked and left, running to ask for help on the town. A few minutes later I was back in the observatory with two police officers, an ambulance and two or three helping peasants. I don’t remember exactly where I went for help, I was so worried that I couldn’t even think right about it. But when I got back, my dad was pale. Even more than before. The police was already talking to him, so I couldn’t say anything, but I was able to exchange looks with his eyes before he entered with Spencer in the ambulance. Why. Why the fuck did he look through the telescope while I went to ask for help? 

I tried to go to the hospital where they were being taken, but the police handcuffed me and brought me to testify on the police station. I was covered in blood and was the only one who wasn’t hurt after all. I spent several hours answering questions there, when the news arrived. Dad had cut his throat with a broken piece of the mirror in the hospital room. When I arrived in the hospital, he was already dead. 

What happened next hurt me so much that I don’t want to write much about it. Dad’s suicide had broken my mom, and she ended up having severe psychological problems after it. A few months later, she joined a weird Christian cult and moved to Guyana. Never saw her again after that. 

I never went back to that motherfucking observatory, neither did Spencer Collins, who in fact, I’ve never heard of again since he left the hospital. The scientist who was traveling, Frederick Puller, kind of became the only astronomer working there when he came back. He tried to contact me to come back or even hire new people from outside the town, but he wasn’t successful, and ended up working alone there. Nobody wanted to work in that dreadful place.

And soon nobody was working there. Freddie (how we called him back there) was found hanging two or three months later. I had already moved away to New York, but my mom was still living in Jeremy’s Coffin. She told me that the state had formally closed the observatory after the last death, but the FBI investigated the whole matter and there were always one or two agents standing on the building’s door. Men in black literally roamed the streets for months. And things only got weirder. People started to disappear, and the city acquired such a bad reputation that it’s name had to be changed. And honestly I never cared about the new name.
 
I never forgot what happened, but got over it. I started teaching science to high schoolers, and ended up marrying one of my former university colleagues who had become an professor, Sarah Wershel. We had one kid, Maxwell Wershel Sehen. He’s the reason I’m registering all of this. Once again, when I had almost forgotten about him, The Gravedigger striked where I was most vulnerable. 

Throughout Maxwell’s early childhood, I was still not fully over what happened. In fact, I’ve never been. I had a drinking habit that I finally got over a few years ago. I never got violent with him or my wife, but I could be quite sincere sometimes, and even if I can’t fully remember it, sometimes I’d let the secrets of Jeremy’s Coffin slip through my lips. Maxwell soon knew about the Gravedigger, and all deaths that surrounded my former life. Sarah, as you can imagine, wasn’t amused by my chit chatting about those events with a child.

With her help I battled and defeated my alcohol addiction, but the damage was already done. Maxwell grew up knowing that something weird happened back there, but not knowing what exactly or what was The Gravedigger. And I can’t blame him. I still don’t know what the Gravedigger is or what he wants. As my wife ordered, I never talked with him openly about those occurrences. I did wrong.
By not talking about how despairing my hometown events were to me, I allowed him to go and try to discover them by himself. Maxwell, together with a few friends from his university, decided to get a camera and go there urban exploring. I tried to stop them from doing it, but they were already too curious and calling me paranoid. I’m on a bus that’s headed to Jeremy’s Coffin right now. Or what’s left of it. The city looks like a fucking ghost town and most of it is now old and decaying. I don’t know if I’ll be able to save Maxwell and his friends, and I doubt I can arrive in the observatory before them. They left at least one hour and a half before I got into the bus. 

I don’t know if I will survive. But please, like suicide and drug addiction, these kind of paranormal things must be discussed. Forgetting the past or ignoring it allows it to happen again. I’ve committed this error twice. This is the main reason I wrote all of this. If it happens with you or in your family, don’t bury the memory. Talk about it, even if it hurts. There’s no way it’ll surprise you if you do it."
diqlud,113,2019-10-16,There's A Reason Why Greek Fire Was Lost To Time,StoryStar,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/diqlud/theres_a_reason_why_greek_fire_was_lost_to_time/,"You know, at least with most traumatic things in your past you
get the comfort knowing that they’re over and done. I don’t even get that small
luxury. I get to know full and well that fire is still burning just as hard as
it did 32 years ago. The heat is just as brutal, the smog is still thick as a
forest, and its victims are screaming louder than ever. Having that kind of
knowledge has tortured me every day, and the deafening silence of this cool
autumn night has made it unbearable. I know I’m probably writing my death
sentence here, but I need to get this out. I can’t let that day just be kept
under wraps forever. 

Even though dad wouldn’t ever give me the exact details of
what he did, I knew he worked for some kind of weaponry company and made a lot
of money from whatever he did. So, it was a no-brainer to take up a summer
internship when Dad said he could hook me up with one. It paid much more than
anything else a college kid could get, and the work seemed to be easy. All I
had to do was write down whatever happened, helped the scientists with whatever
they needed, and keep my mouth shut about whatever I saw.

They’ve probably gone through a hundred different names by
now, but they were called Ratavia Incorporation when I worked for them. The
thing about Ratavia was, in a legal sense, they didn’t exactly…exist. Multiple government
and large corporations paid Ratavia under the table for their more… extreme inventions
of protecting national security. Whether it be speakers that could break the
bones of interrogatees with just the power of its bass, advanced systems to
identify protestors from miles away, or a chemical gas that could turn the most
courageous of soldiers into sobbing messes, if you wanted something made to
take out someone you didn’t like all that much, chances are Ratavia already had
it perfected. 

All the things I know about could make a book all on their
own, but there’s one in particular I wanted to talk about. The one that doomed
their California base. The one that doomed me. 

The Greek Fire Project. 

You’ve all probably heard about Greek Fire in your
history classes. It was an incredible invention by the Ancient Greeks that set
enemy ships ablaze. The fire would still burn despite any water to try and
douse it, and those unfortunate to be inflicted by it were at the mercy of its
unrelenting flames. The Greeks knew that they could never let other nations
know how to make it, and so kept it as a deeply-guarded secret. So much so in
fact, as Empires fell and time marched on, no one remembered how to make it.
Even now we still don’t know exactly what went into the original concoction,
and it seemed that it would be lost to history forever. 

That was until Ratavia at least. 

Greek Fire would still be an incredible asset even in our
time, and Ratavia had already tried to recreate it for some time. Apparently,
someone in Sicily found a battered manuscript containing the formula for a key
missing ingredient, and Ratavia, probably through some very questionable means,
managed to get their hands on it. By my first day, they were already preparing
to conduct the very first test of it. I was tasked recording (yes, that meant
holding one of those old huge VHS camcorders over my shoulder) and reporting
whatever happened. Hey, at least I couldn’t say my first day wouldn’t be
interesting. 

I was ushered into a large room with a group of other
scientists. They were watching intently through the protective glass as a man
in a hazmat suit begun preparing a concoction in a large, metal-like container.
Feeling anxious on my first day, I tried to make small talk with a nearby
a scientist named Mr. Davidson.

Mr. Davidson was one of the leading developers for this
project as was probably even more nervous than I was. He seemed nice enough and
was happy to talk to calm both our nerves, but Mr. Davidson’s smile seemed a
little off-putting. The gleam in his eyes was saying something different than from
what came out of his mouth. 

I didn’t have much time to think about it though as a buzzer
went off and the room fell to a hush. The hazmat-man lit a match into the container
and slowly backed away.

The room fell dead silent for a few moments. Then, it
happened. 

That thing was brighter than anything I had ever seen. It
was almost too painful to look at, yet I couldn’t pry my eyes away from it. The
flames were nearly as high as the ceiling as it cast a glowing green aura
with this otherworldly purple outline. It seemed as if it was trying to escape
the confines of its prison, rattling and shaking the container. And I know this
is going to sound silly, but… but I could’ve sworn I saw a face in there for a
moment.

A scientist broke my daze as Mr. Davidson nudged me to focus
my shot. The man had started to inch forward again, holding a piece of plastic
over the fire. It caught ablaze in a near-instant, but as the flames consumed
and burnt it dark black, it didn’t melt even a little. The fire on the plastic
raged on as he set it aside and picked up other materials. Even fragile things
like paper had the same thing happen; they wouldn’t burn away, but the fire
would never cease on them. It was easily one of the strangest things I’d ever
seen. 

Eventually the man brought over a yellow liquid (which I
later learned was of all things cat urine) and sprayed it over the fire. The
flames grew even more furious for a moment before it finally died down. Maybe
it was just my imagination, but before that last spark went out, I heard almost
something like a mixture of crying and laughter. 

I was about to ask one of the others if they heard it too,
but I was just trying to keep my grip on the camcorder as they suddenly erupted
into a cheer. I guess it was a great success for them, not to mention probably
a big payday. Though I joined in their cheer, I couldn’t help to ponder about
what terrible horrors this strange creature that I just witness would be used
for. 

“So,” Mr. Davidson said, again breaking my daze. “What did
you think? Pretty neat, right?”  
  

“Y-yeah. That really was something.”

“Heh,” Mr. Davidson chuckled. “I can see you’re shook up a
bit, it was quite the spectacle. But hey, just so you know you had nothing to
fear, Ratavia’s pretty good with safety.”

I gave him an assuring smile, but I still felt like
something was off. I still got that same feeling from his eyes that I did
before. 

I gave the recording to my supervisor and started heading
back to put the camcorder away. But as I passed through the corridor of offices,
I eavesdropped on a screaming match coming from one of the doors. It was Mr.
Davidson, and another unfamiliar voice. 

“Sir, how many times do I have to explain this? You got
lucky!” Mr. Davidson bellowed out. 

“Nonsense, we had the whole thing under control.”

“No, you didn’t! You’re lucky that fire, that thing decided
to play along and douse itself. If it decided to break the glass, everyone in
that room-

“That enough!” the other voice cut-off. “You don’t get paid to
complain and whine. You are going to continue with this project, and if you
don’t you can go work somewhere else. I’m done talking about this, get the hell
out of my office.”

The door slammed opened. Mr. Davidson was mumbling himself
until he caught my surprised expression. 

“Oh, hi again. So… did you just get here?” he asked me.

“S-sure.” I stammered out.

“Ah, geez. Well, pretend you did, trust me. What they’ll do to
you isn’t worth it.”

Mr. Davidson met my wide-eyed stare with a cold smile and
started to walk away.

Thinking back, I wonder how much different my life would’ve
been if I got sick that day, or just called out. I should’ve just backed out as
soon as I heard the guy from yesterday couldn’t make it and I would be the poor
bastard in the hazmat-suit. I should’ve told them no. I could’ve told the
scientists what I heard. But I was a stupid, shy little kid, and people paid
the price for my silence. 

They handed me what looked like a modified flamethrower.
Under no circumstances was I to pull the trigger unless instructed to. The
opened the door to my side of the room. I saw Mr. Davidson’s eyes widen a bit;
I think he recognized me.  It was a
strange feeling having all those scientists on me. But what was even stranger
though was what was in the room with me.

It was… a dog. A whimpering dog in a cage. 

“D-don’t tell me you want me to do what I think you do.” I gulped
out to one of the supervisors as they were about to close the door. 

“We need to test on living subjects. You’ll be paid extra. Begin
when you hear the buzzer.”

They slammed the door behind me, and I left alone with the
canine. 

My breathing began to quicken as I realized what I had to
do. Well, they were a lot of people counting on me, right? I had to it, right? Even
though I didn’t, I convinced myself I did anyway. The buzzer rang, and I closed
my eyes as I did the deed. 

*click*

I looked down. Nothing. 

*click* *click* 

Still nothing. I kept trying to click it to no avail.

“Hey, uh, guys, I think it’s bro-“

It was like a shotgun fired right next to me. There was a
bright flash, and the next thing I knew I was lying down on the floor in agony.
 Pieces of the flamethrower were
scattered everywhere. Three fingers on my right arm were missing. The fire had
completely enflamed the cage and poor dog. It wracked the dog’s body as it
hallowed out in pain and burned the skin, but it didn’t collapse. The flames
wouldn’t let it die. 

The fire was now rapidly spreading. The alarm sounded off,
the scientists were already scrambling out. The fire quickly encircled the
glass and completely shattered it. Half of them were quickly snatched by the
fire, doing its quick work. They began to roll around the floor in agony. 

The fire now inched towards me, and that face I saw was even
more menacing than before. I tried to get up, but the fear and pain I felt made
my legs scared-stiff. I was about to close my eyes and accept my fate when I
heard the door bust open behind me and something began to drag me out. 

“Get up! We have to go now dammit!” Mr. Davidson shouted as
he lifted me up. 

He helped me walk as we trudged down the hall, the fire
close behind us. I tried to help Mr. Davidson pry open the exit door, but it
wouldn’t budge. 

“Shit! They jammed it!” he cried out.

“W-who did?” 

“Who do you think!? They’re trying to contain it! We need to
get to the roof!”

We hoped there would be some kind of helicopter waiting for
us, but we had no such luck. All that was there was the pouring rain and
pavement below. 

The fire was roaring downstairs, the rain would only grant
us a few moments, surely it wouldn’t be long before it would charge through and
come for us. Mr. Davidson and I exchanged fearful looks as we peered down the
seven stories.

“I’m sorry I didn’t just say what I meant.” Mr. Davidson somberly
muttered. “I thought you’d be smart after that, that I scared you away, that
you’d… well, it’s too late now. Kid, we don’t have a choice.”

I looked back one more time at Mr. Davidson, and with a tear
streaming from both our faces, we stepped forward. 

The rest of that year was kind of a blur. I woke up some
months later in the hospital where they shoved a disclosure agreement in my
face the moment I had prosthetics for my missing fingers. I was never able to
walk right again, and I have scars all over my body. But even so, I learned
later that Mr. Davidson was… even unluckier. 

Every night, I still imagine that place. There’s no way they
figured out how to extinguish it. That building and all those poor souls are
still burning as terrible as they did all that time ago. The truly worse part
though about all this though, what motivated to write this, is somewhere deep
in Ratavia’s vaults, that manuscript to make Greek Fire is there. It’s just waiting
for the past to be forgotten and to be rescued, so it can have some new
victims. 

If you ever find the recipe to make Greek Fire, do yourself a
favor and destroy it. [It was lost to time for a reason.] (https://old.reddit.com/r/StoryStar/)"

I recently started attending uni and want to land an internship at a tech company this summer for something in the coding field (UI/UX, software engineer, etc). A club I attend recently had a panel that featured successful grad students/students who got very good internships at tech companies. A big piece of advice I learned from that panel is to start making personal projects to show employers, make a website, apps, etc. I've had (at least what I thought to be) a good idea for an app since high school, but don't know enough about programs to know which one to use. I've had experience with Java and I'm currently taking classes for C++. 

TL;DR want to make my first app, what's a good program/language to use. I've had experience with Java and I'm learning c++.
Thanks!"

My school is essentially a no name school and I was never given a chance for an internship.  For what little it's worth, my GPA is currently 3.77.  Former military (hopefully relevant for some of the defense positions I applied for)

Now that I am a few months out I have started to apply to jobs in the Denver area (my wife already has a job lined up) but out of the 25+ applications I've sent out, I've only heard back from 3 places with rejection emails.

I've managed to convince my wife to possibly consider Texas (low cost of living and she's picky about locations) but it seems like the same deal.  I know first thing people will say is to check my resume -- I'll upload an anonymized version if anyone is curious, but it feels like a lot of the job postings for new grads/juniors I come across are ones I've already applied to.

Combining this with some imposter syndrome is really making me feel like I picked the wrong field and wasted the last few years of my life (and GI Bill).  I'm seriously considering going to a coding bootcamp (which the VA would pay for in full) just to take advantage of their career services.  

Has anyone been in a similar situation or am I letting anxiety get the best of me?"

Feeling like a bit of a chump.,hopeitsnotsobad,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dis2lr/am_i_suffering_from_imposter_syndrome_or_am_i/,"So here’s the deal. I’m a senior in college and I just landed what i would consider to be my dream internship (analyst at a marketing firm). The company offered me a one month position as an evaluation period and the potential to continue after that. I’ve never had a company do that before so i feel like I’m totally being watched and judged. I’m not an awkward person, but for whatever reason i just can’t function socially there. I have had at least two awkward encounters in three days of work. Here’s why I’m feeling so nervous:

1. I was ten minutes late to the interview. I couldn’t use my car so i had to Uber and the Uber driver got lost. I suppose i could be blamed for that for not leaving earlier but the amount of time added because he got lost was the real reason i was late - i would not have been late had he not gotten lost 

2. I couldn’t get into my computer on the second day of work. Apparently the passwords didn’t automatically sync when i changed my outlook account so that was embarrassing. 

3. I’m using programs I’ve neverlike  really used before and learning on the job. They’re giving me a month to learn though which is nice. 

4. I forgot to fill out something for HR so i have to do that tomorrow. It just doesn’t reflect well on me that i forgot to do that. 

I just feel like i have zero confidence but I’m doing my best. I’ve resolved to show up 30 minutes early every day. I just already feel like such a failure because i just couldn’t do these simple things. I feel like I’ve already fucked up the evaluation and now I’m going through a Sisyphean struggle. I know i can’t have that attitude and i just have to work that much harder. Maybe I’m being too hard on myself but i just haven’t been under this much self imposed pressure. I’ve got to do better but I don’t know how when I’m just so new to it. Do y’all have any similar experiences?"
dis6ds,1,2019-10-16,How to handle unexpected team matching for a new time SWE offer?,PugilisticCat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dis6ds/how_to_handle_unexpected_team_matching_for_a_new/,"So this summer I interned at a pretty well known company and absolutely loved my time there. I managed to finish my project and start on a smaller project, and overall got good feedback from fellow engineers on my team, including my mentor. 

However, at the end of the internship (last two weeks), I was informed that my division did not have enough space to give full time positions to matriculating interns (of which there were 6 or 7). My recruiter did not tell me this in time for me to effectively recruit outside of my division, and as a result, I am sitting here waiting to hear something back (while concurrent recruiting).

I have emailed my recruiter several times over the past month and a half, and I have always been somewhat blown off by responses such as ""we will get back to you in a few weeks"". 

I know that the answer is to keep recruiting, but honestly, my mental health is starting to dwindle. I have already gotten rejected from an on-site, I've had 5 interviews in the past two weeks, I am having to withdraw from a class because recruiting is ramping up and I can't spend the 40 hrs per hw set that is necessary to do well. I'm just extremely frustrated and not sure how to handle all of this pressure, and I am especially frustrated at the company because one of the major reasons I took their internship was because they touted high matriculation statistics from interns to full time hires. All of my friends from this summer are getting to go back to honestly what is my dream company, and I feel fucked by the random chance I was assigned to intern in the one division that wasn't going to have space to do new hires. I feel mentally shot and frankly have been super withdrawn in the past two weeks, spending nearly all day in bed. 

What is the best way to recover from this sort of shit? Additionally, do I keep pressuring my recruiter, or do I just wait for her to respond?"
ditlk2,1,2019-10-16,Should I stick it out with my fast food job or should I go to a call center job with higher pay?,Dont-throw-it-away32,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ditlk2/should_i_stick_it_out_with_my_fast_food_job_or/,"TL;DR- Should I stay with my fast food job that I hate for $10.75/hr, or try a call center for $16 an hour?

Hey, so I am a college CS student looking for some advice. 

I currently work at a fast food restaurant making $10.75 in a relatively LCOL area. This was my first job and  I’ve been there 3 years now and am honestly burnt out. This restaurant is closed on Sundays and I work 12-16 hour days on Fridays and Saturdays to barely scrape by. I’m one of the highest paid people in the store, and am excellent at retail and customer service, even having locals come back specifically to see me (sorry for the brag...). I don’t feel I’m making enough however and really do no enjoy what I do. However, it is brain dead easy and I’m respected at work, and have a lot of friends there. 

It should be noted that my current job does have a corporate internship in summer 2020 for software development, though my boss has said it’s a very hard position to get into and that, while they would pay for my costs, I would have to move out of state.

Retail/Customer service is not my interest. Computer science is. I love programming and learning more about my field. 

I have an opportunity to work in a call center for an ISP making $16/hr, but browsing through various subreddits, I hear horror stories about call center jobs and I can’t truly gauge how much harder/easier a call center job is versus a food service job. This ISP  has different departments, including an internship ALSO for summer 2020 for software development.  The pay would greatly offset my tuition payments and lift a burden off me.

Are call centers better or worse than food service? If they are worse, are they that much worse that I’d be better served staying with my current job? 

And for people that worked in call centers that had different departments, was it easy to move to another department once you had established yourself in the call center?"

This last summer someone introduced me to programming and oh boy did I like it. So I spent that summer's free time learning to code, and I thought I was getting the hang of it, so this semester I started applying for some internships in software. Well, I've gotten a couple responses asking me to take a coding challenge on HackerRank. Unfortunately I've never even heard of such a site, and when I tried the tests, I only managed to get like 10/13 test cases for the hardest questions and failed to move on. So I clearly screwed up and completely overestimated my abilities.

I tried looking at some LeetCode problems after this. To be honest, I find them very hard. I've been able to solve every easy or medium I've tried so far (about 15), but each one takes me anywhere from half an hour to two hours, which is clearly too much time. Do these kinds of problems get easier with time, or should I be doing something else before trying these problems? I haven't taken DS or Algo classes at my uni yet, so the only knowledge I have of these is from self studying through the Internet. Do you think I should wait until I take these courses? Or is there some book I should go through before doing LeetCode problems? I don't really know what to do at the moment... Thanks for the advice."

(for a new grad),arshon0029,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/diycet/capital_one_vs_jpmorgan_chase_for_a_new_grad/,"I have offers from Capital One and JPMorgan Chase for their TDP/SEP programs, starting next summer after I graduate. The JPMC offer is in Columbus. The location of the Capital One offer is tbd, but I'd push hard for McLean if I decide I want to take it (from what I've heard/read, that shouldn't be too difficult).  
  
Compensation wise, they seem to be about equal after adjusting for cost-of-living differences between Columbus and NoVA.  
  
I'm not totally sure which offer to take. Here's a rough outline of my pros/cons so far:  
  
**JPMorgan Chase**:  

* I was an intern there and had a good experience. Kind of a ""better the devil you know than the devil you don't"" situation here  
  
* I have more ideas around what teams I'd like to request for placement come Spring, because of said internship  
  
* I'd prefer Columbus over NoVA/DC for personal reasons (I have friends there, closer to family)  
      
* Possibly weaker technical culture than C1? Seems like they're slow to adopt new technologies and don't use a ton of open source software. Dev environments aren't great either (slow virtual machines running Windows) 
  
**Capital One**:  
  
* Seems to be a more well-regarded name in tech circles, I know a lot of people consider it to be the best bank from a technical perspective.
  
* Program is rotational, so I'd get to try out a few different things    
    
* From reading this subreddit/Blind/Glassdoor, it seems like Capital One has some *very* dysfunctional organizations within it. I don't know if JPMC is any better though, it might just be that the people unhappy with C1 are louder.
  
Anybody have any advice or thoughts? If all things were equal, I'd probably pick JPMC because of the location. But if Capital One is really a much better place to be a SWE, I'm open to that too."

Company agreed to pay for CySA so I dove right in. No prior IT or security experience beyond that.

Been studying since mid-August. I used Jason Dion's course and practice exams as well as the all in one guide from Maymi/Chapman. Used the CompTIA CySA+ practice exams that I had access to through my company.

The exam was challenging but certainly passable. Lot's of focus on the IR process and knowing how to read various logs and outputs from tools like Netstat, Wireshark, and NMAP as well as vulnerability scan results (deciphering false positives vs true positives). Overall I liked the process and feel that even though I had a decent foundation coming into it from school and work, it's certainly helped strengthen my skills and sharpen my knowledge more."

If you were me, what would you do in this case?

A. Tell all offers (w/o money part) you have with company names and their deadlines.

B.  Provide generic response like have couple of offers and they have deadline end of next month or what else.

C. Don't tell anything about your offers and dodge the question citing some politically correct answer like policy from offered company prohibits me from discussing with another company.

It raised following questions to me after the call as certainly that conversation felt odd if not completely inappropriate.

2. How the information about other offers and deadlines helps the recruiter for their position?
3. How my chances would affect the outcome based on my answer A/B/C?

So first I am a graphic design artist just recently graduated, and one of my first aspiring goals is to become and art director and go from there. Right, so back in May right after graduation I didn't wait around to look for a job, I was hunting online, going to offices and asking around, even my former teacher tried helping but nothing and I got super depressed, and anxious cause I just spent a few years and money and I'm starting to second guess my self. Now at the time and at the end of that semester is when I met my true set if friends, like I mean true friends and they've always been there to support me. And at the same time I was chasing after a girl and over that summer even though I was down, when I was around her I pretended my problems did not exist. At the end of the summer though a company I talked to said they would take me on as an intern and instantly I took it, it was one and only shot and a for sure ticket ya know. When I started my boss asked about my goals and I told her. The day I started she came to me and said ""we usually have two designers at a time, but since the other dropped I will not only train you as a graphic artist, but to be an director as well, and when the internship is done I will put in a referral for you to be a director."" And ever since she have truely been the best, but in the first two weeks I got an offer out of state, and ice always wanted to work out of state because where I live now isn't exactly the best for graphic design. Now the girl I mentioned before we were close to dating but when I told her my goals, she flipped and it turned to an argument, and we parted was, I won't talk about what was said because it no longer has relevance. Now we get to the part where I need help. So the same night, a friend of mine comforts me over what just happen, and I've known her for a while now, but never seen her other than a friend. And since then we've hung out like every day and talk all the time, and when we talk there's this energy and it's never negative. So for a while I just focused on my self, but a few weeks ago we were talking and she brought up the words "" her boyfriend"" and before that moment I never seen her other than a friend, but when she said that I got mad, because how she said he treated her and just uses her. We talked and got past it and things were normal, until Sunday. We talked again Sunday but this time, I couldn't keep my feelings inside, and neither could she. She didn't exactly say she likes me, but I think that is part in her being in a relationship, but we said all these things about each other, like how we are our true selves with each other, and how we want to spend more time together. And since it's been very different, and now it's good morning, goodnight, how's your day, what are you doing ect. And we went out last night and it's was soooo different we couldn't stop looking at each other, smiling talking or anything, but there was a moment and maybe I'm reading too much into this, but she ""compared"" hand sizes and hesitated like she wanted to hold hand or more, but she pulled away as if forcing herself. Now I'm stuck and don't know what to do."

Is it worth it to try to change my future career from CS to something else?  
2. Also, would it be worth trying to change degrees from CS to something else?  
3. Is it possible for me to finish my undergrad in either computer science or philosophy, and then get a graduate degree in psychology?  

**Background**  

* Currently attending a top 10 Computer Science undergraduate program  
* Also 4 courses into my philosophy minor  
* Completed two software engineering/development internships  
* Switched into the major during my sophomore year  
* Withdrew from 7 courses so far due to depression. I'm actually considering just going part-time for the rest of my college career because I've withdrawn so many times.  
* My parents are paying for my tuition, and might withdraw their financial support if I change my major to something impractical like philosophy.  
* Halfway through the computer science degree  
* Just began my 4th year  
* 3.4 GPA  

**The personal side of it**  

* Switched into computer science for the prestige, the job stability, and because it reminded me of math which I love  
* The longer I continue the CS program, the less I like it. Currently in despair over feeling obligated to enter a career in software engineering/development.  
* Would love an academic career, but I'm afraid my GPA isn't good enough or that I've withdrawn from too many courses  
* Addicted to learning about psychology. I often research it for fun (beyond what is useful for treating my depression), and it's been a huge part of my thoughts for my whole life. I also love the meaningful aspect to it. Being a person that makes other people feel mentally healthier just by being around them, is one of my major life goals.  
* I've also thought about philosophy my whole life, and while I'm good at Western philosophy, I've grown to somewhat dislike it recently. Eastern philosophy, on the other hand, has fundamentally changed the way I view the world and is something I'm still very fascinated by. I could see myself becoming a professor specializing in Eastern philosophy, assuming I were able to. My close friends and family have also told me that they could easily envision me being a professor, especially a philosophy professor.  
* I loved the first course I took in computer science. I also loved Calculus I and II. I love conceptual things in general, but for some reason computer science doesn't excite me anymore. Even  algorithmic analysis doesn't seem that interesting to me. Being a UI/UX designer is somewhat appealing, but my degree doesn't really prepare me for that.  


I really appreciate all your help! Thanks so much for any advice you have to give. :) I hope I can figure this out."

I use Sage to develop our main website (WordPress).

However I am more comfortable with Node.js, especially when it comes down to routing and processing data received from forms.

Would it be a good solution to use a subdomain like forms.domainName.com to host all our forms on a different server running on node/pm2 ?"

djchjq,0,2019-10-17,"Start “real” life early, or postpone?",dshah1507,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/djchjq/start_real_life_early_or_postpone/,"Hi all,
I’m graduating this semester (will be done with my BS in computer science in December), and have a job lined up. My employer said I am eligible for a February 10th start date, and I was completely fine with this coming into recruiting season, but the more I think about it I really feel like I would regret if I were to start my life early. My parents are all for pushing me to go and start work, and said it will put me at a huge advantage over my peers if I’m already working while they are all still finishing up their degrees and will graduate in May. Part of me really wants to try to push my start date to August (It’s for a TDP program which has Feb and Aug start dates) so that I can use these 6 months to relax and hangout with my friends, but my parents are worried I’ll become lazy and unmotivated to work (since I have the rhythm of having done internships every summer since my freshman year, I’ve never really taken a Real break. Not sure what to do, what do ya’ll think?"
djcp32,0,2019-10-17,CS Senior Transfer Student without Projects,HewJNus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/djcp32/cs_senior_transfer_student_without_projects/,"Hi. Before you read this, know this is partly a rant and cry of frustration. It will also probably be lengthy. I’m gonna provide context but try to skip unnecessary stuff. Thank you for reading.

I would just like to introduce myself. I’m a guy who moved to CA during my senior year of high school. I had no friends and was pretty depressed that I didn’t get accepted to UCLA(the reason why I moved to CA). I went to a local community college to try to transfer to UCLA after two years.

I got through community college without trying to network or make friends, and I feel like the isolation has kind of made me not able to come out of my shell. I don’t have friends at my new college that I transferred to, and it’s been a year in. I also joined no clubs so far, and worked on zero projects.

I’m a senior now(but will still be in school for another 1 1/2- 2 years because I only took 12 credits each semester/quarter). I just went to a career fair and felt pretty crappy because I have no projects I’ve worked on. Basically I was just told I don’t have any experience, but I can apply still.

I tried joining beginner hackathons(because they sound fun) at my school, but they only accept freshmen and sophomores. I also tried joining the hacking club at my school, but I don’t exactly know what I’m going to get out of it.

I would really like to get an internship, or job immediately after graduating, but I’m pretty discouraged. If I need to just pick up the slack, let me know.

I feel like I’ve been reading about people making projects, and my honest feelings are that they’re pretty bs because I would really not want to make a side project on something that doesn’t interest me just because I want an internship.

I do enjoy CS, and the programming parts of my classes are very enjoyable. I personally don’t feel very confident in my programming skills as of now, but I believe I’m a bright individual. I just really don’t know where to start, and if I really just have to start doing projects and stuff on the side, I’ll try to do it during my breaks.

Hobbies: Basketball(NBA and NBA 2K games), gaming in general, competitive eSports(I don’t play competitively, but I really enjoy watching eSports like Rainbow Six Siege Pro League), and anime

I think I enjoy the coaching and strategy aspects of anything, but I am really bad with people, so it’s kind of actually hard for me to tell people or teach people. I do enjoy teaching people, as I’ve tutored in math during high school, and enjoy tutoring my gf’s brother.

Thanks for reading. If I just need a reality check, please let me know. Feeling a little despair right now."
djd43j,1,2019-10-17,Academic Dismissal Readmissions Questions,academ_dismiss,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/djd43j/academic_dismissal_readmissions_questions/," 

Hello, I was academically dismissed this Spring. I did fairly well in my first semester but deteriorated the next 3 until getting dismissed. This summer I had an internship with a very high profile company in my field, and this fall I'm doing online classes.

I've submitted my application to be readmitted into the university, however I'm very nervous about it and would like some advice. First of all, how often are people readmitted. Something that especially makes me nervous is that because I'm taking cc classes during the fall, my transcripts won't be available so they won't have access to that and I think that's the number one factor for readmission.

Secondly, if I don't get readmitted, do I have any options for finding a different university? I'm too high level for cc classes anymore, so I'd like to find a way to continue my education as I believe I've fixed my mistakes since then. The problem is I barely have above a 2 GPA, so I don't know if any university would even take me at this point.

Thanks"
dje1tz,0,2019-10-17,Does the industry you intern in as a sophomore affect your long term prospects? Making a decision between two drastically different offers.,WholeFlatworm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dje1tz/does_the_industry_you_intern_in_as_a_sophomore/,"Hi. This is my first post, I read the rules but please let me know if I've not followed something in the FAQ or rules. 

I'm  a sophomore CS major at a public university in Texas. I've really been searching for internships this year and have an offer in hand and a verbal offer from another company. These offers are drastically different and as this would be my first ever internship I want to make sure I start off on the right foot. 

My main question is, does the company you intern at steer your future internship opportunities? Or do the things you do at your internship matter more in your next internship search? 

I have a SWE intern offer from Textron Systems, and from the discussions I've had with my team lead and interviewers it sounds like an interesting opportunity at a huge company. The only concern I have with this opportunity is the fact that they are a defense contractor, so I was wondering if someone could weigh in on that? 

My other offer is a Product Dev role with PROS, an AI SaaS company. They are less known but they are the market leader in their sector, and they seem to have the tech/startup culture with cool projects. The glassdoor reviews for this company also looks much better, but that's not too important of a metric. 

I'm torn between which to accept. Location, pay and logistics are all accounted for in my two offers so I'm looking for an offer that would help me the most in my future prospects at tech companies/startups.. Are there any other things I should think about while considering these offers or any culture/pitfalls to keep in mind?"
djeb1a,2,2019-10-17,Considering living in a van for a six month internship in a different town.,underfilled_icetrays,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/djeb1a/considering_living_in_a_van_for_a_six_month/,"I’m currently a senior studying mechanical engineering. I was offered an engineering co-op (like a long internship) position with a company from Jan-June in a town 2 hours away from where I live. I have to find housing as commuting every day is not an option. It’s not looking cheap- $500/month on average. So $3k over the course of the co-op. I can definitely afford this with what I’m being paid, but I’m trying to weigh my options here. 

I met a guy this semester who lived in a van for a summer internship, and he said it was a really cool experience. He stayed at a campground for free. Another old roommate I had stayed in a tent for the entirety of a summer internship. 

What do you think about the idea about buying a cheap van, throwing a mattress in the back, and living in it? (And making some shelves/cabinets etc for clothes and storage) 

For food, I’d keep breakfast and lunch simple (yogurt and granola, cereal etc; sandwiches, salads &amp; fruit) and dinners use my propane camp stove to cook something simple (like chicken, rice, noodles etc).  For bathroom/shower, I’d get a gym membership (my company said they’d pay for it). 

Electricity- charge my phone at work, use a battery operated fan &amp; light that could be charged at work
Heat- I have a small indoor propane heater i could use if it got bitter cold (obviously wouldn’t turn it on and sleep). 

&amp; I’d just stay in a campground somewhere and commute on a motorcycle so it wouldn’t be too bad on gas.

It’s not really about the money. In the end, this may cost the same as a rental. But at the end of the co-op, I would have this cool van that I could go on road trips with and stuff. 

I found a ford e150 econoline conversion van on marketplace for $1500 and It looks in decent shape. My friends say go for it, it’ll be a cool experience, but my parents/adult friends say it’s not a very good idea. I’d love some more input here. 

Thoughts???"

I wanted to do some travelling and adventuring first so I came to Korea to teach. 

Fast-forward to 2019 (almost 2020) and I’m still in Korea. It’s been almost 7 years since graduating. I haven’t completely abandoned programming. I studied in my spare time and learned a few new skills. However the only thing I have to show for it is an app I created. 

My initial plan was to try to make time to do a lot of study and follow a few online courses, and in turn build up my Github page with projects. 

Although, I am wondering would this be enough? Most places seem to ask for recent graduates or those with experience. Would it best to look into doing a Masters? Or try to do what I’m doing (but better) and look for an internship? 

I appreciate any and all help."

My only issue is that I’m starting to get bored of embedded software so I don’t know if it’s best for me to take it. 

My other option would be to apply for masters in AI/ML or CV (not in it for the hype, I genuinely like stats/signal processing stuff). My concern about this is that I won’t be able to get into any programs to make it worth it. I have a high GPA, semi-related research (Deep Learning hardware accelerators for a year, no papers/presentations), good letters of rec, lots of intern experience, but my GRE is pretty trash (I am bad at standardized testing). 

So basically I’m afraid of turning down the FAANG offer only to get denied at every grad school... Any advice on what I should do here? Finances are not a big issue."

Is there a specific use case where one is better than the other (or perhaps in a certain field?).

I'm just taking a look at CS programs and I need linear algebra.. discrete math structures etc.. Just looking at the requirements scares me bc I feel like I'm not capable. It's discouraging knowing I need to study 300x longer than the average person I feel like I don't have the brains for this major. So I keep looking towards business instead. My classmates in my C++ class got an average of 80% on our midterm and I got a 50%.

One is a big bank and the other is a local web development agency. Both offers in AUD$

I'm a final year computer science student that took a lighter load the last couple semesters because I've been burning out, so I won't be graduating for another year and will just be doing the absolute minimum amount of credits I can and working full-time while attempting to pull up my GPA before grad.

**Bank Pros:**

* Can literally walk there from my house, 20 minute train commute otherwise
*  Big 4 bank, very well known so probably better for resume
* Good culture, already have friends working there
* Will pay for AWS/Google Cloud certs and other training
* Possibility to learn Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana stack 
* After 12 months can transition to graduate role for pay bump to $70K
* Can switch teams/roles after 3 months
* Will be assigned a mentor

**Bank Cons:**

* Low pay and zero chance for negotiation, have to wait until graduation to transition to a grad role
* Business dress code
* 9-5 work day
* Open office

**Agency Pros:**

* Higher pay, might be possible to negotiate even more
* Can start late, flexible hours, remote work allowed one day per week
* No dress code
* Good culture, lead engineer seems really nice
* Working with React
* Constant stream of new projects

**Agency Cons:**

* Small and unknown company
* Be working mostly front-end at first
* Wordpress
* Longer commute (45 min train)

I only have two internships so far, one for 9 months (unknown startup) and one 6 months (well known global non-profit), both working on NodeJS web apps, so I'm leaning towards the bank. However the web dev agency is money in the bank and probably less stress with studying on top.

Also as soon as I graduate I plan on aggressively applying for jobs in the US/Big N so probably wouldn't hang around to transition from an internship to grad role at the bank.

Thanks for taking the time to respond."

I'm currently a second year IT student at a Dutch University of Applied Sciences. When I graduate in 2022 I will get a Bsc.

There are a few things I'm unsure about that maybe you guys can help me with.

1. Is it too early/even possible to apply for an internship for Sept 2020 now? I feel like I should start early on keeping in mind that things like sponsorships take lots of time?
2. Right now all I have are my grades from last year during which my GPA was a 3.0. Will companies even consider me with such a low gpa?
3. What did your motivation/cover letter look like? Because I just can't think of something to write down that would distinguish me from thousands of other people.

Btw I'm not bad at school, I really like what I study and enjoy learning. I'm just a bit lazy and don't study hard enough for a test to get 100%. I usually score very high on projects between 90-95% but those sometimes just get a complete or incomplete and therefor don't boost my gpa.

University taught me C#, school taught me a little bit of C++, and in iOS I was self-taught until I landed an intern at the same above mentioned firm, who has it's own iOS app. My advisor was very great at teaching me iOS architecture styles, clean code in swift, objective-c, etc.. Now I've come to a point that I really don't know how to learn a new language, I learned swift from a course on Udemy (having previous university C# object-oriented programming modules) , it was helpful and all, but I was so bored listening to the beginner stuff of coding... So at this point now, I wanted to learn Node-js, and downloaded another udemy course on Node.js, but gosh, I wanna get pretty straightforward to the good stuff, because what I've seen by now, that all udemy highest-rated courses are for complete beginners, and they don't teach you very much besides the fundamental stuff. I kind of don't know the best way to teach myself a new language, and I don't want to waste my time on some guy explaining what a class is, what an object is, what is threading, etc., etc..

**Major: Computer science**

**Stats:**

SAT: 1490 (750 Math, 740 EBRW).

GPA: 3.74 on a 4.0 scale

**Demographic:**

Brown (Bengali) male in Middle-Upper middle class suburb in Massachusetts

**ECs:**

DECA Business Club for Sophomore and Junior year (doing it senior year), places in States both times

Coached Middle School recreational basketball as a sophomore

Internship at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, helped publish paper that I’m coauthored on. Interned over the summer there since freshman year, currently I help manage a Harvard Summit’s social media pages (probably not gonna mention this, more so the published paper). Helped with a project that used a web-based program to educate those in African countries (Nigeria and Tanzania, two off the top of my head) on certain medical procedures. This is computer science related, in case I worded it poorly.

Published research paper in an annually published journal at my school.

Have played piano since I was 8.


**AP Classes:**

AP Psychology, taking biology, literature, and statistics senior year. Will have at least an A- in all of them for quarter one grades (although I’m applying EA for all of these schools, so the grade is not as relevant).

I’d appreciate any help, and mentioning any other target schools that would be good for CS. Keep in mind these are looking to be early action applications, and all of them are for the CS program which makes everything more difficult. Thanks."
djuako,73,2019-10-18,Yet another new grad success story - dream job accepted!,madmike34455,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/djuako/yet_another_new_grad_success_story_dream_job/,"I hate to be yet another student humble bragging about their job offer, but I am honestly still in absolute shock and can barely believe it myself. It’s been a wild couple weeks, including literally breaking my back three weeks ago and having to go home for the rest of the semester, but it’s great to finally have some good news. 

I grew up in a low income single parent home, and went to a public school that barely had computers in the building, let alone computer science classes. I went to a small liberal arts school and started studying cs in my sophomore year, proceeding to get no internships for two years and generally feeling like shit. As cliche as it sounds, I spent a lot of my past summer grinding Leetcode, and two days ago I got my first ever offer at a big N company, which has been my dream (however misguided it may be) since starting.

I’m making more than anybody in my family, and it’s straight out of college. I just honestly can’t believe it, and definitely have imposter syndrome and probably will for a while. I found a lot of people on this sub really helpful, and I’m grateful for this resource when I felt like shit and like I’d never get anything sitting around doing side projects for two summers. This is the only offer I’ve received, but it really only takes one!"
djupio,2,2019-10-18,Not sure which route would be the best to take in order to obtain CompTIA A+,MsBerg,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/djupio/not_sure_which_route_would_be_the_best_to_take_in/,"**Background:** I (30 F) have been working in healthcare (pharmacy tech) for the last 11 years and I am ready to move on. I'm bored as there really isn't any way for me to advance as a pharm tech anymore and healthcare is starting to become more emotionally taxing for me the older I get. I graduated with a BS in food and nutrition in 2018 with the intention of becoming a dietitian, but after doing a year and a half of various internships, I realized it wasn't for me.

**Current Plan:** Take and (hopefully) pass both CompTIA A+ certification exams by the end of next summer so that I can start looking for help desk type roles by the end of next year. I would then probably continue studying for Net+ and Sec+ as I gained experience to help me get a better sense of where my interests lie and to open up more opportunities for myself.

I've thought about self-studying the material, but having virtually no background in IT other than one elective class I took, I believe I would feel more comfortable with an instructor-led course to get me started and to make sure I am understanding everything properly. 

I have explored options at a local community college and they have two that really interest me: 

* A Certificate in Networking Program (2 years of in-person classes, course descriptions say they cover material that's on the A+, CCENT, CCNA, and the ICND1/2 exams)

* A 6-month online program that prepares you specifically for the CompTIA A+ exams

The other piece to this is that my current employer will pay 100% for me to get the Certificate in Networking because I'm earning college credits. They will not pay for the 6-month course, which runs about $2,000 (including the vouchers for the exams).

Based on your experience, which do you think is the best route for me to take in this situation? Or is there something else I should be doing instead? 

I don't want to waste 2 years on a Certificate in Networking if I could have prepared for the A+ exams in 6-months with this online course just as well. But I also don't want to be foolish to not take the essentially free classes. Thank you for any advice!"

Which one would be more valuable for someone applying to deferred enrollment MBA programs (2+2, etc)? Obviously GS is a well-known firm by top MBA programs and I would honestly prefer to be in NYC this summer, but I don’t feel great about passing on the opportunity to have a Big 4 on my resume. Any thoughts?"

Have questions about this situation as I’ve never really been in it before.

I am a junior at a small college in Upstate New York. I will be studying in New York City next semester, and part of the requirement of the program I am involved in is that I must do 6 credits of internships while I am in New York (pretty much, this means I have to have one full-time internship or two part-time internships). 

Last week, I applied for an internship at a mid-sized public relations firm in the city that I was really jazzed about. I worked really hard on my resume and cover letter - used job scan and all that jazz to make sure it was tailored right. My hard work paid off! This Tuesday, I received an email from the woman that I presume to be the HR recruiter inviting me to submit a video application for the position (I haven’t submitted it yet-I was going to create and submit it this Sunday). This was for the PR intern position. 

Today, I had two hits on my LinkedIn account and I think it was from this company, because shortly after that I received an email from the same HR recruiter lady to an in-person interview with the head of their internship program for a social media intern position. The problem is, they’re in NYC and I’m about 4 hours away upstate. I don’t know anyone in the city I could stay with for an overnight interview on a Tuesday, and I wouldn’t want to cut it so short by bussing into the interview day-of. 

I have 2 questions here:

1. Would they disqualify me if I explained that it isn’t really feasible for me to get to the city on such short notice and asked for a phone or video interview instead for the social media internship position
2. Do I still submit the video application for the PR internship position/does it sound like I’m still being considered for it? I’m willing to take the social media internship position at this company because it’s a company I really want to get to know better, but I’m not interested in doing social media as a career at all so I would much rather have the PR position. 

Thanks!"

I'm starting to see a lot of people getting offers and it seems like the big recruiting wave has already passed. I've applied to about 40 places and have been offered 6 interviews. I'm still waiting for the results from some of my interviews and have not had some of them yet. I'm willing to keep applying, but I'm not sure if it's a waste of time at this point. I appreciate any input. Thanks!

If this helps I attend a top public university in the northeast, have a \~3.6 GPA, have prior internship experience at a startup, and have a couple of independent projects."

djyqpv,1,2019-10-19,Had my first Software Engineering internship experience and I felt like it was a little toxic but I'm not sure if that was partially my fault. Can anyone chime in and give me a 2nd unbiased opinion on this?,throwawaysonataferry,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/djyqpv/had_my_first_software_engineering_internship/,"At my recent internship, there was this guy who was highly regarded as THE guy with the knowledge in the department about the technical stuff (extremely smart SWE). I tried REALLY hard to get him to like me but I wanted to learn a lot from this guy. I'd always greet him and try to talk to make small talk with him sometimes. About mid-way into the internship, he'd always say hi to the other intern and help them out with their project. I felt like I was always ignored. I really didn't understand why. Maybe it was because the other intern had more experience and knowledge than me or was able to teach him things that he didn't know before. It was so frustrating to the point where I almost had a panic attack at work. That's a situation I would really like to avoid at my next internship or job because the way he treated me kind of made me really depressed and almost not want to come to work. The thing is that he was sort of the designated person in the department (heavily understaffed) who I was supposed to ask questions regarding my project about. Instead, I avoided asking him questions and just asked Google first or the other intern.  

A few other things (that may or may not help):  He asked me a lot of questions early on in my internship about my knowledge and I said no to a lot of the questions but I'd ask about them.  He did in fact try to help me at the beginning but he got frustrated and told me ""good luck"".  He did spend 2-3 days out of my 12-week internship to help me but I felt like the other intern always had help throughout their internship while I was left alone most of the time (I did ask questions).  

I'm just trying to better understand the situation because from my perspective, it seems like we got off on the wrong foot or something.  If there is something that I can improve on, then I want to know."

dk0gt4,0,2019-10-19,"Is it just me, or does Sudorank suck?",alanfmlng,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dk0gt4/is_it_just_me_or_does_sudorank_suck/,"Everyone here should have heard of Hackerrank and their coding assessments, but have you heard of Sudorank? 

I have been applying to internships and co-ops every summer since I got into the university 3 years ago and I have done a lot of online coding assessments on Hackerrank, Leetcode, etc. They were generally pretty easy, and even if you got stuck in one of the questions you could easily put it into google and look for similar algorithms to gain some insights (this always works for me). But today I genuinely felt defeated when I did this new type of assessments called Sudorank from Hackerrank. 

It is basically like any other coding assessments, but instead of typing on their website, I had to ssh to their remote machine and type code in the command line. The questions were not difficult, if I knew the languages. Yes, if I knew the languages. The first question I was asked to write a Shell script on the machine. I had coded with Shell only once before and that was years before with a much simpler content (a single line of command for crontab to run, that’s it). I didn’t even remember the syntax. As you may know, spacing matters a lot in Shell script and I got stuck there for an hour trying to debug and google what could be wrong, which turned out to be the whitespaces after all the equal sign I wrote. The next hour was literally a hell. I was asked to write a Puppet Script but I had never ever heard of Puppet before and I basically had to learn it up in a hour. Eventually I managed to write up something in the script that would have worked if I didn’t forgot to escape one single quote ‘ in one of the command arguments causing a compilation error. But then I ran out of time to correct it. 

I feel like the whole one hour was wasted because I am pretty sure they do not look at my code and compilation error means zero marks. (Do they?) I also feel bad because neither does the job requirement mention I need to know Puppet nor did I mention I knew it."

Alumni here. I graduated last year with a CS degree and continued working at my PEY placement (for anyone on the fence, do your PEY!!). I will likely have the opportunity to do interviews for our 16 months internship hiring round. 

I think the conversation is usually one sided; recruiters telling applicants what to do and what not to do. But this should go both ways. So, here it is.

Some ideas (please do not limit yourself to these):

* Things that have made you more comfortable during the interview? Conversely, things that ruined your experience?
* Questions that you thought were unfair?
* Do you like background information sent before the interview? For example, ""brush up on Java concurrency practices"". Or would you rather have no prep?

Thanks and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!"

dk5ppw,2,2019-10-19,Would doing my internship a research center reflect badly on me if I want to work in the industry?,[deleted],Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/dk5ppw/would_doing_my_internship_a_research_center/,"Hello! :)

I am a computer science student who is very interested in artificial intelligence (especially machine learning and deep learning).

I am required to do an internship before graduating, and I have an opportunity to do it at the German research center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Kaiserslautern, Germany. I also have the opportunity to do it at the Fraunhofer institute in Kaiserslautern.

I can also apply to do it at other companies.

Some of my friends are telling me not to do at my internship one of the research centers I listed above if I am interested in working in the industry in the future rather than working in research. They are telling me that it would be better to do my internship at a company instead.

I am more interested in going into the industry rather than into research in the future, but I was hoping to see how research is, as well.

But are my friends right? Would doing my internship at a research center make it more difficult to find a good job at a company in the future?

Thank you for any and all answers! :)

EDIT: forgot the ""at"" before ""a research"" in the title. Sorry!"
dk66o7,2,2019-10-19,Need career advice to 'choose' between supply chain and accounting,throwwaway601,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/dk66o7/need_career_advice_to_choose_between_supply_chain/,"TL;DR I'm a math/business university student going into my last year of university in South Western Ontario. I've had the luxury of trying an array of math and business courses because of my program, but it's also been a curse to have so many opportunities. I am having sleepless nights debating on the right career path; supply chain management (SCM) versus the CPA route and would really like your advice on the path that I best should take given I accepted a CPA financial analyst offer that begins in fall 2020, or go for SCM which, I'm currently enjoying at my SCM internship right now.

I've always had an interest in SCM because I see it's real direct impact and how important its role is in most industries. My first ""job"" in university I ended up randomly landing an Research Assistant in the Operations faculty at my university, and I actually did enjoy what I was learning and doing. I took a break from my path to SCM because out of chance, I landed some business analyst co-ops at Banks, but I really hated that type of environment and role in the banks, esp in Toronto. I then got a co-op at an insurance company as a Financial Analyst and tbh it was my favourite co-op term--the team, the values, the support and I felt like I was contributing to the team. Though, it was a Financial Reporting role, and I won't lie, doing month end tasks got tedious and boring at times, and things didn't click so well. They also had a great CPA rotational program and I had a good chance of getting in.

I decided at this point, I thought supply chain management or accounting would be what I specialized in (I didn't like actuarial sciences or finance), but i couldn't decide. So, to be fair, I gave SCM another try after 3 years. I took a SCM course in univeristy, and it was farr more interesting than sitting in the my Taxation class. It was really applicable and interesting. I also took another gamble for my last co-op. Either return to the last employer for another Financial Analyst type role, or try something completely new. I took a big gamble and went for a Supply Chain Analyst co-op for electronics which I am currently at right now. And I must say, out of all of my co-ops, I really am enjoying this one the most. The projects I get to work on make sense to me, and what I am doing is actually making a huge different to saving money for the company. It's a great feeling. However, here's the twist.......

A while ago (before even taking the SCM co-op), I applied for a full time CPA Rotational Program for a Financial Analyst role at the same insurance company I had my prior co-op in. But after 3 interviews, I ended up getting an awesome offer from them -- 2 years with them, they help reimburse of provide knowledge for writing the CPA, I remember the good values and team members i knew there, and the physical environment was awesome too. Everything just seemed so great for it and i understand how competitive it was to get an offer so 3 weeks ago, I accepted the offer. But now, here I am after 3 weeks and my SCM co-op continues to get really enjoyable. I wouldn't return to this employer, but thinking of that path in the future would be nice. I wouldn't think I'd do an MBA if I take that route though. And most SCM jobs are in mississauga or brampton near me, so i'd have to relocate and possibly get a car (while this CPA job i can live at home to save money for the two years). The CPA is agree is a big commitment. In fact, I need to still (suffer) through a few more accounting courses in order to get into one of the PREP terms my school offers to prep for the CFE writing. So yeah, I'm worried about the decision I made and my values. 

On one hand, I had already accepted the CPA rotational program job but the downside is the next year of courses and studying for accounting to get over which is a big commitment. On the other hand, I am starting to realize how much I have enjoyed this SC internship and am really questioning if I made the right decision. What advice do you all have for those who are in SCM or Accounting?"

**ECs:**

DECA Business Club for Sophomore and Junior year (doing it senior year), places in States both times

Coached Middle School recreational basketball as a sophomore

Internship at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, helped publish paper that I’m coauthored on. Interned over the summer there since freshman year, currently I help manage a Harvard Summit’s social media pages (probably not gonna mention this, more so the published paper). Helped with a project that used a web-based program to educate those in African countries (Nigeria and Tanzania, two off the top of my head) on certain medical procedures. This is computer science related, in case I worded it poorly.

Published research paper in an annually published journal at my school.

**AP Classes:**

AP Psychology, taking biology, literature, and statistics senior year. Will have at least an A- in all of them for quarter one grades (although I’m applying EA for all of these schools, so the grade is not as relevant).

I’d appreciate any help, and mentioning any other target schools that would be good for CS. Keep in mind these are looking to be early action applications, and all of them are for the CS program which makes everything more difficult. Thanks."
dk6m4b,2,2019-10-19,"22, Computer Science Major, and Feeling Lost",CollegeKidThroweway9,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/dk6m4b/22_computer_science_major_and_feeling_lost/,"Hello everyone. I apologize in advance for how long this is. So, I’m having some major difficulties with how exactly to proceed with my life and was hoping maybe I could get some advice/guidance. I’m making a kind of lengthy situation explanation as the first paragraph, but I think you could skip if you so choose.

Where I’m at right now is that I’m doing quite well academically pursuing a STEM path, but I’m feeling more and more disinterested and depressed about my path. I spent my first 3 years in Community College with no real exact direction for where I was going other than generalized STEM since it paid well and partly because I have dealt with severe shyness/social anxiety most of my life and I thought it would be “safe”. I excelled in my classes more because I’m compulsively competitive and ended up finishing my Associates with a 4.0. However, I was completely lost at what exactly I wanted to do and I couldn’t go any further with general STEM/Engineering related classes at my CC (Diff Eq, Lin Alg, and Phys II at my particular CC), so I ended up taking a semester off to think. This did pretty much nothing for me as far as finding a path, so I just ended up enrolling at a nearby University for Computer Science the next semester. Here is where my problems have really started to come to a head. I had already had some experience with basic programming and knew that I wasn’t a huge fan, but I did it anyway because I thought I could just suck it up. Like in my self-taught past, once the newness of programming wore off, I realized just how much I really hate programming and that I don’t fit well with the general culture of programmers(which is a generalization. I know there are all types in any degree program or career path, but like any degree or career, there are very prevalent personality types that fit with the degree/career). This is not an indictment of programming or the major, it’s more saying that I personally don’t like programming or the major. Also, I did try doing personal projects, but I found that I would end up spending forever planning out ideas for things I wanted to build and writing about it, and had a lot of fun with this, but would put the programming off for as long as I could, and couldn’t get more than a few hours into a project because it felt tedious and boring, even if I liked the idea. However, the even bigger issue was realizing, at least at my college, just how serious a lot of my classmates are about coding and how competitive many of the internships I’m looking at are. I’m starting to worry that sucking it up and may not be quite enough to make it in this field.

Now some short points that might be helpful to understanding what I like/dislike.

What I dislike about my major: Other than a general distaste for writing code, the hyper-focus on efficiency and creating algorithms/data structures that eek out microseconds of efficiency just doesn’t seem to be utilizing the strongest parts of my brain. The very individualistic nature of the major and career is also really turning me off, and honestly, my favorite parts of the year in the major so far has been group projects, especially since I usually end up the leader and get to set-up the communication pipeline, manage the project, delegate tasks, and people in my groups seem to be pretty happy with the way that I manage it.

What I like in general: Since I’ve started working on my social anxiety and shyness, I’ve discovered that I really like working with people. I love planning things out, specifically I’ve worked with others on fitness(a long-time passion of mine) planning and financial planning. I love writing for communication and planning(not so much creative writing like novels). I’m moderately competent in math, though I don’t want to do a proof-heavy math-major. I’m interested by finance, though leaning more towards personal planning and not so much investment banking or high finance type stuff.

What are my hobbies(not exactly relevant): Fitness(especially powerlifting/bodybuilding), drawing/art, guitar, and being outside in nature.

Some final thoughts. I’m still two years away from graduating with my CS degree because of program sequencing issues, so I’m not exactly close to graduating by any means. I grew up with parents living paycheck to paycheck and having very little, so much of why I chose STEM and why I’m still in CS is because of fear of financial insecurity and because articles saying that at least half the people without STEM degrees are destined to be baristas or janitors. I want to switch to something else, I know I would be much happier if I found something that I at least found tolerable, but I just don’t know what else to switch to that at least offers a good chance at being able to be financially secure."

Check the above link if you need a little backstory. If you don't want to read it, it's okay because this thread is a little different from the above one.

So I'm currently in my final (3rd Year) in a private college in India, and have been placed in a company already. Majority of the positions here were non-technical (as well as mass recruiters), but I am still hopeful of something better to come.

If you read the above thread, I just want to tell you some of the things I've done during the year since I posted :

* Wrote code, as much as I could.
* Pushed some code on GitHub
* Built a portfolio, a resume.
* Tried getting into competitive programming (Failed, hate it. Did learn a few algorithms through a course though.)
* Tried contributing to open source projects. (Failed, maybe didn't try hard enough. Seemed too overwhelming.)
* Have been learning more and more about different subjects in CS, whether on my own or through college (Mostly on my own), through MOOCs, books, etc.
* Tried getting an internship in the summer. (Failed, got ghosted a few times by recruiters, many didn't even respond.)

So I am currently trying my best to get internships for winter. I think that right now, it's my best bet. But it's difficult, like really difficult. So my problem now is different from the last post I made. Last time I was more confused about learning things, but now my problem is actually getting into the industry.

I would appreciate any guidance from experienced people in the industry, on how to network, how to actually properly apply to internships, how to improve my profile perhaps, how to get and prepare for interviews, and things I should/should not do. I hate to ask for referrals, but hey, even that would help me. Just let me know and I'll drop you my portfolio and resume link.

Thank you :)

**TL;DR : Final year student, need help getting into the software industry, need advice from professionals, how to network, how to apply to jobs, how to improve my profile, how to get and prepare for interviews.**"

As some of you may have seen my previous post https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/dctv5f/i_got_my_first_internship/

I wanted to give an update on how my first week went. On the first day, I got to chat with my mentor, who has about 5ish years of experience in front end. He gave me a project to make a mobile first web app in Angular. 

So I have never really had much experience with this particular framework, but I did do some AngularJS last year. Each day I got introduced to a new technology/ methodology. From Monday to Friday, I taught myself Angular / Sass ( as well as Sass architecture) , BEM. I was also told to keep a track of users in anyway possible, with authentication. I chose to study Firebase, because fuck it. 
I honestly feel like I don't know anything, I'm mostly searching for answers and improvising if I can't find anything. I feel like I am learning tons, and my mentor is amazing. 

Usually when we start work, I dabble with something new and read the docs for 2-3 hours, after which he gives me some more assignments I could do, offering different solutions and what not.
On Friday, he told me that he thinks I have what it takes to be a programmer. I felt very happy, as it meant to me that the hard work I've put in the past year is finally starting to pay off.

If anyone has any advice to offer to a new intern, or any particular questions, I'd feel free to answer!"

Since there is no direct comparison of IBM with a unicorn, all the IBM posts on cscareerquestions just say positive things. My parents pay for my rent and tuition so I need to be careful about this conversation. As an out of state student, Lyft intern salary won't be enough to pay, even with student loans.

&amp;#x200B;

""'Take the internship,' they said. 'It'll be fun,' they said..."" Sam muttered to himself as he pushed away from his desk and got out of his maglev chair. Walking past the countless holographic projectors that lined the desks of the control room, the young man seemed to be making a bee line for the food synthesizer. Being that there never was anything of much importance happening that the United Earth Space Command was concerned about outside of routine cargo shipments and passenger craft, this control room, along with a hundred others around the globe, stayed silent. The only thing in the room that could keep Sam vaguely entertained were the constant flurry of multicolored trials and dots on the screens lining the room that marked the plethora of objects breaching Earth's atmosphere.

With a thought, Sam brought up the clock on his retinal contact terminal; 10:53 PM. Alright, just another hour and seven minutes until he can head home. It's a good thing he bought a nano-patch earlier today so that his body would repair itself and balance its hormones without requiring sleep. Then again, after having been awake for three days, the nanites from the patch were beginning to biodegrade. Nobody said this internship wouldn't be demanding. What has he been doing for three days, you may ask?

The planetary defense system in the year 2097 consists of 103 relay satellites in relatively stationary orbit to one another. In the event of a declaration of war either by or on planet Earth, the satellites are capable of using their neutron array to ionize the air between them and arrange the molecules into a rigid crystalline structure that spans the entire globe, capable of deflecting 3.8\*10\^19 joules per square kilometer; enough to effectively nullify even a fusion bomb detonated directly above Earth's atmosphere. In order to activate such a massive array, the UNSC has a series of dedicated quantum computers capable of decoding the initiation sequence code given the key from the Prime Minister.

However, as of midnight approximately four days ago, all of the satellites above the European Commissariate mysteriously went offline, rousing suspicions of an attack by the Forthmen, a radical anarchist group that surfaced after the unification of the world's governments during the climate crisis of 2060. It was obvious that there was a widespread quantum disturbance, as only devices that relied on quantum entanglement were rendered unusable. Quickly, the system was rebooted and the satellite circuitry replaced. In the following hours, both cyber and physical security was beefed up at federal institutions, and that included atmospheric traffic control centers; one of which Sam was interning at. Sadly, the shipment of security drones that the facility ordered wouldn't arrive from Luna until next week. So, while the higher-ups were figuring out something for Sam to do, he could suffice as a security guard in the meantime.

That brings us to today or, rather, tonight. *BEEP, BEEP, BEEP!* Sam was shaken from his thoughts by the piercing alarm. Sliding open the manifesting compartment of the synthesizer, he reached in and pulled out a decent helping of fettuccine alfredo along with the generic white plate it was generated in. Welp, it's time to get back to work; that game of chess wasn't going to play itself, even though it technically could.

As Sam sat back down in his chair and began establishing a neural link to the internet, he noticed something out of the corner of his eye. It was a red flashing symbol on the holographic monitor in front of him. Quickly swallowing his last bite of pasta, he put the plate down and expanded the alert. What could this possibly be? A perimeter breach? Maybe some sort of high-priority email?

One could say that Sam was closer with his former guess, as the screens around the room made an abrupt transition to display one of the colonies on Titan; Endeavor. Furthermore, there was a red figure outlined above said colony. With his curiosity piqued, the young man zoomed in on the figure with the holographic display in front of him. What used to be a red dot soon became what looked like-

""A ship?"" Sam blurted out in nobody's presence. At least, it looked vaguely like a ship. It was certainly no design that Sam had seen before; too elegantly curved to be Terran, yet too impractically designed to be Martian. The thing looked like an anemone; countless spindly limbs protruded out from a spherical center, any of which posed an obvious lack of structural integrity. Wanting to know more, Sam was quick to bring up various newsfeeds on the monitor in front of him. As his fingers whirred away on the holographic keyboard and the air in front of him was cluttered with browser windows, his suspicion was piqued. Not a single news broadcaster was even mentioning this rogue vessel above an inhabited planet.

Perhaps this was some sort of top-secret government operation that Sam was only able to witness because he happened to have access to a federal facility. Regardless of how he was seeing something that no other civilian knew about, there was nothing he could do. With a sigh, he sat back down in his maglev chair, picked up his bowl of pasta, and stared at the object highlighted in red as it made its way across the surround-screens and, apparently, Titan's orbit.

The red dot in the sky was back, only, this time, mankind was not going to let it go.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vek-shuul's anticipation grew with every step he took through the ship. Having been captain of this ship for more than 2,000 cycles, he knew his way around quite well, swooping through the narrows halls engineered to optimize space for the survey ship's long-range sensors and their respective generators. His neck frills we expanded to encompass almost the entire circumference of his head, a blatant display of his excitement. His six limbs carried his swiftly through another series of narrow corridors, lit only by strips of hyper-heated carbon. Finally, he reached the door to the bridge. As it de-materialized and the captain climbed the ramp leading into the command center, the expansive bridge itself was revealed. Six data analysis terminals lay in a hexagonal formation, looking in every direction from the center of the completely transparent semi-spherical chamber. Currently, with how the ship was oriented, the bridge's ground was parallel to the surface of the moon beneath them. Vek-shuul's presence was obviously noted as the six data analysts that manned each station promptly stood up and crossed their fore-limbs over their chests and bowed their heads toward the captain.

""Be relieved, brothers."" Vek's voice rang throughout the bridge, allowing the recruits to return to their jobs and the rhythmic beeps of computer prompts to fill the air once more. Vek-shuul made his way to the chair at the center of the hexagon and sat down, drinking in the beauty of his species' home galaxy once more. With a flick of his wrist, he motioned for his chair to initiate its antigravity, allowing him to float up into the semi-sphere and gaze below the horizon. However, he wasn't the only one who was able to enjoy this emulated immersion in deep space as his crew was quick to follow, circling around the bridge and performing system checks before the captain's inevitable next move. One of the recruits turned around in his chair and addressed the captain.

""My liege, subspace accelerators have been primed, inertial dampeners are at full capacity, and equipment has been secured. We are ready to move into observation,"" he stated.

Vek-shuul looked down and nodded. As he returned his gaze forward, he eagerly anticipated what was about to come into his view. His crew had been chosen to perform the progress cache of the genetically-engineered species known to his own species as Neuros. Granted, it has only been 5 millennia, so that was not the entirety of what had Vek so excited. On their way into the system, the crew had noticed peculiar heat and energy signatures from stellar bodies within the system that had no atmosphere at all. The only plausible explanation for this was, of course, that one of the hundreds of thousands of civilizations that had been seeded by Vek's species had expanded to this system undetected! Thus, it was unanimously decided to kill two birds with one stone and see what was happening elsewhere in the system, saving the most exciting inquiries (the homeworld of Neurons) for last.

In the midst of the captain's flashback, the ship's tendrils were storing energy and beginning to luminesce, indicating that the subspace accelerators had successfully gripped onto the fabric of the third dimension and were beginning to produce thrust. The captain's train of thought was broken as the twinkle of the night sky was drowned out by the light pollution that came into view. The grin on Vek-shuul's face only grew wider as the surface of the planet could finally be seen. The ship stopped rotating when the ground of the bridge was perpendicular to the surface of the planet, and the lights of the metropolis that was once beneath them now filled the frontal vision of the crew members; The crew members who were now all facing the same direction with gaping maws.

""H-how..."" a recruit could not help but inquire.

""It's magnificent! Energy usage readings are in the terawatt-hours! M'lord, th-this is beyond the capabilities of any cataloged species,"" another practically involuntarily chimed in.

""Wait, look! Those... those are-"" another recruit began, but was interrupted by the captain.

""Space elevators..."" Vek finished. Space elevators had been deemed an engineering impossibility tens of millennia ago when the strongest material to date was invented -- graphene. It was simply too expensive to produce and, although space elevators would ultimately decrease the rigors of surface-to-space transport, the construction of such a massive structure was deemed practically facetious by most. Now, of course, a majority of the captain's species resides in higher planes of existence as pure energy, but seeing a civilization achieve something that they could not was completely unheard of.

""Permission to launch drones for aerial surveillance, milord?"" the same recruit inquired.

""Granted, but do not fly below 80,000 epsels. On that note, uncover all close-range telescopes and focus them on that city. I want as many pictures as you can cram into those storage drives."" Vek quickly commanded.

""Of course, my liege."" the recruit replied before a dozen meter-wide probes were magnetically accelerated into orbit around Titan. Around the dome of glass that made up the bridge's structure, holographic screens popped up displaying the enhanced views of the moon's surface.

After observing the complexity of the city beneath them for a mere second, the captain looked down towards another recruit, similarly busy at his data console. ""You, transmit a message to Supreme Command. Tell them that we seem to have found a... wha..."" Vek-shuul trailed off as he noticed that the screens which once displayed elaborate vehicles and massive spires piercing the non-existent sky of the moon, connected to sprawling metallic complexes were now pitch black.

""I-it seems that our drones have lost connection, sire,"" a recruit sheepishly admitted.

""All of them?!"" Vek suddenly uproared, causing all 6 of the data analysts to recoil in their seats and make sure they are doing what they are supposed to be doing. ""What is the meaning of this?!""

""I b-believe that they were struck fr-"" one analyst began but was interrupted by another.

""My liege, we are receiving a transmission through short-wave radio! Really... short-wave radio. I don't think we've seen any signal as complex as this before, my liege!""

Vek-shuul's blood ran cold. It all made sense now; These are beings capable of interplanetary travel, so it would stand to reason that they may possibly possess the technology necessary to detect objects entering high orbit. They must have seen the drones as some sort of threat and seen no choice but to neutralize them. How foolish Vek and his crew had been. He gulped. ""Intercept the transmission.""

""My apologies, b-but our computers must figure out how to make sense of these signals."" the recruit curtly replied, a bit embarrassed at the apparently superior communication capabilities of these supposed primitives. The next two minutes were spent in near silence as blood pressures continued to climb with anticipation and the whir of the hard drives scribbling magnetic notes filled the chamber. Vek had some time to ponder.

Who *were* these people? They certainly weren't his own species but they had a technological understanding that rivaled his own, going so far as to surpass them in certain areas. There had been no words of such a species. Granted, these people may simply be a rogue faction of his own species, but then why would they opt to inhabit the same system as the Neuros? Were they simply a highly interested faction that wished to sacrifice their upper dimensionality to observe the real-time progress of the Neuros. Still, the designs and constructions... they were so massive and, quite frankly, alien in design. The modular manner with which things seemed to be attached to each other and the slick yet stately angles had not existed anywhere in the architectural history of Vek's species.

The captain's train of thought was, once more, interrupted as the screens around the room rematerialized and displayed the message. It seemed to be a video that was, somehow, transmitted through radio waves. As the picture began to form in front of the crew and captain, everyone's jaws dropped. In front of them, obscuring their view of the alien settlement, was the face of a human. The cherry on top was the audio that began to play. Apparently, they had managed to teach our computer their language through the waves, as well.

""*Greetings. We are humanity. We welcome you to the Sol System.*""

Vek and his crew were speechless. On the bright side, it seemed that Project Genesis was a success."
dk9y7w,289,2019-10-19,I finally did it! Unemployed for a year and took a risk that will pay off,henrymega,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dk9y7w/i_finally_did_it_unemployed_for_a_year_and_took_a/,"I've never posted here before but I want to share my story and hope it might help inspire some of you who went through similar situations or are still in the job hunt.

A little bit of background about me. I graduated in May 2018 with a Bachelors in Economics. During my undergraduate years, I didn't go out much nor did I really pursue any real opportunities. I did not hold a single job but was involved in some of the student clubs so I had that going for me. I spent a lot of my years in my room playing video games (I still do) and really avoided anything that could land me an internship because I was afraid of rejection. As a result, I didn't have a resume up until my junior year and at that point, I still was reluctant to look for things. Time went by fast and before I knew it, I was a senior with no internship experience and literally zero job experience in my life. I did have some activities though such as some of the clubs I was in but that was it. Alongside that, my GPA wasn't exactly the best, higher than a 3.0 but not by much.

After graduation, I started applying for jobs. I knew I wanted a job in the financial services or tech industry. Initially, I was a bit delusional and thought I could land a solid job but my expectations quickly faded as weeks went on without a single response back. After a month of applying endlessly, I realized that the job hunt process was tiring and brutal but I pushed on. I used LinkedIn, Indeed, and all sorts of different job boards to apply and look for jobs. I tried to get out at least 10 applications a day before I went back to playing video games and this went on until September of that year where I would get my first interview. Because I had no interview skills, I ended up not making it past the first round. Over the course of next few months, this cycle would repeat where I would send out many applications and maybe 1 would get back to me. Sometimes even after getting back to me, I would get ghosted or not do well on the interviews. This went on for sometime and I started feeling helpless as I had to start paying my loans and did not have the means to do so. The only positive side of all of this was that I was living at home and all the jobs I was applying for was in my city (NYC). Instead of applying for some retail jobs to make some money, I was determined to land something I wanted and kept sending applications out mindlessly.

By this point, roughly 7 months had passed by and I had several interviews but couldn't convert any to an offer. I did start to get pretty good at them but I still didn't know why I wasn't getting anything. I was getting desperate and embarrassed and I eventually looked into my school's one-year MBA program. I was worried because I had loans and my family was in a bad financial situation. However, my parents were very encouraging and after consulting a lot of my friends and family, I decided to pursue it. I saw it as a second chance to take all the opportunities I had missed as an undergrad but I knew I would have to really try for it.

I'm currently a few months in and I graduate from my program in May 2020. I have attended many different career events and have done a lot compared to what I had done as an undergrad. I finally have received an offer a few days ago and it feels like a huge boulder has been lifted off my shoulders. The offer exceeded my expectations and I couldn't be more happy with it.

I wanted to share this story because I know how brutal the whole job application can be. The last year had been hell for me but it did teach me a lot about the whole process. In the end, it really can be a numbers game and luck does play a factor. For those who are still out there looking, I want you to know that you're not alone. There will be always be up and downs and it takes a lot to push forward but at the end of the day, you only need to land one job. I know my story isn't unique but I know that some of you can relate and push forward. 

If there's anything you guys want to ask, feel free to shoot me a pm."

I've been debating this for a really long time, and looking for some advice. I'm a Junior in college, studying Computer Science at a really small school (not really well known for engineering). 

I currently have a return internship offer (Software Engineering Intern) at a smaller company (they have a website that gets \~46M page views a month) of about 50 people. From last summer, I know the work is great and the location is near my hometown. I love the team and casual culture.

I also have an offer from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co in Chicago for a Software Engineering Internship next summer. It definitely pays better, and I've never worked somewhere so large and far-reaching. However, I'm not sure whether to take it, as my concern is that I won't do as much meaningful work as I would at the smaller company. I was curious about the following factors:

1. Company prestige (will having JPMorgan on my resume make it easier to apply to other big tech companies?). Note that I am not set on moving to Chicago, so not sure if I would take a full-time offer from them yet.
2. Work environment at JPMorgan? (I don't want to be stuck around on a bad intern project / intern only team and not have the ability to learn from others).

Does anyone have experience with JPMorgan or have any advice about starting your career at larger vs smaller companies?"
dkaoki,0,2019-10-19,Help Needed,warkrry,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dkaoki/help_needed/,"So I am a third-year computer science student at Canadian University and I am an international student here. I recently got diagnosed with severe inattentive ADHD in summer because at that time I was suffering through severe depression and anxiety. I failed three courses in my winter term. Back home where I am originally from I had a lot of pressure from my parents to get good grades so I was pretty well but when I came to Canada everything changed my graph went low and especially when I was not able to get good grades and was not able to understand the fundamental computer science concepts deeply I really wanted to quit because I did not know what else to do. But now after medication and daily routine habits, my condition has improved a lot. It was a big jump I would say now I can study for hours and hours but only sometimes I will have focus issues but most of the time it's fine. Due to my poor academic background, it is really hard for me to get a coop even tho now I am doing really well in school. And as I told you as an international student it's hard for my parents to send me fees and especially when I am repeating some courses. Also by the third week of October, I have MSFT onsite interview pretty sure I won't be able to clear it if the technical question is leetcode medium but I would also appreciate it if I could get tips about that. It would be really great if someone in this group can help me land a coop/internship in America/Canada because now I can learn stuff I just want some time off from school where I can learn the stuff. I mean I still have knowledge of algorithms and data structure and kind of code as well but I want to have more deep knowledge so I am starting from scratch. If anyone could help me with my internship I would really appreciate."
dkb3z4,2,2019-10-19,Feeling a bit lost,Ryzai-GUY,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/dkb3z4/feeling_a_bit_lost/,"I am not really stressed out since I know in the end ill be fine. But I am greatly concerned about my options about the future with my computer science degree and much more about my intellectual capacity. I am currently a senior at my university pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science, but I am taking junior-level classes (graduating 2 years late). I feel like computer science isn't for me. I like and enjoy learning the material, but the problem for me is that every single little thing is a huge learning curve, I am constantly always doing homework/studying and always attending all of my professors' office hours since I can never for the life of me do any assignment on my own, and this greatly concerns me. What I more precisely mean is that I can never solve things on my own, and I don't really like the idea of building apps and websites for people's validation. (Save me the discussion about major decision, it's already too late for me to switch majors, the school wont let me.)

I chose computer science because I was very introverted my freshman year and had no problem with never interacting with people. Well that all changed now, and I love associating myself with people in general and I feel that in computer science all I ever do is sit behind a computer all day and struggle for hours. (I don't mind it too much because I actually do enjoy the material and concepts, I dont hate it).

I have zero outside experience since I never have time for myself due to my assignments and I refuse to deprive myself of sleep and putting my health at risk (did that for 3 years and was constantly depressed, now I have a strict routine for working out, eating healthy, and sleeping). The only good thing I've got going for me is a part time security analyst job that I just started working at. I am worried if I'll ever be able to get a decent job with little to no outside experience and a terrible GPA of 2.5. Although I am currently a part of our school's National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (just started this semester), and also am part of a AutoDrive Challenge that's sponsored by GM (general motors) and SAE Internationals. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried joining clubs (currently part of cybersecurity which seems to be my major interest at the moment) and doing  hackathons (when I realized I dont like software development), I do have a huge network seems I would like to consider myself pretty charismatic.

&amp;#x200B;

I've applied to at least 80+ internships from software dev and cybersecurity and only three interviews with no luck.

If I have terrible problem solving skills but am willing to put in the work, will my work be rewarded? I feel like no matter how much work I put in even more than my peers, my limitation to problem solving is always gonna be the death of me and no company will want to hire me."

Two companies, Google and Apple, both require me to sign prior inventions disclosures. 

1. Should I include any of my projects, whether past or current, in them? Meaning, is it better to keep an invention a secret?

2. If so, how extensive should my answers be?

Any other tips would be greatly appreciated. I intend to turn my current projects into businesses after/during completing my internships, but I don't currently have any formal businesses set up. Thanks!"

As the title reads, I'm currently a digital forensics major graduating from a state school this coming May. With the way I took courses in high school, I'm finishing a year early. As the date to walk across the stage is approaching, I've been getting really anxious and stressed out thinking towards the future.

Even though I'm a senior, I never landed an internship; it wasn't something on my radar in high school, and since I did a year of community college then transferred, I didn't consider until I was a junior. I feel like a lot of organizations hire mostly interns, but I am not really sure myself.

Additionally, I don't know what types of jobs to be looking for that are considered entry level. I'm open to other IT positions, and am not fully sure if DFIR is exactly what I want to do yet. I like the idea of system administration and doing troubleshooting, and working with people Given that my program focuses around that, though, I don't know if I have the technical skills or expertise fitting for other positions.

I have been working since 16 in retail and service, so I think that I have strong soft skills. It's just that I don't really know where to look moving forward and really feel that not getting an internship is going to wind up with me graduating, then taking a help desk job that I could've had three years ago.

Lastly I wanted to add that on the side I've only messed around with rooting my phone, vms, simple stuff like that.

Any tips or resources to look more into would be greatly appreciated, and thank you to whoever reads this."

I'm a freshman in college and right now is the time where many of us are looking for housing options. I really want to live off-campus for my second year because it's cheaper than on-campus housing, living in an apartment would be a new experience, and living in upperclassmen dorms is based on a ""lottery selection"" (sort of), and there are some not-so-good halls that I may end up at which I don't want to end up at. My hallmates, who I'm pretty chill with, are opting for housing off-campus (aka apartments). A lot of people from my Christian organization have also reserved apartments as well. There's a guy who wants to share an apartment with me but I had to keep holding him off to gain my parents' approval (**which therefore, ultimately may have been my fault for asking my parents for permission to live in an apartment next year**). I asked my parents today and they said no, but I didn't really remember what they said about why. So I FaceTime my mom again, and she explains to me that since my dorm is a mess that I should abstain from living in an apartment my second year. **At least what she says is fair, for now.**

Yes, I will admit that my dorm was a mess so far, but I didn't really find the time to clean it up because I had to do schoolwork, I had to spend time at clubs, and I had to spend time with friends. Well, I will also admit that I am kind of a lazy person so I could have spent time cleaning up my room instead of watching YouTube.

Anyway, I'm still FaceTiming my mom. She goes on a tirade of how my messiness reflects my ""immaturity"" and how apartment-mates are going to ""hate"" me for being a mess. Honestly, I think it's something I can work on.

**Now here's where the bullshit begins.** I'm already mad at my parents' denial of my plead to live off-campus, but I get even more mad when my mom bring up the ""you play too much, you should be spending time studying instead."" I rationalize and mention how I NEVER went to a single party BUT one where I only had like THREE -- NOT EVEN THREE -- equivalent shots and that was it (it wasn't even a party honestly, it was just a hangout -- I did not mention that one party because I didn't want to be killed). I tell my mom that I spend time studying for exams, spend time working out, spend time at clubs and spend time with friends overall. Then she starts bringing up, ""why are you not applying for internships? why are you not applying for scholarships?"" At this point she totally detracted from the main subject of the conversation.

Okay first of all, not that many freshmen get an internship or even apply for one, and two, even if I am applying for any, I'm only applying to like three, max five, contrary to the something-like-twenty-to-fifty my parents want me to apply to.

She then checks my school email -- which I reluctantly had to give to her -- and scrolls through the emails my lazy ass never read. She finds out that I missed some deadlines and starts getting super Asian mom mode on me, going on a prolonged diatribe.

""Why are you looking at housing and not internships?""

""\*Family friend's son\* lives on a dorm on-campus! What about him?""

""You play too much, go study! Apply for internships!""

""We paid five hundred dollars for your A+ certification and you're not even doing it!""

""We did everything for you! We took you to a Korean restaurant and bought you apples!""

Yes, I will admit that she is right on certain points. What drives me insane is that her intention is to make my life miserable by disconnecting me from my friends and turning me into a workaholic who only thinks that money brings happiness. What do you want from me, mom? To never hang out with my friends again? To only apply for internships in my first year? (Ik I'm exaggerating but it's just the way I feel rn bc I'm so mad)

And what makes me even more insane is that she thinks I'm incapable of carrying a good conversation and that I'm ""talking like a baby"" when I'm bringing up rational arguments."

dkhe5r,10,2019-10-20,Everybody in this sub is making me scared of QA jobs and I would love some career advice from people who are more knowledgeable about this...,dataStructures4Life,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dkhe5r/everybody_in_this_sub_is_making_me_scared_of_qa/,"It's a weird coincidence. Recently I had an interview with a really well known semiconductor and microcontroller company and I didn't really realize it was a QA position until I did the interview.


For reference, I am graduating as a computer engineer this December and I am in a major US city (not San Francisco or West coast or anything). I had worked as an intern at a Fortune 100ish company that is a really well known tech company based in the US this past summer and it was mostly QA. I was writing automation scripts and my whole job was programming which is something of course I wanted to do.


As you all know, finding that first full time job after college is stressful. I've been Leetcoding like crazy and I have been applying to a lot of places and I have been getting call backs for actual developer positions, but the company that I just interviewed really seemed to wanted me on board.


I did the interview and it was great. It seemed like everyone liked me, I got tested on data structure questions, multi-threading, and typical computer science questions and I answered pretty much all the answers correctly. It looks like I will get an offer because I talked to HR and everything already, but it's pretty much a QA job. I think I got a call back from them because what I did at my internship is really damn similar to what they want me to do at this job I interviewed very recently for.



My end goal is not QA. I want to be a software/engineer developer, but I don't know if taking QA jobs will hurt my career or not. I don't know if I should work in QA and then hop on another actual developer job after about a year or if I'm stuck in QA land for the rest of my life. I've been reading QA related posts here and it seems that this is what people are saying and it's getting me worried. I don't know if I even should put the words ""Quality Assurance"" on my resume because it might hurt me finding a real developer job or what.



What should I do ? I really need to start working when college is done as soon as possible and I feel like I really don't have the luxury to be picky this early in my career. Do you all recommend that I just take the first job I can get and then hop on a higher paying developer non-QA job after that or what ? I got lucky with the internship I had because it is such a well known tech company and it has lead me to getting a lot of calls and such but unfortunately it was a QA internship and it was my first gig. Should I take the words quality assurance off my resume ?



For the people who have been in the industry and have a great career, what do you all recommend ? I just want to be financially successful doing a developer/engineering job and I'm getting the vibe that QA jobs are seen as ""easier"" or something. I could be overthinking here but I would love some advice.


Thanks !"

Long time lurker coming out the cracks to ask the hive-mind that is Reddit for some help setting the trajectory of my life, getting some realistic ideas for goals and any other thoughts and insights. I will definitely feedback results into the reddit community.

**About me**

I’m a male that is going to be 30 soon with have no kids or GF. I am still living in my parental home, have an average amount of savings in the bank (enough to travel for a few months), live in a dull city in England and work in a unfulfilling IT job.

**Recent Background and Adversity**

After university (22) I came back to a horrible disaster that was my parents’ divorce in 2012. I’ll spare you the details but things got unbelievably hectic and they essentially waged a full on war against each other until about 2016 - I was caught in the middle and faced much abuse from both. The stress over such a long period of time took a hefty toll on me and I started suffering panic attacks, depression and GAD but I have managed to get it a bit more under control in the last year or so. My employment as a result has been pretty spotty, with two big gaps between 2014- 2016 and 2016-2018.

During this period (2012-2016) I tried my best to get a graduate job and leave my parental home but my presence of mind and luck just wasn’t there at all. So whilst everyone was moving up the ladder I was seriously falling behind my peers. 

**My Solution**

I decided to self-teach higher mathematics and programming from around 2014 whilst unemployed, my goal was basically to start a career up in Software Development and live my young life in London. The closest I came to obtaining this goal was that I eventually got a 6 month internship in 2016 at a startup as a Web Developer but it went under by early 2017; this left me unemployed again until October 2018. So the past year (Oct 2018-present) I managed to get stable employment in an IT job in my home town, put some savings and get into really good physical shape.

**Problem**

I detest my job, it’s so unfulfilling and I struggle to bring myself to work every day. They lied I would be developing software but I’m doing 90% IT work and now my programming skills are atrophying and the skills I use are not transferable. I am no longer ‘young’ (despite looking 22 still \[honestly\]), making it increasingly harder for me to get into what I originally intended to get into in 2014.

The crux of my current dilemma is that I don’t have a clear idea of what I want and what is viable for me anymore. Before I was so sure I wanted to live in London but as I get older I feel like I am less likely and seem to have a decreasing desire to pursue Software Development. My desire is waning primarily because all my efforts to get a job and move since 2014 really haven’t been that fruitful. 

The main reason I wanted to move to London originally was so that I could grow with my friends, as a person and be young in a cool city. However, now most of my friends have outgrown me and I am pretty socially isolated, which for an extrovert is pretty depressing.

I’m all for a phoenix like transformation/rebirth, i.e. burning off my old goals and redefining them but I have no idea what direction to go in now? One thing is for certain, I don’t want to stay in this city and in this job.

**Some vague insight into what I want**

I want to travel and see the world so much, particularly Japan. I see a few problems with this though; one, I have nobody to go with :( and two, I fear travelling would create another big employment gap. Maybe working on a business idea remotely or getting a job abroad would be great, that way I wouldn’t develop another gap? But I doubt that my chances of getting employed into a decent job abroad is any more/less likely than in England.

**Hobbies &amp; Interests**

* Fitness &amp; Sports (weight lifting, track)
* Boxing
* Mathematics
* Programming
* Reading
* Anime
* Socialising
* Music
* Popular Science

&amp;#x200B;

**Strengths &amp; Character Traits**

* Good teacher
* Good technical mind (maths &amp; programming)
* Social skills
* Open minded
* Patient
* Enjoy discussing ideas
* Empathetic
* Good critical thinker
* Funny

*I will edit in weaknesses if commenters want to know*

**Things I’m doing to improve my life**

* Exercising regularly.
* Saving money.
* Already passed driving test but haven’t driven in years, so getting refresher lessons.
* Reading.
* Trying to find time to study programming with varying degrees of success.

Sorry for the length of this post, I really need some help though. Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: I’m going to be 30 and after some life adversity I have no idea what trajectory to take my life in and what my options are given who I am.

The moment that I climaxed inside my intern, I knew that I had made a huge mistake. Most men know the feeling of deep shame after getting their rocks off. I was no different. Not only was I married, but the woman I had just fucked was my subordinate. I owned the law firm she interned at, so I wasn’t worried about losing my position. But I could eventually get sued up the ass if I failed to keep this girl happy.

Maybe it was all this guilt and self loathing, but she looked different after I had came. She resembled myself. Its hard to describe. I could have sworn her eyes were green before but now they matched my blue eyes. She looked older. She was twenty four but now she looked forty-four. I recognized the wrinkles on her face as my own. Her hair looked thinner, as if she would be as bald as I, given a few years. Maybe I was just projecting my guilt onto this woman. After all, she was gorgeous before the intercourse. 
I got up and began make an exit from my office, leaving my intern, Rachel, to clean herself up. It was late and we were the only ones in my building. 

“where are you going, Robbie?”

“I have to use the men’s room.” I replied

“should I just let myself out then?”

“Do you want me to call you an uber?”

“no, I…I drove to work today.” she said flatly, almost disappointed.

The first thing I did when I got to the bathroom was to check for hickies on my neck. Luckily there was only lipstick but none on my white dress shirt.
I got most of the lipstick off, but as much as I scrubbed, I couldn’t get the perfectly lip-shaped stain off of my neck. I soaked my neck and rubbed at it with soap until my neck was red and raw. Still no luck. 

I couldn’t be out much longer without arousing suspicion from my wife, so I covered my mark of shame with the collar of my shirt. 
On the drive home, I reminisced on the good times I had with my wife. I can’t believe I cheated on her. She was the most glorious woman I have ever met.

I met my wife, Renee, at a market festival during a trip to Chicago. She had a booth where she performed tarot card readings. I was immediately stricken by her mahogany eyes and her dark complexion. She had long black hair that was meticulously braided in intricate patterns. I had the feeling that most of her clients weren’t actually interested in tarot cards. I’m not ashamed to admit that I was one of those. 

Before I even got home, I knew that I was busted. Renee always had a way of knowing things, she won every argument and managed to get her way in any dispute. It was charming when it wasn’t aimed at me. After marrying Renee, I noticed a series of strange coincidences. They were mostly little things. Whenever we had an argument, some outside source would make her win. For example, I wanted to watch Law and Order, she wanted to watch reruns of The Golden Girls. Coincidentally the channel that aired Law and Order quit working for the exact allotted time that her show was on. 

I recall another time when I wanted to go to Hawaii and Renee wanted to go to the Bahamas. Coincidentally a hurricane hit Hawaii, cutting off all flights for the exact duration of our allotted vacation time. One time I bought a German Shepherd when Renee wanted a poodle. Coincidentally our German shepherd got hit by a car. 
 
Sure enough, when I finally got home, Renee sat waiting for me in the shadows on a love seat. 

“Was it worth it?” She asked flatly.

How had she known? Was she tracking my phone records? All these thoughts went racing through my head as I stumbled over my words. As much as I tried to think quick on my feet, I had nothing. So, I did the only thing I could, after mumbling some gibberish: I bowed my head in shame, and replied “No.”
The following weeks were the most quiet of our entire marriage. We did not speak of my infidelity. I slept in the spare bedroom, contemplating the ramifications of my actions. Renee spent all her spare time in her study at work on god knows what. 

The thought occurred to me that she might also have a lover on the side. As hypocritical as this sounds, it filled be with jealous rage. If I was correct, I would be vindicated in my indiscretion. This vivisected my emotions. Part of me wanted her to be guilty of my same crime. The other part of me would have been devastated if she had done unto me that which I had done to her.
I decided to wait for her to leave the house before snooping around in her office. Maybe I could search through her emails and find evidence of infidelity. She must have dug through my emails and texts, otherwise how else would she have known of my affair? I kept the residual lipstick mark on my neck covered with high collared shirts at all times, so there was no way that she saw that. I was completely baffled. 

Upon entering her study, I found a room that was a mess with books and papers. All these bore strange symbols and some were written in languages that I could not even place let alone understand. These ancient and foreboding volumes were splayed out deliberately, so I tried my best not to disturb them. 
The most recently read of these tomes sat open on her desk with her keyboard cast aside. A highlighted passage spoke of immortality and rejuvenation. I could barely comprehend most of the material, but it entailed human sacrifice in order to achieve immortality. The books may have been convoluted but I knew that my life was in danger. I knew it sounded crazy and paranoid, but the thoughts persisited.

Now this might be a far- fetched conclusion to reach, but what else was I supposed to think? Considering all the strange coincidences that had always let Renee get her way, was witchcraft or sorcery so unbelievable? I saw my side piece wither into a hag before my eyes. And the lipstick that still stained my neck had no other explanation. Witchcraft would explained how she automatically knew that I had cheated on her. Either I was completely insane or Renee was manipulating my life in ways that I could not understand. This was worse than cheating. Meddling with the laws of nature and reality was cheating God. At least, that’s what I told myself.
I left Renee’s study with a lot to ponder. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions but I was seriously freaked out. When Renee got home the first thing she asked was, 

“Have you been in my office?”

Renee hadn’t even entered her office before asking me the question. So I lied. I knew full-well that she knew I was lying. 
Later that evening I heard a crash only to find Renee standing over what had once been a statue. It wasn’t just any statue, it was a one of a kind work of art that had been in my family’s possession for generations. 

“It was an accident.” 

she said this, but I knew she was lying. Not wanting to cause a fight, I began to clean it up, but she insisted on taking care of it. 
The next morning, the statue was as good as new and back where it belonged. Now I was starting to get terrified. There were no signs that it had been broken to begin with. Even worse was the implication that this could have been part of some spell. Don’t witches need a prized possession or a lock of hair to cast hexes on people? Seeing as I had gone bald ages ago, this sacrifice and rejuvenation of one of my prized possessions did not bode well. I felt like I was losing my mind. 

Upon asking her about it, all she said was,  “I took care of it.”

I tried prying further but her only response was, 

“I told you I would take care of it and I did.”

The more I thought about this, the more I became suspicious of all the odd things that have happened over the years. All these coincidences didn’t add up. The lipstick mark on my neck, the shattered yet renewed statue, and the marked pages concerning human sacrifice. I felt like my life was in danger. What was I supposed to do? I couldn’t go to the cops. They wouldn’t believe me. And would my wife admit to contemplating human sacrifice? I doubt it. 
What I did, I did with the best intentions. I concluded that If she wasn’t going to sacrifice me, she would have sacrificed somebody else. She was plotting murder and I knew it. So, after a considerable amount of booze, I smothered Renee in her sleep before she could harm anyone or anything else. I buried her and her vile books in my vast estate. She had no job, no other friends and no relatives. No one would go looking for her.

I had to drink myself to sleep that night. I’m not a monster. Killing my wife was the hardest thing that I had ever done. It would be a burden that I would have to carry for the rest of my life.
As I drank I remembered all the good times we had. I tried pushing the thoughts out of my mind but my attempts proved futile. My only option was to drink until my brain was too inebriated to process my depression and feelings of iniquity. 

The following morning, I awoke to a searing headache, and then there was the realization of what I had done the night before. Oh god. I killed my wife. I didn’t know for a fact that she was a witch. Sure she had some strange books and behaved oddly but that didn’t make her a witch. Even if she was a witch, was it my place to kill her?
At first I blamed the alcohol for both my actions and my headache, but strangely, I was starving. Usually hangovers left me nauseated, and guilt had never left me with a healthy appetite. I noticed that my headache seemed to get better as I approached food. It was like an odd game of hot and cold. If I stepped away from the food, my headache would come right back to me. So I found that eating was the only way to fend off that awful migraine.

I tried leaving my house but the headache became unbearable. I couldn’t even make it to my car. When I got back inside I heard Renee’s voice clear as day saying, 
“Stay.”

The voiced seemed to resonate within my massive home. Holy shit! Fear made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. Son of a bitch, she must have hexed me or something. Or was I just paranoid? Maybe it was fear of upsetting the ghoulish voice, or maybe it was my ravenous hunger, but I spent the rest of the day inside, eating. 

The next morning I woke to blindness in my left eye. Of course this understandably scared the living shit out of me. I could feel my eye moving around, looking in all directions except for the direction that I willed it. After waving my hand in front of my face like it was a cure for blindness, I went to the bathroom to check it out in the mirror. My eye was darting back and forth, looking at everything. Even worse, my eye wasn’t blue like it normally was. Instead my eye was a dark shade of mahogany. I could have recognized that eye anywhere; It was Renee’s eye.

Concerned, I immediately picked up the phone to call for an ambulance but was met with yet another incapacitating headache. It was so bad that I couldn’t even dial the three numbers that I needed for 911. Again I heard the voice of my head, “Eat.” 
The headache and hunger outweighed my horror but I tried fighting the urge to eat nonetheless. I fought the headache until I lost consciousness. When I came to, I was on my bed, surrounded by snacks. There was an assortment of opened food packages that looked as if they were half devoured by an animal. My face and hands were sticky with whatever I had been eating while I was out cold.

I was horrified. Even worse, I was losing hope. There was no fighting what was happening to me. My heart was racing but whatever this ailment was, it gave me no other choice but to sit back and take the passenger seat to my own demise. I gave in to the instructions of the only woman I had ever loved. I consumed mass quantities of calories until I passed out again.
	
The following day I woke with a massive pimple on the far side of my left temple, near my ear. It was the size of a quarter. It bulged out in a bright yellow, surrounded by red irritated flesh. I was met with pure anguish upon touching the thing. There was no way that I would be able to pop it. Something under the pimple moved around like there was a creature living within.
 	
I could see two holes forming on my left cheek. Like the rest of my abnormalities, they were painful to touch, but I could feel air on my wrist, breathing out as I exhaled. The flesh surrounding these holes was malformed and pinkish white in color, like a scar. The deformed skin stretched from my lower cheek to my temple. The holes would dilate and contract every once in a while and mucus dripped continuously from them. I had to perpetually wipe them clean whenever I could withstand the pain. 
 
I felt two tender bulges forming on my chest and back. I could see the lump on my chest clearly. It was at shoulder height and had five wart-like protrusions. While these lumps hurt, they didn’t compare to the pain that my head caused me. The things were wet, staining my shirts with a yellow fluid that crusted up as it dried.
I was terrified. What kind of curse did this bitch put on me? What I did was in self defense! I didn’t deserve this! 
	
I noticed longer periods of those blackouts. I would be out cold for longer stretches of time. Days seemed to flash by in spurts of anguished consciousness. Each time I awoke, I noticed more disturbing changes to my body. 

I woke one morning, pus dripping down my face. Upon inspection, I found a scab running across the pimple near my temple. It began to split and tear until it opened up completely. What I thought was a pimple, split to reveal another mahogany eyeball. It rotated sickeningly, the pus pooling at the base of my new eyelid. I now had three eyes and only one was my own. The newly formed third eye itched like crazy, but every time I touched it, pure agony engulfed my entire head.

The two holes on my left cheek grew in size along with the irritated flesh surrounding it. This continued until the meat of my cheek formed into a nose. It looked malformed but soon grew into the perfectly cute button nose that Renee once had. 

The left side of my mouth began to sag and stretch towards my left ear. A second pair of lips swelled on the edges of my skewed mouth. Spare teeth penetrated my gums at odd angles, forcing my own teeth to fall out. A lump the size of a golf ball ballooned at the left of my chin. This made room for more teeth to form from within my mouth.
 
The two lumps on my back and chest sprouted into tiny arms that increased in size with every passing day. These parasitic limbs moved and twitched of their own accord. This made wearing a shirt impossible but that was the least of my worries. I couldn’t trim the nails on the hands without pain. So as these limbs writhed around, they scratched, pinched and swatted at me every few minutes. I couldn’t lie down on my stomach or back without crushing the frail looking abnormalities. 

My legs, once plump with fat, withered into a slender feminine form. They struggled to carry my plump upper body. Again this was the least of my concern as I had lost all control over them. They would carry me to the kitchen from time to time if I made the effort to push myself up. Otherwise they kicked, spasmed and acted as a nuisance whenever possible. 

My genitals, something I once took great pride in, turned a sickly shade of grey. They shriveled up like a frightened turtle. I noticed scabs forming around the base of my cock and ballsack. These wounds, like the rest of my body, looked infected and dripped the same yellow fluid as the rest of my lacerations. The scabs began to peel before my junk fell off completely. This was just the first part of my body to rot and fall off.

I felt my arms get weaker as they shriveled in a similar fashion as my genitals. My left arm was the first to go. I lost mobility in it sometime before it happened. It sagged vestigially for a few days. The flesh on my arm decayed and flaked off until I saw bone. I accidentally shoulder checked a doorway and then heard a wet thump on the floor behind me. I didn’t even notice my arm was gone except for the sudden feeling of weightlessness in my shoulder. 

That’s why I am writing this journal. I want someone to know what happened to me.

Part II: Renee 
I found this Robert’s journal. I think I will keep it for myself. In fact it’s the only thing I will keep from this marriage besides the money. Our relationship was doomed from the moment that I hexed my husband. I knew that I had made a huge mistake. I just never thought he would throw everything we had away for some  whore. Robert was my world. A lot of people assumed I married him for his wealth, and I’m not going to lie, it did add to his charm. 


Our problems only started when he began to drift away from me as I grew older. It’s like he lost interest in me as soon as my body began to show signs of age.
I knew that he was falling for his intern, so I cursed him. I only made his guilt visible to himself. No one else saw these manifestations. No matter how insignificant the spell was, he was terrified of me after that. He wouldn’t even sleep in the same bed as me. I forgave him for his moment of weakness but he still wouldn’t trust me. The irony was painful. 

I decided to try to make myself young again for him. Maybe then he would love me as he used to. Unfortunately the only suitable spells that I could find required a price that I was not willing to pay: a human life. 

I was foolish. I tried tweaking the magic in every way imaginable to make it work without spilling blood. I did every other step that the spell required, only attempting to sacrifice things of great value, instead of a human life: like Robert’s precious little statue, for example. I was hoping that destroying something of great significance would at least remove some wrinkles. But sorcery isn’t like baking, you can’t just mix and substitute ingredients.

My death must have completed the spell and in turn started a chain reaction. As I slowly took over Robert’s body and mind, I finally realized the ramifications of my actions. This wasn’t an enchantment to bless yourself with immortality. The spell granted eternal youth to whoever was initially sacrificed. 
To this day I don’t completely understand it. Maybe it was because I meddled with the spell. Or maybe I just didn’t comprehend the texts correctly. I honestly am not surprised by the outcome though, as most dark magic has some sort of monkey’s paw ironic twist.

I was almost fully restored to my younger self but it was torture seeing Robert like this. I had to accept that he murdered me. How could I still have feelings for a man who murdered me? What the fuck was wrong with me? He was already as good as dead. But I already missed him. If we would have had better communication, then this whole mess wouldn’t have happened. It pains me to see him go, but at the same time a huge weight had been lifted from my shoulders. Robert was an adulterous murderer. Does such a man deserve compassion? I will leave that for god to decide. 

I had tried my best to keep him unconscious as often as I could. I tried making him eat as much as possible to quicken my growth. I had little control over my growing parts. Once my legs were formed, I was able to maneuver them on my own accord but even that was difficult.

Do I wish things had ended differently? Of course I do, but he made his choices. Even so, I wanted to end his suffering as soon as possible. I’m not some merciless monster after all. So I took a knife and shucked the remaining bits of him off my beautifully rejuvenated body. Now he can lay in the grave that he dug for me."

dkqrjv,19,2019-10-20,Should I quit my job with no plan? Is it really as liberating as everyone says?,nicolelynn21094,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dkqrjv/should_i_quit_my_job_with_no_plan_is_it_really_as/,"I’m 25 and have been working at McDonald’s since I was 18. It was a steady income while in school. 

Fast forward 7 years and I’m still with the company as a General Manager. I worked my way up and held every management position until I was at the top. All while getting a Master’s in Sport Administration.

Two years ago, I took the big promotion and became GM of a low volume store. I still had one semester left of grad school. Everything in me didn’t want to take on the heavy responsibility of being a GM but I knew that I could grow from this experience.

The store was under performing. I built a management team, increased sales, and increased our customer satisfaction score...
The store became my baby and I succeed in my position. I completed my degree and decided to take the time to stay with the company. I made a living and had stability after being busy nonstop for 6 years. 

My team and I worked in this oldest store of the company, which could make our job very difficult most days as we worked with limited equipment. There was a light at the end of the tunnel....we had a remodel coming up. I had plans for this new store. I had started considering making a career move but this new store was giving me fulfillment. I had to see this through. I changed this store around and now my team could work up to their potential with fewer limitations. 

While the store is down for remodel, my staff and I have been placed in other stores. I got the chance to work in my original store with familiar faces, which was great. Until I got a call that a GM had walked out and the company needed my help until they found a replacement. I was promised that I would return to my store.

A week into being at this new store, I was told I would be staying. This news was heartbreaking to me. This store is underperforming and is currently one of the companies, “problem stores”. I was also told I had time to think about it but when I sat down with the new supervisor, it was clear I had no choice.

I was honest with them. Everything in my gut says to run and says I will not last in this new store. Their response was “give us 6 months”. 

This store is “on fire”. Everything about it on an operational level needs work. Also, the customers are rough. In all my years in customer service, I have never seen customers act like this. Screaming, cursing, throwing iced coffee at my employee. The company put me here because of my track record of success and they want me to view it as a promotion. 

I’ve never felt so hopeless when it comes to my career. My stomach has been it knots for almost two weeks. I can not eat. I can not sleep. Knowing that I have to go in to this mess, makes me sick. It also gives me guilt, this is part of the business, isn’t it? Everyone has to move eventually. 

I lost my store. I lost my team. I lost my new store plans. This was never meant to be my career. I took the stability route and stayed much longer than I expected.

I don’t live in an area where there is a flourishing amount of job opportunities. My undergrad was Communications an again, Master’s in Sport Administration. Lately I’m regretting my schooling choices as I feel I’ll never get out...

To get the point, everything in my gut and mind is saying to put a two week in and hope that I get an offer. To take one of those jumps and that so many talk about...I have money saved up and could get by for a bit..
I have even considered trying to wait tables until I find my new career but I am realistic that may not look great on a Resume...

This was never my permanent career. It does not even require a degree. I went to school for six years and had two internships along the way...I know I am leaving, I guess I just didn’t expect it to happen now. 

Today was my day off and I didn’t even want to get out of bed...I think this post is helping me clear my head a bit...the thought of another week in this store is just wearing me out...

Saturday was one of the worst days I have ever worked and the only thing that kept me from walking out and never looking back was the employees. I couldn’t leave them like that. In that moment, I didn’t even consider the loss of money or losing my ability to come back to the company...I just wanted the mental relief of moving on.

Is it time to take a leap? I’m so scared but everything is telling me to put in my notice tomorrow and hope that things will work out for me."

I don't know if I should go for a start-up early in my career because when I reflect on my past internship at a start-up, I was constantly stressed (I'm OK with this) but I wasn't really learning much from my co-workers.  I felt like I didn't know what the hell I was doing and when I tried to ask co-workers for help, they didn't know what to do and told me ""good luck with that"".  I often felt lonely because everyone was too busy with their own crap.  Then I compare my workload to what the full-time engineers had and they seemed understaffed and overworked.  I came in with the expectation that I would receive some type of training or educating but that didn't happen.  Felt like I was expected to immediately start being productive for that company.  However, I did feel that my contributions (however small) were listened to and that the work I did was varied (I enjoyed being able to wear multiple hats). However, I felt very VERY underqualified for the work I was trying to do.  

So, I've been doing my research and it seems that people say WLB is much better at a big company and that you will actually receive training due to them having more resources.  However, I also hear that since there are more employees in each department, the work you do can be much more limited and you might just work on a very tiny feature that may not be implemented at all.

What should I be expecting from each?"

BS in IT. I've been looking at desired skills and I'm a little overwhelmed.

Currently studying for Network+ and Im thinking about the A+ aswell. I only have so much time so I'm trying to figure out what I should focus on.

There is Active Directory, SQL, Excel, Outlook, Linux, Powershell, etc.

Its a little overwhelming. I've studied a lot over my degree and dont feel that confident of my knowledge in things I've studied like AD and SQL.

I only have so much time between school, my job, my internship, and applying and hopefully interviewing for jobs. My internship is focused on Argos for creating reports...

Im thinking about spending my spare time studying for both the Network+ and A+, because If I graduate this fall without a job yet then getting those should get me much more interview Id imagine.

Thoughts? Just struggle to know what to focus on. I'm just am looking for an entry job that pay $15-18 or more so I can get experience."

I am currently 24 and a law/international business student. A string of stupid decisions and friends on the past few years resulted in my failing alot of uni subjects and delaying my course of a few years. I have a job in retail but no real friends, hobbies or even a girlfriend before. I think my life is alright compared to others more unfortunate than me but my family thinks otherwise.

My parents are Chinese and have always expected a lot from me. They expect me to have a law graduate job and earn big bucks. They expect to show up to family gatherings and show off about my prestigious status, which it is not. They don't give permission for anything outside the 'sensible' line like a motorcycle. 

After I told them that I wouldn't return to a law interns hip because I like the retail job I had been working at for a few years, they started to show signs that they look down on my. E.g they would always complain I don't give them enough money, I won't be able to buy a house etc

My brother is a accountant who earns over 100k a year and he is the same age. He even thinks I'm shit and always tries to combat me with his success. E.g. He kept singing when I was trying to study and I asked him to stop. Keeps singing, I ask him to shut up and he tells me to get some friends and real job. And he always boasts about how much money he makes/gives to my parents and talks shit about mutual friends and how they are failing at life

It just sucks that I feel like my own family looks down on me just because of my job.

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/cgx1sn/nontarget\_to\_f100\_analyst\_keep\_your\_head\_up\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/cgx1sn/nontarget_to_f100_analyst_keep_your_head_up_you/) 

Background

I was in the Navy for 8 years and at a point where I felt I had not more room for growth and I was getting tired of missing family events and not being home. I got my degree online from a reputable school but had no internships (3.7 GPA). My job in the Navy did have some finance experience and I got to work with the comptroller at my last command which was a great introduction into the world of finance and accounting. I decided to start my process for separation and applying for jobs a year in advance just to get some feedback and prepare to transition to a new life. I got some positive reviews and felt confident to separate and began my job search in a new career field. 

Job Search

I began applying for jobs like crazy on various platforms such as LinkedIn, Glassdoor (worst one with outdated job postings), and Indeed. I wasn't hearing much feedback and began to let doubt settle in. Rather than let depression get the best of me I decided to take a long hard look at both my resume and LinkedIn profile. I would say this was the turning point in my search. You really need to take your time on your resume and it can't be the same for every job you apply for. I went back to my military experience where we have to quantify everything we do for evaluations and did that for my resume. For LinkedIn I took a better picture and redid my whole profile. I knew LinkedIn was important but the only way I can describe it is the Facebook for professionals. Once I did this I noticed my profile was getting more looks and I had a recruiter from a F500 company reach out to me for a position. Also, veterans LinkedIn premium is free for a year please take advantage of this or spend the $ on the monthly fee. It is the best thing that happened to me and I encourage others to use the premium feature. 

Interview

I was happy to get the interview and I didn't want to come off as desperate but I wanted this job. It was for a FP &amp; A position and it seemed like a dream opportunity. I read about the history of the company and recent news and events and impressed the panel that interviewed me. The interview started with the senior manager, someone from HR, then with another analyst. It was with the last person that I truly realized how important fit matters. Let me explain what I mean by fit. You will spend more time at work than you will with your friends and family in some cases. If that is the case then how well you get along with those people is the most important part. With each person there was the inevitable what makes you interesting and why should we hire you question. I gave them the best answer that I practiced in front of a mirror and with my wife while also asking important questions such as what are the company values, how do those values align with my values, and is there room for growth within the company. 

Conclusion

I received an offer (side story about salary negation do your research because I left $5k on the table and could/should be making more but I am happy either way) and just had my first week. It is everything I dreamed of and look forward to going to work tomorrow. My advice to those feeling down is to keep your head up. It is not easy in this market but the jobs are out there. Take your time, be patient, and your time will come. If my post doesn't inspire you then I hope the above post I linked does. I can finally add flair to my profile in this sub and I wish all of you a great work week and luck finding a job. If I can do it all of you can!! Thank you everyone for all your help in this sub and the discord server!"

I don't know if I should go for a start-up early in my career because when I reflect on my past internship at a start-up, I was constantly stressed (I'm OK with this) but I wasn't really learning much from my co-workers. I felt like I didn't know what the hell I was doing and when I tried to ask co-workers for help, they didn't know what to do and told me ""good luck with that"". I often felt lonely because everyone was too busy with their own crap. Then I compare my workload to what the full-time engineers had and they seemed understaffed and overworked. I came in with the expectation that I would receive some type of training or educating but that didn't happen. Felt like I was expected to immediately start being productive for that company. However, I did feel that my contributions (however small) were listened to and that the work I did was varied (I enjoyed being able to wear multiple hats). However, I felt very VERY underqualified for the work I was trying to do and the mentorship was lacking here. 

So, I've been doing my research and it seems that people say WLB is much better at a big company and that you will actually receive training due to them having more resources. However, I also hear that since there are more employees in each department, the work you do can be much more limited and you might just work on a very tiny feature that may not be implemented at all.

What should I be expecting from each?"

dkw79w,1,2019-10-21,Team politics and corruption - what to do?,anon_8761,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dkw79w/team_politics_and_corruption_what_to_do/,"Hi all,

I've been on a high school FRC robotics team for three years and we're a very well-known team because we win a *lot*. People don't know about all the BS that goes on behind the scenes, and the mentors are scared to death of tarnishing our reputation in the worldwide community. This season as a senior I've gotten the short end of the stick TWICE and have been stripped of any valuable position on the team. I don't know what to do now. Before you say ""well you probably weren't the most qualified,"" let me give context.

I'll use the word ""politics"" a lot in this. When I refer to team politics, I'm talking about favoritism, corruption, and unjustified/immoral/unethical criteria in selecting students for important roles on the team.

Basically, a committee of captains and subteam leaders is selected by the previous captains and lead mentors every season. The lead mentors always say that they always select the most qualified students. Last season I was a subteam leader, and I did my job well according to the lead mentors and several people on the team. I thought I was set in stone to be re-selected for the same position (this is common; students stay in their positions until they graduate), but I was extremely surprised to find out that another senior, who I will refer to as Jason for anonymity's sake, was selected. Jason's mom is a super involved team parent that manages a lot of logistics for competitions and serves as a mentor as well. Jason is not super well-liked by everyone, including a couple subteam leaders. He definitely has flaws and qualities that make him not the most qualified person for any position (I'm aware that this is a biased opinion, but it is an opinion shared by many on the team). I did the math and the most obvious explanation is team politics: he was selected as a form of ""payment"" to his mother for being such a valuable contributor to the team. Is this wrong? Yes. Is this life? Yes. Can I really do anything about it now? Nope. Since this happened back in May, I've become indifferent towards it (especially after seeing the relative uselessness of the subteam, but that's another story) and I don't really care too much about it more—but, granted, I was pissed for a few days after the selection.

The next week I talked to the lead mentors who made this decision about why I wasn't selected, and they told me that they wanted to give another student this opportunity before they left the team. Whatever, makes sense, and like I said before I didn't really care at that point. What I did make clear during my conversation, though, was that I had my eyes set on a certain role at competitions (*not* a leadership role) that was closely related to my subteam work, and was a relatively important position at that. I was told that the main thing they looked for was great interpersonal skills, so I set a goal for myself to focus on improving that aspect of my personality immediately. The mentor who made this decision (done later in August/September) told me to wait until said date, when he would conduct interviews and make the final decision. So I waited.

(Something that might be important was that I was invited by this same mentor to be a summer intern at the workplace he manages. This theoretically means that he was fond of me, and I believed I proved my interpersonal skills to him at the workplace in the six weeks I worked. One of the subteam leaders (also a good friend) also worked with me here, and the lead mentor is super fond of him. He told me that the lead mentor was ""considering all the politics that would play into the decision of \[the competition role I wanted\] and that there's pros and cons to choosing each candidate."" This will be important later.)

Come September, a short informal interview was held, and I made sure to reiterate how much I wanted this position as a senior who has one year left on the team. A week later, I was told that another *junior* (who I will refer to as Caleb for the same reason as above) was selected. This came as a surprise to me because a) Caleb was already the leader of another subteam, b) Caleb was not more qualified than me (again, a biased but popular opinion), and c) Caleb was a junior who still had two years left on the team. When I approached the mentor (again) about why I wasn't selected for this position, I was fed with a ton of bullshit about how much they considered me and the petty things I did in the past (which shouldn't have any impact at all). In the end, they felt that Caleb was just barely the better choice.

I asked them if there were any team politics involved in the decision, and I was very quickly and firmly shut down. Given the information I mentioned above, this is a straight lie to my face. But I had to pretend like I didn't know anything, and just accepted it. I made it clear that I felt like I was being very undervalued on the team given the massive amount of time and effort I've put into robotics. It's obvious to everyone that there's team politics, and everyone thinks it's wrong. But the students who are in the position to actually influence anything are too scared/too indifferent to actually do anything about it.

So now I'm considering having one of my parents approach the mentor about this; I'm not happy about my position on the team and it definitely degrades my experience at robotics. I've heard in the past that there have been many students in similar situations, and their parents approached the same mentors about all the BS. The mentors gave in and granted the position to the student because the last thing they wanted to deal with was team drama and pissed parents. The difference is that those parents had leverage as sponsors/contributing parents, whereas my parents have little involvement or knowledge about anything on the team. Given this, I'm torn between whether to suck it up or do something about it.

I'm aware that this kind of stuff happens in the workplace all the time, but the main talking point would be that this type of corruption is not OK in a high-school program like this. The robotics team is not a workplace. In addition to that, I feel like I've been cheated twice, and, like I said before, I'm being extremely undervalued on the team. Aside from that, it's clear to any reasonable person that I have more experience and qualifications than both Jason and Caleb for both positions.

To be clear: I will NOT quit the team. The amount of good on the team (what I'm learning, my friends on the team, etc.) outweighs the bad. But I'm in a position right now where I have nothing to lose, and I'm confident that they won't kick me off the team just because my parent complained to them.

What do I do??

TL;DR (but if you have the time please read because this situation is kinda unique): I was not selected for a position that I'm clearly the most qualified for, because of team politics and favoritism. I'm considering having my parents confront the lead mentor about it, but I'm torn. What do?"
dkwk7t,1,2019-10-21,What Am I Doing Wrong?,ThatGuyWhoTypes,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/dkwk7t/what_am_i_doing_wrong/,"So I worked at my last job for about 1 year and 6 months. The whole time I worked there, I always got screwed over by the company. I worked full time hours and they started off by first taking away my full time benefits of getting paid holiday and using personal time off. I was told I could get it back and work 90 days consecutively and work at least 30 hours a week. I did this and talked to the guy in HR again and he said no. That's when I lost my shit and just about cussed him out. I told him how I was so sick of the company screwing me over and singling me out when everyone else in the CSR department gets PTO and holiday pay. I was brought into the conference room where I was told that ""you were talking too loud and other people could hear you"" even though we were having an argument in a closed door conference room. Pass to the next day or so when I come in and see a coworker crying while on the phone. First thing I thought was that she was dealing with boyfriend issues. Nope, she was being yelled at by our COO. Another coworker comes in and tells everyone that he can't talk to her like that. I go on my way and talk to another co-worker of mine on what happened and also spoke to one of my supervisors about it. Apparently, the COO overheard me and the guy in HR called me into the office on that Friday, the 13th to be exact, and proceeded to fire me. When I asked what for, I was told ""incompatibilities with the company"". When I pressed the HR guy further, I was told that the COO overheard some of the things I said, but they never said what. I gathered my things from my office desk and walked out. Since then, I never received termination papers or anything. The week after, I went to a career fair on campus and gave my resume to over 25 people. Still haven't heard anything. I even put into other job positions that weren't internship related and it now totals about 72 applications I've put in. What the hell am I doing wrong and why do I always find myself with companies that treat me like total shit? I'm so sick of stuff like this and struggling week to week with bills piling up and running out of food and gas. I've applied for unemployment the other day, so perhaps that will keep me steady for the time being. I put in for a part time meat assistant position at Whole Foods and I'm supposed to know something by tomorrow, but no promises. So far, things just aren't looking good to me. I'm Christian and I have faith, but right now I'm just asking God as to why I'm going through so much and what in the world am I doing wrong."

So far as an intern I havent been receiving any stipend, but the knowledge I've gained is enormous and vast. I've also found a perfect mentor and a boss that pushes the best out of everyone.  
I've received a job opportunity to continue there but the catch is the starting salary is really low **211$ per month**, I've read articles that say working in a startup is really useful and you learn a lot and I'm completely positive about the learning.   
I've planned to work there for a year, gain as much knowledge as possible and move on to a better-paying company.  


**My questions are,**  
1) Is this a good way to start of my career?  
2) Does startup experience help you a lot while in search of another job **(Preferable if someone who has done it could answer)**?  
3) And joining another company after a year in a startup would I be given a higher position or do I start from scratch over there?"

\- Been awhile, but Ive spent a good bit of time learning HTML and CSS

\- Some experience using Windows Sever with AD

Im just looking for feedback on what sort of jobs I should be looking at with my experience. Im looking for me first IT job and have this feeling that I dont have great chances in my area so I'm willing to relocate. Also, should I take advantage of recruiters and how?

The first one decided I was better fit for another role (applied for Leadership Development Program to do while I finished last two classes in fall, they changed it to internship during summer) and wanted time to do a three hour interview (would be my third) at their HQ. The first two interviews I did with them went extremely well and the interviewers have been keeping in contact with me. I might try to add the one on LinkedIn because we had such a great conversation.

The other company was for an internship for 10 weeks. I really liked their mission in helping others (medical technology) and they gave me an offer I couldn’t refuse. I accepted it and I’m very excited to work for them next summer.

How do I approach this to company one? They are a huge, well known company, but I feel that they wouldn’t be able to match my other offer. They brought up that they’d also consider me for full time jobs that start January 2021, which is what I might gear towards. The interviewers were extremely great and I want to leave the door open for potentially working for them in the future if I decide company two isn’t a place I want to stay at."

They pay me well, Have amazing hours, are accommodating of school and overall are awesome. I love my boss and the people I work with. These people really went through a lot of work to hire me (especially for me being a sophomore in CS). I really want to finish my junior and senior year with them. However the only downside is the location is in a city I do not want to live in. Now that I'm a junior most people apply for internships in places they want to be, however I do not want to apply for internships in places where I want to be (mostly somewhere in the Pacific Northwest) and go through getting letters of recommendation, if I want to stay at my internship this coming summer. A major reason for this is because I figure 2 years of interning at the same place (Im also interning through the semesters) looks better than interning at two different places in 2 different summers. As I said above this place is amazing to work for and its a place that will look quite good on my resume. I just do not want to stay in a place where I will be unhappy or don't see a future. This place is in my hometown so another summer would be a great time to save up if I want to move states after senior year.

I went straight into grad school but now that I'm getting ready to graduate again, I'm realizing that I am simply not meant for the business world and I'm considering taking another trip to grad school.

I have worked a few different internships with athletic departments and an event management company and my takeaway from 3+ years of work is the time devotion required to be successful will make me miserable. On top of normal 9-5 hours, you have to work any events your organization puts on which usually means you're lucky if you have more than half your weekends a year to yourself. Not to mention I am extremely quiet and reserved so my personal skills are not up to snuff compared to any of the people I have worked with.

While working full-time over the summer for my work-study position in my schools financial aid office, I got the opportunity to work in a different department within our office. Essentially I sat in front of a computer all day and made edits in one of our databases for two months. I was in heaven. I didn't have to talk to anybody instead of working the phone lines as a customer service rep like I normally do and I just sat at a computer all day. Since then I have been looking into careers that revolve around computers and that will put me in a position to work on my own or with a very small group. 

I think I want to do a complete 180 from my first two tries at school and go into software development. I am trying to teach myself different programming languages online but it hasn't been going as quickly as I would like (granted if I wasn't working a 30-40 hour a week internship, a 15 hour a week work-study job, and taking 3 grad classes I could devote more time to it). I am considering taking a semester off and then just jumping right back into getting another graduate degree but in computer science. 

I am already drowning in debt but I am hoping that if I get a full time job at a university and take advantage of their employee tuition assistance I can pay off my student loans while getting half or free tuition. I really don't mind putting in the work to really learn how to program and the ins and outs of computers but if I am going to do it I need to know if it's practical. So is going back to school my best option? Or are there better alternatives to learn programming that will get me a good job in software development?"

I made a recent jump last year from Desktop to a NOC/Data Center position. However, NOC work is only so rewarding and it was to get my foot in the door on the infrastructure side of things.

I graduated with a degree in IT specifically concentrated in Sys Admin but picked up Bash, Powershell, Perl and Python along the way. I use Python almost everyday at work since we are a hybrid NOC (sysadmin/network work). I have written extensive scripts in all of the languages for college labs. I write Python at work to help automate the tedious things. 

My resume is pretty strong IT wise. I had an internship my Freshman year of college where I was the lone Sysadmin. Then worked in a K12 setting as Desktop/Jr Sysadmin.... but more so Desktop. NOC being almost a year now with 6 years total in experience. I do have my own test environment at home being a homelabber so I'm really confident I can manage Linux and Windows Server OS's since I've been working with them for a while now.

I started my Cloud Practitioner modules on the AWS training website since it's all free. I'm pretty strong with Python so I will most likely be going the Devops/Operations route. I'm aware of the free tier but how far can that really go in terms of being familiar enough to be hired by someone? AWS says Cloud Practitioners should have 6 months of experience by the time they are certified, with specialties being a year or more. I live in a very hot market, but the end goal is to work remote. A lot of people advertise, ""you don't need prior experience to get certified!"" However, what good does that for anyone when employers want experience too?

I have a desire to work remote since I am single, plan on staying single. All I want to do is work. So I don't mind a remote position and being on-call. I am hoping this path can help me get there in some way. 

Is there a catch? Is it all true? I'm going for the cert regardless because it can't hurt. The training is free, the exam is all I have to pay for. I just want to make sure in the end I can excel in my career without wasting money and time."

dl4mk2,0,2019-10-21,Internship or summer courses?,ImOuttaThyme,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/dl4mk2/internship_or_summer_courses/,"Before y'all start telling me to talk to my advisor about it, I already set up a meeting with him this Wednesday. I just wanted some more experienced juniors/seniors/graduates/professors to give me their input.

I was planning on being in AAE in FYE but due to lack of good grades, I had to choose another course. So I took MSE (Materials Science Engineering), a course that I'm finding to like a lot. (So it's not a case of ""Oh I'm stuck with this boo hoo"") However, I didn't take my Chem 116 second semester since I was intending on doing AAE. Obviously, I had to take Chem 116 this semester since I changed my major to be MSE. Due to me realizing I had to take this to even catch up with the sophomores, I took a math course, a BSS course, and an MSE course to get a couple of the requirements out of the way while giving myself a bit of a lighter load so that I can boost my GPA higher. (I'm not in danger of academic probation but it's something I don't want to ever worry about.)

Now, I already thought over my third through fifth semesters including summer when I submitted this schedule last summer. I figured I was going to be taking summer courses but I would see if I could catch up in my fourth semester (Spring 2020, next semester). I submitted the course requests to check out all the timing and to see if they were all available. An MSE course is available next summer (this I already knew), along with the math and physics courses.

I looked over them and I realized that doing all of these at once, especially two math courses and three MSE courses, will be a challenge and that I shouldn't bite more than I chew. I tried to split it up so that I could take a Physics and a Math class next semester but the Physics course I have to take clashes with the schedule for all of my MSE courses which are nonnegotiables. So I'm obviously going to have to do summer courses. There really isn't a way around it unless I attempt to do distance courses and even then, I don't know how they work (another question for my advisor)

This entire thing was basically background on why I can't really change any of my courses. Now, I've talked with my parents and we do have the money to extend my college term a year so it's not a big deal money wise if I had to graduate in five years, especially if I do an internship.

During this fall, I've been talking with a person from a pretty big failure analysis company, something I've been interested in doing, and I'm actually gonna meet with them this Thanksgiving break and tour their grounds this Christmas break. There is a possibility of being offered an internship (I was told I'd be talking with their internship folks) but I still need to ask them questions such as when do they accept internships, what is the process, and is it year round or only by a single season? What is the criteria? Do I fit it? Stuff like that. So there's a possibility of being offered an internship but nothing is actually set in stone. (Am waiting on an email for these facts)

It's been the general plan that I would take the internship in the summer (I know I shouldn't have made any actual plans without the facts but I didn't know what could happen until the course times were released) but now that's looking not possible if I have to do summer courses if I want to keep on track for a 4 year term. Granted, many folks graduate Purdue in more than 4 years because ~~they walked under the Bell tower~~ they take internships or learn in other countries.

I dunno what I'm worried about. This kind of plan isn't entirely unique, I'm sure it's happened in the past. I guess I'm worried about being left behind by my friends. Most of them would still be there, I'd just be a semester behind in courses. After all, the rate of college depends on you, not necessarily your comparison with your friends and colleagues.

I guess saying that I'm not gonna be graduating in four years, unless I take summer courses, is too much for my ego to take (and somehow, the math courses here at Purdue haven't taken it down that much, just joking, they destroyed it) but... it seems like a lot.

This is a field I'd be interested in doing. I know I need to get the facts but suppose that I can only do the internship in the summer. Then is it really okay to extend myself another year/half year? I suppose I would prefer to do the internship during a fall or spring semester so that a) I have more time in it instead of the 2 months and b) the courses I need to take over the summer are prerequisites for several other MSE courses so I think that if I were to try to do those in the next fall semester, even if I tried to do another MSE course or get a couple Gen Ed courses out of the way, I think it would wind up accumulating how behind I am and I would end up having to take an extended year instead of extended half year. If I were to do the summer courses, I'd be bought up to date and be equals among the other juniors, and maybe a little more if I take another Gen Ed course.

I know this entire thing has been a bit of a rant/typing thing to figure out and I praise you all for being my computer rubber ducks. So I guess in the end, if the internship turns out being available only in the summer, I should turn it down so that I can ""round up"" my credits and kinda start the fifth semester back on track. If the internship turns out being available during the fall/spring semester(s), then I could do the summer courses, then take it during one of the semesters and just have my plan extended out by one semester.

Does that all sound good? Does that make sense?"

So back in the summer I got into the school of my dreams, run by one of the fore-founders of the field but because of how new the school is (only one class before us) and their refusal to take venture capital money and trying to get accreditation (they're state accredited but not nationally yet). I am waiting to hear back on a start date for this program. I'm plugging away in other ways, working with a professional mentorship program, working on my portfolio.

I'm in a bit of a flux period because I have no solid start date (first they said beginning of year, then spring, now spring is looking like it might get pushed to summer and I'm really floundering with my mental health where I'm at. I'm miserable I have very few friends I see (like maybe once every few weeks) and I'm not doing well mental health wise... I've been back here in the state I'm currently in for officially 2 years (After I lost my home previously and had a very very bad experience with my landlord) and I've made very little progress mental health wise, career wise, anything wise. I had a therapist quit on me because of how ""little I was improving"" and wanted me to go back to another day program after I had done 2 in a year.

I feel stupid. Stupid, trapped, and unable to progress. I freelance various things but other than that jobs here don't seem to work out that well and I'm always flirting with being broke. Unfortunately this school is pretty much my only chance at getting into the career I want as I can never get anyone to take a chance on me without a degree, can't get internships without being in a 4 year school and can't afford to work and go back to school (The school will be covering my living costs, and supplies including a new computer) 

One of my best friends is offering to let me rent out his room in near where I used to live (close back to NYC, which is my home and where I want to be at the end) for 300 dollars flat (and no security deposit) which would be less than I'm paying now, I'd be close to home, and I'd have a lot more opportunities for internships and networking. And more importantly I'd be able to connect with more of my friends and have someone there to But I wouldn't have good insurance and I'm afraid of having another complete mental health collapse. Here I have a therapist and psychiatrist and meds completely paid but over there I'd have more copays. I'd also be living with someone I care about and I've had some pretty bad experiences with that in the past but I've spent extended time being around them and living with them for weeks and things have been good, in fact that's part of the reason they reached out to me because they felt comfortable living with me before other people. I'm torn. I'm in a stable but miserable situation now, and am just waiting to move.

tl;dr offered a cheap room in a great place with a good friend back home where I feel comfortable but will lose out on mental health support but am miserable where I currently am and am unsure whether or not it will be worth it for a short time"

I have no problems with their assessment, although they seemed to be a waste of time as it consisted of an easy English test, high school math/logic and their data analytics test was just to pick out the best type of graph for representing data. Their Hackerrank was also very easy, (2 LC easy questions, if not easier? most people who have taken AP Java in high school would be able to pass). My main problem with their assessment was the deadline. They sent me the assessments on the evening of a weekday, and it was due **BY THE END OF THE DAY**, not even 8 hours later. Unfortunately I was busy with family issues / school work and I did not see the assessment until the very next morning, after it was due, to which I promptly completed all the assessments.

Is it reasonable for companies to send Hackerranks that would take 2-3 hours within 8 hours of the due date? That seems totally unfair to anyone, especially a college student who has to worry about exams and school work. I am genuinely wondering who they think is going to intern there as they don't even pay competitively and seem to think college students are willing to drop everything to do their tedious (but easy) assessments."
dl79ws,4,2019-10-21,In College and struggling to find a path,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/dl79ws/in_college_and_struggling_to_find_a_path/,"Hello, I am a Junior at a pretty respectable college and while everybody I know already has an exact goal, I feel a bit lost. 

Basically, when I got to college I kept on hearing how great programming was and I gave it a try and got decent grades, but could never really say I am good at it or love it. So I got a summer internship to see if programming could be for me and the job sucked. It killed my appetite for programming honestly. However, it wasn't a big company internship. It was a obscure small company internship.

So now I am in my 3rd year at my university and not really sure what to do. I also can't major in computer science because my grades aren't good enough (capacity constrained majors need 3.7+ GPA to get in) so I have to major in Math/Econ if I want to graduate next year which I am fine with either of those although not in love with them. I talked to an advisor and they were nice and helpful, but this is basically my situation. Ideally, I want to get an good internship this summer since it's my junior year, graduate next year and then start working. But, that looks far fetched to me. I just feel way too lost for someone in their junior year of college. I'm thinking of either getting another programming internship with a better company or just give up on it and try something else out like Business Analyst or who knows.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I am currently attending school full time for cybersecurity network forensics and intrusion investigation at one of the few schools in the country endorsed by NSA, Homeland Security and DC3. I have been unemployed this past year and focusing on school but have also been looking for my next big opportunity. My classes now are online so I can work a day job.  I have probably applied to 75+ positions, desktop support, system admin, security analyst etc...  My last job was essentially helpdesk and I hated it, being tied to a desk wearing a headset all day was just not for me and I was not utilizing my degree. I am looking for something mid level in the security or admin field. One thing I know is holding me back is not having a security clearance, seems like all the jobs I see posted require it. It also seems like lack of experience holds me back,  I know I need experience but taking another helpdesk role will not help me.  I want to be challenged and learn not reset passwords and reboot routers. Maybe its my resume, it could also by my geographical area (upstate NY). I have considered moving to a major city for a couple years to gain some experience in the field. I have less than a year left to obtain my degree but didn't think that would deter potential employers since I am pursuing and doing well. I have gotten interviews but they were for entry level help desk roles that did not pay well. I have also thought maybe getting some certs like security+ and network+ would help. Another problem is even though I am 33 I essentially have the same experience of someone 10 years younger than me that has just graduated. Unfortunately I am not in my 20's living home with my parents so I can't afford to take unpaid internships or entry level wages because I do live on my own and have bills. My question is what are the next steps I should take, given all the options I have went over? I am open to any and all advice and will also post a link to my resume if anyone wants to give me some feedback.

They're close to my hometown, but in a pretty undesirable location; I probably wouldn't be able to move closer than 30 minutes away, but I'd maybe have free housing.

The other is offering me an associate System Administrator position, in a slightly more desirable location, for roughly the same pay (haven't got a quote yet in writing). They're looking to scale up production and integrate with Azure as well. I'd be willing to move closer to them, and it's a more ""happening"" area without much more of a cost of living adjustment.

I need some advice on my pay raise situation.

So a long story/rant.

I started at a FIber ISP/I.T. Consultant company in Sept. of 2015. I originally started as an intern as I was still going to school for my degree. I eventually was hired full time and got a slight bump in pay, but I have gotten several pay raises since. Now, I have to major clients that I make our company over $115k a year. One of these major clients is also very confidential so I can not have any notes of what I do there, and they only want me to work with them. So, that means if I left it would be very hard to replace me.  I also have been there every time and emergency came up. My job title is System/Network Administrator and come to find out the new guy we just hired (who is way under qualified) is making more than me. What the heck?? I saw his pay stub laying in the printer one day when I was getting my print.

I recently went and talked to my I.T. department manager about getting paid more. He said before our meeting he talked to the General Manager and they both agreed I was getting under paid. I was basically told that it is not in the budget but we are waiting for the banks (which was end of last month) because we are getting loans for a huge expansion, and then I will see a pay raise. We never talked solid numbers. Either way it's been a month and nothing has changed. I asked our HR representative where we were with the Payscale program that we planned on using. He said we are in the process, and there is no solid date to when that will take effect.

I just feel like they are jerking me around and I am not sure what step to take next.

Do I schedule another meeting with my manager?

Is it a bad idea to bring up that I saw another employees pay stub?

I am sure there are more questions I need answers to, but any advice would be great."

I started a degree in CS a few years ago, but life happened and I didn't finish.  Then I got a job working for a fortune 500 tech company as a repair technician.   I currently have a full time job repairing computers(mostly hardware fixes) for several vendors in both consumer and enterprise equipment.

The problem is that I don't care much for the job and I have always enjoyed writing software/coding and would really like to get back into that world.  To achieve that goal I have re-enrolled and will graduating in a year or so with a degree in CS.  I also had a summer internship as a software QA tester for an insurance company.

From what I've heard on Reddit and a handful of other online sources that future potential employers might have already ""pegged me as a technician"" once they look at my resume and see that I have work experience repairing computers.  My plan is to apply for jobs as a software developer/engineer pretty much the day that graduate and maybe a little earlier.

Do any of you have experience with this type of situation?  Is it going to be an uphill battle to move away from the support side of the industry and towards the production/development side of the industry.

I’m doing a rotational program, for new grads and I’m struggling hard in this first rotation.

It’s been almost 4 months and I basically haven’t written any code. Most of what I have been doing is commenting and “learning” the code base. Everyone on my team seems so busy that they don’t even know what to do with me and sees/treats me as an intern. 

I just feel completely useless and having no clue about anything has deprived me of motivation to learn. My first rotation is basically Spring Boot application development but I had no experience working with it, and I feel like the ecosystem is so huge. Everything I do is in vain especially since there are developers with 10+ YOE that could do my task in minutes.

I also feel like everything I try to learn sifts right through my brain. Like learning spring is not intuitive for me at all. It just seems like there are endless files, and parts to an overall application I just get lost.

I’m afraid of getting in trouble or possibly fired? I doubt I’d get fired but I just feel completely incompetent and it’s a concern I have since I relocated across the country for this opportunity.

dlc09t,1,2019-10-21,Do I have any chance left after this nightmare internship interview?,TheGreatUsername,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dlc09t/do_i_have_any_chance_left_after_this_nightmare/,"I'm a junior in college at a ""public-ivy""-type state flagship studying Information Systems with a minor in Computer Science. I've been applying around to internships and generating a good amount of interest for IT Business Analyst and even project management internships -- the interview in question was for the former.

It was a second-round virtual interview through Cisco's Webex platform for a very large company that develops cleaning supplies. The issues with the interview were as following:

-The hiring manager was 5 minutes late and finished 12 minutes early (for a 30 minute interview, totaling **13 f*cking minutes of actual interview time.**

-Despite this being a virtual interview, he didn't have a webcam, so it was basically a phone interview that I had to dress up for and feign eye contact.

-He asked me only 2-3 questions, one about a couple specific college classes and another about some dual-credit college/high-school coursework I did years ago. **He literally didn't even acknowledge the internship I had this past summer, even when I brought it up in one of my responses.**

Overall, I can only assume that A: I just made a really bad impression (there were some technical difficulties with my mic and noise outside of my apartment at the start, and I've recently switched down to a minor in CS but he had an older copy of my resume that has it listed as a double-major (I made sure to let the recruiter know this before)), B: he never actually accepted the meeting request from the recruiter on Outlook and was blindsided, or C: they already had someone picked out and he fully intended to give me the interview equivalent of a kangaroo court trial.

I'd expect this from a ""Bob's IT Solutions"" type company, but not a multinational F500 in a major city. But all this aside, this was still a second-round interview for a company that, prior to this, I was really interested in. Am I screwed?"

I graduated in 2017 and currently work for a large company that operates globally doing Web QA, both automated and manual testing. I've worked here full time for almost 2 years now and have done multiple internships with them.

Projects that I am a part of are all ""high priority"" and are constantly brought to us, the developers and I, with only 1 or 2 weeks to complete. We are normally working on 3 or 4 projects at once. This has caused a lot of overtime each week, working normally 55 - 60 hours per week and on weekends. I make a very low salary, a little under 50k, and do not get overtime pay.

I've spoken to my supervisor multiple times that I want to get into the development side. Each time he has ""promised"" me that he will speak to one of the developers and have them set up some time with me to go over their process, where they check in their code, etc. but in the end, nothing. This is mostly because none of the developers are also overworked and have no time to teach me. On top of that I am given more administrative duties. I don't feel like I am learning at work anymore.

The low pay, long hours with no compensation, and empty promises have made me feel like I am not appreciated. This has all increased my stress too and my mental health is suffering. I am sleeping less because I dread that the day will end and I will have to go to work again. I am unmotivated at work and all I can think about is quitting. I'm calling in sick every couple of weeks to take a mental health day but on those off days I just think about the next day and how much I will need to do.

I have a performance review with my supervisor at the end of the year and I will ask again to get into development and also try to get a significant pay increase. They usually only give 1 - 5% depending on your review. So my question is, is it wise to give my 2 weeks, without another job lined up, on that day if I do not like the answer I'm given? Would the possible gap in employment be cause for concern even if it is just a couple of months? If a potential employer asks why I left, is it okay to voice my concerns of my previous employer?

I do not have debt, live at home, and have a large emergency fund so financially I'm okay. I have been applying for jobs over the past month but I feel like I need to quit to recover mentally. I will continue to learn and code on my own though since I enjoy it. Any advice would be appreciated."

I think I’m decently good at my major (comp sci) and have done internships and projects, so I think it’s safe to say I’ll have a job out of college.

But I don’t think this is the life I want. Like not even my major, just the life of getting a job, eventually getting a house, probably wife and kids, and just having a standard life till death. I want to leave college and it all behind, be on my own, travel, struggle, and be around people who are down to earth. My father did this. He left everything behind when he was 17 and travelled on his own and made his own way. Sure, he’s never had a lot of money, but he seems very wise because of it and he’s content with life and with what he has. 

I want to live a life where I don’t know what’s going to happen next. I want my life to be an adventure. But if I don’t do it now, I feel I’ll never get the chance. I’ll get tied down to a job or a family and never be able to just go and wander. My heart is telling me to go and I really want to, but I can’t make myself for some reason. I also feel I’ll be such a disappointment to my mother because she always wanted me to not be like my father. She wants me to graduate and have the life her and my dad couldn’t have because of money. Also, I know there are many people who would love to be in my position and I would just be throwing it away for some stupid dream.

I never make huge life changing decisions, never take risks, and I’m tired of it. Sorry this is such a ramble.

What do y’all think, do I follow my heart or do I push my feelings away"

I’m currently a junior undergrad and am working on getting internships for next summer. I have an offer for one company that pays pretty competitively and am waiting/working on interviews for a few more. Unfortunately, I didn’t apply to a lot of the quant firms until later since I wanted to get a bit more time and practice interviews before working on my top choice companies.  
  
I’m now in a bit of a predicament. I have an offer to work at a company that many people would probably happily take, and am working on a final interview for another company that might be first choice for a lot of people.  
  
I’d be happy to take these offers just as a safety net, but I also would like to get a chance to intern for my top choices. Unfortunately my top choices which include quant firms are extremely selective and while I think I have a good chance, it’s nowhere near guaranteed. Especially since these companies often reject qualified applicants knowing they can afford to.  
  
Going forward, though, a lot of these quant firms want PhDs for their technical positions and also probably want prior experience. For interns, however, they don’t ask for much more than just excellent baseline skills, passion, and the ability to learn. I’m not sure if I would be closing the doors, by not going for internships at those companies.  
  
**TL;DR:** Do you guys know of situations where someone purely in software engineering and CS could make the transition to finance and quant firms? Thanks!"

The position is remote and I can work from anywhere I want. The internship does not pay and lasts for 6 months.

As for my full time job, it is slightly flexible but its required to work 42 hours a week. It's a position not in the field I want to be in one day, but its still a job that pays well, is close, is something I'm good at, and something that I feel good about doing. 

The college I go to is completely online and the classes I'm currently taking are pretty easy and can be managed with about 5-15 hours a week.

I'm so excited for everything. I feel like I'm finally getting somewhere in my life. I'm excited for the internship, schooling, and full time position. I hope that after a few months I can finally become fully independent and move out. 

Do you have any advice for time management or balancing this all? I feel like it's going to be difficult but in the long run I believe I will benefit from it."

However, a week ago she told me some about some past events (including sexual abuse), how she gets no love from her parents, and how school has burned her out. She also told me that she thought about suicide at least 3 times a week in high school and thinks about it once in awhile while in college. And she told me that I am the only reason keeping her alive, she can't leave me.


""Episode"" 2: Yesterday she had a free day without classes. So she spent most of the day watching Netflix and was unmotivated to start her work till late at night. Which is normal for her, but now I think is a byproduct of depression (maybe?). But the main concerning event that happened was when we were trying to sleep. She started crying and said, ""I don't know if I'll ever be happy"". But then 10 minutes later we were chatting and having fun.  Which makes me worried about how good she is at masking her depression. And possibly the effects of seasonal depression on her.

Right now I don't know what to do. I want to get somebody to help, but I feel like it's going back on her trust in me. She takes awhile to open up, it took her two years to open up to me, to her boyfriend. And she did some free counseling at our home institution, but she said she couldn't open up to somebody she didn't know well. And currently we're in Ireland and our program offers 4 free mental health consultations with experts. However, I know she needs much more than 4. And I want to get her help in America, but she doesn't have a valid Visa for America currently, so we have to go back to Cambodia to get it. Which who knows what will happen if we do that with the idea of my mistrust in her mind.

But I think there are some good signs: she's planning for the future: looking for internships, thinking about classes, money; she still does her makeup and care about cleaningness and her outfit everyday; her brother is getting married in January and her other brother is having a son in January; and I am still with her.

Basically I am lost on how to help her and if I should wait for the spring to get better help under her Visa.
I appreciate any advice."

dlhusp,157,2019-10-22,How was all of yall's realization that the 8 to 5 is just modern day slavery. This was mine,abrow336,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dlhusp/how_was_all_of_yalls_realization_that_the_8_to_5/,"I'd like to say it is so mentally comforting knowing that there are people out there are aware that being forced to work 55 hours a week for an 8 to 5 or be homeless is akin slavery.

It took about a year for me during college to come to the conclusion that the ~~9 to 5~~  8 to 5 is actually immensely evil. It was at a time I was dropping a lot of acid realizing that I and the majority of people around me are slaves to money with no real free will or agency.

When I first came on reddit I saw a askreddit post online about how it's not actually 9 to 5 or 8 to 5 its about 7 to 6 which was just the beginning of me questioning things.

Let's say it takes only 30 minutes to get ready including shitting, getting dressed in dumbass business casual while trying to force feed yourself like a race horse. Then if your lucky your commute is only 30 there and 30 minutes back including the time it takes to park and walk our slave asses through the lot. Then it takes 30+ minutes to unwind, eat, shower, shit, and shop for food. **LET ALONE** if you go to the gym or actually want to cook food which I love doing both of.

That's 11 hours a day for a regular 8 1/2 hour shift with a 30 minute break.  11 hours a day 5 days a week, and if your salaried you best believe they're going find some way to milk a milk-less cow harder.

I remember in college after acknowledging all of this I contemplate the sanity of human beings. From march of 2016 onward I had spent the majority of my days attempting to find another path of living. Including [youtube](https://youtube.game), game design, web design, comedy sketches, and even reselling expensive sneakers.

This was going on while the rest of my peers are either spending all day gaming, watching Tv or sucking cock for an internship. **NO MATTER** what it is, spending 11 hours most fucken days on one thing is **ABSURD.**  The amount of panic I thought I would see from my peers was non existent.

It was just something they accepted and didn't do anything to avoid while acknowledging that it was an awful way of living. How the fuck does that happen!!

Maybe it was because I was a gay black guy in high and middle school.  I had to get up at 6:30am every fucken day to be surrounded by homophobes. Life already put me through hell and on the outside of things, but it still wasn't until my junior of college year when someone had to introduce the idea of what real freedom is.

Humans willingness to put up with awful bullshit without even considering an alternative let alone attempting one  is incomprehensible!   It makes me realize why the world has been so shit for the longest time. Us humans are designed to be OK with the worst shit.

What I'm wondering is how did all of you realize that this kind of living was akin to slavery and a shit way of going through life and what are you doing to avoid living like this."
dlhwlg,4,2019-10-22,I choose a shitty Msc degree,KoalaKeys_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dlhwlg/i_choose_a_shitty_msc_degree/,"Hey what's up everyone, I'm a 24 years old Italian guy and I'm afraid I might have worsened my future career/life by choosing a non competitive master degree.

A little bit of backstory, I was a very bad student in high school, I even ended up failing some classes and had to retake them during the summer, in 12th grade I had the chance to do an exchange in the U.S. so I got my shit together and I ended up going. It was a life changing experience, I made a lot of friends, learned English, became a better student and I became more aware about world problems, so much that being the idealizer I am I thought my life goal was to change the world for the better.

I joined university in Milan but I wasn't sure about my choice so I dropped out, worked for 6 months pondered my decision better and enrolled in another program ""Economics and business administration"" at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan (medium/high tier school in my country). I was determined to show myself and others that I could make it and I could really excel at what I did, 3 years of bettering myself in everyway and really believing in my goals and I was able to graduate in time with the maximum grade and a small internship experience in SME based in Lombardy. 

I really felt I needed a change as well and  I was ready to raise the bar and aim at a better school abroad (going abroad was my first intention from the beginning, I wanted to do an exchange but something happened and I didn't do it), I selected a few master programs at the Rotterdam School of Management specifically a Master in Management, mind I'm really not sure about the specific position I would like to cover in a company but I know I would like to get in the marketing area (analysis and strategy) of a company with values shared to mine and work in an international setting.

 I thought that would be the best choice to aim at that so in between exam breaks I got ready for the GMAT, the minimum score they were asking for was 600 so not that high but unfortunately I didn't have much time to prepare, I gave 100% but I scored 580 1st attempt and 460 (or 420 don't remember) on the 2nd, I was mortified, my score were very uneven (75-80 percentile on the verbal 19-29 percentile on the quantitative) I knew I was strong in the verbal and weak in the quant part but I wasn't expecting the results to go so down on the second attempt, I really don't know what went wrong, anyways that was my last attempt as deadlines were approaching fast so I picked myself up and made a decision. 

I always make the mistake to focus too much on one objective and not consider other option so given that I hadn't reach the minimum score to go to RSM I gathered information about other Italian universities that had more relaxed deadlines and I ended up deciding to stay in my uni and enroll in a Master's program (Msc in Management, MiM) in English.

Long story short  the program wasn't up to my expectations at all, we're talking about professors that don't speak English well, wordy slides, no good books, courses that seemed just credit fillers to me, the fact that I approached it as a step backward also played a role in making my experience bad. 

Everything started going south, everything that I was so proud of and helped me build my confidence over my university years started to deteriorate and go wrong, studying 

\- Studying, I stopped giving all of my exams and being on track, I was so unmotivated and  broken down for all of my hard work seemed to have been wasted.

\-Love, I started to date a girl I really liked and that was also giving me a lot of confidence as I never managed to date the girl I REALLY liked in my life, but then right after New Years eve when everything was at its worst with life doubts and school, it ended cause she wasn't into me

\-Personal, I stopped going to the gym and being healthy, I stopped caring, I stopped going to classes and I really beat myself down, I got to a point where I simply didn't care anymore.

I decided I needed to find a solution, I pondered a multitude of solutions and even questioned if I was really in the right major and If what I was doing was what I really wanted to do, I boiled down my options to two. I was either going to quit this program and start again in Copenaghen (Copenaghen Business School - top tier in Europe) to which I had applied in January  (Msc International Marketing) or stay in my school and finish my degree in Spain (with the options of taking all of my missing exams in the host uni ICAI-ICADE in Madrid).

I ended up choosing the secondo option and this is way: 

1) ever since I came back from the US I've been dreaming of going to another country and learning a new language (as I mentioned earlier I tried to do that in my bachelor but in the end I couldn't do it) 

2) My family financial situation has not been that great recently. My parents are divorced and my dad has to provide for 2 families and 5 children, two of whom are now living outside our hometown. Going to Copenaghen would have been great but it would have been very difficult to bear the costs of me being there, on the other hand Madrid is less expensive and I also got a small scholarship.

3) Spanish, speaking a third language would make me more competitive and career decisions aside I've been wanting to learn it ever since I took Spanish I during my exchange

I want to take a small break by thanking you, whoever is reading, thank you, it means a lot to me that you read to this point and using your time  to give me an advice on what I should do. I'm the oldest of five and my dad and mom can offer me little guidance at this point. I've also talked to my psychologist about it but she just doesn't have the experience/knowledge to advice on this case so I just don't know whom to ask anymore. 

Now. I'm here in Spain, I feel I'm finally getting back on track on so many levels. I'm learning a new language, meeting so many inspiring and funny people and doing many beautiful experiences, but I still don't know precisely what to do in the future. 

When I'll be over with this I'll have to write my thesis, at the end I will have a degree which will probably only give me some value in Italy but not abroad, and most of the jobs that I would be able to access will not be stimulating, at least that's what I've understood of my country, everything is competition and the people who get the best jobs are usually people who have done more than what I've done, it will be hard to find something exciting and for which working hard is worthed, very hard, and even harder since I still have no idea about what the fuck it is I would love to do with my life, I would love to have a vision, be excited everyday to work hard on something but I just don't know. I know who I am more or less, I know what I like, for what kind of companies I would like to work and in which kind of environment and so on but I don't have a plan, I don't know how to get there, it's like I'm short sighted and I don't have glasses to fix it, I can see something but it's blurred and the more time passes the more life will make decisions for me and I'll have less freedom in choosing where to aim and go, I'm so afraid I will end up somewhere not right for me, that I'll be sad, that I won't be able to do the things I love, and I keep going back in time and telling myself I could have done more and should have decided earlier by this time I wouldn't be so doubtful.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to synthesize what my problem is. I apologize for being wordy and making probably, a lot grammar mistakes along the way. If you have experience or even if you want to share your perspective and are willing to give advice please do, everything from book reccomandations to a few lines of what you think will be appreciated. 

My best wishes

Everything a bit new to me, From where to find the applications and what to include.

Initial questions.

Where is the best place to find internships, The big ones are easy enough to find and generally link directly to the company, Others also appear to come through job market type sites, normally appearing on many and Im always sceptical of these that my application actually makes it to its intended destination.

Does anyone have a sort of guide/flow of where the best places to look for would be and best application method, I try to find a direct link to the companies website in most instances but not always possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly is the CV/application form itself.

Does this differ much from a typical job CV?

I am a mature student, Have taken the slightly modular route onto a BSC computer science degree, I went HNC software development, HND computer science, Direct entry 3rd Year BSC computer science.

On my CV, Would it be optimal to list these individually with HNC/HND grades (AA) or just note current study towards BSC  (hons) computer science?

Anything else to add to the general CV format, I have employment history (non-comp sci related) which is ongoing and previous high school qualifications etc. but wondering if theres anything else to add aimed towards internship applications?

Any help would be appreciated."

dllzcd,1,2019-10-22,In college. Less than three semesters away from graduation. I have NO idea how to solve this problem.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dllzcd/in_college_less_than_three_semesters_away_from/,"Background information: I'm 21 years old in my fourth year of college. I'm majoring in elementary education. Last semester was rough-- I was working any time I wasn't at school, and it took its toll on me physically, emotionally, and academically. My GPA dropped to a 2.4, but I need a 2.5 or higher to get into the school's Education department. I can't apply for the education department this semester, because even though I'm doing much better now, my GPA is still officially a 2.4. And I can't apply to the education department next semester, because the semester AFTER next semester (fall 2020) is supposed to be the semester I do my internship, and it's required that students take a particular class the semester before their internship (so next semester, spring 2020, for me). And in order to be in that class, you have to already be admitted into the education department. So... I'm stuck.

Did all of that make sense? Please let me know if it didn't.

Truthfully, I hate college. I've hated every minute of the three years I've been here. For more reasons than just the academic problems I've already laid out. But I desperately want to be an elementary teacher, so I've toughed it out for three years. But now I'm in a situation where simply toughing it out won't do anything. Here are the possible solutions I've come up with, along with the reasons they likely won't work:

1. Register for easy classes next semester to get my GPA back up.

Reasons it's not ideal: My advisor and the other higher-ups at my school still won't think I'm education-department-material. And if, by miracle, they do admit me into the education department, they still have the power to pull me out if and when they do not see me as a good fit. Also, I'd be delaying graduation by a semester. I don't want to waste so much of my parents' money on a relatively unnecessary semester (although, after last semester's revelation that I was working so many hours at my job, they told me not to stress so much about tuition).

2. Transfer to a different college. This is the solution I like the best because I really just hate it here.

Reasons it's not ideal: In the vast majority of other colleges, you still need a 2.5 GPA. What if I don't get it back up? Also, I'm not sure how many of my credits would transfer over. And I'd have to deal with housing changes, but tbh I'd be willing to endure that if it meant all these other problems would be solved.

3. Drop tf out. Also fond of this solution, because I really really just hate the college I'm at.

Reasons it's not ideal: I'm either two or three semesters away from graduation. Surely I can tough it out till then, right? Also, I don't know what I'd do after I drop out. Get certified for early childhood education? Apply to another college? Get a job that doesn't require a degree? Travel/teach abroad? 

I truly have no idea what to do. I just want to graduate and be a teacher already. I hate it here, and I hate the situation I'm in. I don't know who else to turn to, because my advisor, the one in charge of all these decisions and the one who will ultimately let me into the education department (he is also the head of the department), has made it very clear that he does not think I'm education-department-material, and on the rare occasion he has answered my questions about what I'm to do, he has done so with annoyance/anger/disappointment in his voice and eyes. 

If you've read all of this, thank you. I know it's not as big a problem as what other people in this sub are going through, but I really don't know where else to go."
dln4ox,1,2019-10-22,Spring Internship Advice Needed,mountain-drive,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dln4ox/spring_internship_advice_needed/," 

**Background:**

I am a senior CS student and although I will graduate in May, I will return in the Fall to do an accelerated master's program. Last summer I completed a Programmer/Analyst internship at \[Large aerospace company\] where I worked on enterprise applications and built a few using Spring and Angular. This summer I have already secured a Software Engineering internship at \[Large finance company\]. 

This semester I am working as a Software Engineering intern at a small startup of about 10 people. In this role, I have been focused primarily on creating CI/CD pipelines, Optimizing AWS resource utilization, and migrating large web applications to various cloud platforms. And while I enjoyed learning about these realms, I haven’t been able to write any code and I know I don’t want to pursue these realms directly. Additionally, my work has been very unsupervised as the CEO is very busy managing everyone and so I feel like I haven’t been able to contribute as much as I’d like to as I’ve been teaching myself everything cloud-related as I go. 

I currently have an offer making roughly the same at a slightly larger company (\~50 people) where I would take on a more development-focused role and I’m significantly more interested in. Although I’m a little hesitant about swapping companies again as I haven’t worked in one place for more than a year so far. Experience wise I think I’d be better to change roles and continue learning and developing skills that are more relevant to my interest. The reason I’m hesitant is after graduation I plan to move out west (currently on the east coast) and I have absolutely no intention of staying with either company past May 2021 and I know in some industries job continuity is important.

Can anyone offer any insight into how important it is to stay in one position for a long period of time?

TLDR: Undergrad CS Student that has worked 2 internships already and is considering swapping to a third in the spring rather than continuing at the current one I’m working at now. Would it look bad if I don’t stay with a company for a longer amount of time than one internship before I graduate? (Even if I gain better experience by swapping)"

- I’d be able to do SWE as a sophomore, extra year of experience
- Higher pay/housing stipend
- Higher possibility of return offer

Cons:
- I’m not too excited by my team placement, but I don’t know which exact team/project I’d be in so I may end up liking it
- More people get msft offers than google offers, might not stand out as much? (feel free to correct me)
- Don’t know if I’d want to return for the following summer

Any advice, especially if anyone’s done either/both programs, would be appreciated!"

I'm a cs student and I'm really lost about what to do as a job in the future. I've done a 6-month internship as a java backend dev. but it was a total mess : old codebase, big codebase (thousands of lines) , my tutor had little patience 

I really lost the motivation for the web thing. Any advice on some alternatives ?

dlp093,1,2019-10-22,Is it worth changing majors for data analytics or programming?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dlp093/is_it_worth_changing_majors_for_data_analytics_or/,"TLDR at bottom

I am right now a Human Resource Major with about a year left until graduation, but have recently came to the realization that I don't want to work in HR. I have always liked working with numbers/data and writing formulas in excel. This leads me to feel very confident that I would do well in data analytics or a field that involves programming. However, I have absolutely no familiarity with these fields-- I will be starting from nothing. 

Changing majors sounds like the best option to me, since I don't have skills, knowledge or work experience in my favor. But changing majors will push me out an extra 2 years or so until graduation (3 years from now, as opposed to 1 year if I stay in HR). Some people I know have told me that it is more important to have a bachelor's degree, than to have one in IS/computer science, and have advised me to finish off in HR and get certificates to join the workforce in those fields. 

Does that sound like the best option? I think if I had any work experience in programming/data or already knew programming languages like JavaScript or Python, I might just do that, but since I am starting from zero, I think that in 3 years I would be better off going to school to get a degree in the right field, build skills and try to find internships or something, than I would be in 3 years if I finished in HR, learned independently and tried to find someone to hire me with no background. 

The only factor against that is the cost involved in extending school. I will be able to afford it without student loans, but obviously I don't like the idea of paying even more and making my last 3 years of school pointless.

TLDR: is it super important to have a degree in IS to enter the world of programming/data analytics, or would I be better off finishing with a degree in HR and not extending my schooling."
dlp6ka,0,2019-10-22,Non Database Jobs?,brentbanks25,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dlp6ka/non_database_jobs/,"I'm finishing (hopefully) the last year of my CS degree at a no name state school and I feel like all the career options are data or database related. 

I am sitting in my software engineering class right now and we are going over ER diagrams *again.* I just don't care anymore, I have no interest in it. I worked an internship a year ago fixing bugs in a software suite written in an obsolete dead language that only managed data and the tables in a database. I quit to focus and school, and because I wasn't contributing much and felt like I wasn't getting much out of it.

Are there any jobs that don't involve working with databases, or writing software that solely handles data, or am I doomed to work a dull soul sucking job? I think I am more interested in lower level C or assembly, maybe embedded programming, but I don't see a path to get to a job that might be fulfilling."
dlpbi5,1,2019-10-22,Applying for Summer or Grad?,MeNameIzJeff,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/dlpbi5/applying_for_summer_or_grad/,"Hi all,

I hope to gain some insight into a predicament that I've been stuck on for a long time now. As most of us know, the UK is very big on their ""analyst pipeline"" and converting summer analysts to graduates, such that almost all of the graduate class will have been occupied when recruitment season starts and so there will be fewer spots. As such, it can be said that the chances of getting into a prestigious firm (e.g. GS) will be higher if you apply as a summer internship instead of a grad role. I am currently a third year student, doing a non-CS degree and thinking of pursuing a MSc in CompSci - I don't strictly need it as I have been programming for awhile now and have some projects under my belt, but no formal SWE/programming internships. I wouldn't mind doing a Masters for the added knowledge, formal CS education branding and if it means I can secure a good job but obviously it would be much better to gain formal working experience and cost is also another factor (not major though).

I really want to get a tech job in an IB and am wondering if I should apply for summer and do a Masters (again not very necessary) or I should just yolo and apply for grad roles.

I'd really appreciate for your advice as most of you would be more informed.

Thanks!"

dlpdxn,1,2019-10-22,[Systems/Data Analytics] What sort of languages/methodologies should I learn outside of my curriculum?,yoshifan64,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dlpdxn/systemsdata_analytics_what_sort_of/,"I'm currently going for an ungrad degree in Business Analytics and Information Services at USF, and I'm reaching the tail end of my curriculum. However, I haven't been able to get an internship, and want to get something before I graduate in Fall 2020. With that said, I haven't been able to get into the nitty gritty of data, and it's been difficult to research exactly what kind of jobs I'd do. All I've gotten out of my degree is drag and drop programming in C# and a ton of business classes so I'm scared I won't know enough for even an internship. Most of the advisors I've spoken with end the conversation on ""Oh that's a good degree it's a growing field"" but I know very little. 

As general questions, should I want to focus my efforts into specific developed software like Tableau, into certain languages (I know syntax of C#, Python, Lua for scripting) like R, or just follow my curriculum? Do I want to learn more about the complex portions of application development/higher end math? In addition, what would be the general workflow of someone working with data? Is it making applications showing stats information on things like market segments and finance information?"
dlph4o,2,2019-10-22,Which coding bootcamp would be right for me?,Chloroform_Panties,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/dlph4o/which_coding_bootcamp_would_be_right_for_me/,"I graduated out of a 4-year college a few years ago and have been struggling to find a relevant job. I'm considering a coding bootcamp since I need a refresher course, but I'm having a little trouble deciding on which bootcamp would be right for me.

After some basic research, it seems like the general consensus is that coding bootcamps don't work if people aren't proactive. While I know that I need to work on being proactive, I feel like I'd be able to accomplish more if I'm given a little more direction.

Ideally, I'm looking for something that could help me get into a relevant job. While I'd like to go over the basics again, I'd rather not spend too much time on them. If they can help me with networking (like career fairs, interview and resume help, etc.), that would be really helpful.

At the same time, I know that nobody is going to look at me if they know I haven't done anything relevant in the past few years, especially now that my education is a little outdated. If a bootcamp can provide the tools I need to do projects on my own time, in addition to teaching me what I need to know, that would be a huge plus.

With all that said, I've been having a little trouble finding the right bootcamp. A lot of the bootcamps I've looked into seem to be saying the same things. They seem to promote themselves to people who have no coding experience at all, but don't provide very much information that's relevant to me. They all have full-stack courses, and they all provide resume and interview help, but not much else. While many of the bootcamps in the higher price range mention internships and setting up networks, I'm still having a little trouble weighing the pros and cons.

If you have any experience with the following bootcamps, what can you tell me about them?

* Ada Developers Academy
* Code Fellows
* Coding Dojo
* Epicodus
* Flatiron School
* Galvanize
* General Assembly
* Nucamp Coding Bootcamp Seattle
* Skillspire
* The Tech Academy
* UW Coding Bootcamp

dlpvnm,3,2019-10-22,When do most students secure a summer software engineering internship?,forekay12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dlpvnm/when_do_most_students_secure_a_summer_software/,"Hi All!

I have been applying to tons of summer software engineering internships and started in late Sept/early Oct. My question is, when is it normal to secure a position? I haven't heard back from many jobs so far.

I talked to an advisor at my school and he said most students secure an internship by late October (my university is in a small town though, so most students work locally and our big career fair is in late October). This seems pretty early to me? Am I wrong? For reference, I've been applying to internships all over the US (mostly medium size companies, not aiming for big N companies).

Has anyone secured an internship yet or have advice to give regarding the rough timeline?

Thanks in advance! :)"
dlq14n,3,2019-10-22,How to make the most out of career fairs?,HumanGarbage2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dlq14n/how_to_make_the_most_out_of_career_fairs/,"Hopefully this is the right place to post this, if not please direct me to where this question would be more applicable.

Hello all,

I'm a 3rd year CS student who just transferred from my community college to a pretty good 4 year university. Last week we had 3 career fairs, in which I was able to talk to about 15+ employers (it would have been more but we had limits on time and the lines were really long). That being said. It's been about a week and I haven't heard anything back. I also applied to a bunch of jobs (about 20+) through Handshake. Again, nothing.

My worry is that since I'm from a community college, I'm at a disadvantage compared to the students who have attended the 4 year university from the beginning. Where as I have only one internship and project under my belt, my peers seem to have several, either through clubs that were available to them but not to me or internships from the aforementioned career fairs that they've been attending since the beginning of their academic career (my cc didn't have any career fairs). I also talked to a lot of other students while waiting in lines at the career fair, and a lot of them are even grad students working on their master's or PhD's, so I dont know how I can compete.

Getting to the point, the career fairs are done for the quarter, and since I didn't get any responses for internships I was hoping to spend this quarter bolstering my resume and preparing to apply for internships next quarter. I've already joined some clubs to learn about AI, web development, and cybersecurity. I'm most interested in internships regarding cybersecurity and software engineering, but honestly I'll take anything at this point. Are there any recommendations you guys have? Either for projects or ways to boost my resume without having an internship? I'd also like to work on my elevator pitch so that way I can be more confident when talking about myself to employers. Thanks, and any feedback is appreciated."

I have a 3.7 gpa, majoring in finance with internship experience.  And outside of that my resume is very solid as well, however I’m not going to go in detail with that on Reddit though out of privacy concerns, so please just take my word for it.

My goal is to have an entry level job in business that requires a degree, that I’d be qualified for.  Ideally I’d like something that matches the following criteria:

1.  Pays at least $30k/year
2. Is in business
3. Has long term opportunities for advancement 
4. And has steady and defined hours not exceeding 60 hours/week or requiring frequent night/weekend shifts in the workplace 

Is this too much to ask for a first time job?  And if not what type of positions specifically should I be applying for?"

**LOR (which should I use?):**

* The professor I am doing the buyback research with. He really likes me and I did the vast majority of the work. He's an experienced writer and I have reason to believe his recommendation will add at least a little bit of information about me and will be very positive.
* My APCSP teacher (11th grade). He was the advisor for my laureate research essay and the teacher contact for the app challenge. Not a good writer though lol. 6/10 maybe?
* My APUSH teacher (11th grade). She's the NHS advisor and really likes me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Extra Info:**

* Somewhat competitive public high school in a wealthy part of Florida
* Somewhat started a business (maybe more of a small unofficial nonprofit?) that has a website, a couple hundred monthly users, and won the app challenge thing. Basically it’s a glorified grade calculator (but my county’s weird with grades). Maybe not even a glorified one lol.

So... what are my general chances to be accepted to Harvard (again, I'm doing REA)?

I’ve been back here reading from time to time. But am still lost, very lost. 

A little background about me:
24 years old in the UK
Degree in Business Studies (2.1)
Work Experience as:
Finance Analyst (6mos, Internship)
Care Team Manager (2.5 years, Part Time UNI)
Health Care Assistant (1.5 years, Part Time UNI)
Love analysis and organising in general. 
Good in Mathematics and Computer Skills. 
Eager to Learn and a Fast Learner
Critical Thinker (not about this sadly)

This may sound cliche to some, but I’ve always seen myself for a guy who has 9-5 job wearing suits but carries the workload pass those hours cause I enjoy what I do. Business and Finance, Accounting, Economics and such. 

I’ve been into interviews for Broker jobs but I dont think I created a good story when I answer their questions since my goals are simple and not as extravagant as what they want or what people in the line usually says, financially stable - long term and career growth are my goals. 

I’ve applied to some Finance/Accounts Assistant but unable to get interviews most likely due to the fact that I have no experience at all in the field. I know I can do any job and build myself if I get the chance to learn but the opportunity just doesnt come by..

I’ve been out of my part-time for 5mos now and was hoping I’ll land an entry level job thats related to my degree and close to my passion - but I didnt. Feeling undervalued in general about myself that despite the fact that I have a decent academic qualification and the eagerness to succeed and grow, I cant even land any. Even worse is I keep sending applications for further studies and all of them came back positive.. Not qualified financially, just want to keep doing it for the sake of feeling myself better. 

Hoping someone who had the same experience or anyone in general can give me a good guidance on how to progress forward. Im just lost on what to do. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my long statement. Ive just wanted to open up rather than keep this to myself and endlessly wonder."

I graduated with a nontech bachelor's from a no-name liberal arts college into the Great Recession. Small wonder I made $30,000/year and was grateful. Then I got married, had a kid, and I had a hard time seeing how I'd ever earn more than $50k at some distant peak of my career. My spouse stayed home to watch the baby and I decided to start a full-time master's in computer science. Money was really tight. But after graduating with a M.S. and moving to a medium cost of living city, software engineering got me $65k starting, then data science was at $100k and I'm now at $125k. That's $500 a day. I know it's not Silicon Valley riches but in the Upper Midwest it's a gold mine. That just blows my mind. We're paying down student loans, bought a house, and even got a new car. And I love my work and look forward to it. I'm still sort of shocked. Tech is magical.

Edit to answer some of the questions in the comments: I learned some BASIC in 9th grade but forgot pretty much everything until after college when I wanted to start making websites. I bought a PHP book from Barnes &amp; Noble and learned PHP, HTML, and CSS on my own time. The closest I got to a tech job was product manager for an almost broke startup that hired me because I could also do some programming work for them. After they went bankrupt I decided I needed a CS degree to be taken seriously by more stable companies. And with a kid on the way, the startup's bankruptcy really made our family's financial situation untenable and we wanted to take a much less risky path. So I found a flagship public university halfway across the country that offered graduate degrees in computer science in the exact subfield I preferred. We moved a thousand miles with an infant. My spouse left their job so we had no full-time income. I had assistantships and tuition assistance. I found consulting opportunities that paid $100/hr which were an *enormous* help. I got a FAANG internship in the summer between my two years. The combination of a good local university name and that internship opened doors in this Upper Midwest city and I didn't have any trouble finding an entry level software engineering job. Part of my master's education included machine learning, and when my company took on a contract that included data science work, I asked to transfer roles internally. Thankfully my company decided to move me into the data scientist title, rather than posting a new role and spending the resources to hire and train a new person. That also allowed us to make a really fast deadline on this contract. I spent three years as a data scientist and am now moving into management. The $125,000/year level was my final year as a data scientist. I don't know what my manager pay will be yet.

A huge part of my success is marketing myself. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to tell my story. Social skills, communication with managers and skip-level managers, learning how to discover other people's (or the business's) incentives and finding how you can align your own goals with theirs: all of these are critical to career growth. The degree opened doors and programming skills are important, but growth comes from clear communication of my value to others, as well as being a good listener and teammate."

Do you know how to code, but don't know how to get started on a big project? Are you creative, but can't make any money off your work. As a student here I see a lot of potential in my peers, however it is often squandered for pennies on the dollar by working some lousy job or unpaid internship. I'm seeking ambitious programmers, designers, and people who live to build things to help me work on a couple projects I have lined up. This is an opportunity to earn some money on the side while you're in school, and get something in your portfolio and on your resume so you stand out once you graduate.

I’m expecting a job offer that I consider long overdue as I am already doing the work. (My mistake...) I have been with the same company for 8 years. Started as an IT intern, moved up through the HelpDesk and learned everything I can along the way. I’m now the sole SME for global collaborations platforms and do the majority of global IT purchasing and asset management (among a million other things)

We are now a global company, purchased by another company and rebranded and I’m not helpdesking anymore but still have the helpdesk title. We are moving to a unified communications platform and I’m the sole person who knows anything about it. The role they have been promising me a job offer for is a hybrid internal IT purchasing and global collaborations role. I know they will be offering me a roughly $7k raise annually, and I don’t think it’s a fair offer market wise. But I’ve been warned that I shouldn’t expect much.

I've worked in Vancouver for an American tech company about a year and very recently received an offer from my current employer to move down to the States. This is my first job after graduating and I am originally from the prairies. The plan was always to move back eventually. Vancouver hasn't been easy for me, I made a few friends but we aren't close and I find myself constantly missing my family and friends. I am only starting to get used to it and the thought of having to move again makes me feel extremely  nervous.

The reason why I am inclined to move is the pay and the 'name brand' of my current company. I did get an offer back home before I moved to Vancouver but it was for a much smaller company and pays 62k. It will be 100k CAD more down in California. My current salary is about 100k. 

If you're in my shoes, what would you do ? Would you move to the US in order to optimize salary and will most likely be unhappy? Or will you move back home and be surrounded by friends and family but with a significant paycut? Or would you stay in Vancouver which is somewhere in the middle ground in terms of salary and social life? 

Also, anyone know if there's any company in the prairie hiring junior engineer with 1 year experience (and some internships) for 100k?"

Resume:

[https://imgur.com/a/K0G3PRI](https://imgur.com/a/K0G3PRI)

Currently I'm faced with a problem. Given that my current position is my first real job (not counting TA positions or internships), and given that I was extremely desperate for a job, I took my current position for only 52k a year (hourly), full health benefits, 0 PTO, 5 sick days, at will. I looked up what my market value on PayScale is:

PayScale:

[https://imgur.com/a/o54q06i](https://imgur.com/a/o54q06i)

There is clearly a huge difference in salary (88k vs 52k if judging market value, or 79k if looking at median pay). Judging from the level of skills and quality of work from me, I feel like I'm merit a raise. I've always met expectations and done beyond what my background is (from DSP electrical engineer to Full Stack software engineer), and my work in signal processing is the main reason the company is able to process for a patent. This is done all in 9 months.

The problem is, I don't know what I'm going to do. I am really grateful that I'm even offered this opportunity. The growth I'm getting from this job in 9 months is tremendous. I'm passionate about my work, and I want to stick with this company and grow with it, but the compensation is hurting my living situation (CA) and my mental health. Should I just go up to my manager and ask for the market value now? Should I wait until I'm at least in this company for one year? Should I bounce mid project? With the current market, would I even be able to find another company to work for? As bad as the above sounds, the CEO personally told me if I was unhappy with anything I should go up to him...

Also, let me know if my resume needs fixing. Really appreciate it and apologies for my frustration. Biggest regret is not having a negotiation tactic."

I get good grades but I dont feel like im good enough for real world programming yet. I've never had a ""technical programming"" interview and i have no idea how I would even do on one. Any advice? what is a good type of job someone like me should be looking for?"

I heard back late last week with a rejection from a very large/famous tech company via a phone call from my recruiter. She was really nice about it and asked me if there was anything she could do, so I asked if there was any way she could give me the interview feedback. She said she could ask if that was allowed and get back to me within a day or two. 

She still hadn’t contacted me over the weekend so I sent her a quick email asking if she would be able to send me feedback. 

Then, just tonight I got another email from her essentially telling me that my interview feedback had been “thoroughly reviewed” and that it was now being sent to the hiring committee for further review. She made it pretty clear that I still wasn’t guaranteed an offer, but asked me for preferred start dates and stuff. 

Basically I am just really confused but too afraid to ask questions because this is literally my dream internship. They obviously don’t have any shortage of people applying so I didn’t even think this could happen. Has anyone heard of this before/might know what happened?"

Lots of internships seem to require applicants to be into programming and have a lot of extracurricular experience under their belts, but I only took the joint degree because CS sounded neat and it is pretty employable. That's not to say I haven't enjoyed the CS side of my course; the programming's been interesting enough, but I'm better at and prefer maths. I'm not very organised, lazy, and I'm also not too great with people - I'm not super weird or anything like that, but I'm awkward and bad at conversation. I think my only good quality is that I'm fairly smart, I averaged a first last year, but as I understand it intelligence isn't the be-all and end-all when it comes to attractive traits in interns. 

Does anyone have advice on this? Should I start thinking more about a career in maths? I've been diagnosed with depression so that probably has been a contributing factor to me not caring about my future but I'm not sure."

I am currently trying to decide between Google, FB, Lyft, Asana, and Stripe internship offers. I am able to choose two as I will be taking next semester off.

Lyft is the highest by a substantial amount in terms of compensation and I think I vibe with Stripe most based on my interviews. I would like to do both BUT.....

Maybe this is just me, but I found that most exceptional devs have interned at Google or FB and I feel some sort of pressure to follow in their footsteps, even though this is not necessary what I want. Has anyone else found this? Is it that important to intern at one of these larger companies? Or should I chase my dreams?

So I'm a college student, working on two associates degrees in IT (Networking &amp; Programming). I was given the opportunity to work at a small local business as their IT, and so far it's been going well, though I have some concerns. I have some previous experience working as an IT intern in a much larger business, and a lot of experience working on personal computers/home networks/building my home lab, but I haven't had as much experience with some of the more.... business? Aspects. Like a POS system (the cash drawers, printers, etc. They have a company that made and maintains the software), purchasing products (don't some companies have special rates/services for businesses?), and just generally maintaining security.


I manage most of the issues that have arisen, and anything I didn't get right away I was able to learn from the internet or various contacts, a hand from the guy who previously covered IT (another employee that happened to know computers), but what I would really like to know is if there are any good resources for I guess... small business IT? Blogs, RSS feeds, a listing of tech companies that offer deals for businesses. Reliable reviews/recommendations for retail systems and/or small business networks maybe? (I've been relying on Amazon, NewEgg, and general google searching for reviews)


The boss is great, he understands that I'm no pro here. I've heard about IT Consulting in my searching tonight and would like to consider it, but I'm not sure where would be a good place to start researching it.


Apologies for the long ramble. Suggestions and tips would be welcomed!"

All of them are as junior project managers in Marketing. Two would be for Global Players, one in an SME. I have had an internship in a globally operating business of about 3000 employees before and even though it was exciting, I felt more like a number which just comes and leaves every day. I feel like this would change in a company of less than 200 employees. 
The differences in the offers are mainly the salary, the Global Players of course offering more and the international orientation, which of course is stronger there too. 
However, I‘m worried that my positions there would come with very little responsibilities opposed to the SME where I feel like I would be able to gain more experience, especially concerning soft skills. 

My question is: How were your experiences? How would you rather start as a rookie in the competitive business world?

&amp;#x200B;

I work as an intern for the IT department of a company and I am tasked with deploying a program.

To keep it short:

PC's in my domain recognize the policy but don't install the msiexec.

I made a batch file with a msiexec command line because the program needs to be installed in combination with a XML file.

msiexec /package %location\\program.msi DESKTOP\_SHORTCUT=1 CONFIG\_FILE=%location\\config.XML /quiet

If I run this script on the computer by it self it works, the files that it needs to download are all on a file server accessible by anyone in the domain.

Now I made a GPO: Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Scripts &gt; Startup.

In there I added the batch file that should install the program correctly.

Then I linked the GPO to the right OU and gpupdated the PC (And restarted multiple times ofcourse).  After doing a quick gpresult I can see it still finds all the policies but won't install the program. 

The domain is on Windows Server 2012, and the PC's run windows 10.

I've looked online for any solutions, tried deleting the GPO and recreating, tried adjusting the msiexec batch file but nothing seems to work. If anyone has any solutions or something I could try, I'd love to hear. Thanks in advance."

dm45ya,6,2019-10-23,What does it look like to transition from IoT client application development back to the embedded space?,kaennar1,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/dm45ya/what_does_it_look_like_to_transition_from_iot/,"This question may have been asked before, but I'm trying to highlight my specific situation and trying to plan ahead so I can be prepared in case I want to transition back to embedded development.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some definitions**:

When I say IoT I'm talking about developing C++/Linux Kernel mods for OS-capable MPUs, not microcontrollers that run some HTTP/TCP stack and a sensing platform.

When I say client I mean that I'm working on downloaded bins/executables which run on a host OS on an MPU/SBC.

**Situation**

I started out working in embedded development at the beginning of my college years. I completed 7 internships (5 of which where I was an Embedded/Electrical Engineering Intern, one of which I was the only Firmware Engineer, and the last of which I was a Software Engineer developing IoT client applications). At the end of last Summer, I was given an offer at a Big-N company working on some of the IoT update solutions they are offering (this has been publicly announced) and some other projects which are not yet publicly announced. It was a solid offer but wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I think what I want to do is develop firmware/software couplings for consumer products, working from concept to shipping.

I interviewed around and ended up with an offer at one startup as an Applications Engineer in the robotics space or a thermal controls engineer at an electric vehicle manufacturer, but I didn't see either of them transitioning into my desired role so I took the job at the Big-N company.

**Next Steps**

My goal for the next 2-3 years is to develop skills and projects that make me marketable to product-centric companies. The sub-goals I've outlined so far are as follows:

1. Develop an entire product from scratch, it doesn't need to be novel, but I should go through a product brief, requirements, board design, firmware design, and eventually build OS drivers which allow it to be accessed either by a computer or by a higher-level system. I was thinking something like a nicer IoT hub that can control Zigbee compatible devices and can be connected to a PC for additional functionality.
2. Learn more about security. In my role, I should focus on developing safe, secure applications that communicate with backend services efficiently.
3. Find similarly minded people in the city I am situated in and have some fun developing applications alongside them.
4. Develop at least one Real-Time control system which requires a controls-model, stability analysis and system implementation (I was thinking something basic like a home-baked robotics kit that uses only DC motors for locomotion and IR/Touch sensors for detecting collisions).

&amp;#x200B;

**Main Questions**

1. Do these sound like reasonable goals?
2. Am I missing something from them?
3. How can I better improve my plan and eventually my career?
4. Does my end goal seem reasonable?

I apologize if this seems braggy or like I'm insane. I've been obsessing over these questions for the past few weeks and wanted to ask here and see if I could get some feedback.

Thank you in advance for reading my wall-o-text."

I’m a 3rd year student specializing in Financial Economics and minoring in math (at a top 20 internationally ranked university) in ONTARIO, with a 3.84 GPA. 

I’ve applied to several summer-analyst internships (at the Big 5 banks), which were advertised though my school’s employment network. 
As expected, I’ve got 0 responses (just 2 declines so far).  
I have had no other internships or co-op positions to date (my school doesn’t offer co-op). 

I don’t have a specific job in mind, however I’d prefer working sell-side. I also am very interested in derivatives (particularly options), and quant-automated investing. I’m very eager to work in finance, and I’m extremely hard working. 

I believe one of my biggest drawbacks is my lack of coding skills (but this summer I plan to learn R, Python and Excel; specifically pertaining to finance). 

However my main problem is that I don’t have much of a network. I live out of the city, so attending events has been limited (in my first 2 years). Between working part-time, committing and maintaining a high GPA, it’s hard to find time for much else. 
I don’t know many people who work in the finance industry (I know several people in retail banking). I have a whole 2 contacts who can be of some help, and I’m in the process of meeting up with them. 


Anyways, as the title says, what are some tips to landing an internship in finance? How can I improve my network? Who should I be aiming to talk to, and what should I be asking? How long should I wait before asking for a job/internship? 

I’m open to any and all advice, and I’d really like to hear from people who work in the industry!

What should I do?",learninginphases,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dm5lvq/graduated_in_march_but_still_unemployed_and_feel/,"So it's been around 6 months since I graduated with a CS degree. I was so caught up in studying and schoolwork that I finished without any internships or projects, which has made me very insecure about how well I match up against the thousands of new grads. Luckily, my parents let me live with them until I can get a job.

I created a resume, posted it on Indeed, and applied to a few local companies but I didn't hear anything back. So this summer, I thought I had time and wanted to add something to my resume. I ended up spending most of my time making a card game with Unity and adding it to my resume, however I still didn't receive better responses. But then Fall came around, and I started to panic. I didn't want to put a lot of my time into something, only for it to be unproductive. I searched online everywhere and scoured Reddit to try to get some direction, but even now I'm very confused. My takeaways from what I've read are that:

\-Full stack developers are the most popular CS-related job right now

\-Technology is moving towards mobile apps and are starting to resemble desktop apps with things like Electron

\-Lots of people try to get into web development by following roadmaps or learning through FreeCodeCamp or The Odin Project

\-Some members of the CS community think CS grads should aim to become software engineers

But I'm extremely confused. At my university, my learning was focused around data structures, algorithms, and computing theory. The impression I get is that web development is popular and has a lot of job security. But it seems different from the whole DS&amp;A, Leetcode vibe I get when reading some other CSCQ posts. So I guess, I'm wondering if someone can help me better understand the career paths for CS. I would say that I don't have a preference for technology or title, but I would like to make use of what I learned through my degree."

I have found that I'm most interested in web development (full stack + design) or data science. I'm struggling to really filter through pros and cons of the two options. I don't know how universally true this is - but I've read that data science positions are almost always in large companies that can afford that sort of thing and usually in larger cities. I really would rather work in a small - medium sized company in a small - medium sized city. So would that basically filter out all data science jobs?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; should I choose a career path based on the size of company I'd prefer working at and size of city I'd prefer living in? Or are there typically data science positions in smaller companies as well, negating that whole line of thought?"

Main things I'm prioritizing are:

1. Modern tech stack: During my last internship I was still working on a waterfall team and using outdate testing software. Don't want that to happen again
2. Location: Currently in Chicago but don't want to stay here. This is my last internship before I graduate so looking at whoever I intern with as potential for full-time work after grad. Thus, prefer West Coast location since I may potentially move there permanently in the future. 
3. How much I'll be able to learn: I want to gain marketable/relevant skills during this internship that I can apply to future job opportunities. Working with new/exciting software, agile development, etc. is a plus.

**Allstate**  
Pay: $34/hr  
Location: Chicago or Houston  
Pros: Paired programming, liked the people   
Cons: Low pay, not preferred location 

**JP Morgan**  
Pay: $42/hr + $62/hr overtime + one-time $2,500 payment  
Location: Chicago  
Pros: Potential to work overseas if convert to full-time, recognizable name, decent pay  
Cons: Not preferred location, tech stack may not be modern, heard the culture is not great, would have to find/pay for housing

**Nordstrom**  
Pay: $44/hr + paid housing + travel compensation + 20% employee discount   
Location: Seattle  
Pros: Great pay PLUS housing, love the location, heard they have modern tech stack   
Cons: Not really considered a tech company"

Maybe I'm overthinking and I'm just nervous because getting this internship would be great in terms of experience and maybe a potential full time position as a computer technician which I'm interested in. That's enough about me though and I don't want to make this too lengthy. 


If anyone would care to share their entry level experiences working in IT, that would be great. I'm all ears"

I’m currently a female second-year at Ohio State in aerospace engineering. Over the last two years, my mental health has been pretty awful and I deal with anxiety, depression, and OCD pretty intensely. I go to a counselor and I see a psychiatrist for medication, so I am *trying* to get better. This is time-consuming already, and on top of the fact that I can’t often motivate myself to get work done or go to extra-curricular activities or events, my gpa is not as great as I want it to be (3.48) and I’m not involved in anything on campus (I’m a TA for an engineering course though). I really really WANT to be involved in more and there are things I’m interested in, but I absolutely cannot find the motivation to be involved in them. This isn’t because I’m lazy; I love to be involved, but I mentally cannot force myself to do this. I’m working on it though, and hopefully soon I’ll join a club I’m interested in.

With all that being said, I'm currently on the internship hunt. I've applied to 243 so far, but I really can't help but feel like I'm going to get looked over by every single one because I am so boring on paper. I haven't been involved in anything, and obviously I can't just write on my resume that I have poor mental health and have been working on that because that's just not something people do.

I can't help but feel like I'm ruining my entire life by not being involved because engineering companies really care about extra-curricular work. I really want to get into the space sector, and I feel like this is even more competitive. College is the most important 4-years of my life in terms of my future; I feel like I'm destroying the entire future I want for myself because of my mental health.

Do any of you have any experience with debilitating mental health and getting internships/jobs at good companies? Do you have any advice on how I can (a) force myself to get involved with something or (2) do something to help my resume without also hurting my mental health? Am I really ruining my future with this?

My family and I don't get along super well,and this leads to a lot of friction. Just recently, my parents almost got investigated for 'abusing' me and my siblings, something I worked my butt off to drop this past month. Even here, we didn't really talk about it in my family. It was just some back and fourth yelling, with them making jokes about it, and me talking to lawyers and friends who could help. After that, I kind of hoped we'd start to build a relationship, but don't listen to me. One example of this would be how at one of my current jobs, I make almost 30 an hour, enough to save up for a small apartment around here.  I've been working 30 hour weeks, on top of classes and volunteer work, and always saw moving out as the light at the end of the tunnel. When I wen't to the bank to take out enough to pay the initial deposit  on the appartment, they told me the account was no longer in my name. When I talked to my parents about this, they told me it was unsafe to move out,and I couldnt take care of myself and make good decisions. But I also babysit,so if someones gonna trust me with four kids, I think I can take care of myself.  And financially? Im doing a lot better than some other people my age.  I cook, I can clean, and I just landed an internship with the company of my dreams, an investment reality group (something they also dont want me doing). I just dont see any support to their beliefs that I wouldn't be better on my own. they are trying to push for me to be evaluated for special needs on top of everything, because my scores in certain classes arent the best. Every now and then, ill put in some studying and get an almost perfect grade, leading me to believe I'd be capable if I tried. However, I spend a lot of those classes answering emails for work, or looking at different properties to pitch to the group once I start the internship, so I only excel in classes that I find benefical and pay attention in. This on top of not going to college are ""red flags"" to my parents, who just reply to everything with ""we're older and wiser."" or ""we're only doing whats best for you."" or ""you're too young to be an adult,so stop pretending."" Im sorry for the long rant. I guess to sum it all up, how do I communicate with them, and help them understand I need some freedom?"

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I need help on deciding what to put on my resume. I've learned that since I'm not in high school anymore, majority of my achievements don't really matter unless they're huge (i.e. placing in a competition). What else should I keep in mind about putting in my resume?

  
I came to college with some credits, but none of them are major specific, obviously. I'm not doing a whole lot outside of class, so no clubs, however, I am in a learning community where we mess with and manipulate big amounts of data to show a specific detail we're looking for in a program called R.

I go to a community College but plan on transferring to a four year. My problem is that I need to take classes that allow me to transfer to a major program I'm qualified for so I need to decide my major now.


I've done a lot of research into VR game design and also taught myself C++ (not very well but I'm at least semi capable). 

As an experiment my career counselor asked me to imagine my dream job. Personally I would love to start a small business designing VR experiences, and playable narratives. I should mention I am super into video production and VFX so I want to take an artsy approach to VR. This is all if I had my choice of what I did. 

I understand that it's difficult to start any business but especially VR and tech since it's so competitive. But I genuinely couldn't think of anything I'd be happier doing so I'd to start now while I'm young and build a foundation to achieve this goal. 

I have still have a lot of questions and also would like some feedback on my dream job goal?



Here are my questions 

-What majors would you recommend looking into? 
I looked into computer science and though it looked great. The only problem is that I have very little skill in math, also a general dislike (still respect it and if push comes to shove can do it). 
Computer science will require me to take Calc 1 and 2, and I don't think I could keep up with that. Would I need a comp Sci degree for this? 


-How does one get their foot into the VR development door? Are there internships opportunities or companies that higher people fresh out of college? 

-How possible/feasible is it to start my own VR dev business one day? 


Thank you to anyone who has read this far. I know this community is a pretty big one so I hope to get some diverse responses!"

I'm kind of looking into graduation with no internships, already feeling like its going to be near impossible to get an engineering job. I almost feel like my degree is worthless, and I also feel like wanting to learn more will amount to nothing respectable for me.  Its almost like engineering ended up the same way people told me pursuing music as a career would. But I kind of speak with a filter outside a select few friends and my father. I felt like at times my online words in the past could have possibly been discouraging to younger students interested in possibly pursuing this field, or maybe they just see me as just not making the cut, I'm honestly not sure. I know I shouldn't be this way but sometimes I want to let off steam that I don't really get to in person often. It's also easier to disassociate myself from the response online

I mostly run into an issue when talking to especially younger students in a non distasteful manner about my major though.  For example, Last fall, I was in a boothing environment for one of the senior projects I was in. This kind of ranged from people a lot more knowledgeable than me in the field (cars) and those less. I got a call a few months later from this guy who ran by our booth and told me that my sons (around preteens I think) were inspired by the project and was interested in our goals (both into cars I guess). Even though I would have been fine with calling back I kind of ignored his voicemail out of fear that he would ask me if I have a job or internships lined up. Then I also kind of didn't want to say anything about having serious trouble finding anything in terms of work when it was brought up. But  overall I felt like I could be discouraging, so I just ignored the voicemail.                   

I think in college I mostly have this trouble when talking to younger students. I was talking to someone and we were talking over what he was covering in mechanics of structures &amp; thermodynamics, and about his capstone project, and then he asked me what my plans were after college. I didn't even know where to really start with this. He also said something along the lines of ""if you have an engineering degree you are set"" an earlier time, where I pretty much knew I had to zip my lips. I kind of responded with something along the lines of my lack of hands on experience, combined with being bad at interviews and connections will it ""make it more difficult"" for me, but I'm unsure yet."

I had worked at the high school for the better part of my life. I started off as an intern but later became the IT guy at the school. My place was called the data clinic. First I must explain what makes our school unique. The school is made up by four buildings. Three of them are connected by a bridge going over a road that would otherwise be separating them. And then we have building four. Most people have no clue that building four is also directly connected the other ones. A tunnel, not particularly big, goes underground right under the ground separating building three and four. I was the only one using the passageway since sometimes I had to move computer components or other electronic equipment between houses while it is raining or snowing. Therefore my key card had access to the tunnel. I was actually the only one with permission to open the doors in that area because no one else ever used it. The lights stopped working in there ages ago but no one bothered fixing them because it is just a straight corridor so you have no risk of getting lost. Now that you know about how the school is structured I can begin to tell you why I will never go back there.

One late summer weekend I had gotten the task to fix a broken projector in building three. No one else is usually in school on weekends for obvious reasons. While doing the mundane task I suddenly saw something in the corner of my eye, a room in building four had its light turned on. No one was supposed to be here so I got scared for a second but then my rational mind kicked in, this had happened before, a chair had probably just fallen over and activated the motion controlled light system. I got over it and continued my work. Well I would have if not for the light in the room next to the first one also had its lights turn on. There had to be someone there. Yet again I tried my best to think up a rational explanation, I did not believe in ghosts but this was weird. The alarms would have turned on I anyone had entered so the only thing I could come up with was that someone must have stayed in school since Friday. I knew the responsible thing to do was to get them out of the building. I did not want to have to go all the way to building one to turn off the alarm just to go back so I decided to go through the tunnel. I headed down all the stairs which took a while and entered the tunnel. As a walked I heard the sound of what must have been raindrops in the tunnel. It must have started raining I remember thinking to myself. I continued walking in the darkness of the tunnel. I heard that I was breathing heavily all of a sudden so I hurried up and almost ran to the exit. 

I walked up the stairs and entered building four. I was already really annoyed so I called out in a stern voice. “Hey, if anyone is here show yourself and I can help you get out.”  
 No one responded so I briskly walked to the room with its lights turned on to get some answers. When I entered I remember taking note that all the chairs were neatly on top of the tables so my first theory went out the window. I was about to go in the next room when I heard hurried footsteps behind me, going down the stairs I just walked up from. Someone was in this building with me and I got an unsettling felling about not being alone. I took a minute to collect myself. Then I heard it and my heart stopped. I heard the sound of crying, a woman intensively crying. I walked out of the room and made my way to the stairs but before I reached the stairs a heart shattering scream started. It sounded like someone was in excruciating pain. I felt my stomach turn. I really did not want to go down there anymore but someone needed my help down in the basement or maybe the tunnel. After a while the screaming calm down but the crying came back just as intense as it was before. I tried to call out once more but all that came out was awkward sound of dread. Something was amiss. 

I took a deep breath and started walking down the stairs I came up from just five minutes ago but this time I could remember that I was scared to go down. That was when the screaming started again. I wanted to turn around and run but I needed to know what was going on and if someone needed help I knew something had to be done. I followed the screams and where else would they lead but that godforsaken pitch black tunnel. The door was open so I figured I must have forgotten to close it. After another couple of careful steps in the tunnel the heart piercing screaming once again stopped and all I heard was the same faint crying and the dripping sound of something. When I walked in something wet it hit me, something that I now wish I would have noticed sooner. It had not been raining when I walked down the tunnel the first time and it did not rain once I came up on the other side but the dripping sound was there all the same. I walked towards the sound.

Now I had a really bad felling because it had to be inside the tunnel that the crying and dripping sound came from because it was much louder now. That was when the screaming started for a third time and I instantly realized what was so wrong with all of this. It wasn’t a person screaming at all. The sound came from some kind of recorder and was on repeat. This was either a trick or a trap. The feeling that I was the one in danger made me dizzy. I started to run back where I came from but when I reached the door it was closed and looked. That was when the crying and screaming came to a sudden stop and I heard footsteps behind me. I fumbled for my key card and in a state of panic thought this was how I was going to die. I got the door open and jumped out. The moment I turned around to close it was when I saw it, a man smiling with a knife in his hand licking his lips. I just ran out the building and the alarm went off. 

My mind was blurry after that but when I later asked the police what happened they told me that they found the female janitor down there, the body was spiked to the ceiling with her body filled with cuts. I had walked in her blood. They never found the man responsible but the voice recorder had indeed been of my co-worker and was recorded moments before if not during her death. We no longer talk about the tunnel. We try to stop any talk that we even ever had an underground tunnel between the buildings. I still have that key card with me. It saved my life but my co-worker had not been as lucky. I still have nightmares of that night, seeing the man walk towards me with I knife in one hand and a recorder in the other while smiling but this time I am unable to get the door open. I can always hear myself cry in the same tone I heard that night and when the man is about to strike me I scream. I wake up screaming like that every time I have that nightmare. The feeling that I could have saved her will never go away but I try and that is why we no longer talk about the tunnel."

What should I do?,espost1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dmgloo/i_have_an_internship_offer_from_my_second_choice/,"Hi Everyone. 

As the title suggests, I'm in a weird spot I never thought I'd be in. I've been applying to internships for the past year and have gotten nothing but rejection letters, or nothing at all. Until this week. I received an offer from my second choice at Company X, but their offer is really less than ideal and kind of underwhelming.

On the other hand, I have a friend who used to intern at Company Y who says the pay is much greater and covers other expenses. The position there is also more in-line with my interests and careers goals. From what my friend tells me, her recruiter was impressed with my resume and cover letter and has passed my information along to some of his colleagues and is actively trying to find a place for me in this company, but they have yet to reach out to me. I have not interviewed for Company Y yet. 

I told Company X I'd have an answer to them by next week.

Should I ask for a time extension and wait for a reply from Company Y? If so, how long of an extension is appropriate to ask for?

Should I contact Company Y and tell them about this other offer? I've considered this, but I'm not sure if it's really professional to rush them when I haven't even heard about a pre-screening yet. 

Or am I just being too picky and I should accept the offer I have at Company X? However, if I do get an offer from Company Y before I start, I like to think I'd take it instead. It is right to rescind my acceptance after I've signed? 

I'm really at a loss and don't know what to do."

I'm a current UC Berkeley undergrad in the midst of applying for MS in CS programs for Fall 2020. My profile is listed below:

* GPA: 3.97 
* GRE: 332 (167– Q, 165– V, 5.5 Essay. 90th, 96th, and 98th percentile respectively.)
* Work Experience: Two SWE Internships: One at a unicorn startup, one at a Fortune 500 tech company. Also got paid as a GSI for 3 semesters for various CS courses.
* Publications: None, though am currently working in an AI research lab on campus.
* LORs: 1 from head of research lab I'm in, 3 from professors of classes I have served as a GSI for, and 1 from a manager at a previous internship.

(I'm also an American citizen– I'm not sure if that matters at all, but I've noticed most people in Masters programs are international students.) Right now, I'm only applying for 5 MS programs: Stanford, Harvard, Columbia, CMU, and the 5th-year Masters program at Berkeley. Each of these is pretty selective, so I'm pretty worried that I won't be able to get into any of them for next year. Should I add some other MS programs as backup, or will these suffice? Thanks!"
dmj037,71,2019-10-24,"My new highly paid coworker is insanely dumb, but also mean.",theworstvacationever,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/dmj037/my_new_highly_paid_coworker_is_insanely_dumb_but/,"TL;DR: New co-worker said something that really offended me, but I don't know whether to complain or not. I'm not sure if it only offended me because I already don't like her, or what I would accomplish by saying something.

TL:

For the past six years I've worked at a small visual arts nonprofit (very surprising we have an HR issue, I know!) that is going through a slight expansion period. Recently, the person who was essentially the ""office manager,"" who had worked here for 14 years, retired. This prompted everyone to restructure her job because she was responsible for a truly insane number of things. We were already planning to hire a new Comms person, but because of this person's retirement, we decided to hire an Office Manager and an Admin Assistant who would report to me (Program manager) and the new Comms person.

One person applied to the Office Manager job that my co-director had a passing familiarity with through another arts org we worked with like three years ago and hired her immediately without consulting the other director or anyone else. I don't have a problem with this per se, but every other hire we typically have some input on. (A few years ago she unilaterally offered a truly terrible intern we had a full time job and everyone had to tell her that was a very bad idea and she had to embarrassingly walk back the offer, just for reference).

So in September we got ""Jess"". She was at her previous job for 5 years, but it was her first and only job. Some of the things she does are just kind of annoying: she'll email people not physically in the office to ask where, like, a stapler is; she's in her early 30s and uses ellipses like a boomer; she calls peoples direct line to ask questions when she's sitting right next to them; she doesn't know how to use Google Drive so she'll keep making new docs every time she makes a change. It's kind of like every day she goes home and forgets everything she learned.

Other stuff is truly impeding everyone's work: she has to do some very basic financial reporting once a week and every week she asks how she's supposed to do it, and then does it wrong, and then I do it for her while explaining how to do it. She's doing duplicative work and ignores when we tell her things she's doing already exist. This week alone my boss has given me three separate tasks that could basically be summed up as ""make sure Jess is doing things right."" I know some people are slow learners, but she visibly bristles when we try to explain things to her, and in terms of figuring things out on her own, I would characterize her as ""terminally incurious"".

But like, fine, whatever, she's still relatively new and maybe she's nervous. And luckily, the new Comms person we hired is really great! I genuinely enjoy working with her. She's bringing a lot of smart ideas and fresh energy to the organization, which would be even better if we had an assistant to help us make these things a reality because we simply don't have the time.

Me and the Comms person asked the director when we can hire the assistant we were both promised and were told, ""well we just hired Jess, do we really need an assistant?"" Which, yes, because we need design and web support, areas in which Jess is almost comically unequipped. Director gave in but told us the new hire's salary was mysteriously $25k less than we were originally told. We have been unable to find someone who will work for the salary we're offering.

Not really all of that context was necessary but it felt good to write it all out instead of just endlessly complaining with my coworkers in G-chat (seriously since she was hired I don't think there's been 2 hours without someone chatting about something weird or fucked up she did).

So, this brings me to The Event. This Tuesday I found out one of my very close friends died unexpectedly. I was really really shocked and I still periodically almost cry. This whole wall of texts feels so stupid when I think about the fragility of life but whatever I guess. That morning I texted our work gonna-be-late group chat saying ""I just found out my friend died so I think I'm gonna be late lol.""

The ""lol"" might not have been wise, but everyone kind of understood it was an ""lol at the absurdity of existence"" and everyone except Jess privately reached out to me asking if I was okay.

I came in visibly crying, which I guess also might not have been wise. The first thing anyone said to me was fucking Jess going ""Was your message true?"" to which I was only have to respond ""what"" and she just repeated the question. And, still crying, I said ""About my dead friend?"" and she said ""yeah is that why you were late?"" and I just stormed off to another part of the office.

No bosses were present, but everyone else was pretty shocked and gchatted amongst themselves and to me. Like an hour+ later, she came back to me and said ""About before. Are we good?"" and I said ""I guess so"" (Quick note, I was still crying). Then she said, ""and also about last week, that meeting, are we good with that?"" to which I also responded yes. I genuinely have no idea what that was in reference to. Whatever she was not-really-apologizing for there certainly was not worthy of being brought up in the same conversation as not-really-apologizing for insinuating I made up a horrific lie to be 15 minutes late to work.

So like, that was Tuesday and today is Thursday. I'm still pretty fucking furious at her even though she gave me a garbage apology. I kind of want to say something to the non-hiring co-director with whom I'm very close, but I also don't want to seem like I'm blowing something out of proportion because I already do not like her. I'm also not sure if I AM blowing something out of proportion because I already do not like her. I also don't know what I even would want accomplished by saying something.

dmj908,2,2019-10-24,Do older computers/operating systems/browsers determine pixels differently than newer systems?,DaCush,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/dmj908/do_older_computersoperating_systemsbrowsers/,"I'm getting frustrated on learning responsive design.  I've looked up tons of articles and everyone has a different opinion on which units to use in what situation.  I decided this go around for my class assignment that I would try and use all ""ems"" and ""rems"" and maybe a viewport unit or two.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally use a 4k 14""  laptop running one of the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox dual booting Windows 10 and a Debian based Linux distribution (Deepin OS).  I am not worried about responsive design in terms of smaller devices yet on this project because it's not required for the assignment so there are no breakpoints.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue comes into play when viewed on my laptop, everything looks completely fine.  When a classmate viewed my project, they could only see half of the site and had to use a horizontal scrollbar to see the right half of it.  So I jumped on my mother's old laptop and I saw the same result.  So I assumed this had something to do with the resolution (even though my 4k screen is scaled).

BUT, then I came into my internship and showed it to a co-worker and he opened it up on his pretty new 1080p 14"" laptop and the site looked completely fine.  Wtf?  What's going on here?

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering, does this have something to do with older computers/browsers/operating systems considering a pixel a hardware pixel while newer systems determine a pixel as 96px=1in, scaling everything appropriately?   Since ems and rems are inherently based off of your pixel size, it shouldn't change much should it?  Should I only use ems and rems for fonts while using pixels for margin, padding, etc?

&amp;#x200B;

This is the github of the project I'm talking about: [https://www.github.com/cushmatt/Monument-Website-Re-Design](https://www.github.com/cushmatt/Monument-Website-Re-Design)

This is a live version of the project via netlify: [https://friendly-ptolemy-b607cc.netlify.com/](https://friendly-ptolemy-b607cc.netlify.com/)

And this is the classmate's screenshot she sent me of what it looked like on her computer and what it also ended up looking like on my mother's old laptop as well: [https://github.com/cushmatt/Monument-Website-Re-design/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20of%20Matt's%20U3DB1%20Post.jpg](https://github.com/cushmatt/Monument-Website-Re-design/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20of%20Matt's%20U3DB1%20Post.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any feedback on this and hopefully you can help solve my confusion.  My co-worker helped me out a bunch in terms of thinking in breakpoints but for some reason I think there's more to this in terms of why it would fit perfectly on his 14"" 1080p laptop screen but not on my mother's 14"" 1080p laptop screen.

dmnfjb,2,2019-10-24,Being shy is the fucking worst.,prussiancucumber,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dmnfjb/being_shy_is_the_fucking_worst/,"I write this with tears in my eyes because I fucked up again, so sorry that this is super inarticulate. I'm a 16 year old female who has been incredibly shy/quiet/introverted my entire life, but this past year its gotten really bad. Here are some examples:

\- I joined an academic team at my school last year and I went through the entire thing talking to no one except for the one person I know personally

\- I was denied a leadership position in my high school's marching band to a person younger then me because of what I suspect to be my shyness.

\- I joined the debate team last year and I froze up in a debate in front of the entire school.

\- Yesterday I had a debate tournament and I was too shy to actually go up and speak (Even though thats the entire fucking point I know) and I got called out for it and now im sad.

\- I haven't made a friend since freshman year and that wouldn't have happened if it werent for being introduced by the people around me. 

To make matters worse I am heavily involved in my community local-politics wise. I intern at a local state delegate's office, I canvassed with my dad during the 2018 midterms, and I'm in charge of a local branch of a national movement. At the state delegate's office I'm known to be super quiet and haven't really interacted much with the politician himself which is uh not fucking good, my dad did most of the talking during the canvassing, and I have only recently been put in charge of this stuff and frankly I don't know what the fuck to do. I don't know why I chose to do these interaction heavy duties, I just felt like I had a duty to do it (because I care a lot), so I did my best which isn't enough.

Now I feel like i'm disappointing people who expect me to be this great charismatic leader n shit. Ironically, I've actually given a few speeches that have gone shockingly well, but its hit or miss, and that just kills me.

It is the thing that is holding me back. I never talk in class and I never talk to anyone, and when I do its painfully awkward. I'm thankful that I have a good friend group, but they are here because I've accumalated them since preschool or I met them through a friend. I'm too awkward to actually go up to people, and if they come up to me, I don't have much to say and I don't give them much to work with, so I basically reject them without wanting to.

The worst part is that i'm unhappy on my own. I get lonely easily and I don't enjoy doing things on my own as much as I would with other people, but apparentally my brain is broken and I can't fucking talk to people.

I'm so worried about what I'm going to do after HS. I'm too awkward to approach people and I have trouble making human connections, and I've picked a human connection heavy field and I have college coming up, where I'll know little to no people.

Please help me. my confidence and self esteem is just so low and I don't know what to do."

Two in Dallas and one in Houston. The Dallas ones are paycom and Texas Instruments, Houston is Baker Hughes.

Currently interested in all of them since they are all fairly business related software development. 

Anyone have some opinions on what you would pick and why?? 

Kinda stressing on what offer to take. 

Pay is pretty much the same, have a house in Houston so living is easier there. Not too worried about the pay or living expense.....just don’t quite know on what internship would help my career the most.

I’m hoping to find some sort of internship this summer. I will have done 2 classes of programming and a digital electronics course. Other than that it’s just math and physics classes and a few engineering classes (I was EE before switching to CS and did Statics, a CAD class, and Dynamics). A lot of the internships I’ve looked at, especially those in computer hardware or software, are requiring a lot more skills than I have at this point.

I know Python but at a lower level I figured sure I’ll apply why not. I mean it’s an internship. So I did the Pymetrics assessment and they sent me a hirevue interview link along with a coding challenge the following morning.

As far as my skill goes with Python, I can make lists, loops, if statements, basics of making functions. That’s pretty much it. I’m learning it in class and watching tutorials on youtube. I just don’t think Im ready to do an actual software engineer internship given the level of my “skill” or lack there of.

I read another post about this internship and someone mentioned that there is a “balancing parentheses” and “Happy Numbers” coding question. I haven’t learned any of this stuff yet. Not sure what to do.

Question is:

Should I even bother doing it? (Fake it till I make it, or keep learning and apply to other opportunities.)

TL:DR
Python noob, MIS major/CS Minor, applied to software engineer internship, got a reply with a coding challenge and hirevue interview. Anxious because I might embarrass myself. Continue or back out?"

So, I just started my first job as a programmer, it's an internship and I'm on my second semester. Until now I had only seen C/C++ I was really enjoying it. But now, on my second month working as an intern(I was told to study some webdev languages on the first month) I got assigned to a project where I'll develop front and back-end. I'll use angular on the front-end and I'll be using Zend framework to handle services on the back-end. Today was the first day, and I was told to create a service, and I spent the whole day just staring at my screen trying to figure anything out, and I was just completely overwhelmed. I have no idea where to start from, what any of those folders are for, how to ""communicate"" with the DB, well, basically I couldn't do shit. I studied DB, php and angular on the first month, but it doesn't seem like I know anything about it when I try to get on with the first task. This whole situation gave me a really bad feeling, I have even started wondering wheter this is for me or not. Is this feeling normal? How can I overcome it? Thank you in advance!

dmqb1u,0,2019-10-24,Which way to choose to get into an area difficult to get into,hmmppff,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dmqb1u/which_way_to_choose_to_get_into_an_area_difficult/,"Hey, 
 I find it difficult to find get into the area I am interested in and not be sorted out by recruiters for higher qualified persons (at least this was the response I got - if any).

But so far, i just see these ways:
1. Do a lot of internships in the area I am interested and so slowly get enough eyperience for a ""real"" job. 
2. Do a master degree, which is not really needed in this area and maybe 1. as far as possible.
3. Settle for a rather boring job to get general professional experience (even though not so relevant for the actual job, just to have CS experience)
4. Working halftime and doing what i really like (unpaid) in the other half (But probably tough to find a company to offer halftime to a beginner) and so going into the area I am interested in with private projects.

What do you think would work out best?

I just kept it general to let the discussion not get distracted."
dmqbyg,1,2019-10-24,How do I ask my boss about either taking a new position or working for a different company?,fysez,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dmqbyg/how_do_i_ask_my_boss_about_either_taking_a_new/,"I work part-time for two companies while going to school full-time. Both jobs are flexible on my school schedule. 

Job A lets me put in as many hours as I want, so I usually stick to about 20. 
Job B is kicking off more projects soon, and they want me to work too many hours to keep both jobs. 

I asked job A about taking a new position, one which lets me work from home as to supplement my school schedule better. Since I'm technically a (paid) intern, they said no since it's company policy, but that after my contract is up (in two months) they could change my status to contractor. That was the end of the discussion. 

Now that job B wants me to put all of my time into them, it's difficult to work both jobs and go to school. But I will take them over job A if job A doesn't give me the new contracting position. 

How do I tell job A that I need to know if I'll get the contracting position otherwise I'll be leaving?"
dmr0nw,2,2019-10-24,"Can't seem to get my first job in my field. Discouraged, and feel I need a change. Should I get a broader degree or keep applying for jobs?",AlphaMod,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dmr0nw/cant_seem_to_get_my_first_job_in_my_field/,"So, I'm approaching the two year mark since I graduated and I've had no success in acquiring any work experience. All I want is a job in my field but I'm extremely discouraged. I apply on plenty of job sites but the majority of the work requires 2+ years work experience which I don't have. 

.

Let me elaborate. I went out of state to a private college due to a scholarship and to get some experience on my own. I've got a BA in fine arts with a focus on animation and storyboarding. I know in the creative/entertainment industry connections are what really matter, but I know absolutely no one. I wasn't able to get any internships where I was and the college didn't really afford me very many connections. The ones I did make are spread throughout the country and can't really help me. 

.

Every industry person I've talked to thus far, when I ask how they got their first job (which is what I need most) they always say ""Well, I knew this guy... etc"" and I swear, the next person I ask for advice and they begin their sentence with ""I knew this guy/gal/co-worker, etc."" I'm going to punch them in the face. It's not like I know this miracle person, and whenever I ask to be introduced it's always an evasive answer or they don't have their contact info. It's the catch-22 of job hunting. People will obviously hire someone who has experience, but I can't GET the experience because they DON'T HIRE me. It's a loop I can't break through because I don't have any industry experience in my job field.

.

I'm aware of my abilities. I'm skilled, above average, but that's not good enough. If I got actual interviews I could probably make my case, much easier to do so in person, but these days with pretty much everything being walled by the ""online application"" gateway its hard to know if my applications are even getting to the people they need to. Nowadays you can't just print up a resume, walk into the company headquarters and ask for an interview. And even I've been applying to a place for six months, I'll always lose out to the guy who's applied for two weeks but has an uncle in the business who can just slap his nephew's resume in front of the guy who's in charge or hiring and force him to look at it.

.

I'm just... I know my industry is competitive and not really viable in the job market, and this past year I've slowly come to terms with it. I feel stuck. I'm 25, applying everywhere I can, working as a waiter and I'm sick and tired on waiting for an opportunity to present itself. I try to put myself out there, but it seems like I've had no luck. No sign of that guy/gal/person who will point me in the right direction. 

.

Thus, I've been thinking about going back to college to get a broader degree. Maybe an english or engineering degree that'll make it easier to find a job. I LOVE animation and making stories, but I need some stability and I can't keep this up. Instead of getting a job I love, I feel its time to start putting in work to get a job that'll just pay the bills and put food on the table. 

.

Sorry if I ranted, but I just needed to get this off my chest and ask if ANYONE has any advice for me. Whether it be job hunting, making connections, the benefits of going back to college or keep applying. I'm in a rut and I'm open to any advice given to me. I would appreciate a little direction or some perspective before making the next step."
dmrmv5,0,2019-10-24,Transferring Majors to CS in Spring 2019 to Dream Internship Offer Today! Story and Advice,ChristianTechBoy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dmrmv5/transferring_majors_to_cs_in_spring_2019_to_dream/," 

Today  I got the email that I've been looking forward to all my life; an offer  from my dream company. I am beyond humbled and blessed to have gotten  this offer, and thought that writing down my experience on how I got  this gig would be helpful for all of you that feel like you ""started too  late."" **Disclaimer: I understand  that I do not have a plethora of experience or knowledge, but wanted to  post this in hopes of encouraging and helping those who are in  university, especially the ones who feel they can never ""make it.""**

**Before CS**

I  actually entered my school as another engineering major, hoping to  transfer to the CS major. I'd been really hoping to get in but did not,  and really did not like my freshman year's worth of courses. Right as my  first year of college was ending, I heard about a new major that was  being designed at my school for a blend of Computer Science and  Economics. This had been my dream major; I'm someone who I'd say enjoys  both the technicalities and the implications of products and their  interaction with consumers. I thus enrolled in sophomore year first  semester into the required core courses to transfer, one of them being  my data structures course. At this point, I didn't even get the chance  to interview at the career fair since I wasn't officially a CS major, so  of course, I didn't bother. I put my head down and got good enough  grades to meet the transfer requirements; for the major, that's really  all you need. I applied this past Spring for transferring and got in!

**Not in** **~~Non-CS Major~~** **Kansas Anymore**

As  soon as I transferred, I raced towards getting the next class I knew I  needed for my career: algorithms. At our school, algorithms was very  much considered the hardest course in all of the university, factoring  in time, difficulty of material, and average competence of a student  within this course. I got absolutely **slammed**.  I didn't do so bad as to fail, but that was really thanks to my team:  one guy was salutatorian of his near-top nationally high school, and the  other had a 4.0, won some competition freshman year and got an offer  from Google; he'd been working there for two years. **I'd never felt so dumb in my life.**  It sometimes felt like my brain was quite literally a pea next to these  guys, and imposter syndrome plus self-confidence issues were abounding.  I was doing fine in other courses, it was just so difficult to do well  in this course while being a first-semester transfer. In addition, I was  interviewing and quickly discovered every single place was completely  filled up that I wanted (minus a few). The tech companies recruit, as  you all know, in the fall, so I was quite bummed. I got OA's for a few  companies like Amazon, but I got slammed on them because I barely  remembered how to reverse a linked list and did not LeetCode nearly  enough. However, I managed to find a company that would take me without  worrying about my technical skills, one that was highly rated on  Glassdoor and had a great culture of mentorship and giving to their  interns. **When you can't get the  top cream of the crop, look for strong names in company reputation that  fit the products or industry you enjoy.** It was through my luck  of finding this opportunity that I got an offer for an internship to  work for them; they even, when hearing about my passion in emerging  technologies like blockchain and ML, pivoted their offering position to  create a ""beta test"" position for me. Instead of just doing testing and  debugging for 10 weeks, they offered me an opportunity to design  improvements or new solutions in their delivery unit. I accepted with  great thanks.

**Great Company, Great People, Bad Fit**

I  really did enjoy my internship, as well as the people I learned from. I  really got along with my boss, and I was even being looked at as a  breath of fresh air. The company was a consulting firm at heart;  customer services and billable hours were the name of the game, and  amidst the swarm of Finance, Economics, and Accounting majors, a dabble  of Industrial Engineering and Mechanical Engineering consultants  existed, but few computer science majors who worked as a consultant. It  was a unique experience because quite literally nobody was doing what I  was doing; however, I worked hard at learning and began to develop a  reputation for myself as a (very much relative to my peers) technology  solutions expert. I helped them out with determining feasibility in  product ideas, as well as with building out system architectures on  these ideas. However, the feeling of loneliness, in addition to the long  commute I was making from home (instead of corporate housing) led me to  feel a bit of imposter syndrome yet again. I ended up not interacting  with others as much during lunch or my free time, and the company itself  would really struggle to offer a position to someone whose position  didn't have a clear ROI. As a result, my boss gave me the talk at the  end of the summer and encouraged me to go out and find a place that'd  fit my desire for the cutting edge. Amidst my development of solution  improvements, I was designing a lot of proof of concepts within their  partner company, Microsoft, on Azure. Thinking this would be my  leverage, I set out in this semester to hit my end goal.

**The Grind**

There  just isn't a person who faces adversities on their journey to success  and does not have to persist with resilience. It's a fact of the matter  that I had to work very hard at preparing myself for interviews. I  edited my resume, brought it in to student career services, then used  VMock, their own online resume reviewing service to perfect it. I looked  up companies that I added to a spreadsheet and I thought of ways I  could fit into their company as I did research and carefully considered  my options. I did not just think I would be going for only Microsoft; I  ended up applying to 60+ internships as a whole, because I really wanted  anyone who would take me as an ""almost there"" sort of candidate. My  leverage with my Azure experience pushed me through to an on-campus, and  my genuine love for the company and what it stands for pushed me  through to the final round. All of this while juggling my coursework,  extracurriculars, and the incredibly arduous LC grind was most  definitely tiring if not downright depressing. But I had my eyes fixed  on the goal, and through the support of my community and believe in the  return on investment I kept pushing. At the end of the day, I practiced  my leetcode enough to know how to solve or begin my approach to almost  any LC easy-medium, and did my research to show a clear pathway to each  company I spoke to of how I could fit in for them. I'll admit my  communication skills were innate and did give me an advantage, but  everything else was very hard earned. I cannot express enough thanks to  the community that surrounds me, and for God who has carried me through  this past year. It's absolutely insane to think that I made this sort of  accomplishment, and I really am humbled. All the glory to Him!

**Misc. Advice and Kinda TL;DR**

* **Keep persisting and searching for opportunities to grow.**  Don't do every single thing, but pick what you think will really  contribute to you and your personal brand. Every podcast episode, every  video tutorial, every online course, every assignment that could be  relevant to your end goal WILL have its return on the initial difficult  cost.
* **Utilize this subreddit, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Jumpstart, and any other resource you**.  The last one is less heard of, but I do encourage everyone to at least  have an account on these platforms. Jumpstart is basically a forum for  discussing internships and new grad together on forums; they all helped  me in a variety of ways. I'm especially thankful to the insight and  motivation this subreddit has provided me, as well as the various news,  insights, and honest confessions of people. If you do have an internship  work email address, try using it to access Blind; it's pretty decently  useful too.
* **Find a company that aligns with your passions and values, not the other way around.**  If you can't express a genuine strong desire to work at a place, then  they won't feel like you're worth it over any other candidate. The  biggest thing that I think set me apart in my interviews with Microsoft  were my passion and genuine interest in the company, in addition to the  Azure experience I had last summer.
* **Keep a community around you that'll help you.**  If you're surrounded by people who just tell you to ""take it easy,""  you'll really struggle to find encouragement in the difficulties. I'm  not saying to throw away your current friends; build and expand your  network and find others who encourage you and are there with you every  step of the way. For me, it was a Church fellowship.
* **Keep your eyes fixed on the prize.**  Amidst solving and going through 50 LC questions in the span of a few  weeks, I got really fed up at times with what I was doing, and I wasn't  even working the hardest I'm sure. It's okay to mess up an interview or  feel like an idiot because you forgot how to count duplicates in a  string. There are a million more opportunities, and you'll get there in a  twisty curvy path if needed; it'll grow you and make you stronger.

That's  about all I have to say for now. Feel free to ask any questions you  have. Again, I hope this is an encouragement to everyone who reads it  and I hope to be of help to anyone who wants it. God Bless!"

My first internship was a train wreck. One of my friends was contacted by this guy on Linkedin who was searching for a couple of interns for his IoT based company. My friend who was basically a researcher in Machine learning forwarded the requirement to me and told me to have a look. The office was a little far away so I took another friend of mine and the both of us went there are talked to the LinkedIn guy. He had no idea what he wanted, was a douche(when I think of him now) but he just had a lot of money and didn't know what to do with it. We had no idea how the industry works so he let us talk to his dev team and they explained what they wanted and finally we had a deal(no selection process, no interview whatsoever) and both me and my friend(lets call him A) got in. We started work immediately and it was basically GPS device management via a TCP server and dumping the gps data onto a database after some raw data processing. It wasn't really fun and I started regretting after a month. However the internship period was only for two months so we somehow completed what he wanted, took our money and got the fuck out of there.

Cut to one year later(4th year CS grad) we stared applying for companies because this time we had to do a 5 month internship which actually had credits (unlike the first time) and we had to do a report in Latex and some crazy shit. So everyone in our class started applying to companies and I got rejected again and again by various companies to the point where I almost had around a 100 mails in my inbox saying ""unfortunately we could not find you the best fit in our organization"". God, that sentence bugs me out. I literally had no other choice so I went back to the same place. And Oh my God. Its even worse. He lost the best workers in his team because he stopped paying them. He didn't tell me about any of the financial issue he's into but made me an offer saying its a paid internship along with the amount written in the letter. I hardly got 2 months of stipend and I'm yet to get 60,000 INR. There was no NDA signed, no structure in the organization. It was literally a shit hole. Slowly people had to leave the team because of lack of money but I decided to stay because going through multiple rounds of interview during the office times wasn't working out for me and I had to get a certificate from him for college purposes. Finally I got my certificate(but not the money) and I submitted my report but it was more than a train wreck. I wrote a big ass codebase this time and I was the only developer who migrated the old tech stack to the newer and a faster one. It was really difficult but I don't thank anyone but myself because I busted my ass and learnt a lot of CI/CD and docker and kubernetes during this period. I know people will come forward and tell me that even if I didn't get enough money out of it I had a good experience but that's not true because my bill aren't gonna get paid by themselves and food isn't free. Remember this: ""You need money and learning. Without either one you're fucked.""

After I came out of that shit hole, I started applying to companies again because univ is boring and my whole surrounding is really really bad and its really depressing here. I do a lot of photography and one of my seniors in college messaged me on instagram about how great my pictures are and we got to talking. So I asked him if his company was hiring any backend developers and he said that they actually are looking for interns who're willing to work. So I applied immediately and it was a tedious selection process.

Round 1: I applied and passed the resume round i.e they liked my resume and would like to see what I know.

Round 2: Then they gave me an assignment where I had to solve a real world problem using backend technologies.

Round 3: Technical round interview via a phone call. The guy who interviewed me was actually pretty cool and we actually got along on the phone itself.

Round 4: The HR round was really not that significant. They asked me basic stuff about my hobbies and what work environment I would like to work in, and some stuff about my schooling and college experiences as a dev guy.

Round 5: I had to talk to the co founder of the company who lives in Singapore and damn that guy made me want to kill myself with the questions and their depth. It wasn't technical but it was like a HR round but which almost transformed into a therapy session lol. I laugh now that I think about it.

But I got the offer immediately after a background verification of my identity, location basis and all that. And that was two days ago. It a really kickass company doing most of the stuff which I'm familiar with and have dealt with before. The food is free and the compensation is really good. It starts in January and I'm really excited about it.

So what I was getting at is, guys unexpected events happen all the time and you just need to be in the zone to observe it and catch hold of it. Last year I was literally the last person to get an internship in a company but this year I'm almost among the people who already got an offer very early. My friends made fun of me because I was broke most of the time but I took it in a positive way and just kept working and learning harder. 

So I wish everyone good luck. Good things are on your way. Just believe in yourself and no one else. Only yourself. :)"

Right now I’m working an internship as a systems engineer and it’s definitely not what I want although I do enjoy it some and I definitely am getting some experience out of it. But most of the time I feel like I don’t have enough work to do and when I do get work a lot of the times I feel like it’s not teaching me what I need to know for a software engineering field. The CTO also makes me not want to ask questions with the way he answers them sometimes. He’s also very pedantic about things that I think shouldn’t be matter much in the larger scheme of things. For example, he’ll spend time correcting grammar on some of the web posts (and he’s the CTO!) I even feel like I waste my time doing that and I’m an intern

I just had another internship interview for a video game company and realized it’s mostly using GUIs to build stuff for the game so that’s now what I want either since it didn’t seem like there’s much Coding. 

I’m also realizing there’s an infinite amount of frameworks, languages, technologies, etc and I learn one and stop using others and I feel like I can never catch up that there‘a way too much to learn. Every job posting  wants you to know different frameworks or languages and you could never possibly know them all.

I got into this field because I was inspired by Elon Musk. I want to change the world. But I feel like I’m not good enough. The repositories I’m working on are massive and complicated and there’s an infinite amount to learn. I have no idea what most of the files are doing.  

I’ve applied to every internship in Orlando and haven’t heard from any of them. There also aren’t a lot in my city and I thought there would be. I’m kind of stuck on what to do and feel lost. Thankfully I’m taking next semester off and plan on teaching myself what I think will be valuable (mostly c++, python, and Leetcode)."

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first time posting here on CS Career Questions.

What I am wondering about is your opinions on which University I should attend, because the programs I am looking at are very different. The schools I am looking into are 100% online because I will be moving shortly, and will not be in the physical location of these schools. I also prefer the flexibility of asynchronous learning because I work full time as an IT Specialist (kind of like a sys-admin light), and this way of learning allows me to take classes full time. I am also in training for more of a data/database focused role switch soon. My goal is to land a job either in software development or in a data science role. I understand the field of data science is very broad, and I would not have a preference in either how technical it is or more business focused it is. The following programs are mostly bachelor completions, and I will be transferring from my current school.

Option 1: Northeastern University offers a 100% online BS in analytics through their college of professional studies.

[https://cps.northeastern.edu/academics/program/bachelor-science-analytics](https://cps.northeastern.edu/academics/program/bachelor-science-analytics)

Option 2: Northeastern University also offers a 100% online BS in information technology through their college of professional studies.

[https://cps.northeastern.edu/academics/program/bachelor-science-information-technology-online](https://cps.northeastern.edu/academics/program/bachelor-science-information-technology-online)

Option 3: Penn State offers an online BS in Software Engineering through their world campus.

[https://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/penn-state-online-software-engineering-bachelors-degree/overview](https://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/penn-state-online-software-engineering-bachelors-degree/overview)

Option 4: Auburn University offers a BS in Computer Science.

[https://csonline.eng.auburn.edu/](https://csonline.eng.auburn.edu/)

&amp;#x200B;

From what I have researched, Northeastern seems to be the highest quality school in my list, but I wanted input to see if these degrees would be respected in regards to the jobs I wanted. They also offer an extensive co-op program (kind of like a full time internship).

&amp;#x200B;

Penn State University Park is a high ranking school as well, and most of this program seems like it goes through their main campus. It is also ABET certified, which i am not sure is very valued. My concern is if the degree is respected to the level that the main campus would be since it seems some/most courses are taught from professors at satellite schools in the Penn State system.

&amp;#x200B;

Auburn is the lowest ranked school on my list, but it seems that the degree itself would be very relevant to what jobs I wanted. It is also SACS certified, but I don't know what that means or how valued it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate some input and advice as to what you would do in my situation!"
dn21c4,1,2019-10-25,"[Product Management] Nearing the end of new grad recruiting season, feeling lost",ConfidentSentence,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dn21c4/product_management_nearing_the_end_of_new_grad/,"Hi all,

I am a college senior graduating next spring with a degree in Applied Math and CS. It's nearing the end of the recruiting season for most of the new grad pm programs and I unfortunately have not managed to secure an offer. I got onsites with both Uber and Fb, which were also the only two companies to even give me a chance to interview because I got referrals, but ultimately they didn't pan out.

I knew that it would be competitive, but it is pretty discouraging to be rejected at the resume stage if I didn't have a referral (or in the case of Google, even when I did have a referral). I go to a top school, have decent grades, did two PM internships (albeit both at obscure startups) and put in the work to prepare for interviews. None of this means I deserve to have an offer but it is still quite disappointing to be in this position.

People are always quick to advise students to pursue these new grad programs if they want to break into PM, but what do you do when that's no longer an option? I'm still very interested in the field and I feel like being able to pass 5 phone screens at top companies (3 for Fb and 2 for Uber) is probably some indication that I would be competent at the role. If anyone who has been in my position could give some guidance, it would be much appreciated. Are there any PM-adjacent roles I can pursue instead? SWE is not really an option for me; while I have taken several cs courses, I don't like/am not good at coding, and I lack previous technical internships that would even get me interviews.

On that note, if anyone happens to be interested in hiring a new grad for an entry level PM role or knows someone who is, feel free to dm me! (ideally in the bay area or greater nyc, but honestly I'll take what I can get)"

This is a crucial question for my future, I hope any of you could be of any assistance.  


December last year I was selected for a full time bootcamp here in Belgium.  
We would see all these subjects: Git, HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery, NPM, API's, PHP, Node.js, React, Wordpress.  


The thing here is, it was a very exciting thing to see all these technologies in such a short timeframe, but I was barely able to grasp any of them. The teaching was quite bad and it was more a self-taught bootcamp. It was mostly just watching youtube tutorials about the subject at hand..  
I know all the stuff in my curriculum does, and how you implement them and so on, I can make some stuff with these languages if I follow a youtube tutorial.. But I don't know them in depth at all. We never had any tests or stuff like that.  
I can't use any of these skills in a professional environment.

How ashamed I am to admit I still can't properly use loops and iterations in JavaScript without just blatantly copy pasting some code.

The only thng I can somewhat manage is the front-end web development, when I can use a bootstrap template and have a customer that is relatively easy to please.   


After 7 months of bootcamp I did a 2 month internship at a small digital agency where I would mostly make HTML websites from Sketch files I got from the designer.  
I learned a lot there, but when I talked with my mentor he said something I already knew: 'You work hard, but you are not there yet on a professional level. I have had the same issues with former students from your coding school, it feels like they try to teach you to much of everything.'  
Although I was a crushed after hearing that, I couldn't agree more..

I also bottled a couple of technical tests for job interviews, and I know that even if I'm lucky enough to get a position somewhere it will be hell for both me as the employer since I don't have the tools nor the workethic at this moment.  


I just have to be honest to myself and find something that suits me better, but I don't want to give up.

I really need to find a job at this moment in the IT sector, since I am currently living without wages because of doing the bootcamp and not having any unemployment benefits.  


Thank you"
dn2myy,2,2019-10-25,Struggling with internship decision...,rubicon7653,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dn2myy/struggling_with_internship_decision/,"Hi all,

I’m kind of struggling with my decision about my internship for next summer and was just wondering what you think about it, or what you would do in my situation.

For some background, I am a second year computer science student, but I am graduating in May 2021, so I am especially trying to get a good internship this year either to get a full time return offer where I intern or to set me up better for full time interviews at big target companies. I did not intern last summer, so it is crucial that I get SOMETHING this summer. 

Now here’s the actual situation. My internship search has been going better than I thought so far. Having no prior internships, I had expected little to nothing, but I’ve been interviewing with ~10-15 places and I have offers from 2 already. One offer is one that I almost surely won’t take, however the other offer is from a place I really like—the culture seems great, I think I would like the work I do, and the pay/location is decent. They aren’t a big name or prestigious, but it wouldn’t matter for a full-time search if I ultimately wanted to return there anyways. However this offer has a deadline of November 1st. 

I am basically torn on whether to accept this offer that expires Nov. 1st or to risk it and go for something better. I am in the final interview stage for 3 companies right now, and still interviewing with many others (including big N), so I probably won’t end up without an internship, but I can’t say for sure that I will be able to find a better offer than what I have now. I know I would prefer a big N offer for sure, but that’s still up in the air completely (interviews still coming up with Amazon and G). Also, I know I would like one of the offers from a company I’m in the final stages with equally, but final interview doesn’t mean guaranteed offer. Basically, if I had all the offers now I would prefer them in order of Big N &gt;&gt; Company A = Company B &gt; The rest, where company A is the company I have an offer with.  I feel pretty good about all my interviews coming up, and I feel like I know my data structures and algorithms very well, but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush...

Accepting and reneging if I get a better offer is an option, but I like the company and wouldn’t want to burn any future bridges by accepting without 100% committing to work there. Plus, my university says they dish out serious consequences for reneging on an offer, and this company has a good relationship with my university.

If you followed my rambling the whole way through, thank you. What would you do? Would you accept the sure offer that’s good, but not great? Or would you go for a great offer (and hope you still have a good offer to fall back on)?

**TL;DR** : I have a good offer from a place I like but it expires soon. If I decline the offer, I have final interviews with places I think would have equal or probably marginally worse offers, but I would also have a chance at better offers. Do I play it safe or do I go for something better?"

For a long time, I’ve been the kind of person where a person gives me an “inch” and I take a “mile.” And in my case of this, it happens with work. 


I’m a senior in college right now, and I’m starting to very much take advantage of my boss at both my job and internship, and I need to gain more self discipline to stop this.  I have called out of my internship twice, and while I usually end up making up the hours after the fact, I notice that after I’m given the green light to call out once, I do it more often, as I always promise to make up the hours. While it’s good I make up the hours, I feel I shouldn’t even call out in the first place. The reasons I call out aren’t exactly good, and usually revolve around my own desire to not go, rather than an actual issue.


For example, today, my plan was to makeup hours from earlier this week and go for four hours. I was supposed to go in at 2pm, however, I emailed my boss at 1:50pm while I was in bed, and said I was “sick” and need to call out, and will make up those hours next week.  The actual reason I called out was because I got 3 hours of sleep and couldn’t/didn’t want to go.


I’m just not sure what I should do, as I know it’s bad but I keep doing it.  Is there any way you guys force yourself to do things when you don’t necessarily want to?

However, I have a final interview coming up for a fairly large company (company B) that I have pretty good chances of getting. The thing is, their internship is 5/1/2020-8/1/2020, which interferes with the contract for company A. How possible would it be for me to be able to negotiate for the contract to be a month or so less, that way it finishes around April? Is this common practice in this industry?

Why does everyone feel the fucking need to compare their FUCKING stats and internships and grades Jesus Christ. Have you ever considered that no one gives a shit about how bad you did on an exam or how well you did or what internships you’re applying to? 

What in the world ever happened to just learning for the sake of learning. I’m sick of grade grubbing and fucking manipulative people HOSTING A FUCKIN POLL OF GRADES TO PREDICT THE MEAN OF AN EXAM BEFORE ITS ANNOUNCED. I’m sick of people joking that they’re going to SWITCH TO HOTEL BECAUSE THEY FAILED A PHYSICS EXAM. CONSIDER THIS: if you think you’re better than any one or any college you’re fucking dead wrong. STEM MAJORS, YOU ARE ALL FUCKING THE SAME AS ANYONE ELSE. CS/ENGINEERING/MATH/PHYS/EVERY MAJORS, YOUR MAJOR ISNT FUCKING HARD OKAY? SPEND LESS TIME THINKING YOURE BETTER THAN PEOPLE AND MORE TIME LEARNING, THEN MAYBE I dont HAVE TO HEAR YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT FAILING AN EXAM OR HOW MUCH SELF ABUSE YOU ENDURE TO COMPLETE YOUR CLASSES. 

Jesus Christ I came to cornell because I wanted to learn. That’s all. How hard is it to ask that the students here foster an environment that does not make people insecure or feel inadequate. STOP ROMANTICIZING ABUSE, to yourself and to others. Losing out in sleep isn’t sexy. 

Here’s a protip, from me to you: Working at SpaceX isn’t a personality trait. Working in Sillicon Valley doesn’t mean youre hot shit, actually you’re barely shit at all. 

To People who are here in the true purpose of higher education: keep on keeping on. Dont let these toxic fucks ruin your love of learning cause in the end, it’s the only thing worth anything."

I applied to Twitter’s Early Bird program (#EarlyBird - May 18-22, 2020 @ Twitter HQ, San Francisco- A five-day program for first year computer science students who identify as black, Hispanic/Latinx and/or Native American).

I applied back in early August. I haven’t heard anything from this application *specifically*, but I did apply to TwitterAcademy at the same time—even though apparently it’s designed for Sophomores. I received a HackerRank invitation probably around a month ago, but I didn’t get around to it yet because I was not yet a very experienced programmer—I was actually planning on doing it this weekend.

Well... today I got a rejection email from TwitterAcademy, but I don’t feel too bad about it since it’s designed for sophomores. *However* I’m still very curious about EarlyBird, and they still haven’t told me **anything**.

Has anyone heard from any of the diversity programs?"

Its not long by any means, but I do have seniority on our team being the longest team member (there was very higher turnover on our team this year).

The manager who hired me quit this summer, as did the previous team members who couldve taken up the position, leaving me as the only remaining person who had experience under the “old guard.”

I am a resource for our team members and train all incoming new members. However, recently a new management trainee has been assiged to our team. He graduated from his undergrad in the spring and was our department’s summer intern the year before, but the way the program works is that he is allowed to remain in any department he visits permanently if theres a management position open. Organizationally in our team, there is that opening, and lately he and many others have mentioned how much he enjoys working in our department.

I feel they are poised to make him the official manager, despite the fact that he has no experience in our teams operations and routinely asks me questions (cant fault him for not knowing) about our processes.

In this case, would quitting because the position was “stolen” from me be unreasonable? Do I mention this as my reason for quitting in future interviews if it indeed comes to pass?"

The same thing happened with me while searching for internships in the past summer; I got interview calls from just a couple of companies and I couldn't clear either of them. I don't have any real-world experience; I have never done any internships in undergrad and I joined an MS program immediately after undergrad. I will confess that I haven't done as much work as I could have in my MS program. I just cleared most of my courses rather than learning them properly. However, I can't mend those mistakes now. I have been doing LeetCode, but that is not helping me because I am simply not getting interviews. Being an international student puts even more pressure on me to find a job quickly. Currently, I have been thinking about doing some online courses, but I can't figure out which ones can actually get me a job within a few months. I would really appreciate any advice to improve my situation.

I am ready to do any job at any company, the compensation doesn't matter to me as long as I can survive.

 All the projects on my resume are academic projects, or rather, ""homeworks"".

Since I have taken a light course load at the university for this semester, I can make time to work on the nanodegree. I chose full-stack web development because that seems to be the field with the most opportunities at the moment. Would this be the right thing to do? Thanks."

I'm having an issue with what to follow even tho i know what i want, please give me some help.

&amp;#x200B;

I engage on a bootcamp type of thing, i couldn't work due to some rules so i have no money, tho i live with my parents and they are fine with it for now.

&amp;#x200B;

On this bootcamp i learned the basics of networking wich prepared me to take the CCENT and with a bit more study the CCNA. I also learned some basic programming on C# [(I kept some stuff on my github if you guys could take a look)](https://github.com/madladwolf), i learned a bit of SQL aswell like creating, deleting, changing, updating and searching for stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that i want programming but i do not feel prepared to search for jobs after i am done with it, i also couldn't get a programming internship because the guys from the bootcamp didn't really show anything about my knowledge and only told what we learned so they were sceptical and said no.

&amp;#x200B;

Ended up on a IT company and i need to make a decision.

* Take the CCNA and try to get a job on IT
* Take some time off after i'm done with the bootcamp (2 months remaining) and learn a bit more programming (i can have 1month+/- full time to learn)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Right now i really don't know what to do, even tho i prefer programming i can land an easy job on the IT field as long i get the CCNA.

I don't have any degree.

The automotive company is a very well known and highly successful company and their offer is pretty nice compared to the aviation company. I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on what things to consider. Would it be better to get experience in the aviation/aerospace industry with a lesser known company or would working for a highly successful company with a great offer give me better success in my job search in the future? Additionally, thinking ahead into the future, are both the aerospace/aviation industry and the automotive industry good industries to choose a career path in for Mechanical Engineers, in terms of growth, income and job security? I’ve looked at full time salaries for both companies and other companies in each industry and the automotive industry seems to have a higher average salary. Simply put my questions is: Is it better to do an internship in the industry I may decide to work in, in the future or should I choose an automotive company that’s one of the top in the automotive industry?"

Also this is my alt account since coworkers could find my normal reddit.

Background: I had to find a job out of college within a half hour of my parents' because i was too poor to move, I was also too poor to find any internships near where I lived while in college (it was in the middle of the country near no major towns). This left me with very few options, with my savings nearly depleted (despite living with my parents I paid for all of my food and other bills aside from rent which they only charged $100) I finally found a job offer within commuting distance, unfortunately it only paid 2/3 the average starting wage for my field in my area but I took it anyways mostly because I had to due to the aforementioned financial and experience situation. 

I was hired as an estimator for a construction materials distributor who also operates a retail sales storefront via a couple branches in my state in the northern us. I was told that I would be doing sales work for the first month while i was brought up to speed on the estimating work. It wasnt in writing but I agreed to it because of the stuff in my first paragraph. I ended up doing almost entirely retail work for the first 3.5 months. Then I left the sales counter and started answering phone calls from my office (on a side note it is actually a 1/3 cubicle with no walls that i share with 2 loud salesmen lol). By the 4th month I basically stopped doing any work outside the scope of my actual position figuring that if it becomes clear how little estimating im doing, I'd finally get some training. Well that was two months ago and I have yet to get any meaningful estimating training. In addition to this I was forced to take a couple weeks of classes on a proprietary structural design software because it seems as though my bosses expect the estimating department to do entire structural plans in addition to estimating despite us having an engineering department and not even being an engineering firm in the first place. We also do not have a licensed engineer on staff so despite my qualification to do work under one, any engineering I have to do at my current job will not be countable for licensure in the future should i choose to pursue it. 

My department head had me come in on a saturday (we otherwise dont work on saturdays) for training like 2 months after i started but he spent 20 minutes scribbling on a piece of paper and jumping around to random topics before spending the rest of the day talking shit about coworkers and telling me stories about random events. He also regularly tells me he will get around to my training but then nothing ever comes of it. I've also been given 3 different projects basically to train myself which i then spent days on (each) and then theyre never reviewed by my superiors and theyre effectively forgotten. Supposedly my dept head was too busy but i regularly see him gossiping with other coworkers for hours at a time which makes me doubt his claims. Another member of my department whose job isnt even my training did give me a bit of material that i could reference which was better than nothing but im still weeks of meaningful instruction away from being up to speed on company methods which are almost entirely nonstandard which is why I learned like none of them in college (I was very upfront about what I knew in my interview so after being hired I was pretty surprised at the lack of any training).

Another item is that I had moved into my own place nearer to my job due to winter making commuting from my parents' impossible. That in addition to thousands of dollars in vehicle repairs have left me unable to seek alternative employment for at least a few months.  Clearly I'm stuck at my current job for the time being but how long would it be appropriate to continue working at my current job? I dont want to leave too soon because I assume it'll get better eventually but at the same time I dont want to end up having wasted too much time on a seemingly dead end position. Should I try something different at my current job in the mean time, and if so what? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Been at job for 6 months and received practically no training. Been forced to do retail sales and other work (that isnt my job) in the mean time. Too poor to move for a different job for the time being. How long would it be appropriate to stay at my current job? Should I try something different at my current job before I commit to leaving?"

I already participated in numerous STEM subject programs both during the school year and the summer; their subjects relating to mathematics, cryptology, cybersecurity, and coding. I’m taking accelerated classes in a STEM program offered at my high school since freshman year, and I got valedictorian for freshman year as well. Hopefully this puts me ahead of others résumé-wise.

I’m considering on getting a CompTia A+ certification when I hit 17 or 18, so I can hopefully land an entry-level job and work ASAP. I’m also self teaching myself on cybersecurity via courses on Udemy.com and MIT OpenCourseWare playlists on YouTube.

I don’t plan on going to college or getting a degree due to how expensive it is. Getting a full ride would be nice, but I need to have a realistic backup plan. I’m thinking of taking up a trade (electrician) and working on my CS career on the side on my own time while making some cash to survive.

dnihec,2,2019-10-26,"$9/hr Entry Level IT Job, Should I take it?",Mazazomn,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dnihec/9hr_entry_level_it_job_should_i_take_it/,"Hello, everyone in r/ITCareerQuestions. I apologize for a lengthy post, but I am in need of advice, and maybe I can also serve as an example of things to avoid. 

I am 23 years old, 24 in February. I will admit, that in this life I have taken things too easy, and had some antiquated ideas about how the world works. My parents told me that I would go to college out of high school, and I did. I moved from north Alabama down to Southwest Georgia to attend a 4 year state university. 

My Dads advice was if I didnt know what degree I wanted to take (I did not. I had no idea who I wanted to be and honestly still not sure.) That I should take Biology. A semester and a half of that, and being told by my advisor that I had taken classes in the wrong order, my roommate who was in the IT program recommended that path to me, because I was a ""tech nerd"" sort of person who enjoyed working with and operating computers. So I switch to that degree, and fortunately it was a degree that my dad considered a ""real degree."" I had the assumption that getting an IT degree would essentially ensure that I could get a job. In the last semester, last class of my degree, our teacher who was sure we were all stupid asked us ""so have you all done any internships.. any certifications?"" To which my class answered entirely with No. I realized that I was not the only one with misconceptions. 

I graduated in May. I applied to hundreds of IT jobs, and received no response from them. I was able to get a part time merchandiser job in June, and worked that until acquiring my current job of Wireless Sales Specialist. I applied and accepted that job offer because the description said ""work in a Licensed store and sell phones"" and when I get to the job, it's at a major retail store, in its electronics dept. 

So to the meat of it, and the real question. Apologies for being long winded. 

I am making $10.50 an hour working this sales job. It is less than 15 minutes from my home here in rural middle Georgia. I have received commissions for what little sales I have made in this low income area, many people dont want another bill to pay. But the commissions are negligible honestly. The environment is pretty terrible, the same retail store day in day out, and struggling to make sales, and even losing those sales when a co worker gets them or a customer returns a phone after they realize that they dont want it. My manager has said that if I take leadership courses, and sell more phones than big city stores, then maybe after 2 years I have a shot at being promoted... maybe. 

However, i have been offered a job as an entry level helpdesk employee at an ISP provider. After going through the pre employment testing, and coming to an interview, the vice president of the branch told me that ""your degree is a good sign, but because you dont have any experience, I am going to have to start you at our base pay.""

So, the base pay is $9 an hour. And the drive is an hour from my house. There is the opportunity for overtime, and raise evaluations every 6 months. The company does offer 401k and PTO for full time workers, whereas I do not believe that is offered at my sales job. 

Recently I have been looking more at the future, understanding now that if I dont research things before getting into them, that only leads to suffering. And looking at the future, I know that I want to get a job with benefits, and long term employment, something that from this subreddit I have gathered is a bit difficult due to the Job hopping nature of IT. So that leads to another question of is it a good idea to get fit, in shape, and go to the military? If nothing else that ensures a job. 


And then theres the option of staying with this sales job until I can get my certifications, base ones like the A+ and the Sec+, and applying to entry level jobs then, but I still worry about the availability of IT jobs in my rural area still.


So, TLDR, 23yo IT Graduate, no certs, no experience. Working 10.50/hr in retail sales, 15 min commute and not bad hours but probably dead end.  job offer for 9/hr entry level tech support +hour commute, +possible raise after 6 months and benefits. 
Should I pursue certs in current job,then apply for entry levels? gain experience in the entry level job, or just train physically and go into the military? 

Any advice is welcome advice. Dont worry about offending me."

I feel like my programming isn't good enough to consider applying for an internship yet since i've just started learning to code. I'm really trying to get as much experience as i could before graduating. All my free time right now is invested to learning more about programming since i'm getting paid anyways to attend school so that i could possibly apply for internship sooner.

If it’s worth mentioning also received 2 other Big N swe intern offers that I turned down during freshman year. Also currently working on a very early stage startup (I’m a solo-founder).

But as the title might suggest, I feel miserable during the academic year. As a whole I feel like I learn, build and just do so much more during the summer period of 4 months (my only time to intern) and the other 8 months of the year I feel completely out of it and intellectual unproductive, I feel like I’m not really accomplishing anything. I know it sounds cocky but I sometimes feel like I’m wasting my energy and potential at school.

And this was reflected in my academic performance during my 1st year, my GPA wasn’t great because I spent a lot of time interviewing/prepping and working on my startup than caring  about/working on school. In fact my GPA doesn’t reflect my CS knowledge at all.

Sometimes I just want to leave school, and go work on building things (my early stage startup mostly). Idk sometimes I just feel like doing something crazy like applying to the thiel fellowship or maybe seeing if I could get my startup to launch faster and dropout to attend YCombinator or something.

However, so far I haven't gotten any callbacks.

I'm a junior studying electrical engineering so I'm at the point where I am finally choosing some electives. For next semester, I am taking a technical elective (just an elective that isn't ECE) and an ECE elective. I've been looking at the catalog for next semester and there are a lot of really interesting sounding classes, but I'm not sure how I'm to go about this. For my tech elective, I was originally going to do a math class because I only need one extra math class for an applied mathematics minor, and this elective covers it! After looking at the classes though, I'm not too sure. There are a lot of classes that sound really cool (like intro to quantum physics, analog/digital devices, and so many more), but I'm not sure if I should be picking an elective that would get me a minor but doesn't sound too interesting, or a class that doesn't help with a minor but seems really cool. Any advice on what to do in this situation?

My second sort of predicament is my ECE electives. The problem here is that almost all of them sound like super interesting classes that I would like to take. I can only take so many, so how can I decide which ones I should take? I have heard the answer of ""just take classes that you would like to do as a career"", but the problem is I really have no clue what I want to do in the future. I did an internship over the summer, but I didn't really feel like I learned much about the electrical engineering field and what I want to do in the future. At BEST I only learned what I didn't want to do in the future. Any advice here on how to choose ECE electives when I don't really know what I want to do in the future but also gain valuable knowledge and skills?

Thank you for any advice for my questions. I know that we are all probably slammed with midterms and homework right now, so literally ANY feedback is greatly appreciated :)"

So currently I am attending a university that ranks really high in the IT department, but the thing is that it's in Australia, and I find it very difficult to even find part time paid internship chances for undergraduates, let alone get an offer.

I'm currently funding my own education, so finding a source of income is pretty crucial for me, but if I can also gain experience in my field of study while at it that'd probably be ideal.
One thing I can theoretically do is take an intermission for a semester or two to get a full time (hopefully paid) internship in America (I've seen a LOT more opportunities offered there than in Australia) for a while to get my financial status back on track and get some experience before resuming my studies.

Would that be a good call or am I better off taking another job for now and just finish my studies? My school does offer job support but its almost exclusively for graduates.

I have working rights in america so thats not a concern btw

Thanks"

What am I doing wrong?,skoumeister,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dnpm55/months_of_job_searching_and_been_applying_to_12/,"Hey all, sorry in advance if I’m posting in the wrong place. 

I’m 18 and just graduated college in June with an AAT degree in Computer Networking / Information Systems Security. I did a running start program in high school and started at 16. 

I was constantly told by all of my instructors that we would never have to apply for jobs, just make a LinkedIn profile and call it a day. And how many employers are going to smoother us with job offers left and right, and I feel idiotic for believing them. 

I never did an internship, and I can’t do one in my current position either. I don’t have time to and my income would drop severely if I were to make time, and would not be able to cover my expenses. 

I’ve tried everything left and right, I’ve spoken with multiple HR employees and showed them resumes and cover letters and have always gotten “Wow! Good job! This will definitely get you a job somewhere!”, or something along those lines. 

I have everything from my CompTia A+ to multiple Cisco certs, as well as 4 Microsoft MTA certs. 

Every job I look at always asks for experience. I live a little more than an hour away from Seattle,  and always find entry level jobs there, which I don’t even bother applying for, because driving 100mi a day just to make enough to buy a few tanks of gas a month, and nothing more just doesn’t seem worth it to me.

The city about 20mi (Max) away from me is Tacoma, which has tons of jobs... but every single one I’ve ever seen asks for 2 years (or more) of related experience, which my two years of schooling doesn’t count towards. 

I’ve been applying to one or two jobs a day since July, and haven’t gotten nothing but voicemails saying I don’t qualify, but they’d *love* to have me work some warehouse positions for less than I make as a server. 

It’s gotten to the point to where it seems pointless, and I should just switch paths. Every job I apply for has 100+ people also apply, every. Single. Time. (Thanks to those nifty indeed.com emails they send, showing how many other people applied.) 

I know it isn’t just me, but who’s been able to combat this? I have 3 other friends I graduated with who found jobs months ago. We did the same classes, same time, same grades, and slightly worse resumes (if I do say so myself, could be wrong) and everything else. The only difference is that they’re older. Same work history, just retail/food related jobs. 

I have no clue where to turn. I have pressure on me from everybody, and I’m tired of sitting around working minimum wage while all my friends are already moving up in the IT field. 

Anybody have any advice? Is there anything I’m doing wrong?

Feel free to ask questions, and thanks in advance."

I have studied what they sold us as a ""super-popular-instant-awesome-employement"" degree, well, double degree, in Math and Computer Science. Now, after finally finishing paperwork with my university, I'm starting to search for a job and well, things aren't as pink as they sold to us.

Math is a dead end, period, any jobs I've found for it are programming jobs that ask for a Computer Scientist (wich I already are, so no point of applying them through my Math Degree) or a Electronic Scientist or a Physicist or a Mathematician (wich, after seeing my Math classmates' or even teachers' allergy to anything computer related.. well) or even a typing avocado. So the Math Degree just seems like it's going to sit there while I apply for CS jobs as a sort of ""hey, I've studied two degrees, I must be cleverer than other candidates, no?.  Hire meeee :D""

And from the CS path... a bit better, at least there are jobs related to it, but considering that, in order to cram two degrees in 1,25x the time needed for one, they removed several things, some of them good, like redundant courses, but some of them bad, like an INTERNSHIP. So now I'm limited to searching for jobs with no experience. Jobs that most of them are on ""meat grinders"" that want to take advantage of fresh graduates (and well, I'm ok with lowish salary, but what ""scares"" me of them is the ""forced overtime"" everyone complains about) and/or require much lower (and practical, I know abstract computing models while they know useful things like web developing, for example) studies than university ones.

So.. Am I doing something wrong? Did they lie to me so hard? What have I studied 6 years for?"
dnrkak,6,2019-10-27,Which path to take to finish my degree,Vinndy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dnrkak/which_path_to_take_to_finish_my_degree/,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to seek advice on how I should finish my degree. The reason why I'm asking this is because where I study we don't have the freedom of choosing the courses we want to take. Apart from that, I'm currently doing an internship at Amazon for 6 months and may get to do another one before starting my last year in September. 

For my final year, I have to choose between 5 branches of computer science: software engineering (software architecure, software quality, distributed applications and you learn things like Spring), computer engineering (here it's more like systems programming), AI (more on the game development side), networking (network protocols, network administration...), information systems (very corporative stuff and things like database administration). Please note that the first 3 years are pretty standard computer science it's just for the 4th one that you have to branch off. Once you've chosen your branch, you can't choose what courses to take. You have to take 8 predefined courses and of course do your thesis.

I also did an internship as a systems programmer and I realized it's something that I enjoy, but mostly as a hobbie. During my current internship I've been doing mostly back-end development and we apply all the standard practices of software development, so I have a decent grasp on those. That might be a reason why I don't really see a point on going the software engineering path, but at the same time if I chose computer engineering, it would be just because I enjoy it but I don't see myself working on that in the future. 

The more general question here is, should I force myself to explore a new territory or should I go with something I see myself working on? This is a big concern I have because I think taking AI for example would be interesting but I definitely don't want to do game development and I'm not sure if that choice would make me less suited for other jobs in other fields."

Ever since the first broadcast I’ve been having constant panic attacks. I kept thinking the same thing over and over again, why me? I have enough to deal with right now, with my mother forgetting who I am, my overdue rent, and my ever disappointing college grades. Why me? I’m not equipped to deal with my mother much less this problem. I would call the police but what would they do? Laugh at me? Write me a ticket for obstruction of justice? It wouldn’t matter I suppose, I mean how could we even help these people? 
After the first broadcast, I asked my father about the station. He laughed and told me he was a fan of the show. He loved how silly Julian sounded, and all the crazy things he would come up with. I never told him that this station played only on his radio. I decided that I would leave the radio where it was and come back next week, transcribing what they say. Hopefully, someone would know what to do with this.
It’s been a week. I’ve brought my laptop this time, so I can keep up with what they're saying easier. I have everything set up and the radio tuned to the right frequency. I just hope I'm doing the right thing.

Automated voice: Aired Approx. 1 year, 4 months, 20 days since the town’s disappearance.

Julian: Hello listeners! I'm your host Juli-

Coco: No.

Julian: Coco we have to say the intro.

Coco: No! you’re going to tell me what happened last week, right now.

Julian: What do you mean buddy?

Coco: The janitor woke me up last week. I was laying down on this floor in a puddle of my nose blood! And all week I couldn’t find you! I tried calling your phone, Visiting the station, asking around but I couldn’t seem to ever get ahold of you! So I want to know. What happened?

Julian: Well Billy decided to visit us last week.

Coco: Who’s Billy?

Julian: The poor spirit at the mall! After he visited us at the station, We went on a walk together and I found out that he’s a nice kid! Poor Billy suffered from chronic social anxiety. Often breaking down at the mere thought of people looking at him. After Port-Lands disappearance though, He knew he would have to face his mental illness head-on and band together with other survivors to find a way out of this nightmare! It sounded so beautiful!

Coco: So what happened to him?

Julian: Oh, he killed himself.

Coco: I'm so sorry.

Julian: Why are you apologizing to me?

Coco: I'm not it's just, wait, if he’s dead then why is he still here?

Julian: No one knows, But Port-Lands Paranormal Investigative Unit theorizes that his soul is trapped in this town, being forced to live out his worst nightmare for all of eternity.

Coco: You’re telling me that if you kill yourself you become a ghost?

Julian: Exactly, He was trapped in the center of that mall, watching all those people stare at him, judge him. They also theorize that the emotions he felt during his death are now radiating off of him, afflicting anyone that comes in contact with him.

Coco: Then why did he come here, we’re just two people.

Julian: Remember, the mall was closed off so he wasn’t around anyone. His body was forced to relocate to the nearest people who were talking about him! Which was us!

Coco: He was dragged here against his will by some supernatural force?

Julian: It appears so!

Coco: I can’t even kill myself to escape this town. Fantastic.

Julian: Coco! Don’t think like that! I would miss you, buddy!

Coco: Where is he now?

Julian: Oh well you see, his body is now trapped with me since I keep talking about him, so I hired him as an intern filing papers in the basement far from anybody. It’s a win-win!

Coco: That reminds me. Why weren’t you affected by him?

Julian: What do you mean?

Coco: You showed no signs of depression, and your nose was dry.

Julian: I’m not following?

Coco: What do you mean you’re not following? Why were you not affected, Julian!

Julian: Maybe my immune system is stronger than yours?

Coco: Your immune system…

Julian: Yeah, I always eat a balanced diet!

Coco: You’re full of shit.

Julian: You mean to say I’m full of nutrients!

Coco: So you honestly don’t know why you weren't affected?

Julian: I honestly don’t buddy.

Coco: (sigh) okay fine. Can we get off this topic and get to the news.

Julian: Well tell me about your week first buddy!

Coco: I told you already, I was looking for you.

Julian: Then I'll tell you mine! After helping our new intern, Billy. I decided to bring him to a football game.

Coco: You brought a spirit that inflicts Chronic depression to a football game.

Julian: I thought it would be good for him to get some fresh air! The game was great by the way. It was a grudge match against Port-Lands favorite team The Kraken facing off against the Sea-Cows!

Coco: You mean the Manatees? I went to that high school.

Julian: Oh you poor child, No wonder you dress like that.

Coco: What is that supposed to mean?

Julian: I just noticed that you wore the same hoodie last week. Look, it even still has some blood on it!

Coco: Well thank god this is a radio show then.

Julian: Presentation Coco, It’s all about presentation! If you want I can let you borrow one of my suits!

Coco: I would rather not.

Julian Suit yourself! (laughs) Get it, Coco?

Coco: So Who won?

Julian: Oh the Sea-Cows again, but this time it was close! The score was only sixty-four to six!

Coco: Wow, what a close one.

Julian: Yeah well I decided that The Sea-Cows deserved some congratulations for winning such a hard-fought victory even if they're disgraceful cheaters.

Coco: What did you do?

Julian: I told Billy to go congratulate them in their locker room.

Coco: JULIAN!

Julian: Oh my bad for teaching Billy sportsmanship.

Coco: Did any of them die!?!

Julian: Coco! Now, who do you think I am?

Coco: I honestly don’t know.

Julian: We talked to them just for a second! Just long enough for one of them to start screaming.

Coco: I think that's enough of our week.

Julian: I suppose your right, but before we get into this week’s news, let's take a word from our sponsors!
Do you ever feel alone in the world? Surrounded by people but never quite able to trick anyone into caring about your frivolous problems. Scared that you never made any close connections in high school and now no one will remember your name once your time has expired? Well, it sounds like you need a cat! But Julian you cry, I love cats but I can’t stand them once they become uninterested with me. Well, I have just the answer for you, you shallow parasite.
Come on down to Schrodinger's cat adoption center Today! You can pick yourself out a beautiful cat and not feel any guilt towards not feeding or supporting him! Every Cat at Schrodinger's Cat shelter exists in a quantum paradox in which they’re simultaneously here and not here! That means once you look away they're gone until observed again! Confused? Well Schrodningers cat shelter C.E.O. Emily Schrodinger is too! She has this to say about it, “Please come down to the shelter so you can tell me they exist. T-they have to exist. I’m in the building right now, right? Please, I keep hearing them but every time I look they're gone. No, wait, I'm outside right now. The building is gone, great.” Schrodinger's Cat shelter is located everywhere and nowhere. Call Emily today so she can find the location and give you temporary directions!

Coco: You’re telling me that quantum cats exist.

Julian: Of course! And to prove it, I bought a quantum cat! Coco, can you hand me that box over there?

Coco: This box is empty.

Julian: Oh shoot. no matter, He’ll turn up eventually! Until then, let's go on to our next sponsor, shall we?
Our next sponsor comes from a fan! She gave us a sizable Donation and asked me to read off this script!

Coco: Okay that sounds easy.

Coco: Julian!

Coco: What? Who?

Julian: He’s right there! Oh, shoot I looked away, he’s gone now. So where did I leave off?

Coco: You finished it!

Julian: I did?

Coco: Yeah good job!

Julian: Oh thanks I guess.

Coco: So uh, how about that news?

Julian: Oh yes the news!
Tragedy has struck Port-Land this week as a young girl's body has been found in the alley near Ozzy the Octopus daycare and divorce court. The young girl has been identified as eight-year-old Rebecca Chaney. Rebecca’s Father, Ford Chaney was on his way to pick up his daughter from daycare, when Ozzy the Octopus informed him that she had already been checked out by his wife, Sarah Chaney. Detective Happ confirmed that her signature was found in the sign-out sheet. This signature has been proven to be forged as Sarah has since passed away last week from an eviscerated abdomen inflicted from feral wall dogs. Rebecca showed no signs of resisting, and officials theorize that the death was quick and sudden. The cause of death appeared to be suffocation due to a crushed Trachea. Detective Happ Believes the culprit may be a mimicker and warns all citizens to be on a lookout for anyone acting unusual. Please if you do suspect anyone of being a mimicker, do not approach them. Call your local police immediately.

Coco: What's a mimicker?

Julian: Monsters.

Coco: Well, of course, there are monsters everywhere in this town, what makes these different?

Julian: No Coco. These are the worst kind of monsters. Most of the wildlife here act on instinct, as all animals do. Mimickers have deeper thinking. They have the same intelligence as us. They can plan and coordinate attacks.

Coco: What do they look like?

Julian: No one has seen what one has looked like. They take their victim's bodies and inhabit them. They take their memories, their personality, their life.

Coco: Why?

Julian: No one knows, they don’t kill randomly. Their murders are carefully planned and executed. We don’t know what their plan is or how they choose their victims.

Coco: How many are there?

Julian: We don’t know that either. They can inhabit a body and live normal lives for the rest of the body’s life span. Anyone can be a mimicker.

Coco: How do we tell if someone is a mimicker?

Julian: Usually it takes quite a while for a mimicker to absorb all of their victim's memories. The best way to confirm if someone is a mimicker is to ask very specific questions only the real person would know. Another way is that a mimicker can’t feel pain. If you suspect someone of being a mimicker try pinching them when they’re not looking. If they don’t react, contact the police immediately.

Coco: Yeah but neither of those sound conclusive.

Julian: Dear listeners I want to personally say, Don’t let fear get the better of you. Do not enact personal “justice” just because you think someone is a mimicker. Let the police handle it. The last thing this bright community need is witch hunts in the streets.

Coco: Julian what's gotten into you? You’re usually not this serious.

Julian: Let’s take a coffee break shall we?

Coco: Sure, I’ll take some green tea.

Julian: Disgusting.

(Intermission)

Julian: We’re back dear listeners! Sorry for that long intermission I had to go grab a surprise for later!

Coco: What’s the surprise?

Julian: Coco you silly goose! I’m not going to ruin the surprise right after I announced it!

Coco: I hate surprises.

Julian: That’s so sad!

Coco: So what are you drinking today Julian?

Julian: Black coffee.

Coco: Do you have any cool facts about it?

Julian: It’s Folgers Coco. Not everything has to have an interesting fact behind it.

Coco: Oh, well is it iced?

Julian: No it’s hot, I don’t drink iced coffee.

Coco: Isn’t that ice cubes floating in the drink though?

Julian: It’s to keep the coffee hot.

Coco: Oh, okay I guess.

Julian: ….

Coco: Should we continue the news?

Julian: Oh yes, let's do that!

Coco: (sigh) oh thank god.

Julian: Local pizzeria, Checkers has started construction on what appears to be a watchtower! Locals have reported seeing unmarked trucks entering and leaving the establishment’s grounds. Sources say one aggravated citizen approached the workers complaining of the loud noises they were producing. The workers swiftly responded to the citizen's complaints by assaulting him numerous times with cattle prods and batons before dragging his unconscious body into the pizzeria. 

Coco: Who are these people?

Julian: Checkers employees

Coco: Sure but what are they doing in there?

Julian: I'm assuming they're making pizzas

Coco: Pizzas that they don’t sell?

Julian: On paper, it does seem like bad business practice, but they are staying in business so what do I know!

Coco: (Groans)

Julian: Local rival high school football team The Sea-Cows have canceled next week's game against the Krakens due to their running back Rodney Herving being hospitalized.

Coco: Julian does this involve you?

Julian: Rodney wouldn’t respond to any questions that our reporters asked, only opting to whisper “He knows when I speak of him.” On behalf of everyone here at Port-Land news network, we hope for a safe and speedy recovery!

Coco: I can’t believe you would do this!

Julian: Coco do you believe I would do something like this?

Coco: What! You said you did it!

Julian: Last week! I checked the tapes, Coco, Billy hasn’t left the basement since then. The good news is that I've never seen the basement so clean!

Coco: You promise this wasn’t your doing?

Julian: I promise you, Coco, I would never wish serious ill towards anyone!

Coco: Then who was haunting him.

Julian: Maybe someone else found themselves a depressed ghost and are sending them out to harass people.

Coco: This is bad Julian! We taught people paranormal warfare!

Julian: That’s a definite my bad.

Coco: That’s all you have to say?

Julian: Fine. I Julian, humbly apologize for teaching the public about the possibility of paranormal warfare. There, happy?

Coco: I guess that's something.

Julian: Good news! I just got an update from our secretary Alison! Our guest has arrived!

Coco: Guest?

Julian: I apologize for not informing you Coco. It was kinda short notice.

Coco: What kind of questions should I ask him?

Julian: let's welcome the guest of the hour Ozzy The Octopus!

Ozzy: Hi everybody!

Coco: Woah you brought the octopus costume.

Julian: Come in! Come in! Here I pulled up a chair on the other side for you!

Ozzy: Thank you, Julian! Would you like a taffy?

Julian: I would love a taffy! Do you remember when we last met Ozzy?

Ozzy: Um I'm sorry but I don’t seem to recall.

Julian: You were my divorce lawyer! Rember? I called you my wizard of Oz!

Ozzy: Oh yeah!

Julian: You helped me make sure I didn’t have to pay a single dime!

Ozzy: Ozzy the octopus makes sure that everyone is happy!

Coco: So Ozzy, what’s your real name?

Ozzy: What do you mean? I’m Ozzy! Ozzy the octopus!

Coco: God I hate you already.

Julian: Coco! Have some respect for our most successful daycare mascot!

Ozzy: And most popular divorce lawyer!

Coco: Do you wear that outfit when you’re a divorce lawyer?

Ozzy: Of course! I'm Ozzy the Octopus!

Coco: (Mumbling) are we out of time yet?

Julian: Coco! Sorry Ozzy, for my inconsiderate co-host!

Ozzy: It’s okay! He just needs a hug from Ozzy’s Tentacles!

Coco: Please never say that to me ever again.

Julian: Ozzy, Do you like games by any chance?

Ozzy: I love games!

Julian: Fantastic, Coco, Would you mind handing me that box underneath you?

Coco: Yeah sure, what's in it?

Julian: Thank you, Coco. While I'm getting the surprise ready, Ozzy, Would you mind telling us who killed Rebecca?

Ozzy: Oh I wish I knew! It was just so terrible. Rebecca was such a joy to be around. The world is a darker place without her!

Coco: Julian, What is that!

Julian: Ozzy, Do you care to inform our listeners what I have in my hand currently?

Ozzy: A-a gun.

Julian: Correct Ozzy! Today I want to play a game with you. Usually, in baseball, it’s three strikes and you’re out, but with life, there’s always a chance, never absolute like baseball. The rules are simple Ozzy, You give me an answer I don’t like. I'll pull the trigger. Since this has a six-round cylinder you have a one in six chance of striking out in the beginning. Are you ready to begin Ozzy?

Coco: Julian this has to be a joke right?

Ozzy: You should never play with guns!

(CLICK)

Coco: Holy shit!

Ozzy: Okay! Okay, Yes! Ozzy would love to play!

Julian: Now you have a one in five chance of striking out.

Coco: Julian Please put down the gun. This isn’t a joke.

Julian: Who signed out Rebecca Ozzy?

Ozzy: I- I didn’t see I was too busy restocking the Soda machine!

(CLICK)

Ozzy: Please don’t kill me!

Coco: JULIAN!

Julian: Why did they leave her body in the alley. Wouldn’t someone who’s sick enough to target children want the body?

Ozzy: I don’t know why they did it! I don’t know anyone that’s sick enough to enjoy hurting innocent kids! P-please you have to believe me.

(CLICK)

Ozzy: (Sobbing)

Coco: Julian give me that goddamn gun right now!

Julian: Why Did the reports say she died from a crushed trachea? Seems like someone tried choking her but accidentally put too much pressure on her windpipe?

Ozzy: (Sobbing) I don’t know! Whatever you think I did I promise you I didn’t. Please let me go, I promise I won't press charges!

(CLICK)

Ozzy: Oh god I don’t want to die.

Coco: Listeners please call the police right now!

Julian: Why did you kill her?

Ozzy: I didn’t Kill Her!

(CLICK)

Julian: You only have one strike left Ozzy.

Ozzy: (Crying)

Julian: Stop crying, here you want some coffee?

Coco: Julian! Don't you dare throw tha-

Ozzy: (Screaming in pain)

Coco: what?

Julian: Weird, I don’t remember Iced coffee ever burning.

Ozzy: Y-You just scared me, that's all. Julian please, I didn’t kill her. We’re friends remember? I'm your wizard of Oz.

Julian: Strange you seem to remember that so strongly even though I’ve never been married before.

Ozzy: What?

Julian: You know what I think? I think you took over Ozzy’s Body and to your horror, you realized someone was watching, a little girl. You panicked and started choking her before she even had time to realize what had happened. You also didn't realize your strength and accidentally crushed her windpipe. Just as things couldn’t get any worse for you, you learned that Rebbeca’s father was on route and you panicked. You didn’t have enough time to absorb the memory of Rebecca’s mother dying so you scribbled her name into the sign-out sheet hoping that would give you enough time to hide the body. Of course, Ford saw right through this and begin searching for his daughter, and soon found her in the alley.
How close am I?

Ozzy: T-that's not true, That's all a lie!

Julian: Sorry Ozzy but we’re all out of time, any last words you would like to say before we sign off?

Ozzy: I know where Oliver is!

Coco: What!

Julian: Well why didn’t you start with that! Please, the floor is yours!

Ozzy: He’s alive! He’s in danger though! Everybody wants him. Mimickers, The government, even the PSS!

Coco: Where is he!

Ozzy: I don’t know, I promise you. Last I heard he escaped into the desert.

Julian: Why does everyone want Oliver?

Ozzy: I don’t know that either! Only the higher council knows!

Julian: So the mimickers have a societal structure?

Ozzy: No, what? I don’t know what you’re talking about! Please just let me go home.

Coco: If hypothetically your species captured Oliver, what would they do with him?

Ozzy: Please Don’t ask me that.

Julian: Coco asked you a question, Ozzy!

Ozzy: T-they would take over his body, so they can learn about his memories.

Coco: Memories? What’s so important about his memories?

Ozzy: If I told you that they would kill me!

Julian: I apologize but we are all out of ti-

Ozzy: WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!

Julian: Me? I’m Julian, Host of “Tales from Port-Land”, and it appears we’re all out of time!

(CLICK)

Coco: Did you... Did you forget to load the gu-

Julian: I forgot to load the gun.

Ozzy: (Laughter) Oh you two are so fucking dead!

Julian: Coco get behind me!

Ozzy: You see I also brought a surprise for you, Julian!

Coco: Julian he has a knife!

Julian: Oh boy this is not going well.

Coco: This is why I hate surprises.

Ozzy: I'm going to enjoy killing you, Julian! You and your stupid bitch!

Coco: You’re about to kill me, you don't have to degrade me too.

Julian: Yeah that was pretty unprofessional.

Ozzy: Shut up!

Quantum cat: Meow?

Julian: Coco! It’s Quantum cat!

Coco: Weird cat if you help us I swear ill spend my entire paycheck on you.

Julian: Where did he go?

Quantum cat: (Muffled) meow?

Ozzy: He’s in my fucking costume! get him out! I can’t see!

Julian: Coco! Keep staring at that cat! I'll load the gun!

Coco: I can’t see him he’s in the outfit!

Julian: Just stare at where you think he’s at!

Ozzy: W-where did that cat go?

Coco: Oh man, I lost sight of him.

Ozzy: I'm going to fucking gut you!

Coco: JULIAN!

(Sound of a gunshot)

Coco: Is… is he dead?

Julian: I sure hope so. I only brought the one bullet.

Coco: H-how do we tell if he’s a mimicker?

Julian: We’ll let the police examine the body.

Coco: The police?

Julian: Yeah, I called the police shortly before Ozzy got here. They know everything. They should be here soon.

Coco: I-I need to sit down.

Julian: Welp. that was a close one! 

Coco: (Sobbing)

Julian: Coco, why are you crying? We made it!

Coco: (Sobbing) Is that what we do now? Do we just murder our guests? We just report about people dying like its nothing! What now? What did we learn from all this? That mimickers have a whole civilization! That we’re fucked!

Julian: Coco, I'm sorry, but at least this information can help someone.

Coco: (Sobbing) And Oliver. Oliver is alive! He’s important apparently, very important. So important in fact that there’s a multi-species manhunt for him!

Julian: He’s alive Coco, That's great news!

Coco: Why didn’t he ever tell me that he’s so important. Why did he keep me in the dark? Why did he love me? Did he love me?

Julian: He probably kept you in the dark to protect you.

Coco: Oh look at how protected I am! This is the second week that I almost died! That's two out of two Julian! That's too high for a radio job!

Julian: Coco, I wish I could tell you that next week it will be normal. That everything will be fine, But It won’t, and if you want to find Oliver, It’s going to get worse.

Coco: I don’t know if I can do this every week.

Julian: You don’t have to do it alone though, You have me!

Coco: (Sniffling) I hate you so much.

Julian: No you don’t buddy.

Coco: (Sniffling) I know I don’t.

Julian: I think this is a good time to wrap things up. Do you want to get some cubed meat from Gigis? It’ll be my treat!

Coco: Sure.

Julian: I’m Julian and this is my co-host Coco signing off, and remember listeners, stay safe out there.

dnx113,2,2019-10-27,Feeling incredibly lonely,Xcadriller37,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dnx113/feeling_incredibly_lonely/,"Hey Reddit. I'm a sophomore guy in college and I'm feeling really lonely right now so I guess I'm reaching out for help. Basically all of the few consistent friends I have this year, I made freshman year. 

I did the sophomore housing draw without a group and got a single, which is nice but it is pretty lonely as I am in a four class dorm tucked away into the back stairwell corner of a hallway that is otherwise all freshman; I only have 2 acquaintances (not really friends that I regularly hang out with) out of the 250+ people in the building. I often find myself eating alone, but I am embarrassed because I don't want people who I know seeing me eating alone and thinking of me as a loner. I'd say I have about 5 ""close"" friends scattered around campus, and around 10 more that I'd call good acquaintances where if we saw each other we'd definitely stop and have a conversation but don't otherwise hang out or text or anything.


My close friends are all genius math majors who are taking incredibly high workloads; I usually see them in class, doing hw/group assignments with them (like once or twice a week), or grabbing a meal with them (maybe 3 or 4 times a weeks). 
Unfortunately they are all swamped with work all the time and don't have time and are not interested in the fun stuff that I would like (partying, going out, movies, video games). Most of them are saying their sophomore year has been pretty depressing and stressful. I used to party/drink a lot last year because I was a freshman in an all freshman dorm and people hosted room parties and giant groups would roll out to frat parties together. This year I have only drunk and partied only once each. At the party I immediately left because I  saw two girls I knew and they asked me if I came alone and I lied and said I was waiting for someone then pretended I was calling him.
I practically never leave campus unless its for a job interview, and there's not much to do on campus. I haven't posted on social media in 2 years.

I'm taking a heavy STEM course load and also work part-time jobs (at a front desk alone, and another desk job where I work with my boss doing menial work) for a few (6ish) hours per week. 

I didn't do any clubs last year and thought that they would be a good way to meet people, so I joined four clubs this year. (newspaper, robotics, entrepreneurship club, CS club); of those I'd say the entrepreneurship club has been pretty good at increasing social opportunities but unfortunately I have not made a single real friend in any of them; most of the clubs are mainly freshmen and the upperclassmen who are there already have their friend groups all settled. I am meeting people, but not making friends. I also find that I cannot simultaneously balance both my classes and all 4 clubs and my jobs, so I only regularly am doing 2 clubs now. I started to work out semi-regularly but I also find it very lonely; I tried going with other people on two occasions but it didn't really become a regular thing.

It was very different in high school; I had a solid group of 12 or so really close friends, with a constantly active group chat, meet ups, and parties/going out, and like 15 or so good acquaintances.
I think a large part of what's changed is that my high school was 30% - 40% my ethnicity group (much more that in the upper level advanced placement classes), and all my friends were the same race as me, but here I am a minority and don't really have friends my race (at most 2 or 3  not-close acquaintances). I tried my race's cultural club and it was mostly international students and focused on the culture of the race (I don't really have a close cultural connection other than food), and I did not enjoy it. The chance of me getting into a frat is zero, except for one frat that is ethnically focused (but on a different ethnicity than mines).

I thought college was supposed to be the fun part of my life, but it seems pretty sad right now. Most of the time, I am either in class, or alone in my room doing psets, on the internet, gaming, or applying to internships. I'm not overly depressed or in any risk of self harm, just very lonely."

I took a semester off to learn python, so I can be better prepared, and it ended up helping in my first programming course in Java. I'm now taking my second programming course in Java and I feel like I'm pretty proficient in Java but I see other people completing programming assignments in ways I didn't even know was possible and other students are completing side projects left and right.

Maybe I'm overestimating the number of students around me that are extremely proficient in Java and came into college already being close to job-ready. The issue is that I want to get internships at great companies and have a great career but how can I do that when my peers and other computer science students around me are consistently ahead of the game? I study every day for many hours and I do very well in my Computer Science courses but it seems like that's not enough.

What's the solution? Dedicating even more of my study time to start making side projects? LeetCode? HackerRank? 

I know that, realistically, I'll be fine but I'm the type that if I do something then I want to be the best at it and right now I'm having a hard time even getting close to the better computer science students."

I haven't applied for anything because I don't think my skills are at a level worthy of being hired, but everyone else in my class seems to disagree.

I am a masters student studying electrical engineering, specifically focused on signal processing and machine learning.  I am planning on graduating in the summer and am currently in the middle of a job hunt.  I currently have a single job offer in the Washington D.C. area and expect another job offer soon, but in a less desirable location.  Unfortunately, the job offer I currently have has offered a considerably low starting salary.  Most other people I know, who went directly to work after receiving a bachelors, are receiving $80k.  My offer was much closer to $70k.  I'm currently preparing to make a counter offer, but I'm afraid that my expected salary of $90k may be much too high given the initial offer.

do2pt2,3,2019-10-27,Please help with some advice for my situation,NewbEngineeringStud,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/do2pt2/please_help_with_some_advice_for_my_situation/,"Hi so I am in a dilemma of sorts rn and need immediate advice. I kinda accepted the offer for Stryker in kind of a rush since they requested I quickly make a decision as they need me to start nov 11. I am hesistant now as the reality of everything is hitting me all at once. Sorry for this long post.

i am a Mechanical Engineering student (used to be BME with almost 3 years) and I have about almost 2 years left till I graduate (unless I do winter and summer courses). So Im working for a company right now as a Complaints Quality Engineer Intern for a medical device company. I have a years experience in the company as a Quality Engineer Intern under my belt with two different departments (Complaints and Quality Assurance). I used to do everything a Quality Engineer would do for the complaints department and i was happy about it but recently we got a new director. I was then ousted away from it by the Director as they had a whole reorganization of the whole department, I was placed into a complaint analyst role as an Engineer Intern, which has reduced me to simply reviewing complaints since the complaints analyst team needed some assistance. They told me it was temporary and HR knows I want to do more engineering related roles even if it means if I have to switch departments. However the HR manager wants to convert me to permanent in this current position and has not addressed my expression that this new role is one that I dislike as well as it not being something I am going to school for. The impression she has given me is that she wants to lock me into this position.

So Stryker has reached out to me and I interviewed with them for a contract position as a RA Consultant position. They are open to my school schedule and it may not be an engineering position but i get to work with R&amp;D and be in the processes of product development. This is way more attractive to me but there are about 3 problems; 1. it is farther from my house and school compared to my current company. 2. it is a contract position compared to my current status as an open ended status intern (but possibly be offered to convert to permanent in my current position but as a complaint analyst which I dont really like the work at all.) 3. I would be leaving all the friends I made at my current company and possibly burn bridges with the company.

So I have 3 options to consider:

1. I can take the permanent position offer for complaints analyst, deal with the monotonous bs work that i really dont like and be possibly locked into this work till I graduate. I will be paid more, be given benefits, and possibly according to a coworker; have the company pay for the rest of my schooling. Then once I finish my schooling, I can try for any engineer position within the company according to the HR manager.
2. I go with Stryker for this RA consultant contracting position, its got really good pay and the work sounds super interesting with the prospect of working with R&amp;D to make sure the products (existing or new) are compliant with the CHINA FDA standards as well as the US one. However it is a contracting one and the hours can be demanding based on the deadlines. I get to be in Stryker and the manager has expressed to me that if I do really well, I can possibly be converted quick to full time or I can move anywhere within the company easily.
3. I can try to bargain for the R&amp;D co-op position with more pay than i have now since I have a years experience and that I want to stay loyal to the company. This would allow me to achieve my goal to gain more hands on experience as an engineering student along with allow me to challenge myself in ways that I haven't before. I would get to stay within the company and still wouldn't be necessarily tied down to the company. I can also see if they can provide a junior engineer job or something for me which i highly doubt would happen.

Please help and let me know what advice you would give."

Whenever I ask classmates for help whether on homework on anything else I feel like they think I am stupid because I struggle to understand things that others can easily do.

Whenever I ask TA's for help I feel on something simple I feel like they are judging me and secretly think I am an idiot(maybe it's because they are around my age too, I don't care if a professor thinks I am dumb).

I have been called stupid for getting a C in an Intro to Computing class because apparently it is an easy A for everyone else.

It seems like all companies have a minimum GPA cutoff so trying to get internships is a nightmare.

Graduate schools have GPA cutoffs.

Professor ask for my transcripts when I ask for research opportunities and reject me for a sub par GPA

I cannot go on Study Abroads because of my low GPA.

I have asked people with High GPA's how they do it and they either call me lazy or dumb and make fun of me for having never gotten an A in a class.(Maybe I just hang out with the wrong crowd).

I do not believe my grades represent my work ethic,abilities or intelligence. Even though I see signs around campus saying that You are not your GPA I still feel like I am judged by it.

I know it is possible to succeed in life even as a Low GPA student. This motivates me to graduate(even with a 2.0 GPA) and get out of the bubble that is College so that I will be judged by something other than just a number."

Naturally, because it’s so close to graduation and because I want to have the same success as my friends, I have come to try looking for internships. The only issue, though, is that I’m in a small town with no real tech focus. All the internships I found on websites through the University show a dismal number of programming internships in my area, and that while there are some available, I’m unqualified for most of them (most require experience with web development, which my school has suspiciously avoided including in its electives list). 

Another viable option for me is to focus on my projects instead. This is something I can really get behind because I really enjoy writing different programs, especially now that I’ve gotten a solid grasp of making commits and managing repos in GitHub using GitBash. However, I wonder how much weight having completed projects will carry compared to having an internship under your belt. I assume it’s because I’ve had the notion of getting an internship ingrained in my head for so long that I’m a little reluctant to just abandon it.

With that said, is it worth it to focus on working on projects in lieu of an internship? To those that have done just that, how has it affected your career?

I've always tried to avoid full time work as it feels like its not worth it. I feel like I am having a commitment issue at this point in my life. I've been wanting to have my own business but I jump around so many ideas to the point that I never commit to one idea, so nothing actually came to fruition. I did an internship in my field the summer before the last one and although I didn't like the work, I liked the people and felt that they also liked me. My boss offered me his position and I declined.

This past summer, I applied to a job. I wasn't sure if I would like it. I was excited when I got the call to make an appointment to interview. During the interview, I did fine but I feel like I could have done much better. I was somewhat not trying my best on purpose. Right before leaving the interview, the manager told me the usual: we have to interview someone else tomorrow and we will let you know. I almost knew that I wasn't going to get an offer based on body language and what not and this made me feel good actually. Most people would feel bad if they thought they wouldn't get an offer but I actually felt good. I felt free knowing this.

I've been working these ""Temporary"" jobs in the same hospital that gave me internships since I was in high school. I have had two ""temporary"" jobs. I say ""temporary"" because they aren't really temporary in the direct definition of the word. They are jobs that many people use to get their foot in the hospital, you can leave after 3 months work but you don't have to stay long. They were two jobs. The first was watching patients who are suicidal or have some abnormal psych problem. The second is basically customer service for the docs and nurses. Both jobs are the type of jobs that might be chill one minute and bat shit cray the next. These 2 jobs that I had in the hospital since graduating university are the type of jobs that really lead no where but the thing was that I was able to choose the shift and the days that I could work. I worked mostly part time as they were stressful.

Now again I have the opportunity to work fulltime in my brothers lab in the same hospital. He really wants me to work with them. He is a research engineer and I would start as a research tech. I am not sure if I would be able to work this job. I feel that I interned in almost everything in this hospital except the research/laboratories. He told me about a possible opening about a month ago and when it opened a couple days ago. I felt like crap when he told me that it opened. I want to pursue but at the same time, it feels like a heavy load. It almost feels as though I'm giving up on my entrepreneurial dreams. If I don't join I'm going to be staying at this job that allows me to choose my schedule and leave for as long as I want to (I left for three months to travel before).

The other piece is that my brother and I can get at each others throat sometimes. I'm afraid that this might cause a problem at work sometimes, although he seems happier when I see him at work then when I see him at home so not sure how this would play out. I've considered not taking this job and going to a different country to teach English, but I also feel like I might get disappointed later on and ask myself the what if later on as these lab positions don't come every day but teaching English will be there for a long time.

At this point, I want to take the job and if I don't like it then just suck it up and stick it out for a total of 6-7 months and then leave. My brother told me that he might leave in the next 8-12 months as he has been there for over 2 years and learned most of the stuff. What should I do?????"

I've been applying for various internships for software development or engineering, and the only word I've received so far is for a small video game company no one has ever heard of. They want me to learn Unity 3D and become familiar with a bunch of kits they have, in a week, if I want an interview. I dont see video game software engine as being my career choice (especially because the hours are crazy and the senior engineere only make 60k), so I don't know if it's worth putting in all this work just for an interview.  Would it even be beneficial for a career in software development for a non game company to take this internship? Most had a deadline to apply by late November or December so should I even be worried that I havent heard anything else? Is it worth it to be picky in general?

TLDR: If I dont want to be a game dev, but I do want to be a software dev or engineer, is it worth it to take a video game software engineering position just for now, even if it's a lot of up front work? And should I be picky over which internships I take in the future?"

I'm an intern (the ""designated IT guy"") at a small flooring company. I'm setting up some VMs on the company server for employees at another storefront to remote-access into because our accounting and inventory-management software only communicates over LAN and refuses to work over the Internet (Quickbooks Desktop 2019 Premier). There are six users total that need to access the software.

Assume our public IP address is 0.0.0.1. For security, I want to close off port 12345 on VM 1, except to 1.2.3.4, which is the public IP address of User 1. I want to close off port 54321 on VM 2, except to 4.3.2.1, which is the public IP address of User 2. I've set up the router to port-forward port 12345 to VM1 and port 54321 to VM2. That way, when User 1 (1.2.3.4) connects to 0.0.0.1:12345, they are prompted for the VM1 username and password, since port 12345 is forwarded to VM1. However, if User 2 (4.3.2.1) or an attacker tries to connect to 0.0.0.1:12345, the connection is refused. Only 1.2.3.4 is allowed to connect to 0.0.0.1:12345 (forwarded to VM1) and only 4.3.2.1 is allowed to connect to 0.0.0.1:54321 (forwarded to VM2).

So now, to accomplish this, I want to know how I can either

1. refuse connections on port 12345 except from 1.2.3.4 on VM1's Windows Firewall, or
2. refuse connections on port 12345 except from 1.2.3.4 on a Comcast Business router which is being used only as a modem right now, or
3. refuse connections on port 12345 except from 1.2.3.4 on a Netgear router, which is connected but not bridged to the Comcast router and is being used as a wireless access point/network switch.

What I'm afraid of is that because of the port forwarding (the Comcast router forwards to the Netgear router which forwards to the VMs), the connection will actually appear to be from the router's private IP address (192.168.0.1) rather than the public IP address of the client (1.2.3.4), resulting in the connection either always being refused (since 192.168.0.1 is not the approved IP address). I'm not sure whether this will actually happen, though."

dof9qk,30,2019-10-28,Keep At It (Long),Ch1p16,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dof9qk/keep_at_it_long/,"  

I am writing this post to try to help those who are really struggling when it comes to finding that job. I know this isn't a question, but I have seen many posts wondering why it's taking so long to get a position and I hope this can answer them. This post is long and I condensed it as much as I could but I hope that it will help some people like various posts helped me out.

First off, I went to a mid-major state university, not one of the best for CS but not one of the bottom ones either. After transferring in, I attended that university for 2.5 years and even though I applied to several different ones, both at the university and with companies that supposedly had a 'special' relationship with my university, I graduated in 2016 with a BS in Computer Science, a 3.2 GPA, but no internships. I expected to be unemployed between 6 months and a year based on the trends I've been researching in the field. 

As soon as I got home, the job applying process began. I started tailoring my resumes and cover letters and I took part-time jobs at a store and high school to earn a little money during the process. I started getting interview requests from local companies and national ones. My first bite was in a city about an hour away from me. This company took me through one phone interview, two coding challenges, and two in-person interviews. The last interview was talking about salary, benefits, and meeting the team I would join. I sat and spoke with them for two hours, shadowing the person who's job I would be taking. I left that place elated and my parents were too. My mom then proceeded to take me to get stuff to furnish an apartment because we were so confident I would get an offer. I did not hear anything for two weeks until I got a letter in the mail. If they sent a letter, it had to mean I got the job, right? NOPE. The letter thanked me for taking the time for the 5 interviews, and wished me luck in my job search. 

The next year was more of the same, I would get interviews at places and get through several rounds, always seeming to get cut at the last second, and any feedback that I received was due to ""lack of experience"". So I thought that maybe I was looking to start too high because I didn’t have experience. I managed to get a just above minimum wage contract position during the summer at a nationally ranked hospital system as a Customer Support Tech. The position was to provide support for a rollout for a new catalog system. My group of contractors trained for 1.5 months on the usual help desk stuff. However the rollout for the new system was delayed until October so all of the contractors would be moved to the general help desk. I was pulled aside and was told that I would be sent to a security team because ""you are too smart to be on that help desk"". Their words, not mine. Before my contract expired, I was asked to come back until December so I could cover the catalog rollout. I turned them down because my current pay pretty much only covered the gas for the commute and they refused to give me a raise. So I left with two letters of recommendation and the VP of Technology sought me out and told me to include him in any application I put in for the hospital. Over the next 16 months, I applied to the hospital 8 times including both letters and the VP's name, I never received a call. Just the generic emails that said they were pursuing more qualified candidates. 

I was stuck again in the cycle of not having enough experience to get a job and not having a job to get experience. So I decided to go back to school and pursue a MS in Computer Science. I applied to several, highly ranked CS programs and enrolled in an online program in the hopes of getting a position before graduation. Two weeks after I put the school on my resume I accepted a summer internship halfway across the country. For 3 months I worked for a tech startup, mainly doing website stuff but also developing code for other projects. 4 months after that I accepted a SWE role at an engineering contractor. I wasn't super enthused about that they did but I figured it was a great way to gain that elusive professional experience. I finally thought I was done with the job search for the time being. Well not so much, I was still going school full-time so the agreement was I would work for 20 hours a week until the term ended and then I would convert to full time. For 3 months I commuted an hour and a half each way to my job just to do nothing. I didn't even have a computer for the first two months. When I asked my manger why I had nothing to do, the answer was they were having trouble finding me work because of my part-time status. I waited for another month but I still got nothing so I decided that job was not for me and I resigned to continue to focus on my schooling.

That’s when I connected with a small, yet international, company located in the same city as my internship. This is the only company I have dealt with that treated me fairly, kept their word, and gave me an acceptable offer. I had 4 interviews until I received the job offer, which I accepted. I am excited to start with this company next month. The point of this post is to prove that not everyone is lucky, some can be pretty dang unlucky when it comes to the job search. It took me 3 years and 4 months to find a position that treated me fairly and what I am worth. So if you are really passionate about getting that CS position, it can take time. You just need to dig down and focus on that goal.

Once again, this post could be a lot longer if I included all the companies that cut me at the very end, lied, or lowballed me. This is the condensed experience."

I'm applying to the following universities for an MS in Statistics (with the exception of UCSB, which has an MA), in order of most desired to attend to least.

* UC Irvine
* UC Santa Barbara (my alma mater)
* UC Riverside
* San Diego State University
* CSU Long Beach
* CSU Fullerton

Education / Tests

* Graduated 2018 with a B.S. in Statistical Science, concentration in Applied Statistics
* Zero research experience
* 3.2 Cumulative GPA, 3.17 Major GPA, 3.16 last two years in the major
* 321 GRE (161V 160Q), writing score pending

Relevant Work Experience

* Interning for a year at a ecological research institute local to the university, mostly cleaning data in R.
* My current job as a data analyst at a medium sized (~600 employees) business, a little over a year now. I write R and Python code to clean/analyze data, build ML models, and use BI software like Power BI.

Recommendations 

* One of my professors, who I didn't really have much of a relationship with (true of most of my experience in college) although I did get an A in her class, and did very well on the final project (probably an average recommendation)
* A software engineer I worked closely with from the aforementioned internship (should be a good recommendation)
* My current manager, who is NOT a data scientist/statistician or even a programmer, although he does regard me very highly (should be a good recommendation)

I tried to reach out to about 3 other professors from my undergrad to get more academic recommendations and I did not receive responses from any of them. *grimace face*

Demographics

* 24 years old, Asian-American (Filipino)
* Identify as LGBTQ (bi)
* Parents are immigrants, only one went to college

Skills

* Data analysis, visualization, cleaning
* Proficient in both R and Python, although moreso R
* Basics of SQL
* Comfortable with Linux

I did a few different extracurriculars in college but I struggle to consider which are ""relevant"", for example I was on college radio (aside from working at the station) and I was a panelist at two editions of a campus conference centered around mental health.

Big companies respond quickly, but I failed to get an offer. Small companies did not reply at all, except one that want me to take their training right now. 

I feel like my resume might not be strong enough. I only have 3 side projects(2 from school &amp; 1 easy game program), and 1 software developer internship.  Average CS student &amp; GPA.

I want to do another side project, but not sure how difficult it should be. I heard some people talking about their offers, and they asked me if I also have offers lined up already so I feel a little depressed and nervous cause I feel everyone has an offer except me.   

I will start to apply for more companies, but I still want some advice on side projects or any other things I should do.

I believe the best practice is to get a bachelor's degree in computer science, and get an internship as well. Another great thing to do is to get a certification in specific DMB's such as SQL, or Oracle. My plan is to get a computer science degree, try to get a good internship, and complete my certification. I understand it will be hard work but I am more than willing to complete it and work hard for it.

So I am halfway through my junior year and the only experience in IT I have is from classes I have taken in college ( java and python programming, Html,CSS/JavaScript and SQL) but I know that I need to start looking into certifications as well as internships.

What certification should someone look into getting for security or just IT in general as their first certification?

Also what would be the best thing to use to learn in order to pass that certification exam? 

Is a certification really required for someone who’s wanting to be a intern somewhere? I have gained this impression by the standards these companies are wanting their interns to have to work at their company"

\- Recently (1 year ago) graduated from a top UC with 3.3 in CSE

\- One internship, one job that lasted 4 months before I got fired, currently with a start up getting paid less than half the average of where I live and it's killing my soul slowly

When I was in school I was one of the top ones, getting good grades and finishing up hard programs/homework with ease. Even now when some of my friends who are still in school ask me for help with homework I can get it pretty quickly.

I feel like I am the WORST software engineer out there and I have had the worst luck with jobs, all my friends who graduated same year as me have jobs where they have been there happy for year + and I am juggling a crappy deadend job with very little pay

Some of the people I have worked with are knowledge hungry and I have noticed I am not, when I am not working I'd much rather play games or hang out with friends than read a book about design pattern. I sometimes wonder if this career doesn't fit me just because of my personality and how much of a lazy person I am.

2 years at a career tech school for computer programming

spend 3 months with my school districts IT deparment

At my 3 month review I was told I wouldn't get any raise, came back the next day and said I'm worth more than that. Salary research in my city shows that help desk 1 starts at around $17/ hour. My boss comes back with $12/ hour which I took because I have a car payment and no other current job prospects. He said he understands that It's way less than what the industry pays, and he would understand if I left because of that. My company is very profitable, they just don't pay people a lot.

My question - What should I do? I am planning to stay a few more months for the experience to put on my resume, and then find something else. My company is creating multiple child companies and is growing quickly, and we are moving into a new building in the spring of next year. I could stay until then to help set up everything system wise, but idk if it would be worth it when I can get better pay elsewhere.

So I am currently completing my internship from a software company here in Dublin. I started in Jan 2019 and my contract ends in Jan 2020. I am primarily a full stack developer working with React and Django. I have learned a lot of stuff on the job that you normally can't learn on your own and it has been a great experience for me. I have contributed really well on my part helping the team create tools and live-services and also handled the production deployment from time to time. I have been praised by both my team leads and my managers. Sadly when I asked them if I can continue working they are saying that its not sure whether they can hire me back as a junior developer as the team that I am allotted to has a limited budget. My hopes of rehiring is pretty slim now but the managers have agreed to help me find a new job. They have agreed to help me get in touch with connections that they have in other companies which is good. 

My **question is whether I should try to persuade them to hire me as an intern again if possible for another 6 months or take this work experience that I currently have and look for other roles in other Companies?** I know its really hard out there so I am not sure what to do here...

**Capital One:** Richmond or McLean location, unsure what team I will be on, $3500 (Richmond) or $3800 (McLean) biweekly, free corporate housing.

I'm really torn over which offer to accept. I was really impressed by the effort C1 put into its Welcome Weekend, and I've heard good things about the tech stack it uses and the organization/structure of its internships. I also heard that C1 gives out a lot of return offers.

The GS name still has a certain luster that'll be hard to pass up, and it seems like front-office teams are more coveted than back-office ones (?), but I also wouldn't want to work with Slang/SecDB, and I've heard that its full-time offers are not that competitive (esp. for the NYC area). Location-wise, I much prefer NYC to Virginia, but my primary concern is to pick up useful skills this summer. I'm still not sure what area of SWE I'd like to work in after I graduate, so I can't really use that to decide. My main questions are:

1. How difficult is it to get a return offer from Goldman Sachs?
2. For those who interned at C1 and GS, were you satisfied overall with your internship experience?
3. How modern is Goldman Sachs' tech stack?"

I want to somehow work my way into this career field of software engineering of visual graphics and rendering. However, I am not interested in completely dropping my major or converting it to a minor. What can anyone suggest on what I should either focus in on or do extra in college and if I should minor in anything. Or if its still possible for me to pursue a masters in this area? Again, I am a freshman and do not know completely what I am doing but what I do know is that I would be foolish if I didn't somehow gravitate towards working in this field as its one of those topics where I stayed up at night reading and researching about and I am heavily passionate about. I really appreciate anyone taking their time to read this and any feedback they can give. (I have linked what my cybersecurity degree plan below if anyone needs more info).

dosl71,13,2019-10-29,Most job descriptions seem similar (REST + DB + Frontend). Is the reality of most jobs like this ?,slientObserver,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dosl71/most_job_descriptions_seem_similar_rest_db/,"I am a soon to be graduates CS student and will start Master's in CS  in US next year. To get an idea of the US job market, I often browse [glassdoor.com](https://glassdoor.com) and look for SWE jobs. As the title hints, most job descriptions seem very similar with slight only variations. Usually they require something along the lines of REST API development/consumption experience, backend experience, some frontend skills and some familarity with any form of SQL.

I have previously done 2 internships (mandatory) and  had 1 part-time job experience (about 1.5 years) in which during this time had a chance to gain considerable experience with all of those points, so they are not completely off-topic subjects for me, but they are not what I would want to do for the rest of my life either.

So, what I wonder is, are SWE jobs in US really like what those job descriptions suggest ? If so, what would you suggest to someone who doesn't want to spend their career building REST apis ?"

\- 9 9 9 9 9 9 A\* A\* 8 8 at GCSE (with the 8s in English Literature and Spanish) (a 9 is like a high A\* whereas 8 is just a normal/low A\*). Also have an A in Additional Maths (highest possible).

\- Predicted A\* A\* A\* A\* at A Level (Econ, Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science)

dosro2,2,2019-10-29,Finally received an offer for the summer and looking for internship prep,mrcultural911,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/dosro2/finally_received_an_offer_for_the_summer_and/,"First of all, I’d like to thank the WSO community and this sub for all the advice I’ve gotten. Using all the info on these forums, I managed to secure a PE internship this summer at one of the biggest pension funds in Canada (think CPPIB, CDPQ, OTPP, etc.).

For people still going through recruitment, keep your heads up, it’s a super tough process and sometimes it can get demoralizing. Just keep going at it and don’t give up. It was really hard for me getting turned down after multiple superdays. The key for me was to never stop networking, keeping up to date with current events, mastering technicals and applying to as many opportunities as possible. At the end of the day, the process requires a lot of luck and sometimes it’s just a numbers game.

Going forward for me, I was wondering if you guys had any recommendations for preparing for my internship this summer. I’m not super skilled in Excel or Powerpoint so I’ve been looking into the WSP and BWIS tutorials. Besides those courses, is there any more material I should be going over to either put myself in the best position to receive a return or to best position myself if I decide to make the switch to IBD?"
doswc9,5,2019-10-29,Here's my essay that got me into Kelley (IU) and Carlson (UMN),[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/doswc9/heres_my_essay_that_got_me_into_kelley_iu_and/,"I read through this essay after submitting, and I know it's cliche and kinda weird (especially the introduction :((( ), but I guess it kinda worked...

""I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was. I know it is my destiny."" Phrases like this from the Pokémon theme song capture the general narrative of life pushed by our parents, teachers, pop culture, and the media: be passionate. Be passionate. Be passionate. Be passionate. This stress on the individual through passion was my greatest gift and setback. Yes, my passion brought me a lot of success in life. However, my overly ambitious self has made me unaware of the people who disagree with me the most. One word could describe my mentality: obsessed. Obsessed with proving them wrong. Obsessed with defeating them all. I was obsessed with me and me only.

Ironically, it was the uncomfortable and divisive nature of politics that assisted me in breaking out of my vigorously passionate mindset. I had an extremely rare opportunity to intern for Congressman Mike Bishop of Michigan's 8th Congressional District. On textbook, I was the most passionate individual in politics. I followed the news vigorously, knew the ins and outs of the American government, and understood political strategy. The uncomfortable truth was that as an individual, I was vehemently passionate about Democratic policies, not those of Republicans. However, the chance to experience a political campaign, regardless of party, seemed like an extraordinary opportunity.

I desperately needed to become acquainted with conservative principles, for I knew none. I knew very well beforehand that I was no Bill Clinton at convincing voters. The thrill of watching politicians debating on live television did not set to stone in reality. Voters wanted to be validated instead of hearing about the reasons to vote for Bishop. I relentlessly tried to persuade voters by lauding Congressman Mike's record. Each effort, however, capsized even with the vessel of facts I threw at them. Every rejection invigorated my anger as my sense of dignity flared. Weren't logic and reason my most powerful weapons in a debate or conversation? Why couldn't I transcend my ignorance?

Each rejection allowed me to glimpse the person I actually was. I clung to what was familiar: myself. For all these years, I never realized I stuck so close to the nest of my egotism. Now I realized that I needed to leave what was me and embrace the unfamiliar. Ever since this realization, I have been pushing myself out of the confinement of myself and started to listen to others. I refused to let other people's perspective be shaped by my selfish overclouded judgment. I used to see my hardcore liberal values and beliefs as an abomination to a conservative Republican internship during an election year. However, my new political diversity enabled my replies to be smooth and calculated by allowing people to visualize the whole picture, by blending both conservative and liberal principles.

President James Madison, the father of the Constitution, warned, ""The strongest passions and most dangerous weakness of the human race; ambition, avarice, vanity, the honorable or venal love of fame, are all in conspiracy against the desire and duty of peace."" President Madison said that as Americans we must deliver ourselves objectively and validate the opinions of others no matter the situation. If people uphold their opinions most of the time, people lose respect and trust for one another. I serve as a testament to President Madison's claim. Talking to people on every corner of the political spectrum served as my catharsis for my previously unhealthy emotions. Sure, my dreams and ambitions keep me motivated, keep my morale up, and give my life a sense of hope. However, when I talked to those voters, I knew I was on a train leaving my previous stubbornness, pride, and assertiveness to observing, understanding, and networking the environment around me stop by stop. This is where I am truly content."
dot0sq,4,2019-10-29,How to Become a Better Machine,SlowResearch2,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/dot0sq/how_to_become_a_better_machine/,"This may seem weird, but I got a college that expects that its students are machines who do everything perfectly: University of Rochester. I got in a lot of trouble in all my clubs for making tiny music mistakes (I do mostly theatre and music clubs). I got rejected from the Chamber Singers group because you're expected to not make any mistakes on your first try. I keep getting Cs on french essays because the professor expects absolute perfection in terms of grammar. And most of the students here take a billion AP classes and bypass half the first year major requirements, and I'm stuck in Calc 1. I already feel like a failure. And if I can't maintain a 3.7+, I'm putting my chances for an internship, ergo my career, ergo my entire life in serious jeopardy. How do I become better than perfect?"

Was wondering if there were any resources offered by the univeristy for learning SQL.

I have seen [this](https://online.umich.edu/courses/introduction-to-structured-query-language-sql/) online course, but it seems to already have happened, and [this](https://cscar.research.umich.edu/event/intro-to-sql-4/) workshop, but I'm not sure I can make the workshop.

Otherwise I was going to do some codeacademy or something. I'm looking to do Data Science and lots of the internships I looked at had SQL listed as a requirement or a recommended skill.

I've applied to a number of internships for Summer 2020 and am not sure where I stand with many of them. I've received around a dozen rejections and around the same number of coding challenges (Hackerrank, Codility, etc.), but most companies haven't gotten back to me at all.

If I applied 2+ weeks ago and haven't heard back yet should I assume it's a no? Is there any chance they just haven't looked at my resume yet or that I've been placed on some sort of waitlist? Is it poor etiquette to reach out to companies that haven't contacted me regarding the status of my application?

Additionally, I was wondering I should take receiving a Hackerrank from a company as a positive signal - I know some (Twitter) send these to every single applicant, so many people do well/perfectly and are still rejected. Do any of you know whether this is the exception to the rule or the norm? If I feel like/know I aced a Hackerrank, should I be confident I'll advance to the next round of interviewing?

I know there are a ton of questions here, so any information/advice at all would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"

I just received an offer to work as an MLE intern in the summer of 2020. (Stipend: about 7500$ per month + housing in Seattle).

What should be the factors that I need to consider before accepting the offer. These are the factors that I had in my mind: 

1) If I would want to work full time in the company: I don't really know how to decide this. Should I just randomly message employees who work in the company on LinkedIn and ask their experience? 

2) Is it easy to switch from MLE to SDE: I think that MLE is just a fancy word. Most of the work that I shall be doing would be the same as that of an SDE except that I might need to run a couple of models etc. So it should be easy to switch for me to switch to an SDE position, if I keep on doing my leetcode. 

3) Is it easy to hop between companies: Assuming that I get a job offer after the internship and I don't like something about the company, how easy is it to change companies. 

4) Does the reputation of the company matter when applying at a new company?

Is there any other thing that I should be aware of before accepting an offer? Also, can anyone elaborate on any of the above mentioned factors: if they are important or not."

In case this interview goes well, what would you advice me to do?

* Lyft (Level 5, autonomous driving) - Palo Alto
* Dropbox - Seattle
* Airbnb - Seattle
* Two Sigma - New York

All of these are for summer SWE internships.

I am currently leaning towards either Airbnb or Two Sigma, but was wondering if anyone else had any insight into any of these companies, or suggestions one way or the other. Also, feel free to ask me any questions about any of the companies and their interview processes, etc, as well as any other questions about me.

Like I said, I am currently a junior, so I would prefer to go to a company where I get a good conversion offer for full time after I graduate. I am not exactly sure what I want to do after graduation (whether it be finance, health, consumer tech), so I am definitely open to exploring.

Which offer would you take and why?"

The job description was a little vague so I'm nervous about being prepared. Nervous I probably may not get it and it would a little costly. Any advice? They think Im local obviously, when I really live several states away.

edit: also concerned how to strategically avoid giving away that I live in another state. My college is online so thats easy to explain away, but my internship is not.

Background: I go to a well known Canadian university and only applied to companies in California, NYC, Seattle, and the occasional trading firm in Chicago. I had three internships already (2 full stack, one IT); even so, it wasn't easy to get a response as I needed visa sponsorship and had a 2022 graduation date which got me auto-rejected from a few places.

I did around 300 leetcode (but only 150 unique questions) and practised behavioural questions for a few hours. 

I personally used this list: https://www.teamblind.com/article/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-100-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU and added more questions to target my weak points (2D DP, Top sort, Patience sort, Graph theory, Tries, 2D Matrices). I also bought leetcode premium to practise company-specific questions. I usually tried to get an hour of leetcode after work during the week and around 3-4 hours a day during the weekends.

The whole search took around 2 months starting at the start of September. I made a Sankey diagram with my results below:

Background: I go to a well known Canadian university and only applied to companies in California, NYC, Seattle, and the occasional trading firm in Chicago. I had three internships already (2 full stack, one IT); even so, it wasn't easy to get a response as I needed visa sponsorship and had a 2022 graduation date which got me auto-rejected from a few places.

I did around 300 leetcode (but only 150 unique questions) and practised behavioural questions for a few hours. 

I personally used this list: https://www.teamblind.com/article/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-100-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU and added more questions to target my weak points (2D DP, Top sort, Patience sort, Graph theory, Tries, 2D Matrices). I also bought leetcode premium to practise company-specific questions. I usually tried to get an hour of leetcode after work during the week and around 3-4 hours a day during the weekends.

Stats :/ (kinda not the best sadly)

SAT: 770 math, 690 reading

GPA: (top 20% our school does quintiles)

I'm not sure how it would convert but I think it's a 3.7 ish unweighted ?? First semester in junior and sophomore year were not the best for me, but they changed a lot (especially second sem junior year)

APs: 5s,4s,3s in everything, and my predicted for my IB class is a 7.

Extracurriculars:

\- Tennis since beginning of HS and captain for 2 years (bronze in ninth grade, gold in tenth and eleventh at international competition)

\- Badminton since beginning of HS and captain for 1 year (gold in eleventh at international competition)

\- Taught elementary students at my school how to play badminton

\- Climbed Kilimanjaro with my dad, which honestly was very hard but I am also grateful to have done it and had the opportunity and resources to be able to have done something like that, and I also have a scuba diving license

\- Karate for three years and black belt by graduation (I'm confident also bronze in a tournament for my age group here)

\- NHS

\- MUN

\- I volunteered 3 ours for three month during my summer break at a hospital in a town I usually am in because a help from my grandma's house was admitted there, and I played with the kids there. Then I came back to school and had a toy drive for the kids there, very successful, then I took them with me back to India and to the hospital and gave them to the kids there.

\- Service trips with my school (Laos for building an eco house and Maldives for whale shark research)

\- I am an executive member of a club at my school and we have held multiple talks to inspire students at our school.

\- I have volunteered every year at an annual festival our school holds.

\- I taught myself japanese (sadly I don't have any time to take a standardized test for it but I will for my regular decisions)

\- I really like to watch anime (lol) so I have an anime review account on instagram which I was pretty committed to in tenth grade so I have like 3000 followers (idky I'm including this but lol I just randomly remembered).

\- They don't allow for under 18s here to have jobs, so I decided to coach tennis at the tennis courts in my compound since the beginning of my junior year, so I can put something I am capable of to use and I've made quite a bit of money.

\- I had an internship at my dad's startup businesses during the summer.

\- I can code.

\- I speak 6 languages (3 extremely fluently)

\- I've been playing the flute since I was in 6th grade and I finished Grade 5 abrsm for flute and grade 5 theory, as well. 

\- I was in a swimming club in my city for 3 years (which was part of the reason my grades weren't the best because I was very occupied by the sports I did).

\- These are more my hobbies but I read quite a bit, and I also draw in my free time (I have sold some of my artwork).

Ending note/ my thoughts??

I think that the experiences I've had and opportunities I've had, honestly, are pretty great, but I don't think they are enough. Sorry everything isn't very in-depth but aha early applications are due in two days soooo I didn't want to write a second application here. The reason I don't appear to have focused a lot on something specific either is because I didn't know what I wanted to do in the future until very recently, and I can only really focus on it now.

I am currently in my second to last semester of college and am a Marketing Major with a Fashion Studies Minor. I applied to a bunch of places and one of the last ones to respond to me was i5 Marketing saying they reviewed my application and were inviting me in for an interview the next day. I secured a time slot with them, and the confirmation email I received, instructed that I go to 690 8th avenue, 3rd floor, and to ask for Kristina. The first interview was short and I met with someone not named Kristina who asked me simple and common interview questions and then told me that they would be selecting a few interviewees to come back for a second round. I received a call much later on in the day to let me know that I was being invited for a second interview. The next day, I went back to 690 8th avenue, 3rd floor, and this time actually met with someone named Kristina. The interview was conducted in some coffee shop on the same block as 690 8th avenue and was much longer and the woman Kristina gave a lot of background on i5 marketing and how as you continue to work with them you move up and start to make more and more money. This got merely excited and intrigued to want to work with them, and I ended up getting phone call from them later on offering me a Marketing Internship. 

Fast forward to now, I begin to start to see and hear about these companies that are doing this kind of pyramid scheme with individuals like myself who are looking for marketing internships. The trend with all of them, they hold their interviews at 690 8th avenue on either the 3rd or 5th floor. I wanted to go ahead and look at reviews of i5 marketing, and I decided to message some people who had left reviews, as I had seen on one review that all of the reviews were fake. I began to do this about a couple of weeks ago, and just now received a message from someone who previously worked as a marketing intern at i5 marketing who had something positive to say about them. However, as me and the individual got to talking more and more, she confirmed that she pretty much was scammed, and her boss told her to write that interview just after like two days of working i5 marketing. 

She explained that she only spent one month with i5 marketing due to the fact that when she started her ""marketing internship,"" she was doing a job in the street, promoting/giving, some phones. She complained to someone in the company about this and then they moved her to the office, but they had nothing for her to do there so she was just pretty much wasting her time and eventually left the company. I also forgot to mention that in my interview, that Kristina in i5 marketing put a lot of emphasis on her Sprint was their biggest Fortune 500 company that they represented.

The conversation that I had with the former marketing intern at i5 marketing ended in her pretty much confirming that is is a scam and once she started the office job they then refused to pay her for that and would only pay her for the original job they started her at. 

What I learned from this whole experience, is to always do research about whatever company you are applying for a job or internship for, and if it says 690 8th avenue then DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Also this reddit forum is great and helped me a lot when my speculations about i5 marketing were first beginning."

Over the Summer I interned at a FAANG company as a product designer and got a return offer as a sophomore. Now as a junior, I switched my major to CS (probably not the best decision for my GPA but I had my reasons) I am enjoying the CS classes, even though they are basic. I am also excited with the applications but at times I struggle and I get super frustrated with myself. I am also struggling in my math classes. While I am aware that being a product designer requires a different set of skills to CS, I just get frustrated because the company I worked with always talked about hiring the best and the brightest and I feel like that's not me. Also, this internship was a huge confidence booster. So with me struggling with these classes, it's kind of destroying the confidence that I acquired over the Summer.

Anyway, it's obvious to some of my classmates that I'm becoming friends with that I'm finding these classes hard but when the conversation evolves regarding what we did over the Summer and I tell them about my internship some of them ask ""how did you get it?"" I know some of my friends ask this question in such a way that they are looking for advice but for some people that are planning to work in different fields, ask it in such a way that they are in disbelief. Some people ask if I had connections (I don't). Even the people who don't know me academically ask me this question. (Not all encounters are like this though.)

I don't know if I'm projecting my insecurities by misinterpreting what people mean when they ask me this question or if people genuinely think I'm too dumb to work at these companies. If the latter is true is this how it's going to be, where people will just think I'm too dumb to work in certain places."

[Obligatory Sankey diagram](https://i.imgur.com/MUaOier.png)

**Background:**

I'm a junior at decent (T-25 maybe?) university. I started searching near the end of July and have previously done one full stack internship at a large bank. My only real Leetcode preparation was doing the Blind 75 list and the occasional problem that a friend would suggest.

**Companies:**

I mostly only applied to companies in tech hubs like the Bay and NYC. My job postings were mostly found on various Github repositories and just companies that I know exist and have internships. 

Since companies have different processes/number of rounds, I wasn't sure how to group everything together so I grouped all of those into either 1st round (mostly challenges but some phone calls) or after first round (some companies had 2 rounds, 3 rounds, or even onsites) so all of the ""no offers"" are me getting rejected at some point in the subsequent rounds. 

All 3 of my referrals resulted in some sort of first round and 2 of them resulted in offers. The ""declined"" data points on the diagram are companies that responded to me after I had signed my offer. 

**Conclusion:**

I'm happy to say I'll be joining FAANG this summer. 

Good luck everyone! Internships are just a numbers game so you need to cast a wide net. Also, try and get referrals wherever you can since they can usually at least get your resume looked at."

dpcvp9,8,2019-10-30,Alone in the Woods,SeanA660,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpcvp9/alone_in_the_woods/,"""I live in Northern Ontario (Canada). There isn't much out here besides deep woods. Its the ideal place for hunting, you could go for hundreds of Kilometers without seeing anyone. And that's why this story is so frightening.

It was just your average Friday afternoon at work, people finishing up articles before the weekend, I was personally eager to get home because I had a date that night. For reference I'm only 26, I had worked there since I was an intern fresh out of school. I worked there for a few years before being hired on full time. I wanted to be a journalist since I was 10, and now here I was, living the dream. It was about 3:30 pm when the call came in from the Police that someone was missing in the woods. I volunteered to go out because I felt it was also a proving ground for me, if I could find him or at least help in some way maybe I could get more recognition around the office. I call my date telling her that something big had come up at work and asked to move the date to Monday. Then I went home packed food, a tent,a coat, a flashlight and matches. I was only expecting to be their for at least a night, I really wanted to find him.

 I get to his last known location at 4:30 pm. I pull up and see at least 2 cop cars pulled over. I dint really have a plan to get past them. I knew they just wouldn't let me pass by, so I sat there for a few minutes thinking. I came to the thought that if I went a few minutes up the road I would find a place to pull over and just walk out to the woods. When I got their it was already starting to get dark, it was October after all. I follow an established hunting path that police knew he went up. I knew it was unlikely that I would find him on my first day. So I set up my tent and ate dinner. Though out the night I would hear rustling and twigs snapping outside my tent. I naturally assumed it was just some animal trying to find some food  from my site. I woke up the next morning to see very large deer tracks around my site. I thought that it must have been just a large male deer, but like I am for most things, I was very wrong.

I begin my search at around 7:45 am and follow the hunting trail for a few hours, until I make it to a little path just off the main one. The only reason this caught my eye at all is because I saw the same deer prints from before, but these ones were a few days old. Now I hunted, like practically everyone did up here, and I knew that the police stated that he was on a hunting trip. So my inner hunter knew that any hunter would follow these tracks, so that's what I did. The further I traveled the more dense the woods became. Soon it was clear I would have to make camp again. Again all night there was movement outside my tent. This now started to startle me, I had been extra careful to make sure everything was picked up and put away from my dinner. This time however the movement was accompanied by a snarl of something that didn't even sound like a deer. I chalked it up to be just a hungry bear, and fell asleep.

I awoke early morning to the sound of a distant scream. It sounded like a man, more over it sounded like it was wounded. I quickly ran out of my tent to get a better idea where it came from. It was quiet, even for a forest, no birds were chirping, there was no wind, none of the leaves were moving. It was like time had stopped. Then I looked down to see the same deer prints I had seen the day before. I was certain it must have been a bear making the noises last night. My thoughts were interrupted by an even closer scream. I ran to the direction I had heard it and came across the body of a man in his late 20's. He had large cut all over his legs and chest. He looked as if he had been attacked by a bear. I looked into his pocket to find a note. It said:""

"" Day One- Tuesday

I set out for the path at dawn, parting ways with my party, I wished them luck and set of. I had been talking with the local native tribe who lives on a reservation nearby to get a good idea on what is a good place to hunt off the path. They said the would not recommend me going off the path because the spirit of the Wendigo is said to stalk these woods, and it would be safer if I stayed on the path. I'm not one to criticize other cultures but I did not take their warning seriously. 

Day Two- Wednesday

Last night I couldn't sleep. There was noise all night around my tent. Not just the wind, but something was moving out there, waiting for me to go look outside my tent. I feel like something is watching me right now, and I feel unsettled.

Day Three- Thursday 

Same thing happened again last night, but the sounds were louder this time. I think I might be going insane, It feels like time keeps stopping. Nothing is moving, and I'm certain that something is following me.

Day Four- Friday

I'm insane, i'm now believing in fairy tales. Maybe those people I talked to were right, maybe there is something out here. I'm heading back I don't care if I haven't shot anything I just want to go home.""

""I was concerned when I found out he had saw he was hearing the same things I was, but not as concerned as when I looked at the days he listed. The fourth day he listed was three days ago. I looked closely at his cuts. The blood had dried. He had been dead for a few days. That's when I remembered, I took native studies in high school. I remember learning that the Wendigo was a large, man like deer. Even more chillingly I remembered its call sounded like a man screaming. Everything begins to make sense now. Oh lord I hear the scream again, its so close right now. Please let me get out of this. Who ever finds this, my name is John Harvey, and I am scared."""

dpg8av,9,2019-10-30,[Advice] Is this company a scam?,Deuslogik,NYCjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCjobs/comments/dpg8av/advice_is_this_company_a_scam/,"Today, I got an invite from a marketing company called Olympiad. They sent me an invite for an interview but upon further research, this company seems like it is another MLM scheme. 

Here are the links to its website and its Linkedin:
http://nycolympiad.com/
https://www.linkedin.com/company/olympiad-nyc/

Some reasons I think so is:
1. The marketing concept behind the company uses keywords such as ""brand awareness"", ""events marketing"", ""guarantee"", ""social impacts"", ""face-to-face"", and others.

2. The website and Linkedin don't give you a specific address of where they are located, just the zipcode 10007. After doing some detective work, I got ahold of some coordinates which brought me to this address: 
80-44 Park Pl, New York, NY 10007
It is not 690 8th ave, 3rd floor New York, NY 10036, but that area might have some history with scams.

3. The website and Linkedin have different jobs posted with the website having positions such as internship, promotional brand ambassador, and brand management.
The Linkedin have positions such as retail sales assistant, management trainee, marketing intern, and others. Neither websites show the position I have applied for with the company.

4. When I reversed image searched the logo, it brought me to the search result ""chanel iphone case""

5. When I looked up the domain name registration of the website on whois.icann.org, it showed it was created on

I've only interned at small, unknown companies before and frankly in the past never got more than one offer. I'm currently pretty lost choosing between them. 

Some of the things I've been factoring in are:

- potentially securing full time employment with the company I intern at, so choosing a company w a bright future would be nice

- or choosing a company that would benefit my career in the long run 

- being close to family is nice (i'm from Toronto) but not the biggest deal 

- money isn't the biggest concern either for the internship, but I would value it a bit more when choosing a full time position

- I've never been to cali and love travelling so that would be fun

- COL in cali is significantly higher than Toronto where I'd live at home, but would have to commute for an hour one way.

- Culture/interesting product is important. All companies give lunch and seem like they all have a fun culture.

- Unsure if there are other factors I should be considering

Offers:

Verizon/Yahoo

- 37 usd, 1.5k housing stipend
- Biggest company, established intern program
- Specific position/which product I'll be working on is told later on
- Unsure how well Yahoo has been doing nowadays, Blind/Glassdoor give the impression I shouldn't work there

Inkling

- 38 usd, 1.5 housing stipend as well
- Smaller company, position is FullStack but I would prefer more Backend or Mobile dev.
- Product not as interesting as the other two companies
- Small intern program


Zynga (Toronto)

- 35 cad
- Mobile dev
- Product seems the most fun
- Unsure if they are expanding enough to hire more new grads

Also are there other details/questions I should find out before accepting?

Thanks!"

I currently see a psychiatrist but unfortunately, I also have had glaucoma my whole life so I am not allowed to take ADHD medication.

I try my hardest in college and did really well during the first midterm season (on all the exams except CS but that was notoriously hard this year).

Initially it was supposed to be a part time job but it later became full time. It's a small restaurant and we're only 5 employees plus my manager and the owner, both of which I only see about once a week or less. 

I like this job and I get along well with my colleagues. At the same time it was supposed to be a student job only to support myself and I really don't want to be stuck working in a restaurant much longer and I really look forward to pursuing a career in the field I studied for. I will be studying full time until the end of the year and then I will have to take a one year unpaid internship to complete my degree so I sadly won't be able to do that very soon. 

That said, I find myself more and more involved with this job and I'm not very happy about it. Aside from doing more hours, I'm often doing more then my job, for example extra cleaning, taking care of bookings, shopping for supplies in my free time because they didn't get delivered and we need them and other smaller things that I just do cause they don't require that much effort, but then they pile up. This is all because the place is small, we had some people quitting lately and someone had to take care of things that are not in the daily routine but still need to be done. The manager and owner are pretty useless at that, they take care of major renovations/issues but don't care for minor stuff. They are also quite clueless about what goes on in the everyday business as they only come in once a week and only look at the sales report. This is because they are working into turning the brand into a franchise so they don't focus so much on the existing restaurant. 

I also feel like I am emotionally investing too much in this job and that's the biggest issue for me. I'd be at home after one shift and I won't be able to stop thinking about what happened, what went wrong, what I could have done better. Every time I talk to my superiors and get even the slightest criticism I'd be thinking about it the while day.

I really want to take a step back and stop being involved so much into this job especially because it was supposed to be just a side hustle and now instead it's even taking away time from my studies. How do I stop caring so much and instead just do my job and close the door behind me when I'm done?"

One is for the spring semester January-August 2020 at a small manufacturing plant, I would gain a lot of skill in design and manufacturing; they were promising a lot of experience and independent work(which I like). The other offer is from a bigger company that's offering me a little bit of a better deal from May-August, more ME work, and has a great turnover rate after college. The thing is I signed a paper saying I would like to do the internship with the smaller company but nothing really official. Right now I'm thinking I might work at the smaller company and then depart from them to the bigger company.

I am a computer engineering major but I love computer science more than the electrical circuits portion of my major. I love to code and play and design with different ICs. There are so many things I want to learn but with school and my internship I can’t fit them all in and can probably only do one at most. Hose things are

- Tensorflow / Machine Learning in Python
- OpenGL in c++
- Arduino / raspberry pi projects 
- Learn more libraries in python reading some books

There are honestly more things but I am blanking at the moment. I know people are going to say “go with what interests you the most” but honestly I don’t know which I will enjoy the most because I haven’t done any of them in depth yet. I’ve only touched the surface on all of them. Most of my free time is spent studying for school and doing homework but i want to force time to learn these side projects so I can enjoy coding and not hate it because of school. 

So my question is how do people decide what to focus on and what to push to the side."

So my background was in food/beverage/hospitality for the last 15 years or so. I worked my way up in restaurants and have been a chef for the last few years. Finally got burned out after working insane hours, holidays, weekends, missing important life events and milestones for friends and family. 

Anyways I have always told myself if I didn't cook I would go into IT because I've always taken to technology and computers. But with the exception of a PC building hobby and a few comp science classes I dabbled with in college (Java, HTML) I have barely dipped a toe into this multi-faceted field. 

My plan as of now, and please weigh in on this, is to return to school for my associates in IT and explore options once I can snag an internship (if i can). I'm interested in web development/cyber security simply because that is where it seems the market is leaning these days. 

Are there any alternate paths available? Certificates I should pursue? Books I should read? Blogs or podcasts to subscribe to? Part of me thinks this is what I kinda sort of want to do and the other part thinks ""you have no idea what you are getting yourself into, you might hate it, just stick to upgrading ram and SSD's"". 

Obviously starting from (mostly) scratch at the age of 34 is pretty daunting which is why I'm here. This reminds me of an eager young line cook asking ""should I go to culinary school?"" on all my old kitchen subreddits (The answer is no, or yes, or maybe depending) Which always got really old. 

Thanks for any words of advice."

&amp;#x200B;

The quarrel I have is what languages I should write my side projects in. For example I enjoy Python and C most but I understand that Java (a language that I am comfrotably familiar with) is in high demand. Nevertheless I don't enjoy Java because of its verbose nature, and I only use UNIX systems so C# isn't an option for me.

So I was wondering, if writing side proejcts in Python and C ok even though they are not the most indemand skills for internship jobs. (Most internship jobs are enterprise java shops).

Need To Look At Full Ride Scholarship Programs",ScholarGrade,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dprx2c/my_story_t20s_are_great_but_you_yes_you_need_to/,"This sub focuses on T20s, and they're highly rated for a reason.  But I wanted to share some of my story and give a quick plug to full ride merit scholarship programs.  The bottom line is that you really should be considering these if you're a top applicant.

[You can read more details about my experience in high school here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/cfgu8j/introducing_your_new_mods/eu9un9l/?context=3), but the TL;DR is that I was a top student at a lousy public high school who had no idea how T20s or financial aid worked.  I applied to several full ride scholarship programs and got into my favorite one, [the Clemson National Scholars Program](https://www.clemson.edu/academics/programs/national-scholars/).  You can read about the [amazing opportunities they offer here](https://www.clemson.edu/academics/programs/national-scholars/experience/), but I wanted to give a quick rundown of some of the incredible experiences I had with the program.  In my opinion, programs like this present far greater opportunities than the general student body gets at any top school.  **If you get into NSP, your mileage WILL vary** - but that's part of the point.  It's designed to empower you to pursue things you're interested in (see if you can guess my major just based on this list).  Note that if you're interested in NSP at Clemson, you must apply to the Honors College by December 1 to be eligible.

#People

One of the best things about NSP is the people.  I was in a close-knit community of ~50 other top students.  We had tons of opportunities to learn from each other and build close friendships, and I even met my wife through NSP.  We also had the opportunity to meet with almost every important visitor to campus.  Here is a list of people I got to meet either at Clemson or on a trip with the university, and honestly looking back on this, I still can't believe how incredible all this was.

- The Chairman of the Federal Reserve (Just 8 students, our prof, and Ben Bernanke.  For an hour.  At the Fed.  In the middle of the Great Recession)
- The US Ambassador to Canada
- An Economics Nobel Laureate (I sat next to him at dinner)
- A member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers (After his post on the council, he returned as a professor at Clemson and taught a class on the Great Recession at Clemson in 2009.  Best class ever.  We became friends and he came to my wedding)
- The lead archaeologist at Ephesus (Gave me a signed copy of his book)
- Curator of the Vasa Museum in Stockholm (Gave us a VIP tour)
- A top federal judge at a courthouse in Amsterdam
- A NYT Best Selling Author
- VIP tickets to a Clemson football game in the President's box (I managed this one five times as well as a VIP tour of the athletics facilities)
- A former Fortune 500 CEO and several other business leaders
- Two presidential candidates and other politicians
- Diplomats at the US Consulate in Istanbul
- Many other visiting professors and other guests of the university

#Trips, Classes, and Programs

Most of these full ride programs include more than just a scholarship.  At Clemson, NSP takes this to a whole other level with study abroad, special course offerings, and other programs.  Here are some of the opportunities I had:

- A summer studying abroad in England/Wales/Ireland (I extended the trip and visited Belgium, Germany, Austria, and Italy as well)
- Maymester study abroad trips to Turkey, Amsterdam, Stockholm, and St. Petersburg
- Seminar classes exclusive to NSP
- Retreats, team building, and social events for national scholars
- Mentorship meetings with advisors, professors, older students, and alumni
- An economics book club funded by the Econ department (We met at professors' houses to eat, drink, and ~~be merry~~ discuss econ books)
- A living history research project
- An Internship Funding Program
- Several summer camps and conferences

#Other Perks

The program also included ""fringe benefits"".  Most of this (other than the stipends and dedicated support office) isn't spelled out formally on any website or document, but the perks were very real.  Other items on this list weren't part of the program, but I would attribute the opportunity to NSP.  NSP graduates routinely win university and national awards, attend top grad schools, and launch great careers competitive with those of top T20 grads.

- Stipends / funding for normal study, research, internships, and study abroad
- Priority class registration (I also had tons of success getting in off the wait list for classes.  I'm not sayin', I'm just sayin'. )
- Priority housing registration
- Ability to enroll in graduate classes as an undergrad.  (I finished the first year of a PhD program before graduating)
- Extended library privileges (Some of my text books I found in the library and just checked them out for the whole semester)
- Awarded a graduate fellowship
- **FOOD** (Like, everywhere.  Almost every NSP class meeting had pizza, there were numerous special dinners and other events, there was a dedicated support office with 24/7 snacks &amp; drinks, etc.)
- Dedicated advising &amp; support staff
- An absurd number of AP credits.  This frees up your class schedule immensely and enabled me to take classes like Scuba Certification and Tennis.
- Outside scholarships or grants, some of which can be applied to ancillary expenses, research/internship opportunities, etc.
- Leads on internships and my first job after college as a trader for a Wall Street bank

As I mentioned above, every national scholar's experience is different.  But these are the kinds of opportunities you can get in programs like NSP.  This sounds incredible, but one of the reasons it happens is that every major university has enormous resources and these are not distributed evenly to the student body.  Not. Even. Close.  Note also that many of the above opportunities were not exclusive to NSP and would have been open to anyone in the Honors College.  So if you're attending Clemson or another state school, check out their honors college as well as their top scholarships.

#THE LIST

&gt;""This sounds great ScholarGrade, but other than Clemson NSP, how do I find these programs?""

Lucky for you, I made a list.  Most schools have a major scholarship program of some kind or another.  At schools below the top 20, these serve as tools to bring in top students who would otherwise be unlikely to attend.  There are many reasons for them, but you should start researching them now.  [Here's a fairly comprehensive list which I've shared before of major scholarships.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/azu8o2/change_your_trajectory_full_ride_scholarship/)  Watch the deadlines carefully because many otherwise qualified applicants aren't considered because they're too late.  Deadlines for these are already upon us.  Your best shot at winning one is to look for the full scholarship programs at the schools you're applying to and apply to several from this list."

I have customer service experience but nothing relevant to the industry. This makes me think I am not qualified for anything netsec-related, as most positions require tools or technologies I have yet to work with and then the dreaded 3+ years experience in tech support/relevant industry. Is it worth it to get a help desk spot in a neighboring city? Should I get a cert to help my chances or is my current background enough?

Currently I'm learning active directory and plan on setting up an environment to test out what I'm learning. I've also designed and partly implemented a virtual home lab with snort on pfsense, a splunk vm, and a kali vm to generate noise on the network. But I'm still learning splunk.

Most of my team is remote and my coworkers are in other departments. I have an amazing manager, but she's the director so it's rare that I get to meet with her.

I'm passionate about software, but I'm having a hard time finding motivation to code with the lack of human interaction. I wouldn't consider myself an extrovert, but I don't like the fact I'm in my head all day.

I've thought about going into sales, but I'm curious to see what others recommend."

I failed first round,janestreethrowaway,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/dpumzl/anyone_have_experience_reinterviewing_with_jane/,"I believe I didn't pass the first round of my phone interview Jane Street for a quant trading internship two days ago. I don't go to a ""top"" school so I was wondering if I just ruined my chances of getting into Jane Street. The questions weren't even hard, but I fucked up some mental math and forgot to add some stuff to one of my formulas. I want to say I got everything correct eventually but I don't think I will be able to move onto the next round.

Does anyone have experience re-interviewing with Jane Street after failing the first round?"

dpvfc0,1,2019-10-31,Summer 2020 Internship Results,davoodm93,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dpvfc0/summer_2020_internship_results/,"**Background:**

I'm a first year PhD student at a T-50 university. My research is about NLP and Deep Learning. 

**Companies:**

I applied to any company listed on LinkedIn. I just  searched for Summer 2020 internship and applied. Also, I tried to find recruiters or employees of different companies and sent them an email to see if they had an opening for internship.

I didn't get any interviews from applying to online applications. I emailed several employees and managed to get an interview. My first interview was for a company I really like. The first interview was not very good imo. But somehow they were excited to move forward.
The second interview was longer and more practical, like how to solve a specific problem using RNN or FF neural networks. After I got my offer I emailed to cancel my other interviews with FAANG companies because they were SWE positions and that's not my top priority.

**Conclusion:**

I'll be joining TAND this summer and I'm very excited about my 1st internship in my 1st year of study. I hope everyone gets the internship they are excited about. My suggestion is: always try to find employees or recruiters. The least thing you get by finding recruiters/employees/managers, is a phone interview which is a step ahead from filling the application form.

Good Luck and if you have any questions let me know ʘ‿ʘ"

I've visited the city, and I really liked it. Because of that, I've been seeking an internship there. I imagine myself moving there after I'm done with college. I've done my own exhaustive search for internships in the Seattle area, and I've applied to all of them I could find. However, I was curious about the lesser known tech companies that offer internship programs. 

Some background info on me: I'm a Junior getting a BS in Computer Science with a 3.9 GPA. I've done multiple personal projects in various disciplines, but my main skills are in web development. Besides this, I've done an internship in my home state."

The roles I’ve had/will have for these internships (from oldest to newest) are:

1) Help Desk Support (non profit)
2) Infrastructure/Information Security (Mainly developing a NIST orientated assessment plan)(middle size company)
3) Application Development and Security (Fortune 500)


I’m graduating college early and will only be doing a part time semester (only need 6 credits). Is there a role I can take during this period of time based on my internship experience? I’m looking towards more of the information security side, but I know getting a role part time (up to 30 hrs/week) for that might be difficult."
