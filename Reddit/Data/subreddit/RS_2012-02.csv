There was no limits on peoples exchange databases therefore people had mailbox sizes of 20+ GB which was pissing off outlook.

So recently I bought a barracuda mail archiver and set exchange up to auto delete emails older than 6 months. (side not people still have mail box sizes of 3-4GB). Now i have a ton of free space in the exchange databases. I need to run eseutil /d but it requires 110% times the space on the server as the database.  Once I do one of the databases i will be find for the rest. 

So here is my question is how do i do the first one.

My idea: I have Exchange Management Console/Shell on another server. This server has tons of free space. Therefore can I dismount the database, copy it to the other server, run eseutil /D on it then copy the database back the exchange server, and reattach it to exchange?  (Note: M$ does not recommend using the eseutil /t and putting the db on a network share). 

thanks in advance

Several years of busting my ass (relatively) at a mediocre public high school, plus tons of luck, got me into my long-time dream college where I joined a baller engineering program.

I had arrived at my version of paradise. I got complacent; I partied, made friends, and expanded my horizons. I also relapsed into a habit of chafing against classes with teaching methods and material that I found irrelevant, and I often did the minimum amount of work to keep my GPA where I wanted it. I grazed over countless topics in my spare time and mastered none, unless you count clicking the Stumbleupon button or writing bad poetry.

Then, last winter quarter (a third of the way into my sophomore year), I took on a time-sucking leadership position in a rowdy extracurricular club and began to let substance habits get the better of me. That spring quarter I underachieved like there was no tomorrow. It was all okay though, because I had a job lined up, didn't I? I was quite the budding (pseudo)intellectual, wasn't I?

Hedonism was the theme of that summer. I turned down a research internship I felt woefully unprepared for and took on a higher-paying job with an education startup that I was woefully not cut out for. I told myself I was going to be a part of the changing education landscape, that I was going to spend my spare time learning web dev and studying the brain and whatnot. Instead I had barrels of fun but continued to let my mind, along with many interpersonal connections, fall into disrepair.

Fall was the very worst. I avoided probation by the skin of my teeth and knew of no professors I could ask for future recommendations. I grew depressed, socially anxious, and increasingly apathetic about my hygiene and health. I had everything I wanted and needed in front of me and still felt miserable, which made me feel even more worthless. 

I resolved to sack up for 2012, and I did. Upon finishing up my leadership post and renouncing substances about a month ago, my schedule opened up, and I started to get back on the horse. I was going to buckle down and get straight A's again, just to prove to myself I could do it.

And here we are.

I sit here, tearing my hair out, staring at three blank problem sets. I feel utterly fucked, as before. To my horror, I haven't been able wrap my head around the material in my classes at nearly the required pace, and it's only going to get plenty harder. The drop deadline has passed. My depression has not.

It's too late for me to change my major without going into serious debt to pay for extra quarters. I can take a year off but I would have to withdraw from my current courses, accept academic probation, and face the ridicule and contempt of my family and peers.

I have let everyone in my life down. I feel extreme shame and don't know where to turn. Reddit, do you have any similar stories with at least a bittersweet ending?

Thank you.

**TL;DR** - Kicked ass in high school, fucked up in college, currently convinced I don't have what it takes to make it the rest of the way through. Has anyone you know made it through something like this?"

Only problem is I don't know the languages they run ASP.NET and C#. 

Now I started playing around with ASP.NET and it seems relatively easy to pick up. C# is going to be interesting because I haven't quite wrapped my head around OOP yet, the classes thing still boggles my mind a bit (this is not the gist of my post, please don't link to stuff explaining classes)

Anyway I wanted to walk through a tutorial on microsoft's ASP.NET site so I downloaded Visual Studio 2010 Express and all the shit that comes with it. Installed and set to work. I went to build the template program in the MVC as the tut instructed but it didn't build at all. It gave a page not found error in the browser after directing to a really high port on localhost. 

I messed with it for awhile but couldn't figure anything out. I uninstalled all the stuff installed by MS when I installed Visual Studio. Personally I wouldn't even use Visual Studio if it were up to me, give me some NP++ and a browser, ill figure out the rest. As it is the company said i needed to learn how to develop with VS, so i am going to. 

tl;dr having issues with Visual Studio no being able to run in my local browser (FF), need helping fixing the issue."

p8swy,0,2012-02-02,Reddit I have been having various issues with a manager at work that seem to be getting worse and worse. Do I complain? Sit back and take it? HELP PLEASE!!,zomgitsagirl,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/p8swy/reddit_i_have_been_having_various_issues_with_a/,"First off, sorry this is so long, and kind of thrown together. I tend to rage write so it may not be the most organized train of thought.

So I currently work retail at a clothing store, and it's the only income I have. I just got an internship with another company so it's unpaid, but I'm still going to be keeping this job for weekends simply because, well, I need an income. Over the past 5 months, I've been noticing that one of the managers (the hiring/scheduling manager) has been doing a LOT of shady things.

The first instance was when this manager hired about 30 new employees, and then dramatically cut everyone's hours (including mine). This was only slightly irritating, until they started requesting us to stay late, until 12AM, for closing and cleaning the store. I understand closing is a part of every retail store, but we close at 6, and cleaning the walls and floors were most definitely NOT part of the job description. By the way my job title is cashier/sales, and my coworkers are all either the same as me, just sales, or backstock (the job descriptions are what you would expect from these titles.)
So to make matters worse, the manager went ahead and had a few of my coworkers repaint the entire store, which first of all seems fairly illegal, as I'm pretty sure there's a law about big businesses hiring from the painters Union and not exploiting your employees. The manager had them working from 12PM (a normal in-store shift) to 12AM, and did not pay them overtime or any extra for their work. Shitty, right?

Since this didn't directly involve me it was only upsetting in passing, but then the manager decided to paint in the morning, during store hours, and not have any fans running. They had the front door open (it is a LARGE open store with lots of little alcoves and corner rooms), but that hardly did anything. Co-workers and customers were all complaining about the smell, and for those of us who worked the whole day there, we began to get headaches and feel light headed. One of my co-workers has asthma, and had to excuse herself to go outside and breathe fresh air every 10 minutes or so because it was affecting her so much. There was NO sympathy from the manager that orchestrated this because since their office was in the back, they chose to ignore the death zone of fumes that was our entire store.

My final straw is that due to slow business my hours were cut to 3 days a week instead of the usual 5. Kinda sucky, but it also gave me more time to find a career based job and what not. So I requested 2 days off because I am going out of town on those days. I wrote that in my explanation of why I needed those days off, and sent it in timely. I figured it was easy enough to work around considering I was only working 3 days, but NOPE. I get my schedule for this week and it says I am only working only 2 days this week, not the usual 3. Those days are the VERY 2 days I requested off. Seems pretty intentional to me. 

The other part to this that makes me even more angry is that we recently had to sign this attendance policy, and it states in the first paragraph of the policy that the next weeks schedule MUST be available to each employee by noon on Thursdays... I received my schedule at 10PM tonight (Thursday February 2), which is earlier then I had been receiving it before this. Last week and the week before my schedule was made available to me Friday morning. This wouldn't be an issue if their work weeks didn't begin on Sunday, meaning you can't actually plan your weekend until it IS the weekend. 


Now, I've been looking around at other retail jobs around town because this has turned into a nightmare fast, but no one else seems to be hiring so I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck here. My question is, what do I do? I'm a pretty damn good employee, I'm top 3 in opening the most company credit cards, I always come in when they call and need me last minute, when they have me working shipment I always bring in coffee for everyone, and I do my job pretty damn well. But I've been sucking it up for 5 months now, watching all of these things happen, and now I'm starting to feel like I'm going to flip a table over in anger because it's clearly getting worse, and this manager NEEDS to be fired. Everything that has gone wrong has been at her hand. Do I complain? Or wait for someone else to complain ? AUGH help please !! &gt;.&lt;"

I have a couple years experience as a graphic design intern, mostly doing flyers and promotional stuff.  I created a website in iWeb, which turned out pretty good, but it was mostly drag and drop, coding optional for improvement (which I did little bit of).  My new boss dropped a bomb on me this evening by telling me that I'm going to be in charge of our website (our company is approximately 2,500 employees, and we're kind of a big deal).  We've got a vendor doing it right now, but they're failing miserably.  I know I can wade my way through it, and pick things up as I go, but it's a bit of a daunting task to replace an outsourced vending team whose job is strictly to create and moderate websites, and take the whole task on myself.  From what I know, I (even with my limited web-design knowledge) am by far the most appropriate candidate for the job without hiring in new people, which doesn't sound like an option.

They've found me a position to work in IT at a Hospital and a few others that weren't specifically specified but I'm trying to figure out what would be the optimum choice.

A lot of people requested I give an update on this, so here it goes.

First of all **thank you** to everyone who gave advice. Especially to people who are themselves disabled or work with people with disabilities. I learned a lot I never knew about what everyday life is like for people in situations I could hardly imagine. I wish this stuff was common knowledge so everyone would understand more about the challenges people have to face.

Now for the update: It's been just over a month and it's going great! We set him up with self-paced learning materials about programming, and he's blowing through them at record pace. He's a very bright and motivated kid. It's been a pleasure having him around the office, and so far, it's not been very different from how I'd imagine any other 16 year old intern would be. While he's still a shy guy, he's coming out of his shell a bit more. I've checked in with him a few times to see how he's finding it, and he said he's really enjoying working with us. I've seen him smile a lot. We've managed to arrange it so he always has some people around if he needs help, but everyone involved has still been able to focus on their own work, so it's working out for our employees as well. I have high hopes that after a while longer we'll be able to have him start doing some paid work using the skills he's learning now. 

Thanks again to everyone who gave constructive comments last time. And to all the naysayers that said it would never work out and we shouldn't give him this chance, take that! :p "
pa2yz,5,2012-02-03,Why shouldn't I do it?,smibly,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pa2yz/why_shouldnt_i_do_it/,"24 year old guy here with one pathetic story to tell and wondering why a worthless, pathetic loser like me shouldn't just kill myself.

As far back as I can remember my life has been nothing but constant, neverending misery.  I've never enjoyed doing anything and actually hated doing everything except zoning out and numbing out.  I've taken up numerous hobbies only to give them up after the misery of forcing myself to do them over and over again got to be too much.**TL;DR** I don't enjoy anything in life

I'm also prone to alcoholism and drug addiction.  I used to use it as a way to escape and numb myself but stopped after it stopped working.  I actually don't know anyone who could get me anything harder than weed.  I usually could only get weed because I would let the person who hooked me up take a nug for themselves.  I can't even do that anymore because I don't have the money for it anymore**TL;DR** Used to escape my misery with drugs and drinking until it stopped working

I have no friends and no one likes me because my misery is like a contagious disease that spreads to everyone else like ebola.  I've also never had a girlfriend (though I'm not a virgin nothing ever came out of any of it) for the same reason.  I am the definition of a forever alone.  When I try to talk to people they just want to get away from me.  My calls and texts aren't responded to and I always get the ""I'll get back to you later"" treatment.  No one ever really gets back to me. **TL;DR** no social life

Actually I used to think I did have friends I hung out with.  It turns out that I was just the runt (lowest rung) of the group and they just put up with me when it was convenient.  They never did invite me to anything and always kept me out of the loop. **TL;DR** people who I thought were friends sucked.

Getting back to never having had a girlfriend.  Everything falls apart very fast when I try to get one.  Some can show some interest in me until I open my mouth and start talking to them.  The loneliness and confidence shattering rejection has turned me into a complete creep.  I'm the guy who will repeatedly, over months, stare at a girl from a distance with the desperate, intense, empty and miserable look of a stalker; then pretend like I'm not doing it by trying to look away when she notices.  I can't talk to them because I'm pretty sure they won't like me.  I've done this so many times with so many girls and they quite frankly think I'm a creep.  I realized that I am a creep when I felt the temptation to sometimes stalk and rape girls out of desperation; though I've never followed through on it for fear of having a restraining order put on me or being sent to prison.  **TL;DR** never had a girlfriend, desperation turns me into a creep

On another note I remember when I was 13 one of my 'friends' who lived in my neighborhood at the time got frustrated at me for being dense and not being able to pick up on subtle, implied cues when talking to other people, especially girls.  He said that he put up with it for years but it was getting really frustrating, especially with girls.  He's now really smooth with girls and also has a much better life than me overall.  Also, just to get an idea of how much of a social runt I am I'll say this. I'm a year older than him and at the time I was considerably bigger, stronger and more physically developed. He still had the leadership role over me and I couldn't get an edge on him when I tried to; he would always put me in my loser place. TL;DR friends ditch me for being worthless

I went to college and studied engineering at a top 10 school because I thought it would be something where even someone who sucks as much as me would be able to get a job and be independent.  I thought so much about changing but had no idea what to change to and knew that my prospects would be worse just about anywhere else except computer science.  Well, I graduated without ever being able to get an internship and can't get a job .  I also can't go to grad school because my grades weren't good enough.  That was because the material made me so miserable that I couldn't put a solid effort into it.  Now my grades aren't good enough and my professors thought I was just lazy (typified by one yelling at me and calling me lazy after I asked him a question in office hours). **TL;DR** Did bad in college

After High School things were supposed to get better.  They might have for others but they sure didn't for me.  Obviously I never had anything close to the experience show in in movies like Animal House or Old School.  I also hated school as far back as I can remember, even elementary school. **TL;DR** I hated my time in college and it was miserable

I still live with my parents and can't get a job and couldn't get an  internship in school because, during the job interview, they could always sense that something was wrong with me no matter how much I try to put on a positive face.  I can't just be myself because that obviously won't work.  btw. this also holds true for jobs like stocking shelves at walmart.  They want someone, just not me.  This was also true before all of the crashes back when the economy was good.  I've been unemployed and living with my parents for over a year now. **TL;DR** I can't get a job and live with parents

I've tried doing other things too.  Extracurriculars, volunteering, the occupy protests, etc.  The people there didn't want me around either.  I could tell because they always acted differently(awkward) when I joined a conversation and left me out of things.  They would keep me out of the loop and not invite me to anything either.  The thing that was the worst was when they gave me recommendations of other places to go, basically they were trying to make me someone else's problem. **TL;DR** more people didn't want me around

I even said I was going to do it once.  I posted a message on facebook asking if anyone had any last things to say to me that were important.  All I got was a bunch of crap saying 'don't do it' without a good reason not to before a bunch of cops stormed in and took my shotgun away.  These were the same people who treated me as I said above.  The same people who hurt me and let me be miserable and then they all the sudden pretended to give a shit.  No one contacted me after to even ask if I was ok.  I've also thought about doing it since I was 15, quite frankly I don't see any reason why I'm better off now not having done it then.  It's like when people treat their grandparents like shit, put them in a home and never visit them; then act all sad when they die. **TL;DR** thought about it for a long time, tried it, no one was genuine.

I've been to a slew of shrinks and have been on just about every antidepressant on the market.  None of that helps and the shrinks can't do anything for me.  It's bad because people have told me to get professional help even though they can't do anything for me.**TL;DR** Tried therapy multiple times, it didn't work

So I ask.  As a miserable bastard who hates everything he does, trapped in lethargy, has no friends, nothing but failure after failure, intense, crushing lonliness, just not being able to honestly feel like a man, and more.  Why shouldn't I just kill myself and end it all like a pathetic loser?

I'm active in a club called AIESEC and I just want you know about a pretty sick deal for students and recent graduates (within 2 years of graduation). AIESEC is the largest student-run organization in the world, with over 60,000 members in over 110 countries around the globe. We provide cultural exchange in the form of internships; varying from technology, business, volunteering, and teaching. These internships range anywhere from 6 weeks to 78 weeks, and there are practically infinite opportunities for exchange. In the case of volunteering and teaching internships, interning with AIESEC is a great alternative to studying abroad for students who do not have the time in their schedule to accommodate taking a semester off, as it is very easy to find summer internships in these categories. For technology and management, it is recommended that the applicant is willing to spend at least 20 weeks abroad (usually with a semester off or post-graduation), however, this is not always the case. We will be hosting information sessions on the U of I campus in Wohler's Hall, room 226, on February 21st-23rd from 7-8 pm for the opportunity to go abroad through AIESEC. It is not necessary to be a member of AIESEC to go abroad with us. 

If you could please share this information with your fellow classmates, we would greatly appreciate it!

Specifically, I'm a team leader in sending students into technological internships, so if any engineering or computer science students are interested, feel free to contact me here or in my inbox!

Thanks!

I cannot be without her, having panic attacks that we grow apart, the fear is taking a big part of me. We can trust eachother, because we are no cheaters, but that’s not the point.

More and more I communicate in a way that is repulsive, pushing her away, while I don’t want that. I cry alot lately, because I miss her. The times that we are together, how rare even, are wonderful.

We have plans to live together, but it has tremendous financial consequences for the both of us. In this country, Belgium, they take away alot from you when you move in with eachother. Taxes go way up, childsupport (she has children) goes alot down and since I am at school, the state will cut down on my income too.

Granted that my school wasn't so primarily focused on the tech side of the CIS program (more business) but it has a good reputation.  With an AAS and BBA under my belt, the past couple of weeks have been miserable.  

I'm currently an intern in a consulting company; granted my duties are not so tech focused but I'll help around when the SA is busy with *real* work (how I hate when my co-workers feel that he doesn't do shit).  I'll help senior management if let's say the printer ""broke"" or have issues with our CRM system, basically putting out the fires.  My previous position in my school was the same thing but more hectic and more users (300 computer lab). 

My issue right now I have been unable to land a simple help desk job and has been pretty frigging discouraging.  I don't have the experience that most employers are looking for (Active Directory, Exchange Server, Networking) but always received a compliment on what a great personality I have and always have a bright attitude when an end user gets uptight.  

Right now I'm just reading as much as I can from certification guides on Active Directory 2008 R2; Group Policy; CCNA (although very interested learning from the CCNA books I picked up than Microsoft) A+ even though it seems so basic. I've been fiddling around with Microsoft Server 2008 R2 with Virtual Box but seems like everyone is talking about Virtualization that I should switch over to VMware to get used to its features.

So this is the part when I ask this specific crowd with any tips, suggestions in your experience when you first started and when was the moment you achieved to kickstart your career.  I've been reading the SysAdmin thread for about 3 weeks now and it provided so much information that it gets me giddy to learn new topics I never came across with.  Maybe my enthusiasm will triumph my cruddy luck in landing a new position.  Thank you in advance if you managed to read this far.

I've always been a good student, I've got lots of AP credit, and got a 800 on the math part of the SAT. But honestly, I majored in business because I didn't know what to do, and it seemed like a somewhat easier major. I'm not sure if I'm too enthused about the job options in the field and the types of people I'd be working with.

Well I've always loved computers, and I'm thinking about switching majors to CS. It would definitely add some time to my college career, but I've had a scholarship so far, and honestly don't mind being in school a little longer (even if I have to take on some debt). Finance is alright, and the job prospects are probably decent, but I'd rather do something I really like the rest of my life than something that's.. well... meh. This would be a big change in my life, that I've arrived at after a long heart to heart with my parents and girlfriend. So I figured I'd come to Reddit to get some practical advice. BA vs BS, job prospects, whether I'm full of shit, difficulty, different career paths, etc. Feel free to drop a bomb on me and hit me with any practical advice about a CS major. Thanks in advance :)"
pds5c,23,2012-02-06,Am I the only one who is beginning to feel like college is a scam?,WreckweeM,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pds5c/am_i_the_only_one_who_is_beginning_to_feel_like/,"I'm a junior at a well-ranked state school currently majoring in economics, and after five semesters of education, I feel like the only thing I have learned is that I'm wasting my time and my parent's money. I spent a large part of my childhood listening to people tell me that I am never going to use anything I learn in college in real life, and every time I heard this statement I would ask myself: ""why go, then?"". I always chalked it up to the adult either lying, or not understanding the importance of a college education. And yet, now that I am here, I cannot find the importance that I once was so sure existed.

I suppose the scenario is different for education majors (who need to learn how to properly teach) or for nursing/med majors (who need to learn how to properly save lives), or for law students, or basically any major that is designed for people who are absolutely going into that profession, but for someone like me, who is still completely unsure of which career I want to pursue, I'm not seeing the benefit of the degree.

I'm aware a degree is necessary to get a well-paying job once I'm out of school, but I find that idea laughable. I can honestly say that there is not a single job out there that I am currently more qualified for than I was graduating high school, and I am having severe difficulty in naming a single job that I will be more qualified for once I graduate than I am now. 

With learning being set to such a vigorous pace, how can anyone expect me to retain everything I have learned? I, like most college students I'm sure, have a tendency to forget everything I learned in a class before at the start of a new semester in order to focus entirely on all the new work that will need to get done.

Say I have a job offer lined up immediately following graduation: what would make me more qualified for that job? A college degree? Or four-years experience at said job, or any other job in the same career-market? 

Let's talk about the money. Oh yes, the money. Again, I'm sure I don't need to explain the reality that graduates are getting their degrees, have been completely unable to find any jobs at all, and yet this does not mitigate the insane mass of debt they have. Someone who worked their ass off for four years has more experience, and zero debt. This debt is even greater if they went to grad school. And let's not forget about those who didn't get it right on the first try: students who decided to change their majors. Extra classes, extra semesters, even more money, and if you didn't realize until after your sophomore year that you're in the wrong major, you're FUCKED. Your choices are now: Enjoy being a super, super, super senior with an insane amount of debt, or enjoy a degree that is now literally useless to you.

Then we have textbooks: books so overpriced that these publishers must have profit margins so massive they look like insurance companies. I was forced to pay one hundred and fifty dollars last year for a textbook that was A STACK OF FUCKING LOOSE-LEAF PAPERS. Of course they had no binding, so you can't sell it back. You have to go online, where no one is going to pay you even a fraction of that for something that you can literally obtain with a copy of the papers and a copy machine (you could even use the automatic feeder since there's no binding).

The only thing I actually feel like I am paying for is the professor's time, and even at that most professors follow the textbook. So why can't I just buy the textbook and forget about the professor (most will make you read it anyway). The only, and I mean only, time I feel like my money has not been wasted is when I have a good professor who can actually make me feel like I learned more with his guidance than I could on my own (this has been a very rare experience).

To be honest, I'm not really sure what the point I'm trying to make it. All I know is that I can't shake this feeling that everything I'm going through is just so, so wrong. I feel like I'm paying insane amounts of money just for a piece of paper that gives me the privilege of working a higher-paying job that someone with the same level of intelligence and no education could work just as well. 

Colleges do provide internship opportunities, I suppose, but this drops me right back to the point that you're paying money only for the privilege of working a higher-paying job. By selecting interns from a college pool, you are eliminating that opportunity from other non-college students, even if that person is more intelligent and more qualified for the job.

I suppose that having a degree proves that you are a hard worker, but so does working hard. A powerful job experience list is just as handy on a resume as a college degree is. 

My final question essentially is: Asides from everything that I named already, why is a college degree even worth getting? Right now it seems that in the choice between go to work and go to college, I made the wrong choice.

TL;DR - If you didn't read what I had say, why should I give a fuck about what you have to say?

EDIT - Spelling, Grammar....I'm no poet.

I only need 5 classes to graduate, which i currently have setup for this semester. But the thing is they are all upper level compsci.  Part of me wants to graduate and move on, but at the same time, ive never taken more than 3 Compsci at a time.  I also dont want to mess up my gpa even more than i have. Its been slowly declining to around a 2.7

If i split, i could potentially do better and be more dedicated. On top of getting another internship in the summer/fall.

Of course part of me is lazy and scared of graduating. Which is why i need some unbiased input.

In case youre wondering, i would be taking these classes:

pder7,5,2012-02-06,Help. My little sister (22) is locked up at a Christian camp in Arkansas. How do I get her out?,jesuscamp22,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pder7/help_my_little_sister_22_is_locked_up_at_a/,"My younger sister has been enrolled in a faith-based psychological program for troubled girls and young women for about three years.  She is 22 years old, was diagnosed as a teenager with bipolar disorder, and has type-1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes -- her extremely poor management of which initially compelled my parents to send her to this place, because the doctor/entrepeneuer who owns it also has a daughter with type-1 diabetes and promised specialized care and intervention.  They were also compelled by the Christian framework that situates what the place calls its “bio-psycho-socio-spiritual model” of psychological intervention, since they believe that only the healing power of Christ can cure my sister of her penchant for making bad decisions.  These decisions include her mistreatment of, or plain disregard for, the insulin therapy she needs to survive; her tendency to get involved in romantic relationships with deadbeat dickheads who treat her poorly and take advantage of her, financially, physically, and emotionally; and the numerous occasions on which she has stolen money from my parents, always in rather clumsy ways, that is, in ways that ensure she will be caught.  The original plan, as I understand it, was for my sister to spend the estimated 120-180 days in treatment at this camp in rural Arkansas (at an truly outrageous cost), and then to enroll in a certificate program at a design institute.  This was the deal: go through the program, get yourself right, and we (parents) will send you to L.A. to pursue your dreams etc. As I said, this was around three years ago. About nine months ago she finally “graduated” from the seven-step program, but moved on to a low-paying internship at the very same place (and under strict supervision and extremely restricted freedoms) which she held until a few weeks ago.  At this point, she was discovered to have been once again skipping her insulin injections, and also she bought some CDs instead of paying for her car insurance, or something, and the psychiatrist in charge of the whole place, and a few other places like it, ordered that she be run through the whole program again, for a second time, complete with regular checks from my parents to the tune of about $6,000 per month.  The details of the whole situation are really quite vague.  This is the biggest problem.  Even when she was on the payroll, she was only allowed to speak on the phone once a week, and even then only to my parents.  She could receive letters from approved immediate family (like myself) until this new turn of events, so I am completely cut off from all communication with her.  She wrote recently, just before her letter-writing privileges were suspended, and asked if she could come live with me for a while; the answer, of course, was yes, but she will not receive my reply.  Technically, there is nothing “keeping” her at this place – in the strictly legal sense of unlawful detention – and supposedly she could sign herself out and walk away at any time.  “Walking away” here means literally walking about 10 miles to the closest pay phone, but also walking away from my parents and their money, and from three years of religious indoctrination.  My impulse is to drive to Arkansas and go pick her up, but there are major practical constraints here: most importantly, health care (which she will need to survive), and the fact that she has been on some serious head medications like Ziprazidone (an anti-psychotic, also used to treat bipolar disorder) that really need to be gradually suspended. 
 
Now, I could enumerate the hundreds of reasons why I think this whole therapeutic model is terrible and violent and offensive, but the main reason is that it attempts to “treat” troubled people by teaching them how to internalize a repressive, odious religious narrative, all while exploiting gullible dogmatists like my parents who they know will raise no objections because to do so would be to compromise their faith in Jesus.  Worst of all, I am fairly certain that, like my parents, these people truly believe that they mean well, and that they are doing a necessary good.  So what do I do?  What can I do?"

I wanted to ask if anyone here has attended this school and what their opinions are of it.

So please any input from people in the netsec field would be appreciated, I am debating going to this expensive private school or the cheaper ASU university. I understand college is what I put into it, I am however willing to pay the extra if the school gives more 1 on 1 time and provides more tools for my education. I understand the school advertises a lot for its gaming program, but the netsec program is apparently an amazing program.

I am a 20yo college student in Seattle majoring in engineering who is having trouble with school and I need advice from ppl who know what they are talking about. I want to become a mechanical engineer and I have all the skills and knowledge to do it. My problem is that as a 3rd year college student, I am so bored with school. Not that the stuff isnt interesting, I just find myself thinking of real world applications and getting lost in making stuff work in my head. 
I remember my teacher was talking about having to make a water pump while in Africa without any electricity, and I came up with a better system in 2 second of thinking about it in my head than 3 mechanical engineers did in their two weeks in Africa. 

I am extremely smart and I know I can figure out anything. I get 100 percents on all my tests in math, science, and engineering courses, but I dont get good grades since I forget about the homework or just find it so stupid and excessively long that I dont do it. 

EDIT: I have extensive knowledge in most engineering related topics. I have all the needed math skills, physics skills, I am extremely good with circuits and electronics, and I spend all of my free time with computers, taking them apart, putting them back together, writing programs to do anything from optimize the order of my grocery list to semi-decent animation. 

My counselors are telling me to change majors since I will never make it as an engineer. I am just having a difficult time in school since it is so pointless and putting myself and my parents in excessive debt from loans and all. 

I really need some educated advice on if there are any options for people to succeed in the engineering world without an engineering degree? Are there internships (but no one really gives engineering internships to students with a 3.0 gpa) I can get in order to get a job anywhere?

Sorry about this drag of a post. If you made it this far thank you so much for reading. "

I am a sophomore student in the Game and Graphic Design Program at Northeastern University in Boston. Next year, I hopefully will be participating in the university's co-op internship program at some sort of game development or design company.

So I ask you:

*How can I get in contact with specific companies? Which specific companies have been known to do internships and what types of companies generally offer internships? It may not be realistic, but it would be awesome to work with Irrational or Sucker Punch because I love both of their games.

*What would you suggest for a first time professional experience?

*Anything particular that should be included in my portfolio or resume?

*Any sort of program knowledge or programming knowledge should I have?

*Is there anybody I should talk to about getting these types of jobs?

Thanks!

**EDIT:**

What I can/want to do:

*I'm really interested in doing anything I can with developers.

*I could do writing for the story or create characters

*I have some programming experience so I could also be of use there perhaps or at least be better communicating with a programming team

*I have some web development skills and know my way around the major Adobe Programs such as Illustrator, Photoshop, inDesign and DreamWeaver.

*I'm a graphic designer and have some sense of good visual design

*And any sort of conceptual game design I think I would do well at, just thinking about how things should work, systems and mechanics, etc.

The first type of interview starts out with questions about me and why I chose that particular company to apply to, followed by one or two logic puzzles to understand how I problem solve and then more general questions about how I would implement a program for scenario A, B etc. This type of interview I like and understand.  However more often I get into this type of interview: I hand over my resume and my GPA get circled, followed by questions like ""What is the difference between a concrete and abstract class?"" or ""What is polymorphism?"" or ""What is an object?"" You get the idea.  Questions that have text book definitions that I've memorized over the years but have little to do with my abilities as a programmer, my intelligence, or my work ethic as an employee. So my question is this, why do you ask these sorts of questions *as the only questions of the interview*?  I feel that if I miss a few out of maybe two dozen of these questions, you've learned nothing about me.  You've learned that I have canned answers that are shot off when asked."

pdwa8,5,2012-02-06,My girlfriend has multiple voices/personalities that can randomly take control of her. How can the poor get treatment?,MultiPersonalityHelp,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pdwa8/my_girlfriend_has_multiple_voicespersonalities/,"   When we first started dating, she mentioned that as a child, she heard voices. At first, the voices were nice, but still scared the hell out of her. She told her mother, and was essentially ignored. This led to a deep resentment to her mother. According to her mother, this was just a phase and it would go away. It really only got worse. Eventually, they told her to do things like kill her sister and kill herself (she didn't, but this really bothered her). After some time apparently they went away, and she doesn't really remember how it happened.


   As we were dating, I noticed she had odd memory problems. She was often so forgetful with basic things. Like forgetting to throw out paper plates, even after she walks by them on her way to the trash. Or forgetting to think about the consequences of her actions. When I asked her why she drank orange juice, even though we both know it upsets her stomach, she replies she didn't think about it, or she forgot. And yet she does this on a weekly basis.


   What really started to concern me was these bizarre episodes she had when she feel asleep. One night, I was in bed with her while playing xbox. She drifted off after a few minutes, and then woke up. While awake I could tell something was very different. She kept asking questions about things that had happened months ago. ""Why aren't you playing mass effect 2 anymore? Where is our old blanket?"" I hadn't played mass effect in 2 months, at this point I sold it. It was at this point I realized she was in some sort of state of mind from two months back. She also acted... ""funny"". Almost as if she was high. She laughed about everything like it was a joke. Finally I convinced her to go back asleep. After sleeping for no longer than a minute, she woke up and had no idea what happened. She looked at me as if I was crazy when I asked her what she did.


   Fast forward a few months later she had another episode. This time I got a call in the middle of the night, with her frantically crying saying she had no idea where she was at. I had just got off the phone with her an hour earlier. She was at home laying in her bed, we talked for a while, and then she went to sleep. So I calmed her down and told her to turn on her laptop. She asked how I knew that she had laptop in front of her. About a month prior to this, she bought a laptop, and switched rooms with her mother. I mentioned this and she said she had no idea what I was talking about. She told me the last thing she remembers was falling asleep while I was playing mass effect (Yeah just like that last episode, and later I find out this mass effect night was one of the most memorable and peaceful nights she had).


   About a year later, I start to see more episodes in a semi frequent pattern. The difference this time is they were... a bit disturbing. All of these ""disturbing"" episodes seemed to be her response to extreme stress. For example, we were talking about her stomach pains, and how we really need to get this checked out (we suspect ulcers, but we don't know. I am poor and in college, and she works for minimum wage with no health insurance). Talking about this REALLY bothered her and caused her to start crying hysterically, cover her ears, and then just pass out. When she woke up she asked me why her face was all wet and why there was snot all over her nose.


   The next episode was the most bothersome. Again it started with her getting stressed out about something, she passed out, but then something different happened. Instead of the normal passing out, it was a BLANK stare. And I mean like she was dead. I tried to get her attention, hugging her, told her I was here for her. I begged for an answer. When she ""awoke"" into her odd episodic state, she began crying like... well I could only image someone crying like this if they were getting raped or beaten. Then she passed out for about 5 seconds, did the blood curdling crying again, and then stopped. I tried telling her I was here for her. And she repeated this, ""no you will beat me up, you  are gonna hurt me."" Just to clarify, I have never hit or hurt her before And as far as I know, no one has every physically hit or hurt her. So I tried asking her who was going to hurt her, and I was here to help. She passed out again, and then woke up. After all of this was over, again she had no memory of the incident.


   From here I suspected she had been raped, or hurt at some point. So when she had another passive episode, I began talking to her in her episodic state. I find out that a neighbor would rest his hand on her vagina as a child, which really bothered and confused her, but nothing that caused that bizarre screaming and crying before. I asked her if anyone hurt or hit her, and she said no one did. After she woke up, she said she hadn't remembered that for years. It was only after I talked to her in this state that she remembered it.


  I find out for the past few months that my girlfriend has been ""confused"". She wasn't sure if she loved me less, or how she felt about me (we had been dating for over 4 years at this point and were pretty committed with each other. In fact as far as I knew, things couldn't have been any better). She tells me her confusion began a few months earlier (coincidentally when these bizarre episodes started happening). I ask her what problems does she have with our relationship and she couldn't name any. She said she just felt less for me, but that she still loved me. And even then she couldn't really explain it. Her most common description was ""confused"". I take her out to eat, to the mall, and buy her a new shirt to try and show her I care. That night, we have a long discussion about our relationship. I tell her I love her just as much as I always have, but if she wants to leave, she can. And that she needs to do whatever makes her happy. She said she was still confused, but that she loved me and she wanted to stay. She says she thought that cheating on me would bring some spark back but dismissed it as a horrible idea (she even called talked this idea through with her friends, her sister, and me. Everyone told her this was a terrible idea). 


  The next day, she cheated on me. She didn't just cheat. She had been planning this for about a week. With a guy I suspected she liked. We even talked about how I was getting jealous, but she promised she would never do anything and nothing was going to happen. That week, she made sure to delete all her texts, change her facebook password, and delete all her facebook conversations. I talk to her about it and she said she didn't know what happened. Even the guy she cheated with said she shouldn't do this and she had too much to lose. She thought this would somehow help us. But that the more she talked about it, the more it was getting buried. She couldn't even recall some common details of what happened.


  I was very hurt, but something didn't add up. I told her I was giving her a second chance. I still love her. So I didn't want to throw everything away. It just seemed so drastically out of character. We have been best friends for 6 years before we started dating and now have been dating for over 4 years. We have literally talked about everything. We are both very open with our problems, we made it clear that we both love and respect each other too much to cheat. And overall seemed too in love to ever do that. While in bed that night, what she did was wearing on me, and the guilt hit her. She again had an episode. But one like I have never seen before. This time it wasn't her, my girlfriend now described herself as betty. 


*Betty - As happy as a human can be. Very playful and fun, almost like a 4 year old little girl. Will do the commands of John under pressure. Even ""evil"" things like holding a knife over someone.

*Tabitha - The sad one. In a constant depression. Does show signs of being happy if I try and make her laugh and tell her I love her. She is the creative one. Writes poetry, paints, sings. But overall comes out when sad, and depressed.

*Tracy - The pure sexual being. When tracy is out, she goes straight for genitals. No matter what the conversation or mood is, if tracy has control of my girlfriend, she tries to have sex. In public, private, anywhere and everywhere. We could be both be crying letting out our feelings. Tracy might randomly take control and grab my penis.

*John - Originally described as the evil one. The one who hates everything and everyone. He changed into a ""bro"". Constantly refers to me as bro. Id a man personality, unlike the other personalities. Likes video games, sports and women (even says he is attracted to my girlfriend's friends). Complains about the other personalities all being women and is bothered by living with them.

*Ally - The terrified one. She comes out rarely. She RUNS from me or anyone else. There is no speaking to her, no reasoning with her. She cries and runs. Only comes out to show my girlfriend's terror.

*My girlfriend - Each personality seems to just be a part of her, but taken to the extreme. When my girlfriend is in control it's just like any other person. Able to show all emotions. Although, I have noticed other personalities ""bleed"" into each other. For example, if we talk about her cheating on me, Tabitha comes out and is very depressed. Randomly John might come out and say, ""Sorry for doing that bro, these women see what they wanted and just went for it. No one spoke up and stopped it.""


  I learned that John was the one causing my girlfriends pain and trouble. He is the one who was ""beating her up"" and was the one making her cry in those episodes. He, apparently, is also the one her makes her do bad things to hurt herself (she was in a bad relationship before me, her ex called her fat, ugly, but according to betty, John made her stay. Also is the one her makes her drink orange juice to hurt her). After a half an hour of talking, betty mentions John has been planning a party to get all the other personalities back. John was ""buried"" away inside my girlfriend. But somehow escaped through a hole. But he never left like the others. He also forces betty to do things. Betty said john forced her to ""kill"" my girlfriends conscience, so it wouldn't stop John from doing bad things.


  After learning this, John starts yelling at betty and takes control of my girlfriend. He says he hates me, and my girlfriend doesn't need me. I say, ""She said that she wants to stay with me,"" he replies, ""you don't know what she wants, I do."" After this, it goes back and forth between betty and john, but as this happens I try to befriend john. After a few hours it works. He transforms from this evil controlling person. To a ""bro"". We start bonding by complaining about women, talking about adult swim and video games. From here on he stops being controlling, and well evil. Betty tells me my girlfriend has been sleeping the whole time.

  Finally my girlfriend wakes up and takes control, again, has NO IDEA what happened. I explain all of this, and she realizes her ""voices"" from her childhood are back. What is different this time, is they don't terrify her. They are more like... siblings? As the night goes her I meet all the other personalities (I guess the party happened?). And so far, we get along. The only other information I can give about them is they are all in her head speaking at anytime. They can all for the most part hear what I say no matter who has control. They do randomly take control of her, so I fear how this will affect her interactions with other people and work (she works in retail).

**tl;dr. My girlfriend has episodes where she doesn't remember anything. Had voices in her head as a child. All of a sudden these voices can now take control of her. I also suspect them having to do with her cheating on me.**


Most importantly, how can we seek treatment or help if we have no financial support from our families? She works getting minimum wage, and I am jobless seeking an internship while in college. I literally have no idea what to do. Nothing in life has prepared me for a situation like this.

Any help on what's going on with my girlfriend is greatly appreciated.

Any help on how to deal with this is greatly appreciated.

And I have just been cheated on by the love of my life, and my best friend. Although I have gladly taken her back, any help coping with what happened will help."

My BIGGEST issue, I have a chronic hereditary disease, ankylosing spondilitis. I affected me all throughout university, It probably wasn't smart going to school when dealing with immense pain 24/7. With the health care system in Canada I was diagnosed overseas at 20 years old (now 22), the damage to my body was done though, it started when I was 15-16. Anywho, should I mention this? If I should in what context/situation.

I would like to know some standard things that I should not do, besides not asking what compensation/benefits the job comes with and such. 

I've prepared some written professional references, and all contact info of job experience mentioned on my CV. Compiled 4-5 questions on a blank page to ask at the interview, when given the chance of course. 

I've brushed up on different experiences from working in a team throughout labs/project management courses/other class projects. My knowledge without looking back into course materials is a little fuzzy, but before the interview I will review some main concepts about circuit design/physics/programming (java, C#/C++).

Thank you for any help you could offer, if I get the internship i shall bake you cookies!"
ph0q5,14,2012-02-08,Questions about programmer resumes,Satros,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ph0q5/questions_about_programmer_resumes/,"I've read a lot of guides and tips on creating a good resume, including many specifically geared toward people in the programming/tech industry. Not matter what though, they all seem to fall short in a few areas because programmers usually have a large amount of technical skills to convey and may also have personal projects in addition to normal experience.

I was hoping someone with experience in this could answer some questions for me. **Note that this is for Entry level**


* How should I organize skills? As programmers we have lots of different technical skills. Some categories of types of things I would like to list include Languages, Frameworks/Libraries, Desktop Software/IDEs/Source Control Systems, Web Software/CMS, and Operating systems. Should I just break them up like I just listed?

* How familiar do you have to be with a technology to list it under skills? For example I have used Javascript for some basic things on websites I've created as well as for a few projects in school. I understand the basics of it although I would probably have to look up some specifics time to time. I haven't done any huge projects in Javascript though, and I'm not as familiar with it as I am with Java for instance. Another example is I took a class where we used Prolog and Haskell pretty much the entire semester. I understand how the languages work conceptually and could write code to do some very basic things if needed, but I would still consider myself a ""beginner"" to these languages although I have some experience working with them. Would it be a good idea or bad idea to list these?
* Should display any personal projects on my resume? Remember right now since it is entry level my experience is very limited, I do have some website work, a software development internship, and some experience working in IT already. But besides that, I also do some freelance webdesign work, but I have no idea how to display it. Also in my spare time I run a small team that develops some server plugins for the game Minecraft, we use git and some of our projects are pretty big in size/deal with things like security/etc, so there is a somewhat professional side to it, would it make sense to add this? I could make a category for Personal projects or something perhaps, any feedback is helpful.


Any feedback is appreciated!"

pgjzi,0,2012-02-08,I recently broke up with a girl who had extremely overbearing parents. Reddit what is your worst/most interesting break up story?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pgjzi/i_recently_broke_up_with_a_girl_who_had_extremely/,"Okay, so I just broke up with my girlfriend of about a year and 3 months a little under a month ago. Here is the story to that and then I will ask the questions.

I started dating this girl last year while she was on an internship in D.C. I fell in love with her over the next three months. She was everything I wanted beautiful, smart, funny, and we had similar interests. Things got serious pretty fast and I went to her house for Thanksgiving and she came to my home for Christmas. We spent the Christmas break together but then her internship ended and she went back to her college the next semester. The next 4 months were a living hell. We broke up once but I convinced her to get back together with me and we continued our shaky relationship. In the summer, she decided to come live in D.C. and study for the LSAT. It was a great summer but in the Fall she had to return to school. I begged her we do not repeat what happened the previous semester. Sure enough we repeated the same kind of terrible relationship. I broke up with her in October but then we did this on again off again thing for about 3 months. We were fighting a lot in that time but there was one thing that really bothered me over our entire relationship. Her parents were the most demanding, over bearing parents I have ever met. I went to her house for Christmas and they treated her like she was 12. I had known her parents were 'helicopter' parents but I realized it was worse than I imagined. I wont get into too many specifics but there were many little things that she was not allowed to do. Her and I are both in our early 20's and they drive her to everything (like her LSAT test day). They will drive 6 hours just to take her to drive her a site one hour away. This meant that during our long distance relationship she could not drive to see me and I had to travel to her destination. It bothered me quite a bit and made me feel unneeded/wanted. We ultimately broke up and I know its for the best. 
Also as a side note:
I am having a hard time getting over this relationship.

How can I move on faster and come to terms with being single? 

Are all woman this dependent on their parents?

pg3m3,2,2012-02-08,Aspiring digital designer advice?,CannibalCheesecake,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/pg3m3/aspiring_digital_designer_advice/,"I'm an undergraduate Computer Engineering major, which entails lots of computer science with some digital design and computer architecture thrown in. I've tried to keep my undergraduate curriculum as open as possible (courses listed below), but when I entered into an engineering internship, I was shocked at how little I was able to do. I was basically a technician, given a part and told to perform tests and verify functionality. I still have a year left of school (3 or 4 more quarters), but looking at the classes available to me, I'm afraid I'll be just as clueless when/if I go fulltime. My biggest complaint is that the professors periodically tell us 'this isn't exactly true, but it's been done this way for so long, and it works in this case'.

Some of my background, I've obviously been forced to take classes in chemistry, physics and calculus and linear algebra (managed to skip vector calculus, although I might take it later). In CS I've taken classes about OOP, Linux, pure mathematics, Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, Finite Automata, and GUI for Qt and Android. On the EE side, I've taken RLC circuit analysis, Signal Processing (Fourier/Laplace/Z Transforms, full of small 'lies'), elementary transistor analysis, and semiconductor physics (focused on Silicon, also full of small 'lies' and handwaving). Last but not least on the CE side, I've taken a class on combinatorial circuits, Verilog (sequential circuits), and am currently taking a class on Computer Architecture (with the design portion scheduled for next quarter). The architecture course is the most relevant course I've seen with discussion of good vs bad datapath design, but we're only focusing on MIPS, and we only cover fixed point arithmetic.

If my dream job is to eventually work in high speed VLSI digital design, what topics should I look to cover? Would graduate school be required? If so, should I attend graduate school immediately after my undergraduate and go into more debt, or wait to make some money and forget most of this material meanwhile? Thanks!"

I'm 23 year old student, majoring in civil engineering and im supposed to finish my BS this may. Slowly throughout the years i've been isolating myself from my friends and family for no reason in particular, i just had no motivation to interact with them. 

I've been on anti-depressants and sleeping pills for about 4 months now and i don't feel like they are having any effect on me. I've slept maybe 2 hours in the last 3 days and i dont feel sleepy, just exhausted... i just want to let go... It's 3:15am right now and i just feel nothing. just feel this primal void. Just emptiness.

Last Saturday i was pretty much forced to go to the ER because i've been having severe chest pains and my left arm regularly starts to feel numb or tingly... But the doctor couldn't come up with a diagnosis because a 23-year-old shouldnt be having these sort of symptoms. The only thing that showed up was that my blood pressure was a bit high... I also told him that i was diagnosed with clinical depression when he asked if i was diagnosed with anything. Probably thought that i was making shit up for the attention or something because after an IV to just lower my blood pressure, he just sent me on my way ant told me i was ok. He even said i shouldnt have to worry when i asked him if i should get checked out by a cardiologist or a specialist. While waiting for the doctor to give me this diagnosis, i was reflecting on all the things i would never get to do with my life. Have a career... Start a family... Fall in love... See the world... and oddly enough, i was ok with it... Right now i'm convinced that this is my body finally just letting go...

As i sat in the waiting room, i calmly jotted down on a paper pad that i had in my backpack my funeral arrangements. Decided to be cremated... half of the ashes spread in the ocean... the other half in the soil with a tree planted in it... Maybe i would finally make a mark on this world...

Ive been told thousands of times how smart i am, how much potential i have, how bright my future is... but i just dont care right now... the only thing that is keeping those pills out of my stomach is my mother... i wouldnt want her to go throught the pain of losing a child. and she lost her own mother almost 2 years ago... If it wasnt for her, i dont really think anyone would miss me. my friends' lives would go on, my family would continue to grow... i'm just here for the ride and i think im ready to get off the cart now.

And of course, no suicide story wouldnt be complete with the heartbreak story. I am really introverted with most people but when i finally trust someone, i am an open book. I wear my heart on my sleeve and so far its been trampled it's share. So far in the past 6 months ive been utterly rejected by 2 of the best people i could have ever met. I'll split them up into 2 stories to avoid confusion:

1. We've known each other for about 3 or 4 years but she had been in a long term relationship the whole time i knew her. I had found out that they had broken up just about a week before she was about to leave for an internship in Michigan for the summer, so i never really got to make any moves as soon as i found out. We met up when she came back in august and we really started hitting it off pretty great. hooked up, talked, all the good things. I told her upfront what i felt for her. little did i know, i was just another guy in a long line of rebound hook ups she was having because ""she had missed out on it so much"" in the last years. Flash forward to a couple of weeks ago. we where in an after party at her place and i was just chilling, trying to get over her so not showing much interest. halfway through the party she leans towards me and whispers ""you know that half of the people here think we're going to hook up tonight right?"" I was like ""Um...ok"". She replied with ""But youre not the one i want tonight"" Me, trying to be the nice guy told her ""if you want me to give you youre space, just say it"" And she just looked me dead in the eye and said ""...move"" This  made my heart hit the floor and i just went straight home without saying goodbye to anyone. i just wanted to be alone. Havent really spoken to her that much since.

2. This girl is a mutual friend that i met a couple of years ago but we kind of lost contact. We got back in touch i would say around September, pretty much after the girl #1 thing went down hill. The catch is that she lives about 1,800 miles away... and theres a huge body of water between us so the only way we could actually see each other was getting on a plane. either way, both knowing this, we kept talking. We talked every day at least an hour a day from mid-september until the end of december. We also skyped every chance we got. We also constantly texted. And by constantly texting im talking about 6,000 texts in this span of time. As you can see we got pretty close during that time. There was also a sort of magnetic attraction between us, but we never really acknowledged it. The thing is i started hinting that i might move a bit closer to her after i graduate, at least close enough where a real relationship could develop. This went on for most of january and she seemed pretty thrilled about it. This all sounds perfect so far, and i thought it was. Then she mentioned something about a guy friend of her's supposedly being jealous of me because we were always talking or texting and that i could always make her smile (her words, not mine)... i was like ""whatever, the guys in the friend zone, i got nothing to worry about"". Today, i had to find out through motherfucking facebook that they started a relationship ""as of today"" which means its probably been going on for a while... ive never felt so betrayed (and i have been cheated on before so it takes a lot for me to trust someone after that first time) we talked literally minutes before i found out and she didnt even mention it. not a word... it just felt like shit.

So thats whats been going on up until a couple of hours ago. I apologize if this seems a bit jumbled up or makes no sense whatsoever. Im a bit drunk and right now, those pills look more tempting than ever.... i know that if i took them, they would just lull me away to sleep and i would just not wake up again... and maybe then i can get rid of this loneliness... of this emptiness... of this nothingness... 

I'm really tempted to delete all of this to just not bother anyone but maybe it can be an outlet... i dont know... we'll see how today pans out... see if another day is really worth it...

UPDATE:Hello everyone, thank you so much for taking your time to read my wall of text and truly caring. It was a rough couple of days but thankfully made it through. Found out from doing some research that all my symptoms, including the increased depression, were severe side effects of my anti-depressants. I instantly stopped taking them as soon as i figured it out and i have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow and i'm going to demand a change in my treatment (i never want to go through that again). Thank you all for the support, you guys made a world of difference. Much love."

I'm looking at getting my first internship this summer in Computer Science after spending 3.5 years at another out of state school. I was pursuing a BA in Economics, (less math and modeling than a BS), but changed my mind and wanted to pursue a CS degree. The thing is, I haven't been able to get my official transcripts from the original school, as I owe some money that I've been paying back slowly, and should be finished within a few months. Up until now, I've been putting my major GPA (4.0) on my resume, but this is not my cumulative. If I had to guess, I would say it's around a 3.2 cumulative, but my original school uses a +- system state wide, while the new state system doesn't. I also am not sure which credits are going to transfer, as I had ~104 towards my Econ BA, and now ~45 towards my CS BS.

Is it acceptable to use my major GPA, even if it could be construed as intentionally misleading in the future? Or should I use my best guess of my cumulative? Thanks y'all."

I'm married and living in an apartment, so I need to bring some income home. I've been using sites like career builder and simply hired to find jobs, and as I try looking for jobs related to my degree, I find that I simply don't have the experience for an IT job right now. I've only made it to the basic math prerequisites of my degree, and while I've gotten a taste of several different programming languages and some toying with a few linux distros, I don't have the professional or personal experience with anything necessary to get a job having anything to do with computers-at least as far as I've found now.

So my question is: Are there entry level jobs that can help me build some kind of resume for after graduation? Could I learn a type of skill or language now and get a job with that? Everything I find seems to want a comp sci degree already or 4-5 years of experience in a given language or job type. I don't have the degree now and unless I got a job I won't have the experience when I graduate, either. I would apply for an internship somewhere, but my GPA is only 2.7-something, I think. The last one I looked at was looking for 3.2, and I suspect they're all looking for about that level or better. I can always raise my grades with time, but is there anywhere I could apply to now that could give me some of the skills and, more importantly, the resume I will need for when college is through?

pigep,1,2012-02-09,Genders in engineering rant,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/pigep/genders_in_engineering_rant/,"So this afternoon I was sitting in the engineering communications studio working dynamics problems with my normal study group—me, two girlfriends, and a guy friend.  The career expo at my school is tomorrow and we were talking about it.  I made the offhand comment that I don’t want to go because I’m never going to get an internship with my GPA as low as it is, regardless of my work experience.  That’s when the token male of the groups says that me and my other girlfriend will get internships because we’re female.

That’s it.  I have a vagina, thus they are going to throw internships at me apparently. Not because I work harder or am more intelligent.  Because I have two X chromosomes.

And I’m not exaggerating.  He is the type of guy that would not get and internship and I would get one and then he’d but all, “Oh well, I didn’t try.” or “You are female and that’s the only reason they picked you over me.” 

I WILL END YOU.

I  might have overreacted a bit and crossed the line in my response to him, but I don’t regret verbally bitch slapping him.  And I’m pretty sure the entire studio outside the conference room could hear me.  They stared as a stormed out, but fuck tha police, I give no fucks.

And I’m not saying companies don’t have to even out their ratios.  I get that.  I think it’s stupid, but I get it.  Fine.  Whatever.  But it seems every guy here has the mentality that gender is the only reason that a woman would get an engineering internship.  

Ad it isn’t just him.  Many of the guys I take classes with feel the same or stronger.  It’s all about insecurities, and frankly, they need to be bitch slapped.  It is possible for me to be a better candidate than you, so get over yourself and stop being so insecure and accept the fact that you are not god’s gift to engineering.  nHe is being nothing but condescending.  I need the help of being a woman to get an internship?  Hey fuck you.

THEN.  I texted my other male engineering friend telling him what happened.  He texted me first about skipping a reception tonight, and I said I probably was too because I’m so irritated.  Then I explained what happened.  And he said that though the comment was harsh, male number one had a point and that it’s a lot harder as a male.  Okay fine I can live with that.  Still see it as an excuse but whatever.  But alas, ladies and gentlemen, he wasn’t done.  I then get this:

“Plus companies know that female engineers are team players and great at communication.”

Um.  Excuse me?  Is that supposed to help?  I’m hired because I’m motherly and warm hearted and some other bullshit only pisses me off. 

And mother fucking I just lost half my post so I don’t remember what I had.  Fuck.

But to continue, I don’t want special treatment.  I’m hate the whole WOMEN POWER bullshit.  Just treat me equal to everyone else, even if that means I don’t get the internship.  At least I know it was honest.

What sucks the most is that these are two of my best friends and they say that shit to me.  I’ve never pulled the whole, “Oh women have a harder time getting hired because it’s a men’s profession and they only want to hire other men and affirmative action must be taken” card because I truly don’t believe it.

Is it so wrong to think that the best candidate should be hired regardless of sex or race or appearance?  This goes to a deeper level.  Why do I have to pretend to be someone else in a job interview?  Why can’t I wear my normal jeans, top, converse, and what might be considered over the top jewelry?  I’m not a different person in trousers and heels and modest jewelry.  Honestly, I work better in my jeans because I’m more comfortable. 

So now I’m a mix of pissed off at the mentality of the males I go to school with, hurt that two of my best friends would act so condescendingly toward me, and frustrated with the job market in general.  Though pissed is the main emotion right now."

J.P. Morgan

Dear Sir or Madame:

I am an ambitious undergraduate at NYU triple majoring in Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science. I am a punctual, personable, and shrewd individual, yet I have a quality which I pride myself on more than any of these.

I am unequivocally the most unflaggingly hard worker I know, and I love self-improvement. I have always felt that my time should be spent wisely, so I continuously challenge myself; I left Villanova because the work was too easy. Once I realized I could achieve a perfect GPA while holding a part-time job at NYU, I decided to redouble my effort by placing out of two classes, taking two honors classes, and holding two part-time jobs. That semester I achieved a 3.93, and in the same time I managed to bench double my bodyweight and do 35 pull-ups.

I say these things only because solid evidence is more convincing than unverifiable statements, and I want to demonstrate that I am a hard worker. J.P. Morgan is a firm with a reputation that precedes itself and employees who represent only the best and rightest in finance. I know that the employees in this firm will push me to excellence, especially within the Investment Banking division. In fact, one of the supporting reasons I chose Investment Banking over any other division was that I know it is difficult. I hope to augment my character by diligently working for the professionals at Morgan Stanley, and I feel I have much to offer in return.

I am proficient in several programming languages, and I can pick up a new one very quickly. For instance, I learned a years worth of Java from NYU in 27 days on my own; this is how I placed out of two including: Money and Banking, Analysis, Game Theory, Probability and Statistics. Even further, I am taking Machine Learning and Probabilistic Graphical Modeling currently, two programming courses offered by Stanford, so that I may truly offer the most if I am accepted. I am proficient with Bloomberg terminals, excellent with excel, and can perform basic office functions with terrifying efficiency. I have plenty of experience in the professional world through my internship at Merrill Lynch, and my research assistant position at NYU. In fact, my most recent employer has found me so useful that he promoted me to a Research Assistant and an official CTED intern. This role is usually reserved for Masters students, but my employer gave the title to me so that he could give me more work.

Please realize that I am not a braggart or conceited, I just want to outline my usefulness. Egos can be a huge liability, and I try not to have one.

Thank you so much for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Mark"
pichc,20,2012-02-09,"Protip #18 - How To: My liberal arts / humanities degree doesn't qualify me to do anything in particular, so I need to compete with the rest of North Campus to get this entry-level office job. ",thehomie,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/pichc/protip_18_how_to_my_liberal_arts_humanities/,"*This was originally going to be a response to a different thread. Now it's here:



I graduated last June. I've got law school apps out and needed to find a job in the mean time. I was looking specifically to work at a law firm to bolster my apps and for that reason wasn't totally overwhelmed by that 'oh-shit... I-should-have-studied-science' existential moment. In 3 eternal weeks of searching, I managed to land 4 interviews and received job offers at the better 3 firms. I was ultimately even able to pseudoleverage one offer over another. I now work full-time for a top firm in a position with basic, but sometimes interesting responsibilities. I make a modest, but livable wage, and I get full benefits. This was accomplished with an unremarkable GPA (~3.5), generic softs, a degree in Philosophy (no double, no minor), a few months previous relevant part-time experience and - most importantly, I think - **the ability to interview well:**




- **DO YOUR RESEARCH** about the place to which you're applying: know as specifically as possible what they do and who does what.


- **SHOW UP EARLY..** my target is ~20 minutes..  If your interview is at 3:00pm and you show up at 2:50, you're late. 


- No, really.. **DO YOUR RESEARCH**.. Have questions lined up about specific people, what they've done / are currently doing, and express your interest. People love an audience, but be *cool*; don't brownnose. People want more than anything to be able to tolerate, ideally even enjoy the company of the people they're working with. In an interview, you're trying to get your interviewer(s) to 1) remember you, and 2) remember that they like you more than the other applicants. If you manage to break the wall, one candid conversation can go a very long way. Example: one of the managing partners of the firm I currently work for has a sports law blog. I came in with his last few entries fresh in my mind.. the two of us talked about the state of Bruin basketball for a full 15 minutes while the other two people in the room listened in and laughed... At my previous job, I googled one of the partners (who happened to interview me) and saw that he owns a bar in Hollywood offering a bunch of microbrews. I've worked in bars / restaurants and spent 4 years in college.. I casually brought up his bar.. We talked about beer and whiskey for 30 minutes of my 35 minute interview. I got the offer the next day. 


- Finding common ground with your interviewer is important, but don't force it. It's probably better to **BE ARTICULATE** in what you say (viz: only speak when you actually know what you're talking about) than to uncomfortably pick at the conversation, trying desperately to keep them talking. Still, as a general rule of thumb, try to get them to talk more about themselves and their business than you talk about yourself and your ""accomplishments"" (however counter-intuitive that may seem). You're 20-something.. Odds are you haven't done anything terribly remarkable, and that's perfectly understandable; even expected. In any event, they've already got your resume. They know what you're selling.. 


- **DRESS WELL** ... Really, this is so often overlooked, especially given what a powerful tool it can be. When it comes to being taken seriously, you wouldn't believe the general disparity between well and poorly-dressed people. In an interview, the way you're dressed accounts for one of the strongest, most lasting impressions you can make, and it's probably the only aspect of an interview that's totally under your control -- don't squander potentially free points. Dressing well means spending a little more on a pair of shoes / shirt / slacks / haircut than your normally would. And if you don't think you have good style (or if you know you don't...), find someone who does and get them to go shopping with you. It shouldn't be hard. Whether they'll admit it or not, the fashion-conscious love being asked to do fashion-related things. And just for the record, every man needs at least one *good* suit (stay away from polyester and H&amp;M). About women, I know less, but you should be aiming somewhere in between the church and the club. Also, when in doubt, overdress. That should never count against you. 


- Wait one day after the interview and then **FOLLOW UP**. Email or phone call. Up to you. Express your thanks, your continued interest and that the interview was a pleasure. That's it. You already put in the work during the interview. The follow up is just to remind them how cool you were. 


- Try not to be devastated by rejection(s). You go / went to UCL-motherfucking-A. We quite literally run this city (huge, established and heavily nostalgic alumni network). Keep at it and shit will work out. Remember: jobs are like women in college --&gt; a numbers game. Put yourself out there earnestly and often enough, and it's only a matter of time before one gives you the nod. That said, be selective if you can afford to be. Don't stop looking for the dime piece just because a ""6"" is willing to jerk you off in the bathroom for a while. Better jobs = better experience = better on your resume = a better next job / grad school app. 



Source: I've had a ton of interviews in my short time for a ton of different things - plenty of paid jobs in plenty of different fields.. schools, scholarships, clubs, internships, volunteer positions, etc. - and I've gotten offers after each of them; this most recent 3/4 being the only exception. The above is arbitrary advice based on what I think I did right and what I noticed I did differently from the often more-impressive-on-paper people I was competing with. I've also always asked (and have been told) what stuck out in my interviews. 


Good luck, Bruins!"

My work experience is pretty limited, just internship experience with HTML, CSS, WordPress, Photoshop, MySQL, and some JavaScript. However, I do have a strong passion for web development, and will be sure to stress that point during the interview. They said they wanted a portfolio, but most of the work I have done was in collaboration with real developers/designers who did the heavy lifting. Should I just include anything I've worked on in a blog portfolio?  
And if it's a casual place dress-wise, should I dress to impress with a suit?

I was able to land one at an engineering firm near where I was from with the help of a family friend.

It was a fairly large IT dept for a small company, including me there were four of us.  Since I was new and the intern, my domain user did not have admin privileges.

I was assigned a task to do maintenance on some lab PCs; profile clean up and the like.  This work required admin access to the PCs.  I asked for the domain admin password.

The tech I was with gave me an uneasy look and called our manager to see if he could give it to me.  He got the OK and he whispered me the password.  At first I didn't think I understood him, he had whispered ""password.""

Yup the domain admin password was just simply ""password.""  No complexity, no nothing.  I stood in shock for a few minutes.  When asked why they didn't change it, I was told ""its cached everywhere and we're afraid of not being able to sign into something.""

I left the company as soon as my internship was over.  Needless to say, there were other things going on there besides passwords.

Anyone have other admin password horror stories?"
phirm,7,2012-02-09,Graduating Without Having Enough Experience,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/phirm/graduating_without_having_enough_experience/,"Hey everyone,
I wanted to ask a couple of questions about not having enough experience after graduating from undergrad. I want to emphasize that I am *not* concerned with how to go about building more experience, though.

Instead, I want to know about some of the questions I've listed below. It would be extremely helpful if anyone who has experience in any of these things could chime in.

**About entry-level/junior positions:**

* What does it take to get a position at the bigger and competitive/reputable places (Microsoft, Google etc.)? In other words, what are the influences involved in their hiring decisions? Do they only care about the extent of your portfolio and your ability to code? I understand that if you have a lower GPA, but an impressive portfolio that it makes you an attractive candidate... What about the other way around? If you have a great academic record, but at the expense of a portfolio, are you considered to be just as valuable as the former candidate?

* How much do the aforementioned workplaces (or any other good job) care about the school you attended? Is it possible to compete with those graduating from Stanford, MIT, etc. when you are coming from a much smaller school?

**About internships:**

* Is it possible to get an internship with any of these companies after graduating? (I know it's typically a summer thing for sophomores/juniors)

* Once again, how competitive are these internships? 

What I really want to know is, did anyone else find themselves having this similar kind of problem? If you did, were you still able to find success?
... Or is the only way to get jobs/internships at these kinds of places to just wait until I've built up enough experience on my own?


Any advice would be helpful. Thank you."
ph7zj,0,2012-02-08,What's are things I can do to get into a top tier company next year?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ph7zj/whats_are_things_i_can_do_to_get_into_a_top_tier/,"Quick background:

- graduating BA in CS in May 2013 with ~2.1 GPA from a good university (top 10)
- work history: Java coop @ IBM, web dev (created Groupon clone), test engineer with some kernel work at a small startup, random IT/project management jobs
- personal projects: small open source CLI tools (only one is mildly popular)
- languages: Java, C++, Python, PHP (~1 yr working experience each)

I know I need to improve my GPA, but I've taken enough hours (120+) that it's not going to budge much at this point.

My interviewing / abstract problem solving is weak. I have a hard time coming up with elegant solutions during interviews. Some years I get past first round and get flown out for interviews, other years I don't do so well. I'm not quite sure how to improve myself in this area except interview more.

Due to travel, I don't have an internship this summer and am putting all my hopes into getting in Google Summer of Code.

My question going forward is what I should do to increase my hiring potential:

- BS over BA (delays graduation by 1-2 semesters)
- Study various online material (e.g Open Courseware) and write proof of concept programs (e.g. distributed file systems, computing, game engines, graphic engines)
- Personal projects: Android webview apps, Android game using existing libraries/frameworks, Add GUI to my CLI programs (PyGTK), specialized Reddit clone to learn RoR, Poker Bot (for this [competition](http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/)), a Bitcoin market bot that follows some rough trading strategies in C++
- study more on design patterns, algorithms, computer vision, databases (past normalization)"

pj4a3,7,2012-02-10,My life is just an illusion,soultransfer,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pj4a3/my_life_is_just_an_illusion/,"I'm not entirely sure how to go about this.. tears are welling up as I type this because I just never knew my life would come to this. Some back story I suppose is in order so I'll try my best.

If I had to describe my life in one word, it would have to be, illusory. The reason I say this is because I more or less cheated my way through life, habitually lying to others (and for the most part, believing them myself), hiding behind a veneer of happiness or earnestness, and often very cynical. I have gotten this far and have nothing to show for it - yet you may see me in public, may get to know me online, be a friend in real life, or even a family member and you will see otherwise. I think I've lied to the point where I don't know who I am anymore and this is now become me.

I'm 25, unemployed, and currently living with my parents. For me, before experiencing these feelings of self-doubt, depression, and overall bleak self-esteem, my life was on cruise control, at least that's how I think about it. I was smart, athletic, and just sped through my schooling years easily with no hassle. College was the inevitable next step and now that I think about it, probably the first instance where I felt inadequate. My mother is 100% of asian descent so her expectations for her only son to succeed and become a trophy to others was always something she showed on her sleeve. I did not get into an ivy league school, but I did get into a rather reputable private college pretty much on a whim. Even though I did not get into an ivy league, my parents, family, and friends were all happy for me. For the sake of brevity, I'll say my college experience was full of ups and downs (mostly downs) and even though I did end up graduating with honors, I left college with not much to show for it. In similar fashion to high school, I felt as though I got away without having to do much and not really taking the time to really learn anything. I'll be honest, I cheated often to get by, or let others do a lot of the work for things, not apply myself during internships so I guess I have no one to blame except myself.

Maybe this will shed more light about me and my situation as it's clear to me because it happened this week, 2 days ago actually. To appease everyone, I still attempt to get job interviews and was invited by a company for an on-site interview in another state and they fly me out. They send a taxi for me and I'm on my way to the hotel the set up me up in. Looking out the window, for some reason, extreme episode of depressive thoughts seeped into my mind. I began to think, ""Why are you even here?"", ""Just get out and go."", ""I don't want to live like this."", etc. The ONLY thing I wanted to do while in that cab was just stop and leave, forget the interview, go out and be alone without anyone knowing. More suicidal thoughts crept into me and although it's all been mental so far and never actually began to add the physicality of it all, I can feel myself slipping and it's becoming harder and harder to stay afloat. I get to the hotel and I've calmed down a bit and just sit my room. I begin to panic somewhat because it's a big interview and I feel somewhat unprepared, so I practice for that. However, I was tired from the trip and decided to just wake up earlier in the morning.

This is probably one of the worst nights I've ever had in my life. It didn't help the bed was by far the most uncomfortable thing I felt. But I woke up in sweat around 2-3 AM, neck cramped, and these vivid dreams just play in my head and I can't get it out. Just completely random things, but I can't shake them off and can't get back to bed and I just wanted it all to stop. I couldn't tell if it was from a half-waken lucid dream or hallucinations.

That's where I am now. I just got the e-mail saying I didn't get the job (I did think I did well though at the time). My parents don't know yet, they get excited every time they hear about me getting an interview, but I just play along. I'm scared to tell them that it's another failure and I just turned out to be a failure that they spent a fortune on to get me through school with. Not just my parents, friends (I don't have many anymore), other family members, all still think I'm the same ""smart kid who can do anything.""

That's me, that's what I've become. I feel wasted, mentally and physically. I just don't know anything anymore.

piuyj,0,2012-02-09,Torn between two internships. :&lt;,confused_coder,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/piuyj/torn_between_two_internships/,"Warning: wall of text!


I've been working at a defense company as an software developer intern since 2008 (I'll graduate university with a MS in CS in 2014 after my BS in 2013). Getting good experience at said company, and they let me work on whatever project I want. Lots of interesting work to be had, though I've worked on most of their major products by now. They also got me a very good level of security clearance -- I won't go into that but it's definitely worth something. I am working there this summer.


Today I got a call from a Microsoft recruiter who I had previously talked to. I'm ""at the top of his list"" and he wants me to intern at MS next summer (2013). He warned me against staying in the defense industry, saying that I'll be stuck doing only defense jobs unless I branch out. While I don't totally believe him seeing as I've done work in biology and web hosting, he is right in that it seems nearly all the defense jobs are in the DC area (where I am from). Also, I don't really like DC and want to move after I graduate.


Some pros and cons of going to Microsoft for me below.

Pros:

-Get experience with different technologies and programming languages.

-Get to work at a larger company and see if I like it -- company I work for now has ~300 employees

-Get to leave DC and live in my dream city (Seattle)

-Pay increased by a metric shit-ton. I made $19/hr last summer (likely getting a raise to $21 or $25 this summer). MS paid my buddy $35/hr.



Cons:

-In all honesty, I really am not excited about any MS products that are out there right now. I enjoy the Kinect, but that's about it. Hell, I'm not even sure I'd like to do development for it.

-As I understand it, my security clearance (job security in my eyes, though please correct me if I'm wrong) will be wiped out. It will be near impossible to get the same clearance again if I end up not coming back to defense industry jobs.

-Will have to rent own apartment and have living expenses. At my current internship I can save money, live at home, get (free) home-cooked food, and drive 5 mins to get to work.

-Will not have any freedom as to which project I work on. MS will assign me wherever they think I'm useful and there's a good chance they might want me to be a developer in test (I detest being a tester...see what I did there? ;] )


One question I have: how often does defense work pop up outside of the Virginia/MD/DC area? I think its a great line of work, but I don't want to get stuck like the recruiter mentions. Thanks in advance reddit!

I'm good at computers, I'm a fast learner, but my grades right now prevent me from going to a college to get a degree so I can actually turn my skill into a job. I want to be a mechanical engineer, mostly because of all the fun I've had at an internship, and every time I tell my parents that I don't want to go to college, I get yelled at. At this point, I feel like a complete mess up, I'm ruining my life day by day. My depression makes it harder to focus in school, which makes it near impossible to get good grades. I'm currently looking for a psychologist so I can maybe get some medication for my severe depression, but it's taking a while finding the right fit for me. At this point, it's just been me rambling, and not asking a real question. I'm looking for an alternative to college, something that will help me pursue a career in computer science, or mechanical engineering. Do you guys know of anything in Oregon that is like that? Also, any recommendations for my depression? Right now I feel completely alone, and am in need of some light to guide me down the path to a happier life. Please, I'm desperately in need of help.....
TLDR; I'm a depressed whiner who can't make up his mind about what he can do with his shitty life."

I am very interested in finding out why unpaid internships are so common these days and more importantly why they are legal at all?

I'm a college student and my friends who are majoring in fields like communications, theater, etc have had as many as 10-12 unpaid internship! As a computer science major this seems ridiculous to me as in my field it's hard to even find an unpaid internship.

It seems like there are companies out there that are hiring armies of interns, not paying them, and not even giving them college credit, yet making profits off everyone of them essentially replacing real paid employees with a collection of nameless minions.

I read up on my own on this topic and ended up finding this quote:

pkezp,1,2012-02-10,"I've made great strides in the last year, but still have no idea what to do, where to go, or how to have fun. What Do? [X-Post]",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkezp/ive_made_great_strides_in_the_last_year_but_still/,"Pre TL;DR: Fucked up childhood spent entirely by myself, almost no free-time, no friends. What do/how fix?

I've personally made leaps and bounds over the last year or so with my social life and self-image. I've slimmed down and lost over 75 pounds, mostly cleared up my face with the help of r/wicked_edge, and started dressing nicer thanks to r/malefashionadvice. I also realized that being 6'6"" doesn't make me a freak, and that I can actually be attractive. I've started being a lot more outgoing, less shy, and generally don't avoid social settings any more. r/askseddit has been awesome for making me see that I was being a complete AFC/Nice Guy™, and I've pretty much stopped being Mr. Friend Zone Magnet.

What I've had a considerably harder time with is actually getting out and doing things, due to a large combination of factors:

* Going to a small, technical school/community college with almost no common-areas/school events. Each major is essentially the same people moving in one group from class to class, never getting larger. All 5 of my classes take place in 3 rooms, with the same 10 people every day/class. Like Majors are grouped together in Gen-Eds, so instead of being an opportunity for meeting women, it's a giant clusterfuck of CS/Engineers. To make matters worse, the building all my classes are in is off by itself, and houses all the sciencey/technical classes.
* I work ~30 hours a week: 24 at a (paid) internship, and ~8 during the week as a CNA at a Nursing Home. The CNA hours are all evening hours, generally two days a week from 5:30pm-9:30pm. Every other weekend, I work from 2:45pm-10:45pm Saturday and Sunday, so that's pretty much two entire weekends a month wasted.
* I still live at home. Although I live in a smallish rural town, I'm just ~35 mins away from Sioux Falls, SD, the biggest city in South Dakota(not saying much, when compared to Minneapolis/St. Paul). College/Internship is there, and Nursing Home is a 5-minute walk from my house. The town is almost stereotypical in that it's full of all the people that couldn't escape/got pregnant in junior-high/barely scraped by on their GED and never gave a thought to anything beyond that.

All of the above has pretty much ground me into a routine of: classes -&gt; work -&gt; homework -&gt; shower -&gt; reading/Reddit -&gt; bed at midnight/1am -&gt; get back up at 6:45am and repeat. Only having 4 days a month completely work-free and to myself has pretty much ruined any chance I have of having a normal social-life.

I really don't regret the above, because it's enabled me to maintain a 3.8+GPA, and just yesterday I paid my last tuition payment off in it's entirety, and am currently ~$2K in the black. My internship is going extremely well, and in about 11 months they're quite likely to give me a job-offer that I'll probably accept, while taking night-classes for my Bachelors in Programming.

I might add that I was born in Japan, my father being a missionary/pastor, and pretty much spent my whole life up until 18 there. Due to complicated shit involving, but not limited to:

* Never really staying in one place for much more than 3-4 years while in Japan, and being almost completely isolated while there due to never really learning fluent Japanese
* Mild ADD/ADHD that I've managed to get/work beyond.
* A mis-diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome that lead to some pretty serious over-medication that left me a zombie for most of my middle-school and high-school years.
* The ""Tourettes"" resulted in me being sent to a school for the mentally-handicapped for 3 grades around middle-school.
* Being sent to a ""youth-home""/boot-camp in the armpit of Montana for all of my high-school years. Run by a stereotypical christian fundamentalist husband/wife. Imagine the type of people who talk about Obama being a Muslim, and not even having an American birth certificate. Every aspect of their lives and personalities was in some way linked to God/church/the Bible.

All of this led to me being a loner my entire life, never having friends for much more than 2 years at a time, with parents who never really trusted me.

With the above wall-o-text said, I have no friends outside of class, almost no free-time, and no idea what to do with myself when I do have some. I really don't want to spend this weekend reading/puttering around on personal projects. I'm planning on bouncing around town tomorrow, but really have no idea of how to fill a day or what to actually do with myself beyond crashing in Barnes &amp; Noble all day. I have no idea where the college bars are, and no one to tell me. Any suggestions?

Where do I start?,aloha2436,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/plyro/highschool_student_with_sysadmin_aspirations/,"So the first thing I knew when I was younger was that when I grew up I wanted to do something with computers. They're just cool. I have a thing for systems and complexity, and have always enjoyed finding out how to do things myself and apply them to different problems.  
  
So my question is twofold:  
With how I've described myself, would I enjoy being a sysadmin?  
Secondly, what should I do if this is my aim?   
I'm currently doing an IT/Math/Management heavy courseload for my final years of high school, but my main concern is where to go after.  
Should I get a four year degree?  
Should I go straight for an internship?  
Should I focus on certs or similar things?  
As a side note, I run a home server with linux installed for fun, but I find that it's time consuming to self-learn it, and I haven't found anything particularly useful for learning linux. Is there anything you would reccomend?  
TL;DR What should an aspiring sysadmin in high school do? What did you do? Did it work well? Would you do anything different?

I have 1 more semester to go, and i just feel like i'm the worst programmer ever.  I understand the concepts, and can chug out code if i have to, but i don't necessarily enjoy doing it.  I got into CS because i generally like computers, tech, and gaming, so i felt CS was related to that, plus it was more financially stable compared to the music education degree i wanted to do before.

Anyways, I will have a potential internship lined up for the summer, but i feel that i'm just ill equipped to be in the CS field.  I have never programmed anything outside of school assignments (open source, etc) i only know the basics of java, C, and Python, nothing too advanced.  Don't necessarily like coding.  I have thought about possibly picking up some books on game coding, and trying to create stuff and try to get it on the xbox live indy game section. In hopes of getting some personal projects on my resume.  however i don't know if i even have the drive to do that.

I guess i'm posting this to try to get some direction.  Maybe the CS direction wasn't for me?  I only have 1 more semester though.  I keep thinking how things would be if i went back in time and went for a music degree instead.  I probably know more about music than i know about programing and CS with the 3 and a half years combined.

I have the feeling i will be an unsuccessful CS graduate.  It's tough to admit.  Thing is that at this point i've lost all desire to properly do something about it.  Guess i got burned out."

So earlier today I posted an article from the Daily Texan that talks about Test PAC. What that article didn’t mention, is that we are looking for campus coordinators of the UT Austin campus. Basically, you would be pretty involved in Test PACs planning &amp; execution to defeat Lamar Smith. Your responsibilities would be primarily:

* You would be an admin on the “Vote Against SOPA Co-Sponsor Lamar Smith” Facebook page, and would be responsible for inviting people from UT Austin to that page.
* Weekly conference calls on Skype for 15-30 minutes
 *You would be responsible for helping us develop a “plan of attack” to get UT students to vote against Smith in the GOP primary. 

Also, if you’d like to try and get internship credit for this, then we’d be more than happy to fill out an necessary paperwork to make that happen. 
 
Anyone interested should email me at testpacinfo@gmail.com.

Lastly, just a note to the mods of this subreddit. If you don’t want me posting Test PAC related stuff here, please just let me know. This stuff is relevant to UT Austin, but still I understand if it’s not kosher.

I have a hard time approaching girls. I never know what to say to them. When I actually go on dates with them, I never initiate physical contact and they think that I'm not interested in them. My problem is that I don't know how to escalate things sexually. Relationships seem like a waste of time to me, I just want to go straight to the being comfortable around each other feeling. The feelings you get about two months into a relationship. This is my second semester in college and I've only gone on three dates with girls, and I haven't even kissed or held hands with a girl yet. It's so pathetic.

My friends go to parties and clubs every week but I dont feel comfortable at parties and I hate dancing and I hate looking like an idiot just sitting there bobbing my head to music.

I spend my days in my room by myself just browsing youtube videos. I occasionaly call up my friends to see what they're up to and they text me and stop by my door to see what I'm up to, but I just dont like to go out...ya know?

I tried to join clubs at school but none of the people seem interesting to me.

I am in great shape and I hit the gym 3 x a week. I am already an intern and Ive got a solid career waiting for me after college.

I've transferred schools and switched majors a few times, and last semester i just started  a major in Computer Information Systems. I've only taken two programming classes so far (an intro course in C++ and i'm currently taking a course in OOP also in c++). I've always had some interest in programming, but I've never been able to teach myself any languages. My problem is that I can't think of any projects to work on besides examples from the textbook. Even with these classes, the professors haven't really been assigning much homework, and when they do it is from the textbook, so I've been trying to do more examples on my own time. But, like I said, I have no ideas.

Anyway, my question is this: With no experience, no side projects, and still just basic programming knowledge, are there companies willing to take in students like me for some sort of unpaid internship?

Also, I don't really have any idea what I want to do when I graduate. I don't know if I want to go into game development, web, etc I don't even really know what my options are. I DO like programming and figuring out solutions to problems, I just don't really know where to go from here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks."

I generally wanted to get an idea of how they treat you/trust your knowledge.  As an intern, did you feel like you were of use to your company?  Or were you just there along for the ride?

The reason is because I did a web development internship at a startup company and that turned into a job after 3 months.  They gave me lots of responsibility and I like my job most of the time now since I am always involved in a project.

I really want to try something more along software engineering, and most of these internships for for big corporations.  But I don't want to end up regretting leaving my job where I was very involved to go to an internship where I am barely involved.

Thanks!"

Okay, so I just got an internship at a computer repair shop next to my fast-food place, and as compensation for my work, their going to give me computer parts at wholesale price, as well as trade parts. I have decided as a celebration for getting my foot in the door, I would upgrade my computer. I would like to get a new processor if possible but I'm still pretty new to the guts of my computer. The only upgrades I've ever made in the 2 years since I got it is the addition of 3 (somehow) gigs of ram, the addition of a secondary hard drive, and a video card upgrade. I'm willing to spend about $300 to upgrade, maybe $350 if the extra is worth it. Feel free to suggest more than that, as I have a pretty consistent, yet low paycheck and have an extremely low cost of living, so I could afford much more given a couple months.

pobnw,1,2012-02-13,"Stay put, or explore? ",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pobnw/stay_put_or_explore/,"So, Reddit, I have a query for you. I am twenty years old, I have worked for the same company building high voltage electrical components for two years, I have good job security here, my employer, and the owner of the company like me personally, and are satisfied with my work. It's somewhat of a dead-end however. The best paid technicians, which is what I am, only make $35-40k a year. I could stay there and be financially secure, and make enough to get by, and facilitate some lesser hobbies of mine, but I don't think i'd ever truly be happy working there, as my co-workers make it somewhat high-stress. 
   I've lived in mid michigan my entire life, A close friend of mine has been on a few different internships to Aspen Colorado over the past few years, and she asked if i'd like to move out there with her. She says i'd love it, and quite frankly, I think that I would. I would love a fresh start in a new place, with new people, I'm a generally well liked enough person, and would have little to no problem making friends anywhere new. Should I seek employment there, and move on out to colorado on a whim, or should I stay here and continue to work for the same company, and not experience any other areas?
     I would like advice on this from anyone who's ever made a big move, to a new place, with little or nothing to go on. I have about six thousand dollars in cash saved up, that I could use for the initial move and expenses, but is it worth it? Should I pick up and move half way across the country simply on a hunch? I know i'll never be truly happy at my current job, but for all I know this whole thing could go crashing down in flames, and I would be broke, jobless, and a hell of a long ways from home, and the little close family that I have. This plan has just started forming today, I apologize for the lengthy post. 

Tl;dr: Should I stay at the same relatively dead-end job, or move across the country on a whim, to experience other things while i'm young? "
preeq,1,2012-02-15,Near Grad Crisis Problem,donfarrell,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/preeq/near_grad_crisis_problem/,"Hi,
I'm a third year IT student and I am very anxious about graduating for a couple of reasons.

1: My GPA is bordering on 2 -2.5 at best.
2: I have no work experience whatsoever in anything.
3: No connections
4: I have no drive anymore to do anything about it 

Don't get me wrong, I didn't pick IT for the sake of it. I love computers and all that and read up on that stuff in my own time, its just that I suck at programming and networking which is probably 80% of the IT sector 
The only thing im really good at is fixing computers, building computers and 3d modeling.
Looking at graduate jobs and internships also depresses is me as I know that I most like wont be able to do whats required thus not getting experience and not getting a job

I dont know if this belongs here, couldnt find a more relevant forum 
Any help would be helpful

Thanks

pr4nw,2,2012-02-15,Need some advice about my internship and future job situation,rockyroadnews,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pr4nw/need_some_advice_about_my_internship_and_future/,"I'm a senior in college, graduating this April.  I'm a journalism major and I thoroughly enjoy what I do.  I love reporting and writing and I want to make a career out of it.  I'm not half bad at it either, not to sound arrogant.

I've been interning since the beginning of this semester (about 6 or 7 weeks ago) at my town's daily newspaper.  I was ecstatic to even get the internship, as it's such an ideal position and there was a lot of competition for it.  As you probably know, opportunities in traditional journalism are, by and large, shrinking.  Since I'm graduating soon, I'm considering my career prospects rather closely.

My situation is this:  I'm doing well at my internship and the editors seem to really like my work.  I've reported on over 20 articles so far in the short time I've been there -- some short dailies, some longer-term feature-y stuff.  I'd love to work here permanently, but I'm afraid that there won't be any positions open towards the end of my internship.  

In the weeks that I've worked here I've seen 3 different open reporter positions get advertised.  The first one happened right after I started, so I didn't even think about trying to apply.  The second and third literally got posted within the last week and I'm torn over whether or not to bring up the idea of applying for them.  On one hand it's still relatively early in my internship; on the other, April gets closer by the day and I *have* been relatively well-received here.

What does Reddit think?  Anyone else have any experiences of getting hired out of an internship (or before it was technically 'over')?  Should I take the chance and risk rejection and potentially looking too eager, or should I wait?  "
pr4ho,1,2012-02-15,What is the best prank YOU have ever pulled on someone?,izmatron,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pr4ho/what_is_the_best_prank_you_have_ever_pulled_on/,"I posted a blurb about this in the ""meanest thing you have ever done to someone"" post, but I went back to the forum where I documented everything as it happened and put together a narrative. It is long, but worth the read. I promise.


To give a little background, one of my friends is big into conspiracy, black helicopter, NWO type stuff and is a huge Alex Jones fan. While I am out of town at another one of our corporate offices, I get a demo Blackberry Storm (shitty device) and it happens to have a 202 area code (Washington D.C.) number associated with it. So I decide to have a little fun...

I send my friend a text:

*DC Line: Go to meeting point 13
DC Line: Contact 9685-P when you arrive.
Him: ?? What are u talking about? I think you have the wrong number.*

To sell him on the prank, I wait a few minutes and to make it look like I just found out who I sent the ""wrong"" message to and since he is on his father's family plan I sent the following text:

*DC Line: Father's name, please remove the two previous messages from your mobile device and disregard.*

He called me a minute later and is freaked the hell out...I hung up on him a few times like we were disconnected as he spoke of ""the incident"".

I waited for a few minutes and I sent him this message;

*DC Line: Father's name, please be advised that you must comply with the previous request under USSID 18 or you can be prosecuted to the fullest extent of Federal Law.*

He called me (you can tell this has really fucked him up his as voice was trembling) and said:

*Him: PLEASE don't tell anyone, I got another message from that number stating that if I don't comply under USSID 18, they can prosecute me! Didn't I tell you about the civilian labor camps and the police falsely accusing people of 'terrorist acts and combatants'?!?! SHIT, wtf. What should I do?

Me: Dude, chill out. Just do what it says. If you implicate me because you told me, I am going to kill you. I don't want any part of this. If they have your cell, why the fuck would you tell me this shit now and not wait until we hang out. You of all people should know.

Him: I read some things online about USSID 18 and it's serious man. Fuck, I'll let you know if anything else comes through tomorrow. I am going to get more smokes. This shit has got me freaked the hell out.*

The next day I am in the office and I realize that our intern is Iranian and can speak Farsi fluently. I had the intern star 67 and call my friend. My friend screens his calls so he was left a message in Farsi with ""CDC"" dropped in plain English for him to understand. Now it is time to let his mind wander as I get back to work.

A few hours later, we exchange some texts (my personal line);

*Me: Do you think something big is going down?
Him: I don't know man. I am thinking about going to the FBI office today.
Me: Aren't they involved since the DC number said you could be prosecuted?
Me: Personally, I would leave it alone. I know I am going by what they see in the movies, but you don't want to get involved in whatever it is going on.
Him: Well, from what I can tell, the texts came from the NSA. But with the VM I just got, I seem to be caught in the middle of something I want nothing to do with. I just want to make that clear to them.
Me: Just play it cool. Honestly, I would leave it alone since they know they have a wrong number.
Me: Shit like that should not be messed with.
Me: Just keep copies of everything in case....off-site somewhere too.....screen prints, etc.
Him: Apparently not, When they called and heard my message before you leave a VM they would know I'm not who they wanted.
Him: I can't. I had to delete the texts. They knew that I didn't after they told me to and sent me a threatening text telling me I really need to delete them. So I did.
Me: How do you know it came from the NSA?
Him: They cited NSA documents in their threat to me and I did a little research online last night.
Me: Well if you decide to go to the FBI wait until I get back. I have to fly today and I don't want to end up on any lists.
Him: Aight*

So now he deleted the evidence and has nothing to take to the FBI. During the time that this has been going on, I know which internet forums and sites he frequents so I keep an eye on everything. All of a sudden, I see this pop up on Twitter;

*xxxxIf you were getting text messages from the NSA and wanted to report it to someone in the government to let them know, who would you call?*

Since my friend doesn’t know what Farsi sounds like and can’t distinguish the differences in middle eastern/central asian languages, I wanted to tie in some theories around Tajikstan and Rendtion.
Since I am heading back home that day and before I head to the airport, I sent him this message from the ""NSA"" number:

*DC Line: Friend's name (Since he posted on Twitter), cease and desist from divulging any further information, including online outlets. Your cooperation is essential.
DC Line: We have intercepted an incoming call and voicemail to your device from Tajikstan. Delete immediately. We guarantee you will in no way be implicated if you comply.*

On the way to the airport, I give him a call and the conversation goes something like this:

*Me: Hey man, what's up. I am going to try and get any earlier flight.
Him: Dude, something is going on, something HUGE. I really can't talk about it, let's just say I am being monitored online and via phone calls.
Me: Uhhh, are you serious? How do you know?
Him: I can't say much, just that I am being watched and I am in some shit. Think Eagle Eye.
Me: Are you still going to go to the FBI?
Him: No, this is bigger than that?
Me: How do you know?
Him: Trust me, in a message I received there was something that set off some flags to me. (In an obvious voice like someone is listening in) I am just going to comply and delete everything. I don't want any part of this. I am just going to leave it alone. I need a job and I can't be a dumbass. Hit me up when you are in town.
Me: Ok man, if anything happens let me know.*

About 15 min later I call him back...

*Me: Man, I think you are right, something is going on. There is a blacked out Tahoe on my tail.
Him: Fuck are you serious?!
Me: Yes, I might just be getting paranoid, but I noticed it leaving work and it is keeping pace with me like 5 cars back, but following me, ya know?
Him: Just be cool, we have nothing to hide, remember I told you about this last night and this morning.
Me: You motherfucker! You should know not to say any of this, couldn't you have just waited til I was home and told me in person?! I can't let this fuck up my job.
Him: Shit, if you can, let me know if anything happens.
Me: Alright.
Him: Peace*

At this point I make my way to the airport lounge and begin plotting my next moves. A friend in Europe has agreed to join in on the prank and while he is getting acclimated to what is going on, I have the intern call and leave another message, but this time mentioning “Rendition”. I immediately follow up the message with a text from the “NSA”;

*DC Line: You have just received another message from the same number in Tajikstan. Delete and disregard. This is a matter of national security.
DC Line: This matter will be resolved shortly. Your continued cooperation is appreciated.
Him: Done. Thank you.*

As I am talking to my friend in Europe I suggest that he go with an approach like this;

*Let's go with something along the lines of you are working along side the US Government. I am sorry that you (my friend) is involved, but this matter is of the utmost urgency. I want to say there is a leak in the Tajik gov't wanting to expose the US (don't say about what). Tell him you know he has already been contacted by the leak and that the US is working to silence this threat.

Let me know when you will call and everything is setup. I will give you the number and set him up by texting him from the NSA number to expect your call. Let's say you are with the UN???*

While I am planning my next move my friend in Europe calls as “Mr. York”.

I get notification once the call has completed and I called my friend to BS since my flight is delayed and it goes something like this:

*Me: What up man, flight is delayed til 8.
Him: Sorry man, I can't talk. Expecting an important call.
Me: Ok, later*

I wait a few minutes and send him a message from the NSA number;

*DC Line: Again, the United States thanks you for your cooperation. Mr. York and I will be your contacts. Your name is guaranteed clear and will face no implication.*

Again, I let some time pass and I send another message;

*DC Line: The leak has been contained and under USSID 18, all information is to be kept confidential.*

Unbeknownst to me, he ended up calling the FBI. I called him to chat while I wait for my plane and he filled me on his phone call with the authorities. He told me that the FBI said if this was real, numbers would be changed and you would have never been contacted again, blah blah blah, that you are possibly dealing with a scammer. He said the FBI was shady and the person he spoke with would not give him their name. My friend said that the shadiest thing was that as soon as he hung up with the he got a text from the “NSA” that said:

*DC Line: You will no longer receive any communications about this matter.*

My friend told me that he has been shaking all day thinking about this, like he woke up in something just like Eagle Eye. However, he did give the FBI my demo number…thankfully I was never contacted by them.

I finally get back in town and after all that has transpired I head directly to his house from the airport to find out more about what has “happened”.

He said he was getting these texts and it was freaking him out. He couldn't sleep at all the previous night because he was so paranoid. He showed me everything that he was looking at via his history on the browser. Oh my god, he Googled everything and then some. Since everything I had done tied together, this fucked him up even further.

The next day as the prank continued he kept getting more and more freaked out. The voicemails that were left in Farsi followed up by texts from the ""NSA"" couldn't have been timed more perfectly. He still believes he was under complete surveillance. The tweet I saw followed by the ""NSA"" text telling him to cease from divulging any further information, including online outlets really got him. Got him so bad that him and his dad went into the bathroom, turned on the water, and left their phones on the other side of the house (he believes the gov't can randomly turn on phones and listen to convos) to chat about what was going on.

Apparently, my friend (the target) had recorded the phone call with my friend in Europe. It couldn’t have been more perfect…accent, information, everything. 

However, my text after that call almost blew the prank and that is when he called the FBI with his father. Apparently, the FBI didn’t take it seriously and the guy on the phone actually laughed at them. He said it was like a Nigerian scam for money and to just disregard it. My friend pretty much quit caring about it until I sent the text saying ""You will receive no further communications"". Unknown to me, the timing couldn't have been better. He said he got it less than a minute from hanging up from the laughing FBI. This kicked his paranoia back in.

Throughout him telling me what has transpired, I keep a straight face and plant seeds of doubt to dispel what the FBI said. I asked him how can this be scam if they accurately monitored your activity. That's all I needed to say, he started freaking out again. I really might be driving him to a nervous breakdown.

Over the next few days I kept the seeds of doubt planted in his head while I plan my grand finale.

A few days later, I texted myself from the ""NSA"" number before I hopped on my motorcycle to meet him. I hauled ass over there and made it in 10 min rather than 15 so that the text would have ""arrived"" while I was on my bike and I wouldn't hear it.

At first we had a good laugh about the crazy “NSA” shit that has happened over the past few days, then things got real when I checked my phone and I got a shady text from the “NSA” number. The text said:

*DC Line: izmatron, we are aware of your knowledge in the matter at hand. Both yourself and friend's name must keep all matters confidential.
DC Line: We are aware that friend's name has called the FBI. Please note that they are aware of our activities through inter-agency cooperation. This is an international matter and out of their jurisdiction.*

So when my friend saw this on MY phone, he almost had a panic attack. His mind wandered and he just wants this to be over, it's a bad dream.

I finally decided to end it on a high note. My friend and I were hanging out at my house and I had my cousin come visit us in formal army attire since “they” have been monitoring my friend’s where-abouts and to bring closure to his black-ops paranoia (he has been having nightmares about this). I tried hiding my digi cam to capture the whole thing, but the lighting was terrible, the zoom was grainy, and audio could barely be heard. Sadly, all of the footage was worthless.

My cousin comes to my door and I pretend that I don't know him and he asks if my friend was there. I get my friend to come to the door and my cousin introduces himself as Lt. Colonel Jacobs. My cousin gives my friend a run down of everything that had occurred to recap. After he recapped everything, he had my friend and myself sit due to association and ""knowledge"" of the matter. My friend is sweating, face is red, you can tell he is quite uncomfortable. I had my cousin refer to this as ""Operation Greyfish"" in honor of other friends who helped generate ideas along the way. Finally, after my cousin finished the recap, he pulled a piece of paper that originally was going to be a non-disclosure agreement, but since I was lazy, it just said:

""izmatron has been fucking with you.""

It took a second for everything to register, but when it did he just busted out laughing. Called me a fucking asshole a few times, but that was the extent of it. He was happy that it wasn’t real, but more interested to know how I pulled everything off since I can’t normally keep a straight face. I told him how it was done and he was quite impressed. He said he is going to get me back, but we'll see…

Obviously, the first step is to learn how to program. I would plan on working through various textbooks, but also working on projects to build a portfolio. I'd like to code some Android apps and contribute to an open source project. 

Are employers going to give me a fair shot, assuming I am competent and have a good portfolio? I want to work as a developer, although I'm not sure what field specifically. Video games, embedded devices, accounting software, even web development; it all sounds interesting.

I did have a couple of my dads friends lined up, but they decided at the last minute that they did not have time. I would really appreciate it if some of you could take the time and answer the questions below, it shouldn't take too long, there are only 12 questions and you don't have to write a lot for them (If you don't feel comfortable answering some of the questions in a reply, you can pm them to me).

Also, if you do take the time to answer the questions, please pm me your first name and email address (My teacher requires that we have contact info for the people that I interview).

Questions:

* What discipline did you choose and why did you choose it?

* Did you do an internship, where, how long?  If not did you any on the job training?  How did it prepare you for your future/current job?

* What was the average salary that companies were offering you when you got out of college?

* Where do you work now, and what types of projects do you work on?

* How long does a typical project last?  Can you provide me with an example?

* Most challenging project, why?

* Most fun/interesting project, why?

* What do you do in a typical day?

* What is the most challenging part of your day to day work?

* What is the most rewarding part of being an engineer?

* In your opinion, what is more valuable in engineering, creativity or math skills?

* What advice would you give to a student interested in pursuing engineering?"
psazw,2,2012-02-16,Graduate Project Help: What sections do you include in your paper?,isurfbecause,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/psazw/graduate_project_help_what_sections_do_you/,"Problem: I need to write 35+ pages minimum for a Software Engineering Graduate project. Professor says use any format we want ( Intro – Conclusion –References) When you write project papers what sections do you usually include?

Background: I am a student that is working on his graduate project that ties into my day job. Basically, when I was an intern I wrote an internal Employee/Role Management System in Flash Forms with a ColdFusion/MSSQL backend. Now, for the project I am making a mobile app with jQuery Mobile so that this web application can be accessed via mobile devices, which is why I choose jQuery Mobile.

Value Provided: * Accessed on majority mobile devices. Can even be accessed via browser, could replace current web app

* More user friendly UI, in current web app functionality is all over the place in different navigation tabs

* First initiative with mobile apps. This is paving the way for more web apps to be converted to mobile app development I am sure there is a lot of experience here. Thanks all!"

I want to join this particular small startup in my city, with an experienced team and a viable product already launched. Is looking for a ""summer internship"" appropriate? What should I ask for?

prsee,2,2012-02-15,I would appreciate a little advice regarding continuing grad. school.,ckallas2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/prsee/i_would_appreciate_a_little_advice_regarding/,"Hello r/jobs,

I completed my undergraduate education from the U of I in 2010 and then I took a year off. In that year I worked in politics. I worked on a couple of different campaigns the largest of which was for a, now former, US House member. After that great experience I decided to jump back into academia. I applied and was accepted to a grad school of which I have just begun my second semester.

This semester started with me earning an unpaid marketing internship at a local NFP theatre. I have learned more about the work world in the last month with this internship than I have in the last 20 years of school. I really enjoy the work, it's challenging, I have a knack for it, and it is rewarding.

I'm thinking of withdrawing from this semester and pursuing the internship as full-time as I can (thinking maybe 20 hours a week).  
The pros of me withdrawing:  
I'm fatigued from 20 years of education  
I like the idea of having a job/career a year from now  
I'll be spending less money (school is expensive)  
I can concentrate on my theatre internship

Cons:  
My education will stop at a bachelors  
I will miss out on networking opportunities from my school  
???

I was hoping a fresh set of eyes would evaluate my position and give me an honest run-down.

TL;DR: I have education fatigue."
prp0p,1,2012-02-15,What are things you learned from your dad/father figure that someone raised by just a mom would miss out on?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/prp0p/what_are_things_you_learned_from_your_dadfather/,"Just really looking for some advice or learning experiences that would be good for me to look back on even though I might have missed out.

What is some things you learned from your dad/father figure that are invaluable in your adult life? I was raised by my mom. I'm a semi-well adjusted adult/college student but I know there has to be some life lessons I missed out on the way. This isn't me having a pitty party or anything. I'm just sure there are some stories/lessons that stick out that you all would like to share. 


Just some notes about myself that might help you pick a story

1. I was a wild kid growing up and a party animal high school.  Got in trouble a lot, had to get arrested to open my eyes and find a responsible path and mellow out after 18. 
2. I'm scheduled to graduate from college next December.
3. Wasn't involved at all besides soccer and tennis in High School, am now in college with complete/current internships and organizations. (Going from not all to probably too much the past year)
4. Had 2 serious g/fs in high school. Nothing more serious than casual dating and hook ups in college. Not good at relationships in my opinion. 
5. Have anxiety on a daily basis and over think just about any and all situations.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I swear this is a true story. I went to a high school in LA and you crashed our prom after party (Universal Hilton). You ended up taking the virginity of a girl named Roseanna. You didn't call her afterwards. She cried a lot. Do you remember any of this and can confirm or have you been so knee deep in hollywood pooty for so long that this qualifies as a mere blip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5swz?context=5)|I Am Woody Harrelson.
[How much of The Game is factually accurate vs. dramatization? I find it hard to believe you could capture all those quotes from all those people verbatim and then write about them later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5o7i?context=5)|It is all accurate. What helped was: taking notes in the moment and immediately afterward. Also, at ProHo, once guys knew who I was, I started recording things. And I think in retrospect what really allowed me to put everything in there was the fact that when you were in the field, you were thinking, ""I can't wait to go home and write a field report about this."" So you were always immediately, while it was fresh, writing out a word by word, blow by blow, report for other guys.
[Everyone I talk to about Pick up has negative views towards it. They think it's bullshit. Why is Pick Up so detested and/or seen as something ineffective or without substance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ni3?context=5)|It makes sense: Here's a quick rushed explanation. Women have naturally evolved a way to filter men of higher status that they should be with from ones of low status that they shouldn't, and if guys have somehow figured out a ""hack"" for this, then it renders that system useless. And that's not a good thing for them.
[Cross posting this from the other thread since I think I got it in there too late.  Neil-  Some critics of you and the seduction community assert that there is an undercurrent of misogyny in the community. Do you think this criticism is warranted?  In your own experience with the community, do you think any of those practicing PUA had or have psychological issues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5o3g?context=5)|Oh, absolutely, a lot of the guys have psychological issues. I think everyone has psychological issues, in the world, just about--no one was raised perfectly. But I think the psychological issues in the community are more about men's low self-esteem, and not about negative attitudes towards women. In fact, as I write it, I realize their negative attitude is only toward themselves. So if their experience in the community fixes this, then that's a good thing.
[How is your relationship with Tyler Durden, Mystery, Ross Jeffries, Steve P? How are they doing, if you know? What do you like about each of the schools now, espcially RSD? Pick up is now generally moving away from routines/indirect and towards just pure direct intent.  How do you feel about this? What did you take away from routines? How have your views on building and maintaining relationships changed from the end of The Game to now? Alternatively, what would you from right now say to yourself from 7 years ago? Are you still meeting people (like in clubs or wherever)? How were the PUAs back in the day, like realistically, how good were they and what stuff did they do right and differently. And have you gone out with newer puas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ntx?context=5)|I've seen all of them this year, and am on good terms with all. Feel like they were all part of my life and integral to the book. Trends in pickup are kind of idiotic. One does what works. I'm sure someone will ask me specifically about direct vs indirect, so if they don't ask that again so I can share my thoughts on it. Feel like you should read, considering your question.
[What are some of the most interesting and extreme positive and negative reviews/responses of The Game that you've seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ntx?context=5)|Seems the responses to the book are either those who've read it (and are generally positive) and those who haven't (and are generally negative). Think a lot of people think the book is something it isn't.
[What age did you go bald? How did it effect you? If an easy cure came along, would you take it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5t9r?context=5)|Not growing a huge crazy 'fro while I had the chance.  Waiting so long to just shave it off, and going around for years trying to hide the bald spot and receding hairline. Hiding anything you're insecure about is generally not good. Like Mystery said in the book, if you can't fix it, feature it.
[Is there any way for a girl to go from a friends-with-benefits situation to something more serious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5zgz?context=5)|What turns off a guy a girl is sleeping with is the same thing that turns off a girl a guy wants to sleep with: desperation and neediness. So eliminate those from your behavior in the friends-plus-ship.
[Your responses make it seem like you are a Redditor and probably have been for a while. True? (And if so, why wait so long to do an AMA??)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r6bh9?context=5)|I'm a lurker. But thank you. Was concerned about doing this. But I am addicted to the IAmAs. Especially the ones with unique life experiences. So was inspired by their candor, courage, and stories. And also by requests I kept seeing here.
[How do you feel the Pickup Artist show on Vh1 affected the seduction community? Also, did any of those people in the show go on to become teachers in the community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5pv7?context=5)|I think it ended up getting a lot more people into it. And I thought it sympathetically portrayed the guys trying to learn it and, since the viewership was more women than men, actually helped in the end.  And I don't know if any of the guys teach it, but I know a lot of them are around and still practicing it. Great group of guys, and I see them as much as I can.  The toughest thing for them was they didn't get enough teaching on the show. The producers wouldn't let Mystery interact with them when the cameras weren't rolling, and the teaching time was really limited.  But thought the show was great and fun, both seasons.
[How do you feel about the monetizing of the pickup community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5wra?context=5)|I feel like it's made it confusing for guys getting into it now. In the past, you'd go to the main forums and there was this free exchange of information. Now all the information comes with a price tag, and you don't know if it's from someone who's credibly using it with success or if it's just a good marketer with no social skills whatsoever trying to make money.   That's why communities like this are great: truth is (generally) sorted from bs pretty quickly.
[Why didn't you bang Courtney Love?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5lxt?context=5)|She wasn't in the most ""bangable"" condition at the time (mental condition).
[How would you use game in a small college setting, where everyone knows everyone else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5lxt?context=5)|Absolutely, but if it's a small town and you see everyone a lot, you don't have to make sure you do EVERYTHING in one meeting. Each time you see them, you can add a little piece and let the attraction grow more naturally (and also more subtly).
[Do you still keep in touch with Courtney Love?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5mt9?context=5)|Yes, talked to her for like two hours yesterday, and used to stay at her place in LA. If I can get it, will show you a photo of what was under the bed. Remind me later if I forget.
[How would you initiate contact with a women you screwed up with in the past? I.E. you were a complete tool,](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5tlt?context=5)|Either I'd have a ""party"" and invite them. Or call and say I just had a dream they were in. (Dream was always PG and fun, not anything romantic/sexual in any way.)
[Any advice for dating chicks who don't speak English?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5tlt?context=5)|Bring a pad of paper, and pencil. i remember meeting a couple Czech girls in Croatia who didn't speak English, and we drew a clock with hour/minute hands to communicate when to meet.
[Have you ever had approach anxiety, if so how do you deal with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5mnr?context=5)|Yes, and in fact, the better I got, the more approach anxiety I developed. This is because people start to know who you are, and expect miracles and no failures. There is only one way to get over it: to approach. Right away. The longer you wait, the more the fear builds. Just accept it as a normal evolutionary response, but also a vestigial holdover fear from a tribal society that no longer really has a purpose.
[What's your opinion of *The Blueprint Decoded*?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5li2?context=5)|Actually, Tyler came to speak at a seminar I had a few months ago. Was great to see him and reconnect. He showed some incredible in-field videos that were evidence that the guy has balls of steel. Great escalation and cocky/funny/teasing/pebbles.
[Have your feelings about Tyler changed since releasing *The Game*? Should I feel bad giving into his teachings?   **THANKS!!**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5li2?context=5)|And you shouldn't feel bad, if it's working for you. In the end, the problems were really a function of living together, more than anything else..
[You've met all kinds of people form all walks of life - who is the biggest out-and-out asshole?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ybh?context=5)|Interesting question, and I've had people be rude, but generally it was just a wall, and once I got through it, they turned out to be a great person. I suppose assholes are like bitches: we think someone is like that, but that's only because they somehow threatened our sense of self and self-esteem--and if we see them with empathy, in most cases, we realize they're just as insecure as we are, if not more so.
[Hey Neil. I read **The Game** (good job, by the way, it inspired me to read Ulysses) and **Emergency** and took a trip with my friend out to California to try to find the cache you hid. I got to Big Basin and to the Lane camp site, but there were a couple clues we just couldn't figure out, and the others we did figure out seemed worthless without the rest. How close were we? Also, has anyone found it yet? And what's the reward for it?  The 25 paces east clue (or however many paces it was, I don't have the book in front of me) was especially frustrating, because 1) I couldn't figure out where to start pacing from, and 2) even if I could, I'm taller than you, so I could easily wind up a couple meters off mark. The other thing, how deep is it buried? Is that one of the clues I couldn't figure out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r660y?context=5)|No way, and how'd you like Ulysses? Hope you had some help when you read it. And hey, I can't say what are it may or may not be. But good for you, and no one has found it yet. And it's not buried more than 2 or so feet deep.
[But as it IS an AMA, I guess I'll pop a question as well :) So here it goes: Do you really think ANYONE can improve their AFC status? I always keep on thinking that it's a great means of self-improvement **for the better looking** part of the population, as opposed to less/or undesirable looking people(I kind of find myself swimming in this latter crowd, as I'm a 22 y.o who suffered 3rd and 4th degree burns on more than 30% of my body). What I'm trying to say is, people like me have to work ten-times fold to even get accepted in society, and it's something you can only WORK on, unless you sit on a shitload of money that can rebuild your traits through surgery. What's there in-store for us? How do we find appreciation, human-connection and why not even love? :)  **TL;DR: [appreciation and personal opinions on Neil Strauss work...]**  **Do you really think ANYONE can improve their AFC status?**  **What's there in-store for undesirable looking people? How do we find appreciation, human-connection and why not even love?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r6epi?context=5)|I like the way it was described, and very cool. Thank you for saying that: most people think of it as this crass how-to lad's manual, when, you're right it's really a memoir of a pivotal period in my life. As said below, what you can't fix, you feature. You don't need to rebuild your traits. You just need to build up your personality. And it just has to be a little more positive, funny, intelligent, and outgoing than the next guy's to compete---and I promise you, because I've seen it with many people with all types of handicaps, you will be able to compete with ANYONE.
[I'm impressed by your books, bust most importantly I read ""The Game"" over and over again.  And I'm still so interested by the chapters that include PROJECT HOLLYWOOD.   My question to you is; Was Project Hollywood as intense as you described it, or was it flared up some for sake of the book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ng9?context=5)|It was that intense and more. Had to leave a lot out of the book. Think about reality shows when a bunch of people are living together, then add Mystery and Courtney Love to the mix (lots of Courtney questions so far)--and you'll realize what would be abnormal is if there was no intensity!
[What is your stance on some PUA/seduction concepts like 'last minute resistance' (LMR), where a woman will resist advancing to sex. Many practitioners of PUA/seduction offer advice and 'tricks' on how to get a woman to stop resisting sex. How do you feel about that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5y8k?context=5)|You raise a good question, much more rational than your username would imply. And the answer is: Is it a technique designed to push someone to do something they DON'T want to do (in which case it's not only immoral but possibly illegal) or is it a technique designed to make someone comfortable with something they WANT to do but are just nervous about (in which it can end up being a great experience for both people)?
[On a separate but somewhat related note, how much do you feel the western world's increasingly 'isolationistic' mentality (i.e. walking around with headphones in, not wanting to be bothered or disturbed) works against the idea of actually meeting someone in your day-to-day life and asking them out, or even having a conversation? **Are future generations doomed to have to read The Game and similar instructional books in order to learn how to socialize and meet with people outside their immediate circles?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5y0l?context=5)|And, yeah, wouldn't it be easier if the roles were reversed. That was always my ambition with The Game, that it would even out that disparity a little. And ""doomed to read The Game,"" nice word usage. Answer is: I think there will always be guys who have it and guys who don't, so some will always be ""doomed"" to read it. But for sure, every hour i spend socially interacting staring at a screen here probably lowers my comfort with socially interacting IRL. So the burden again is on the individual to make sure their life is in balance. And that becomes more challenging the more great tools people create online.
[Are you still what that girl you ended up going in a relationship with that you mentioned at the end of your book The Game? Also how many women have you slept with would you say since you first got into the seduction game, a rough estimate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5szi?context=5)|And never counted or quantified.
[I'm a mod at /r/pickup4dykes and am about to read The Game (it's on hold for me at the library right now - hope you don't mind me not paying for it!). Which of your books would you recommend for women interested in picking up women?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5qj9?context=5)|I'd read The Game and Rules of the Game of mine, maybe someone else here wants to recommend others more specifically on the subject. But it applies. Just had a Twitter discussion recently with a woman reading it to meet women, and have had female couples come up to me.
[How do you approach and engage a target who has her headphones on, or is absorbed in a book or newspaper without being obnoxious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r6syp?context=5)|Offhand, what would be funny is to start talking and gesture for her to take them off. Then when she does, just be moving your mouth and not saying anything.
[Did you ever succeed in going 30 days without an orgasm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5xnb?context=5)|Never!   Interesting username, just read an interesting manifesto by William Hazlitt (I think), called On the Pleasure of Hating.
[Can peacocking be so outrageous that it ends up becoming detrimental to the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r65vm?context=5)|Yes, the line is: Are you wearing the clothes or are they wearing you?
[If you could tell everyone who read The Game just one additional fact using what you've learned since then, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r8l4y?context=5)|Rule one of AA: Life is fun if you open your mouth.
[I ruined a relationship by not realizing how important it was to me, and now I have a serious case of one-itis while she's moved on. How do I get her back, or get over her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r6sni?context=5)|Isn't that so true: people don't appreciate it while they have it, then when it's gone they do.  My sincere guess is that this is mostly your ego state. And as soon as you have her back and are confident that the relationship is 100 percent on again, you will start not appreciating her again.  So first you have to examine your true intentions and motivations here. Because if you do get her back, and then change your mind again or have doubts again, that's not fair to her.
[What do you do for fun (outside of writing/interviews)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ybl?context=5)|Surfing and, my favorite, putting together groups of about 12 people (old friends and new friends and even people I've never met) and having a night of fun adventures. How about you?
[How did you get started in journalism? How did you make your way to the Rolling Stone? Any advice to a soon to be college grad looking to (roughly) emulate your career as a journalist/author?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r8g6c?context=5)|Got it.   And it was an internship during college that got me started. Hey, if you're willing to work for free, there's no end to the amount of people who will be willing to exploit you.  Seriously, best way to get experience. And once I was writing for that small magazine (called Ear, R.I.P.), then I started writing for a slightly bigger one, then slightly bigger, until eventually Rolling Stone.  So advice for you is: internships, and be willing to pay your dues and do the hard work and put in the Gladwellian 10,000 hours.
[Oh Man, I loved The Dirt.  When's the movie coming out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r6esm?context=5)|Thanks. The script is written, by Rich Wilkes, incredible! But don't know what's going on with the movie. Think a guy named Rick Yorn is producing, so let's get him to do an AMA and put the pressure on!
[Can we smell your finger..?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5vw9?context=5)|Yes, and you'd smell what you're looking for. Rolled out of bed to do this, so you may not want to smell my breath.

I'm starting to apply to positions far out of state. So I don't have too much as far as networking to rely on out there.

But I feel like I may have more experience than the average fresh graduate.

I worked 2 software development jobs simultaneously for 9 months. Both in ASP.NET and both for 16 hours each A total of 32 hours a week developing in ASP.NET. Recently I quit one of them because my last semester in college is a bit more intense and I didn't have time for both. I intend on keeping the job I am still working at 16 hours a week until I graduate and find my entry level job. Both of these jobs involved experience with SQL, JQuery, CSS, and anything else you'd expect a typical web app intern to work with.

During my time in school I wasn't an impressive student GPA wise and my school itself is probably a tier 2 or 3 school. However I was a member of a student organization focused on creating video games through programming and design elements. I attended the club for 2 years and I was eventually elected president of the club in my final year. As president I generally helped people understand game development concepts through the XNA as well as unofficially tutored members in their CS homework.

That's my story so far. How competitive am I for an entry level position?

pu13n,3,2012-02-17,Is comptia A+ exam really worth it?,JoshCalCal,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pu13n/is_comptia_a_exam_really_worth_it/,"From what I've read, it seems like the A+ exam isnt worth the $360 I might be spending on it. I'm in school for Computer Network info. And Security, and it seems like by the time I do internships, and get some other higher certs (MCITP, CCNA, Sec. +) A+ would kind of be nil.

I'd imagine from an employer's point of view, A guy whos got say his CCNA knows his sh*t about comp. hardware and basic customer service...right?"

pvngt,3,2012-02-18,Summer Research - Better/Worse/Same compared to an internship?,okiyama,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pvngt/summer_research_betterworsesame_compared_to_an/,"Hey there, I am a first year CS student hoping to plan out my future summers to maximize job potential. I already have my plans for this summer laid out which leaves me basically 2 more in which I can do stuff before graduating.

I feel I would not have a problem getting either a summer research position at my college or an internship. Summer research here entails working with a professor for either 4 or 8 weeks on a related field of study doing research and getting paid. I would probably prefer to do this because for one it is not terribly competitive to get and it also gives good pay. I would make $3,000 for 2 months of work.

An internship however may look better on a resume and I know that building a resume ends up paying off quite a bit more over my career.

I am certain that I will do an internship at least one summer, most likely my junior year summer. Is it a good idea to try to get a second internship my sophomore year summer or would I be alright going with the research opportunities?"

pxvia,6,2012-02-20,First Resume. Could really use some advice.,Bendetta327,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/pxvia/first_resume_could_really_use_some_advice/,"I've been a web developer for about 3.5 years now. I got an internship from my brother's friend my freshman year of college, and I failed out of school after my sophomore year. I've been working full time for the same company since then, and now I'm getting married and have a kid so I need to go some place where they'll pay me more - I asked for a raise and was essentially denied.

I never really needed a resume before, and I'm trying to update the one I did have during school, but never needed to use. Now that I'm going to be putting it out everywhere, I feel like this is very lacking despite having a good amount of experience now. I'm the only web developer here, and I do some IT stuff with the only other actual IT guy in the building.

I don't think I should mention my school experience. I also haven't had time with the newborn to get an actual online portfolio going. Is this considered a must and should be included on the resume?

This is what I have going so far.

[Why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sszbf?context=5)|I mean if its something your really wanna do go for it. Skilled welders are not paid or respected like they used to be. Theres been a pay freeze for the past 10 years, when I got in, jobs were paying $20-$25 an hour for someone who knew what they were doing. Now they want to pay $17-$18 starting off. Yet they will higher an idiot engy straight out of school for $50-$60 a year and you are cleaning up their mess all the time.
[Is this because most manufacturing has been outsourced overseas in the past few decades?  Or something else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stdt3?context=5)|Mostly yes.
[Wow good for you! I'm 20 and I've been welding for a couple years now, I'm up in Alberta welding on pressure pipe. Recently I'm thinking about setting up my own truck but I'm not sure how exactly you go about getting clients, do you know? An also how did you end up landing those cool jobs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sska0?context=5)|I never stopped looking for a job, Ive always known what I was capable of and was never happy doing production work. Push yourself to do better, be better, know more. Know what your worth monetarily and to the company.  As in terms of getting clients, I dont know much, I have a friend that has started his own business, the jist of what I have gotten is there are web pages out there that companies post bids on for work they need done. You go on and bid on the job after you have run your numbers and decided what you want to charge.   My recommendation and what I have seen work well is.  1) get your truck and everything you might need, little by little. 2) Keep a full time job, use your side work as means to pay off or buy tools needed. 3) Word of mouth, craigslist etc, just start building up your experience and client base.
[Miller or Lincoln?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sske2?context=5)|Miller, or Fronius. Fronius is much nicer technology and they are starting to get into the US pretty strong. But miller because of the support in the northeast, Lincoln is more popular down south.  Every Lincoln ive used, just doesn't feel right. I have a harder time weldin I feel. I mean it doesnt really affect me using one or the other but how the arc starts, pedal sensitivity etc.   Lincolns a very storng company and are really pushing the welding simulators.   Funny Story I was actually at a demo for an American Welding Society meeting near me. The rep held a competition of Flux core mig. It uses a scoring system to rate your by how stable you were, consistency in rate of travel, angle etc. Now I'm in a room with 30 people, all have been welding longer then Ive been alive.  I actually won lol, by like two points. I was shocked as hell, got a nice hood out of it.  tl;dr Did a welding game with a bunch of older welders and won. Barely.
[Ever work with aliens on Area 51?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st96d?context=5)|Once, but it was a long time ago and I dont wanna talk about it.

[Is the work physically demanding? Howso? Does it keep you in shape?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stj5e?context=5)|The work can be excruciating hard, like when I was doing confined space ont he condensers, or it can be laid back and easy as hell. It can certainly keep you in shape, climbing, crawling holding a 30 lb lead above your head for 10 mins at a time for 8-10 hours.
[How many hours a week do you work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stj5e?context=5)|Depends on how well you pick it up. Ive known guys who have welded for years that cant do code, its how much you want to learn and want to do quality.
[How long does it take to become qualified for welding work, starting from scratch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stj5e?context=5)|Yes a lot of welders develop eye problems later on from arc flash or just the eye strain, lung issues and skin cancer can crop up without proper PPE.
[Do you enjoy what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stj5e?context=5)|For the most, most days lol.
[Did you go to school for welding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3ssvs5?context=5)|Yes i did, I went to a Technical High school where I learned the basics. Didnt really prepare me for the workforce, luckily I had people willing to teach me more once I got out of school. I got certified for my basic AWS cert while I was there. All other training I have gotten on the job.
[Wouldn't working with stainless technically be considered ""brazing""?  Or is it just all welding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stscj?context=5)|Uhhhh. not as far as I know. Brazing is more of a Mechanical bond, between two plates and the filler. Welding more making two pieces one, using the material it is made of. Unless your doing dissimilar metals, then thats more complicated.
[I have to agree with that.  My dad was an underwater welder most of my childhood and then a foreman. Life was good when he had a rare union job.  But I spent most of my childhood moving from coast to coast while he changed jobs.  Out of curiosity, are you unionized?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stlgi?context=5)|I used to, when I was building for the Navy.
[What is the single scariest piece of military equipment you've worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3ssi4y?context=5)|I honestly havnt worked on anything really scary. The coolest/most pain in the ass that I have worked on was the condensers for the Virginia class subs and the new super carriers. Defense contractors are spread out all over the place. I did have a friend in texas that said he was working on chemical weapon components. Thats something I really wanted to work on. As morbid as it is.
[Any artistic ambitions that you'd care to pursue in your welding career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st5mn?context=5)|God Id love to, I am aiming for when I get a house and a garage making a blacksmith, sheetmetal shop and working on my projects in my head.   Make a real Katana is my dream.
[Best weld...stick or fluxcore? tell me about mixing shielding gasses. Personal Protection? respirators? have you noticed damage to your eyes? what color are they? (optional)what is your ethnicity/background? TIG tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stdxn?context=5)|Depends on the job and where your at. What do you want to know about mixing shielding gases? I have only ever used bottle mixes 75/25 90/10 60/40 60/38/2. PPE depends on the job at hand, I recommend respirators at all times if your grinding or mig welding. a p100 should be good enough. 3m's 7501 witht he pancake p100 is nice and comfy, if you dont have tor wear safety classes all the time. I have had arc flash but no permanent damage. green/blue to hazel. Im white, msotly western europe mutt.   Tig tips, Rest the cup on the piece if you can and get as comfy as you can. 45 degrees doesnt always work sometimes a 30/15 works great. Set your amperage to the piece your working on, the pedal is a percentage of that usually.
[What has been your greatest accomplishment as a welder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st5r3?context=5)|I did all of the new procedure qualifications for dissimilar metals, which included re-qualifying old procedures and developing new ones with my welding engineer for the new super carrier condensers. They were all ultimatley used. I passed 51/52, screwed up a 1/16 Inconel test. We didn't use it anyways. These all got X-rayed, cut up, bent( destructive), and macro'd (being able to see the individual pass, Heat affected zones and grain.).
[Any advice for a new student? I'm in my first semester, and I'm doing really good so far. Anything to look out for when I enter the work force?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stbjk?context=5)|First off, Thank you so much for your service to our country.  Youll need to feel out any new place, but trust no one. Sometimes welders dont like new guys.  Take your time, think everything out from start to finish. Double and triple check your math and measurements. Its better to take longer to make it right the first time then to have to make two.
[My question is, what type of process(es) and what type of material did you use for the majority of the spent fuel rod lockers? Could you walk me through your guys' quality procedures (ie x-ray tested? Destruct tested?)? Were you required to be AWS or some other type of certification to work with such dangerous material? What was the worst part of the welding (crazy out of position? Extensive pre-heating before laying a bead? Huge time-consuming multi-pass welds?)? And do they allow you to weave your hardwire welds or must you lay stringers only?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sto6i?context=5)|&gt; What was the worst part of the welding (crazy out of position?

[What is your favorite TV show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st5ku?context=5)|Oh, tough one.. Right now I have five. Dexter, Walking Dead, Hell on wheels, Alphas dirty jobs.
[How often do your friends ask you to make things for them? Can you 'feel' if it's a good weld? If so, how? Do you get sick of what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stbmi?context=5)|-Every once in awhile. I cant know, my boss doesn't allow personal work. -When you know what your doing, I can't stress that enough, everything went smoothly, good penetration and your weld looks good. BUT welds can look gorgeous and fail miserably. A good experienced welder trained in inspection cans pot the fakes.
[What's the hardest metal to weld with? The easiest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stbmi?context=5)|- Depends, all metal sucks to weld wihtout the proper prep. Thats the key. Aluminum can be the trickiest I will say, with thin gauge Stainless being a very close second. Theres a lot of details and procedures to follow with both.
[What's the hardest weld/job you worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sstau?context=5)|The condensers for the submarines. They are so ridiculously tight in there.  A lot of areas I couldn't fit into so I have to improvise by welding with an extension on the mig gun, or hang upside. Sometimes I had to take my boots off just to get in there. It was hot as hell in there during the summer.
[Is there a different technique used in welding pieces going into a nuclear reactor? I'm taking a course in the radiation effects on materials and was just curious.  Also, do you have any experience/ knowledge of using acoustic emissions to find any cracks, whether on welding surfaces or not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stva4?context=5)|Yes im familiar with ultrasonic work. No diffrent technique, just better welding.
[When I was working at Subbase Bangor in WA, one of the cryo techs in my shop filled an argon vessel with LIN before sending it back to the welders. An inquiry went down, and being the new guy I got the blame. Not mad about it; hated the navy by that time anyway. My question was, how much of a hassle would it have been to redo all those welds? What sort of testing would have to be done to determine the composition of the welds to see if they were done with N2 instead of argon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3ste9v?context=5)|I dont know what a cryo tech is, and I assume LIN is liquid nitrogen. Keep in mind not all acronyms are universally used. It is up to the weld engy to determine based on the purpose of the vessel is the n2 is gonna affect the  weld substantially. The AWS book on Elements of Metallurgy has tables and exceprts about the effects of n2 vs argon. Sometime they are neglible. Sometime they can cause cracking it all depends on material being welding. I dont know how much of a hassle it would be to redo the welds because you didnt say what you were working on. Typically argon adds some strength to SS and steel. But n2 can be used. If you are going to purging only.  tl;dr Welding engineers call on if they need to fix it or not.
[I want to get a cheap setup for basic car stuff: sheet metal and possibly welding heavier suspension components to the frame.  What type of set up would you recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st9bh?context=5)|Http://store.cyberweld.com/mil175witecc.html  This should work as long as your not going over 5/16"". If you are need to go next step.  Be careful welding on frames, do your homework.
[How many times have you forgotten to turn the gas on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3su8w3?context=5)|Lol at least once a week,.
[I really want to get into welding because its a trade skill that I figured will get me a job wherever I go, in the us and in the world. Im also an artist and want to use it as an art medium. Any thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stczr?context=5)|Go for it!
[How often do you have diarrhea on the job? Is the welder ever clogged?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3suoow?context=5)|About once a month, but only on sundays at noon.   sometimes, but i just say a chant and the smurfs come out.
[I'm currently working at H.I.I. as a structural welder @ the Newport News shipyard, I assume this is where you were working as well for the Virginia Class stuff?  Or were you up at Electric Boat Company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stdym?context=5)|Sub contractor in NJ, for electric boat.

[Nice to see an AMA by a welder. I'm nearly finished my C level (year one in BC) and am going for my metal fabricator's ticket straight away afterward. Apologies if this has been answered, but what sort of gear have you got? What's your favourite/least favourite process? Ever had any close calls on the job, e.g. shit idiots have done that's nearly gotten you killed? Lastly, if you could be doing any kind of welding, anywhere, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stnmc?context=5)|I dont own much of my own gear anymore, I have a miller elite hood though. Tig welding is my fav. Ive had a couple ""I almost got fucked up"" Ive always been real careful with others around, ive messed myself up more by being a klutz then anything else lol.  Nuclear welding or weapons manufacturing. I love what im doing now though with custom sheet metal fab.
[Ever do a little oxy-acetylene welding on the side for old times sake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3ssoed?context=5)|Lol, you know what, I never really got into it. Ironically I wasnt required by the AWS to pass that in school and no one does it anymore really. Ive done it a couple times, but I love tig welding more.
[Off topic question. How much different is Carbon based steel welding for a MIG welder running straight argon gas as opposed to a 75 25 mix?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3swq8y?context=5)|Runs much colder, the c02 acts as a de oxidizer, increase the heat and Helps with penetration.
[When I was in shipyard (on the navy side) I heard of a midget welder that they lowered into places no one else could reach. Do you have one of those in your shop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stnf7?context=5)|Apprently a long time ago in the 70's the palce i worked at that built the condensers did have a midget who worked there lol.
[When my grandfather came home from the war, he settled down with the woman he's met at a USO dance and became a welder. It would be the only job he held until the day he retired forty-five years later (with the same company). He was a machinist, an engineer, and a true tinkerer. Because of that, I've always harbored this sort of romantic idea about the welding profession.  How typical was his experience? Is the profession still as stable as it was in his time? I worked in programming and IT for a while because I wanted to sort of follow in his footsteps, and I was disgusted by how transitory most of the jobs in that field were. Is it still possible to find a good company and stick with them for a career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sv39c?context=5)|Its not unhearxdof. Depends on person and company. Yes it is still possible. But rare  there is no company or employer loyalty really around anymore.
[How hard was certification tests?  And what equipment do you typically weld with (modified MIG, TIG, something Industrial etc)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stfnn?context=5)|Mig-pulse and tig. Some pulse tig. Depends on the type of tests, full pen on thin gauge with purge overhead is a bitch.  The place i work at now its a syncrowave 200. Small company/start up.
[I know I'm late to the game here. I'm a structural engineer with a few years of experience. What are a few things that I can do to make your life easier?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3swe6f?context=5)|The biggest problem I have is engy's making things to hard when it doesnt have to be, I.e. you have the software to pull measurements off anything. Every chance you can try  putting in extra dimensions, and other dimensions so we can check to make sure everything is correct. Otherwise I have to sit here and do half an hour of math ahead of time laying everything out.
[Are you worried (at all) more about breathing in welding fume, or x-ray exposure from radiographic inspection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stpey?context=5)|Very much so, i used to go through 2-3 p100 masks a day, clogged to where I couldnt breathe through them.  No worries about xray, no one should be around. Not like it stays hot.
[Are you talking about a nuclear condenser for a sub? If so, how are they different from a condenser in a normal marine steam plant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sto85?context=5)|I cant really get into it.

[Plants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stljs?context=5)|What kind, like begonias or roses? Herbs?
[If you weld a piece of stainless steel, how hot does the whole piece get? Assuming it's fairly small (like a piece that's a few inches)   Also, what different types of metals do you weld? Is it possible to weld, like, titanium?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3svgwy?context=5)|Titanium welding is very common and i have done it. It welds just like stainless but requires perfect and clean conditions. how hot the piece gets depends on how you have everything set up. clamped? gauge? amperage? travel rate?
[With your highly specialized experience, do you think you make more or less money than a 10yr experienced engineer/scientist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stwew?context=5)|Way less.
[Are there any specific rules as to what a ""sanitary"" weld is?  Is it just a clean weld done with backgassing and finished to a non-pitted surface that is easily cleaned without scrubbing and then reconditioned (is the process called pickling?) to preserve the stainless qualities of the metal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3suj78?context=5)|Yes there are codes for sanitary pipin, pickling depends on material and customer requirements. Smooth inside, full penetration.

[That seems kind of low for a x-ray certified welder with 10 years experience. I live in Alberta, and people here make $25 dollars an hour for manual labour with no experience or training. I'm assuming welders here make quite a bit more than that. How is the job market for welders where you live, high demand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3styec?context=5)|Your right, but its a start up, i have stock share, im 9-5 and im in temperature controlled enviro. sometimes the extra coin aint worth it immeditatley.

But there needs to be procedures established by whoever does the r&amp;d or inspection.
[I did a internship at a company that tested welders in the construction industry by pulling apart 2 wires (which they use in prefabricated concrete constructions) that where welded (? idk is this correct? I'm not native) in an x shape.   What is the difference between this and ""X-Ray"" certification?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3suus4?context=5)|See the first posts about xray welding.

pxjiy,3,2012-02-20,I guess I ruined the relationship of my life forever,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pxjiy/i_guess_i_ruined_the_relationship_of_my_life/,"So there's this girl (that's how every problem starts, I suppose) and she was my first everything. I met her three years ago and she is the kind of person you only meet once in a lifetime. And, of course, I screwed it all up.

We were good friends for 8 months (I waited too long to clear my true intentions, I guess), dated for almost a year and a half and it's been 10 months since we broke up. Our relationship had many problems, but I think the main reason of its ending was my inability to handle them the right way. I was too jealous, controlling and impulsive. I blamed the society and her friends for influencing her to do things I disapproved, when it wasn't really up to me to decide all that. I judge people a lot (maybe I'll be a judge someday, maybe not).

After we broke up, I lost it. She was too important in my life, and that's never good. I lacked of other things to keep me interested and occupied when I wasn't with her, and once I figured I wouldn't be with her again, everything went down. Things got out of control and she filed a restraining order against me (and it gets better: I'm a law student). Her family was scared and who can blame them? I would've done the same thing or worse If I had a daughter and some guy wouldn't stop annoying her and going after her against her will. Long story short, I spent my 21st birthday afternoon in a police station explaining myself. I talked to a professor of mine and lawyered up. He solved the hole thing without getting me involved.

The fact is, after all that, I still miss her and don't know what do with myself. I've tried lots of things, good and bad. I searched for psychological and psychiatric help and started taking anti depressives; I used cocaine, which I regret; I spent a month in Europe (I could easily be living in London, but I can't just drop off college now); I started to practice Boxing and returned to play football, but injured my knee; I got in touch with old friends; I dedicated myself into a 4 months internship at the Federal Courts of Justice in Brazil (in case I didn't mention, that's where I'm from).

I'm much more mature now and I'm certain that I could do things differently, but I'm also certain that she will never be with me again. The thing is, at the end of the day, I can't help thinking about her and feel sad for everything. And I'm sure she doesn't waist any second of her life thinking about me anymore and is probably having fun with her friends - it's Carnival weekend over here. So I wanted to ask for some real advice, something huge. It could be anything, like growing a beard (even tho I'm incapable of doing that), buy an old Jeep and live in northern Norway. I don't care, I just want some ideas and advices to help me get thru this. 

And I know this is probably a cliche question, but believe me, this wasn't just a normal relationship break up for me. It's much harder, much deeper. The ""you'll find someone else"" is useless. I have strong issues regarding social relationships (you can probably tell by now) and I connected with her like I only do with one other person in the world, my brother who has Down Syndrome and is a very special person.

Don't know If anyone is going to read this, but writing and talking always helps me put my thoughts in order. And If you did read, thank you for your time.

Cheers and thanks for all the learning and laughter you promote here everyday.

q00i6,226,2012-02-21,This is my confession.,mprunner85,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/q00i6/this_is_my_confession/,"*DISCLAIMER*

First of all, I just want to say- what you're about to read is true. However, it is up to you to arrive at your own conclusions. I just need to get this off my chest because I have never told anyone in real life thinking they won't believe me. Not even my parents, my friends or my GF. Being anonymous here affords me an audience that I would not get otherwise. It's kind of long so please, bare with me. 

I like to run. I ran a lot and I've been running since sophomore year in highschool. I graduated in 2003, which means I have been running either competitively or recreationally for over 10 years now. I don't plan on stopping anytime soon, and to me, running is the best stress reliever for any amount of terrible things going on in my life. Over the years, girlfriends and loved ones have left and faded away, but the road has always been there. Gravel, cement, sand, snow, flat, curved, undulating- as long as I have two feet, and two shoes I can run and just, forget.
Sorry, I am getting a bit nostalgic, so let us move on. I ran through highschool, made state a few times for cross country, but never won it, and walked on in college for the X-country team (Div III nothing major). After college, decided to stop running competitively since my life was moving faster now- much faster than my legs could keep up. I moved, got an internship to another city and said good bye to my weeping mom, packed up my things and flew across the country. This new city of mine, had some of the highest costs of living in the country and so I moved out of the city, but kept my job. My commute to work everyday was not so bad, and the low cost of rent allowed me to afford some luxuries as a semi-decent car, decent clothes and decent food. I even started dating a girl that I knew from high school that happened to live nearby.


Anyways, this new place that I got myself was kind of in an older city. In fact, it was one of the oldest small communities in the East Coast. I decided to look up trails around my house and found an old park about 10 minutes drive; I looked it up and found that it had a circumference of about 10kms which would be ideal for a few laps. I made a mental note to drive down and run it the next day.
The next day, I got off work late due to some project I had to do and would be starting my run about an hour after I normally do- around 5:30pm. Since this was the fall, the sun would pretty much set around 6, and of because that, I was a bit apprehensive about running a trail I had never traversed before. I decided to do it in the end because I was a grown up, and there were probably going to be other people on the trail, and there has to be signs and some sort of lighting.
I arrived at the park and noticed immediately how old it looked and the thick the trees were. I got there around 5:45 and already the sky was turning dark. Right away I noticed how creepy some of these trees looked with their vacant branches clawing at the sky- as if they were trying to escape the soil that anchored them. The park was connected to the road by an over-pass, and I decided to make one lap around for today, a trial run, and see how it was. I quickly glanced at the trail map, laced up and ran over the bridge.
The trail was covered by trees and every time I looked forward, I noticed that there was just more and more of them overlapping. To me, their branches looked like interlocking fingers belonging to a series of giant hands that were enclosing upon me. It was around 6:15 when I was half way into my run, and the sun had set completely. All I could see were silhouettes of trees infront of me which seemed to go on forever. The sky came in cracks where the branches allowed it, and I could see no stars or clouds in the night above me. I could also hear no car noises nor did I see any other joggers on the path. The only sound were the sound of my Asics moving along the pavement. I made a mental note to speed up and finish as quickly as possible. I am an atheist, and I certainly don't believe in anything paranormal, but I also didn't want to get mugged or lost in the darkness. I checked my GPS at 6:27 which told me I had ran about 8kms in the last 40 minutes. I was making good progress, and had only 2kms to go. A sign that I pssed showing the direction of the park exit confirmed this notion. It was around this time when I felt a bit of relief that weird things started happening. Like I said, this is all true and while it may seem kind of weird, I swear that it happened exactly as I am about to describe.
Around 2 minutes after I had checked my GPS, I heard something- the sound of footsteps about 500 meters behind me. 

Great, I thought. Another jogger- at least I'll have company. The footsteps were a rhythmic pace with even intervals slightly slower than the pace that I was at, but also not at a slow jog. Pat-pat-pat-pat they went behind me in the distant darkness. I continued forward with my speed, honestly, a bit relieved that there was some else sharing the trail with me at the time and looked forward to leaving.

""Mark."" I heard a male's voice call my name from the background. No it can't be, must be the wind or the trees. I kept going forward...""Marrkk"". OK there was no mistaking it now that was definitely my name. I slowed down to a jog, but didn't stop, and turned around. Behind me all I could see were silhouettes of trees- nothing. A calm breeze rustled the leaves lying on the ground around me, but that was the only movement I could see. Or hear. The pat-pat-pat of my running companion had faded. I shrugged and kept going forward again. 
""Mark P____"" my full name was called. It stopped me dead in my tracks and a cold chill went down my spine. How could there possibly me someone that knew my FULL name in the middle of this park. Could it be a highschool or college buddy who recognized me and was fucking with me?
""Ya? Who's there?"" I called back into the darkness. One of my hands went into my pockets around my car keys in case there was a confrontation. No one replied. I turned around and began to start up again.
""What's the hurry you little shit?"" I jumped out and turned to the direction of my voice, seeing only an old hollowed out tree.

""Look man, I have to finish this. I'll see you at the entrance."" I answered back to no one in particular. I was trying hard not to show fear in my voice and was using the excuse of finishing my run to get the hell out of there. I started up again and really stepped on it.
""Race ya, Mark"" said the voice in my ear. I looked back, but again saw nothing in the woods behind me. I started running faster- a really fast jogging pace.
This is when shit got REALLY weird.
I heard the pat-pat-pat-pat of the runner behind me. Unmistakable footsteps, but the cadence seemed off. His steps were faster now, but they weren't well spaced apart- as if he was speeding up and slowing down: pat-pat-----pat----pat---------pat--------pat--pat--pat--clonk
Wait what was that?
CLONK--CLONK--CLONK---CLONK---CLONK
Were those? Hooves? Ok I have totally lost my mind. Paranoia and adrenaline was starting to make me hear stuff that was not there. But it was unmistakable. It was the sound of hooves running. Fast. Not a horse's hooves where you can hear four , but the clonking was a lot shorter and faster tempo- as if there were just two feet. I glanced back and again saw nothing but twisted branches reaching up to the sky.
I started sprinting towards the overpass that I came across. It was about 600 meters ahead of me and I knew for whatever reason that if I made it there I was safe.

clonkclonkclonkclonk
My pursuer had also started sprinting. At this point my heart was going a million beats per minute and I knew I could not let him catch me. Whatever he was, I HAD to get to that overpass before him. Every race I had ran: from state in highschool to NCAA races in college were just races. In the end, win or lose you were going home. All that was on the line was pride. Like I said, I am a non-believer, but I knew in the back of my mind and with every tendon that was screaming for me to stop, and every sinew of being in my body that was racing at that very moment, that I had to make that overpass before he did, and if I lost this race, something absolutely terrible would happen.
I sprinted. I sprinted like it was the 2003 state championships, like the 2007 NCAA championships. I knew that out of every race I had ever ran- from small relays when I was a kid, to races in front of thousands, out of all those races, this race of the last 400 or so meters between me and whatever the fuck was chasing me, and making those sounds...this race I was in, was by far the most important race I have and will ever run.
I ran as fast as I could. I ran until I felt my lungs would burst- I ran at a sub 4:30 mile pace. I ran for my life. And he was gaining on me. Clonkclonkclonkclonk. Each step I took it seemed he got closer- the hooves got louder, and each step I took the overpass seemed to be even further away.

I gritted through my teeth and with every ounce of strength in my body pressed hard for the last 50 meters and ran right to the overpass. I turned and got off the trail and planted both feet on the reassuring wood planks. No sooner had I turned into the overpass, I knew that he was right behind me by no more than an inch. And at that moment I felt him. And I smelt him. I smelt decay, and embers, and funeral pyres and incenses. I also felt the coldest chill went down my spine throughout every neuron and fiber in my body and I felt completely paralyzed as he passed me. The whole world around me stopped at that moment and time itself seemed to slow down. My heartbeat grinded almost to a halt, and my breath came out in a long slow sigh- in a long slow funnel of mist infront of my face. I saw and felt everything, even thought this happened in mere seconds. And for those mere seconds, that I felt him pass behind, I knew I had experienced death.
""See you around"" he whispered, so close into my ear with this terrible, sickly breath.

Clonk-Clonk-Clonk--pat---pat-----pat------pat-----pat
His stpes faded away down the trail as I looked back from the overpass. Of course the path was empty and only a slight breeze passed through the tree branches. I walked over the bridge, my heart rate going back down and didn't say a word. I got in my car and that night, after I showered and changed at home, I collapsed in my bed due to exhaustion that I had never faced in my entire life, and fell asleep for 12 hours.


It's been over a year now, and I still wonder about the events that transpired that day. Did I imagine it all? Was someone playing tricks on me? Then how did they know my name? Yet, I each time I think of it, I get right back to that day- I remember every detail so vividly and it all felt so real. I still feel that sense of dread every time I am around a fire or see images of a funeral. Then again, it could all have been my mind having a hallucination due to my paranoia and adrenaline from the run. I am a skeptical, educated person, and it takes a lot to unnerve me, but what happened that day, I still cannot understand no matter how much I try. Regardless, I am still not a firm believer, but I am an agnostic now. Thanks for reading. "

[How much did fear/excitement play a role in your ability to aim?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2dne?context=5)|I didn't aim per se, I just reacted the way my dad taught me and like we always practiced.
[Where you aware of how many rounds you were firing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2dne?context=5)|Oh, and I didn't need to keep track of the rounds, because the second shot misfired, and by when I reacted and did the TRB procedure, I could see they were fleeing already. And I was scared that my gun was jammed or something and they'd notice it.
[How was the recoil.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t5rpx?context=5)|Barely noticeable. It's a good balanced gun, and so is the MiniThunder 45.
[Edit: As for an actual question, do you feel guilty or any regret, or do you just shrug it off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t57gt?context=5)|Edit: Neither. I don't have reasons to feel guilty because I'll never now how badly injured was the guy. But even if I'd learn for some reason that he died, I don't believe I'd feel guilty. Sad? Maybe, but not for him.
[How long did the attack go on for before you realised it was serious enough to need you to shoot.. did you hesitate at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2e1a?context=5)|You can keep the islands, they look dry and boring.
[Why do you want the Falkland Islands back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2e1a?context=5)|I was holding my gun inside my purse. When I saw them more closely and noticed they were a treath, I took the safety off. When they jumped (one of them reached for his waist, the other one jumped towards us grunting something that would translate as *""staystillstaystill""*, I just told my sister to run, took my gun and shot him.

[Karma works though...he was clearly a much worse person than you and you ruined his evening for sure. I would guess you have to be in such a life or death situation to make a call on shooting someone. Odd that you're angry and that you even sound disappointed the gun misfired.  You achieved the main aim which was to make them run away..did you want to empty the whole clip into him or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2o7v?context=5)|In that particular moment, I thought that only out of fear; my dad has been a cop for 37 years and is still on active duty, and I saw many of his friends being killed by wounded perps that had the time and strenght to shoot even after being badly injured. You just want to live *so* much, that you really can't stand the thought of having any chances to die there. But now, that years have passed, I'm glad that everything worked out that way. Like I said, it's the best possible outcome for us, because we didn't get in trouble. But... again, you should have seen them. Their looks and their body language. They *hated* us, and we never harmed anyone.
[Did the assailants steal your clothes during this altercation?  If so, why did you not purchase more in the years since the incident?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t7abs?context=5)|Because I decided to stay naked from that moment onwards, for the rest of my life.
[So what happened to the other assailant who saw his buddy get shot? Run after you? Run away screaming in terror? Help his buddy out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2dzk?context=5)|I would have shot the whole cartridge, though, if the second shot wouldn't have misfired.
[Did you call the police to report the crime or did you just go home and hope nothing came of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2fn1?context=5)|I ran like hell —I even lost my sandals on the way— back to my friends' house, and called my dad. I never reported it to the police, for the obvious reasons.
[You are being VERY polite to certain commenters. Kudos. Do you think you killed him? If so, do you feel secretly excited that you've done what few do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t8d12?context=5)|I... don't know. It could have gone either way. I've seen so many people die from much lesser wounds, and at the same time, I've seen people survive absolutely *terrible* injuries.  I stopped wondering about it a long time ago. I'm content with the fact that I *ruined his fucking day*, that's for sure.  If I did in fact kill him, I don't think I'd feel different about it in any meaningful way.
[Why do you feel the need to only show pics of your tits? is that the only way to get attention?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t5r5k?context=5)|Oh, hai _oogle.

[What is your occupation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2m3g?context=5)|I'm a licensed Surgeon's Assistant, but worked most of my life as a commercial model, dancer and some other stuff in the same venue. [I'm a mom now](http://imgur.com/a/FAWG7#0), so I'm working only a couple of hours on weekends for the time being.
[Also, what were you and your sister doing that night before the attack happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2m3g?context=5)|It was December 30th, and we were at a party in a mutual friend's house. It was just five blocks away and we couldn't get a cab. She insisted she had to be there, so I accompanied her, thinking what the hell, it's close and I have a gun. It was a stupid mistake that I never, ever repeated.
[Do you usually carry a gun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t3gq3?context=5)|I don't usually carry a gun anymore because I just don't go where I might need to. I learned my lesson and try to avoid those situations if possible. I also work much less now that I had a daughter.
[You never reported it to the police, but i assume there was some newspaper article about it? What did it say/what happended/where there no witnesses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4gvd?context=5)|No witnesses, except a poor [cartonero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartonero) that *maybe* heard the shot. He was around the corner and saw us running back to our friend's house.  Besides, Buenos Aires is a *huge* city. I hardly think that any newspaper would be interested in such a trivial shooting, where nobody died —at least on the scene— and nothing of value was lost.
[I assume when shot u fall down and scream on top of your lungs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4qoq?context=5)|I'm afraid that's not like you see it in the movies. You can just google for videos of people being shot if you want, but you'll end up in dark corners of the Internet watching horrible stuff. Or 4chan. I had to do internship in clinics and hospitals for three years to get my Surgeon's Assistant degree. I've seen many, *many* cases of injured criminals going to the hospital with ludicrous stories about how they got shot. Some of them waited for too long and couldn't be saved, and it was amazing how they managed to even get to the hospital in the first place. You'd be surprised of how much the human body can whitstand, and I'd suggest you don't bait for the gore lovers to explain it to you with links.
[Any guilty feelings about shooting the guy? any idea where you hit him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2ie7?context=5)|He had a baggy... er, what's the name... like a T-Shirt, but with a hood. I could see the impact somewhere in his torso, as his clothes flapped noticeably.  I don't feel guilty. You should have seen his eyes. He really meant us harm, because he hated us, and whatever we stood for in his mind.
[How did the police respond to your self defense shooting?  Did they treat it like a crime and indict you on charges, or did they act differently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2g23?context=5)|I never reported it, because I didn't own the gun, and the HP bullets aren't permitted here. Which is stupid.
[What are gun laws like in Argentina? In the US, it's generally pretty simple to legally own and carry a gun. Is that the case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4w77?context=5)|Quite the contrary. It's very, very hard to be a legal owner here, and even if you are, the laws are very strict —and stupid— about concealed carry and permitted ammunition.
[~~Would you get in trouble for killing someone in self defence?~~   ~~Why did they attack you? Robbery? Rape?~~   Did you shoot to kill or injure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tcsuc?context=5)|I shot to neutralize, didn't really care about my target's health.

[Can civilians buy handguns easily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t8ms8?context=5)|No, not at all. It's not impossible but they surely make it really hard.
[Where did this happen? Is this common?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t69jg?context=5)|It happened in [San Martín](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Mart%C3%ADn,_Buenos_Aires). It's not uncommon if you're stupid like I was and walk alone at night thinking that nobody will be in the streets, but it's not a particular unsafe place to live.
[How did you cope with the stress after the event? how long it took you to get completely recovered from the shock?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tb7pm?context=5)|That's a good question. It took about four or five months until my life was practically the same as before the attack.  Before that, I had periods of sheer bliss for every trivial little thing that I could enjoy in my life (like being with friends, watching a movie at home, having a nice dinner, playing a new game), and serious worries about my safety (triple checking my doors many times a day, avoiding going outside, buying firearms, etc.). All in all, I think my life was improved and I ended up being much wiser after that incident.  **Edit:** Oh, it was *you*, and I just noticed! (n.n) Why didn't you tell me on Skype you were posting in my IAMA? /hug You sexy macfag! &lt;3.

Such a big gun, and such a smooth shot.
[Was it a racial thing? Strikes me as odd that these randoms would stop you out of hate? Unless it is somehow racial.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tos0h?context=5)|It's not about race, no. It's more about our socioeconomic differences. Some people hate you just because you have things that they never will.  Don't get me wrong, I believe their intentions were probably mundane: robbery, rape, who knows. I was talking about their *motivation* when I mentioned the hate.
[How many years ago was this? i've been to buenos aires recently, it's a lovely city, but many places seemed abandoned and scary. many weird people walking around and asking strange questions. do you think violence in buenos aires has grown recently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2jlx?context=5)|Yes, but it's not really different from the US if you [check the statistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate). You just have to take care of who you trust and where you go, like in every part of the world where you are a tourist.  Oh, and it was about 3 or 4 years ago.

Winchester is widely regarded as a good manufacturer, so in this case it was just the user's fault.  I do not carry the Thunder 380 anymore, and I never knew what happened to the attacker I shot.  Personally, I'm all for stopping power, but of course, you have to be able to put the bullets in your targets. I would recommend acquiring the biggest caliber *that you can comfortably control*, and no more.

Okey: you are aggressive and did nothing but post grammatically challenged *ad hominem* attacks; you clearly seem to have a fixation on my looks and didn't contribute anything to the discussion. I can only conclude that you're just a sad, spiteful and envious teenage girl, making a poor attempt at trolling, and [your post history](http://www.reddit.com/user/jane408) does nothing but confirm it, so I'm gonna ignore you from now on.

Was it casting couch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t469j?context=5)|The option to do some stuff for a considerable material gain —whether that's money, gifts, job opportunities, etc.— is always present. Depending on your working environment, it's almost *mandatory*. The article is a recent case in which a somewhat known manager was arrested by the Interpol because he pimped his models. And nobody was surprised.

Not to mention the possible civil action that the injured attacker could pursue.

pykzr,0,2012-02-20,What should I focus on next?,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/pykzr/what_should_i_focus_on_next/,"I'm currently in my first year of a two year computer systems program, its pretty intensive, but I'm familiar with a lot of the stuff as I have taught myself quite a bit about programming concepts in the past few years.

I am doing well, but I would like to do other programming related stuff on the side to broaden my knowledge. I know a bit of Java so I am wondering whether I should focus on learning data structures and algorithms using the language (there'll be a course on that next quarter), another option I was thinking of was doing programming problems on websites like project euler and programming praxis, or I could just take one of the online courses at udacity.

I know that learning is an ongoing process, but I am wondering what will improve my programming skills while also being useful in the real world. I will be doing an internship this summer as well.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!"
q1lo9,140,2012-02-22,It's the little things (differences between living in the US and Germany),leechnerd,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/q1lo9/its_the_little_things_differences_between_living/,"I'm an American and I've been living in Germany for nearly a year and a half now. Life here in Germany isn't really that much different for me from life in the US. Most of the differences really are just tiny or little things that I've gotten used to and/or take for granted.

Here are some of them, maybe some Americans/Germans would find it interesting, especially cause I see some posts asking about what it's like over here. These aren't meant to be taken too seriously or as a definitive guide or anything, just my take on them.

**Home**

Windows. They open in two ways; tilt it back from the top to let in air, or swing it open from the side to open the whole thing. In the US, they slide to the side.

I'm not sure if closets physically built into the room are common here; people just have wardrobes. In the US, every room I can think of has a closet built into some section of the wall with sliding or deal doors.

**Groceries**

Shopping carts are locked and require a deposit to unlock it. Shopping carts in the US are free to take. The ones here can also be pushed in all directions (i.e., left and right too), while in the US you can only push them forward and backward. This was the strangest thing to get used to IMO.

Eggs come in cartons of 6, or cartons of 10. Why not 12? Who knows. Eggs are also not washed here, so don't be surprised if you see dried feathers stuck to the side of the egg. In the US they come in cartons of 6 (I think), 12, or more, and are washed.

Bags cost money, so people generally bring their own bags or backpacks. In the US, bags are free and plentiful, and are way thinner.

Americans are used to looking for milk in the refridgerator. You can find such milk in the fridge here too, but I'd say most people buy this ""utra-pasteurized"" milk which come in cardboard cartons and is unrefridgerated. Unopened, it can last ages, but once opened, of course you put it in the fridge. I find this milk tastes much better. Milk also comes in 1.5% and 3.5%.

I've seen refrigerator packages of food such as ""American Hotdogs"" which is like a hotdog in a bun with onions and ketchup prepackaged. (Side note, our ""American"" hotdogs are more like the sausages that come in the glass jars over here).

**Restaurants**

You're expected to seat yourself. You really do just walk in the door and find a table to sit down at and do it. In the US, you just stand by the entrance and just wait until a specific employee, usually a hostess, seats you.

At McDonalds (for example), you order your hamburgers and then you stand there in front of the cashier and wait. In the US, they'll take your name and call you when your food is ready, so you can go sit down or stand out of the way of people ordering.

Drinks do not come with free refills here. Most places in the US will happily refill your drink until you burst. In popular restaurants in the US they typically won't even ask if you want a refill and just bring you another cup when they see you're like 2/3 done with your current one. This applies to tea, soda, water, but not alcohol of course.

Here the waiters typically won't ever ""bother"" you. They'll just take your order, bring you your food, and when it looks like you're done eating they come and ask if you're finished. In the US, they're more personal and come by every so often to ask how it tastes, if they could bring you anything (e.g., more sauce), if you want to try anything else, deserts, etc.

**Entertainment**

You can order, pick and reserve your seats at the movie theater online, so it's pointless to show up to the theater earlier than the starting time. In the US, most theaters have first-come first-serve seating, so for popular movies people will typically show up hour(s) early to wait in line to get a good seat.

**New** Something I find hilarious is [Tanzverbot](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzverbot#Stille_Tage). There are some days in Germany where dancing is actually forbidden (actually what they mean is that clubs can not be open for dancing). On Good Friday in every state dancing is expressly forbidden. I guess you should instead go to church or something.

**Cultural**

One thing I find strange is that at a job, when *you're* leaving (on good terms), *you* bring a cake to work and share with everybody. When I left my internship back in the US, my coworkers brought *me* a cake to work.

**Other**

What Americans know of as the ""first floor,"" the Germans know of as the ""ground floor."" What Germans know of as the ""first floor,"" the Americans know of as the ""second floor."" I am never going to *not* instinctively press 1 whenever I get in an elevator to go down :(.

German (and really, the rest of the world) paper is size ""A4."" US paper is size ""letter"" aka ""8.5 x 11."" A4 paper is a bit taller and skinner than US letter paper.

These are just the things I can think of at the moment. I can post more or answer some questions too if anyone has some."
q1d8z,2,2012-02-22,CAS authentication for Gerrit/git?,avart10,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/q1d8z/cas_authentication_for_gerritgit/,"Hey, r/sysadmin! I'm into my second week as an intern at an IT consulting firm, and they are having me do some changes to their in-house IT infrastructure. I've been helping them migrate from Perforce to Gerrit/git as a versioning and review system, and I think that I've got almost everything planned out the way I want it to, and have found resources for most of the things I want to do.

Gerrit needs to integrate with Jenkins, Jira and Fisheye, and all of those things have plugins ready. And most of the integration with git is done through SSH with RSA keys. 

However, the company infrastructure uses CAS and ProxyPass to enable single-sign-on sessions, and I haven't been able to find any good material on how to get gerrit to authenticate with a CAS cookie or anything like that. 

I've found anecdotal evidence that mod_auth_cas for Apache should work (through there being bug reports on it, heh), but no real HOWTO. Does anybody here have any pointers? 

Should I just go at it from the other way around, and read up on how both CAS and gerrit integrates with Apache, and then build a custom solution?


Thanks."

*(I heard this subreddit relies on a certain suspension of disbelief, but this is an actual true story that I first submitted to reddit a while ago, and now in the comment linked above.)*

================

(...) Warning: explicit. The following story is 100% true. (...)

I was 23 years old with the same condition -  phimosis. Not as severe as some of the pictures you see online, but there was also this pinching feeling when I had sex, so I decided to get circumcised.

The doctor had told me to relax, it would be a relatively painless procedure and I could walk home from the hospital after less than an hour of surgery. So I walked into the OR optimistically.

Turns out, the procedure hurts quite a bit. For anesthesia, they stuck a huge syringe into my penis 4 times. Each time felt like... well, a big needle being stuck into your penis. When they started cutting, I still had a lot of feeling down there. The feeling when they cut off the foreskin was... how can I describe it? The pain itself wasn't as bad as the knowledge that what you felt was a part of your body slowly being severed. Horrible. Then they started sewing me together and kind of folding and fusing together the skin-- how exactly it works, I couldn't see. It hurt a lot. It hurt a lot in my *penis*, and the awareness of that made the time ten times worse.

When they were done, the bleeding wouldn't stop. The doctor mentioned that I took unusually long to stop bleeding and asked me whether I had taken any aspirin or something earlier. I didn't. Well, they put my penis into a tight bandage and sent me home saying the pain would stop soon.

It didn't. 

Soon, it started to hurt really, really badly. They hadn't even given me a painkiller. It was terrible. At the that time, I actually did an AMA ""I am a 23 yo male who just got circumcised"" or something. It never made the front page though. And I had no idea the worst was yet to come.

At the time, I had just met a girl that would become my new girlfriend. Despite the mess in my pants, I met her a few evenings in a row. And we would make out. And I would get an erection.

I had never known this kind of pain. Every time I got turned on, it was torture. My penis would also start bleeding into the bandages, which I would have to change several times a day. Sometimes they would bleed through my pants and I didn't notice in time, then looking down in public to discover I had red spots between my legs. And yet, the worst was still to come. 

I pulled through the make-out session with my girlfriend-to-be like a champ. The pain got a bit better over the course of a few days. The bleeding would become less frequent. I later learned I was never supposed to bleed at all. To conquer the bleeding, I always wrapped my penis in toilet paper as well as putting bandage-pads into my shorts. Keep this in mind.

At first I had evaded sex with my new girlfriend, but as time progressed it was hard to make up excuses, and I told her the embarrassing truth a week after surgery. She was okay with not being able to have sex for another 3 weeks. But we still made out a lot, and in the heat of the moment she would sometimes dry-hump me a bit.

One night when she was dry-humping me, I felt a sudden sharp pain in my penis. Keep in mind that that happened all the time when I moved the wrong way or accidentally brushed against something with my crotch, so it wasn't unusual. Still I told my girlfriend to stop and we went to sleep.

The next morning when I woke up, I felt extremely weak, and my crotch was aching heavily.

When I pulled back the sheets, my entire sheets and shorts were SOAKED with blood. Blood everywhere. The bed was full of it.

I let out a loud ""AAAAAAAH!"" and jumped up, running to the bathroom. As I was running down the hallway, blood was dripping from my shorts to the floor, leaving red spots on the carpet. 

In the bathroom, I frantically tore down my shorts. The bandage pads fell off, and I was looking at my penis, completely wet and red from blood, and what looked like chunks of torn skin hanging down all over it.

Those were the worst few seconds of my life. My heart thumped and I felt sick. My girlfriend, who had woken up from the screams and followed me to the bathroom burst in, looked at my penis and screamed.

Then, thankfully, I realized that I wasn't looking at chunks of torn skin. I had forgotten the toilet paper wrapped around my penis. It had soaked up the blood and hung down thick and heavy, looking like flaps of skin. I yelled ""it's only paper, it's only paper"" to calm down my girlfriend, and pulled it off. Still, underneath it my penis was torn and bleeding. Turns out, the seams from my circumcision had ripped when my girlfriend dry humped me. I had went to sleep without noticing. The tightly stuffed paper and pads had held back much of the bleeding, but still I had woken up to the bloodbath in my sheets. As I stood in the bathroom, the shorts and pads removed, blood dripped down from my penis at a steady rate, going *drip drap drip drop* and leaving a puddle of blood on the floor between my legs.

I yelled at my girlfriend to go home and let me take care of it, and went to get dressed to go to the hospital. Since I was in a hurry, I only threw on old pants and a shirt and some sandals.

I'm a European student in a big city, so it's not out of the ordinary for me not to have a car. I got on the next metro train en route to the hospital. Halfway through the ride, I catch a little girl staring at me and whispering something to her mom. The mom is looking at me, and quickly pulls her daughter away.

I look down and see that there's blood running out of the legs of my pants, all over my feet and into the sandals. 

I only had to drive for two stations. Then I got off and had to walk the last 300 meters to the hospital. As I walked, more blood ran down my leg and made squishy sounds in my sandals. Some blood dropped onto the pavement. I left a trail of blood behind me on the sidewalk. 

When I reached the ER, the nurse on duty was quite unphased. They let me wait a few anxious minutes. Then I was called into surgery.  The doctor asked me whether there was anything unusual she should know. I told her that the last doctor had noted that my bleeding stopped unusually slow. She dismissed that tidbit and went on.

I had to go through the same horrible procedure that I was so glad about never having to go through again, again. They stuck a big needle into my penis, five times this time. They started to sew the torn skin under the head of my penis back together.

That's when the young doctor noticed what I had already told her: The bleeding was strong, and it wouldn't stop. She went on. Bleeding went on strong as ever. Blood flowing out of my penis all over it,  and over her fingers.

Now she freaked out. She was like a junior doctor or something, an intern? resident? I don't know. She refused to go on with the surgery and used a phone to call for the chief of medicine to take over. The chief of medicine was occupied with a heart surgery. Only after a while, she reluctantly went on with the procedure. 

They finished up the sewing part and wrapped a bandage *way* too tight around my penis. (I was slightly incontinent for the next few days that I had to wear it). 

They sent me home, again without painkillers, and again telling me not to have sex for another month. For the next week, the pain was worse this time around.

And when I had sex for the first time after the month was over, I was terrified that a seam would rip again every second through.

So there you go, that's my story. The moral of it: Treat your dick like porcelain, OP. Don't dry hump. Don't have sex earlier than advised. It could go horribly wrong."

q0ukp,6,2012-02-22," Having a rough time job hunting, here is my story -- any ideas?",danceswithknives,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/q0ukp/having_a_rough_time_job_hunting_here_is_my_story/,"I have a very diverse job history, and while it would be great in a post-apocalyptic world, I am finding it hard (impossible) to get a job. I have had people tell me I am a liar about this history, that I did not do any of this. Do you have any ideas on how I should present this or what I should do?

I grew up in a machine shop/garage working with my father on engine repair for cars and trucks. (I can repair anything.)

In the 90s I was a body piercer and manufactured titanium, niobium, and stainless steel body jewelry. I used medical implant standards according to ASTM standards at the time, and implemented CDC standards for universal precautions into my practice. I was one of the founders of the Association of Professional Piercers and consulted with National medical boards and organisations including the CDC and the AMA. 

I have a passion for computers and in the mid nineties I had my first experience with Linux. I began installing Linux on everything. The server side of Linux, what happened behind the scenes for web pages fascinated me, so I began setting up servers and firewalls for companies. I attended Devry and worked for a company doing video monitoring of day care centers to ease the minds of parents that had to abandon their kids all day while living in the cubical. 

I had to move back to my hometown to help with a family member that was ill, so I changed course and adapted to working conditions in that area. I took a job in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant. I had no idea how much I had picked up from my Grandmother in the kitchen, as she was a chef for 40 years running some pretty big kitchens, and I swiftly shot through the ranks. Within 6 months I was the second chef and kitchen manager. I proceeded to work in this kitchen and a few others for most of the 2000s. Except for a year in which I wrote, distributed, and published a monthly tabloid magazine. 

The economy was getting pretty bad so I went back to school, doing what I loved when I was in High school but never had the chance to be properly trained. I have finished a Bachelors of Fine Arts for painting and sculpture. I took an intern-ship in Italy doing art restoration for the Fall of 2011. I learned some Italian, and discovered many little facts about art from the Etruscans down to Baroque artists and their techniques that I am incorporating into my work. 

Oh yeah, I drove cab, ran a cab company for a while in 1992-1993 when my grandfather-inlaw was sick, and again in 2000 after moving back to help that family member. I drove school bus for a year and a half, but I don't have the CDL on my licence any more -- the medical exams were too expensive once I was no longer with the district.

I think that is everything, thanks for reading.

So here's the story, I graduated from a top tier engineering school, but I can't find a job.  Warranted, I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Liberal Arts/Digital Media essentially.  I've been stuck in a rut for the better part of 7 months, and I have exhausted damn near every viable career option.  There have been phone screenings, Skype interviews, and there was even an offer for an internship, but I couldn't make the deadline for work because I was in the middle of moving.  Funny side note, for one Skype interview, I pointed out a flaw in the preliminary test they issued, and the recruiter/CEO became so embarrassed/frustrated once he realized the stupidity of the question that he shut his laptop (He arrived at my explanation when he tried to walk me through the question).  Anyhow, I don't have the tools to further my portfolio because they were provided by my school, and I can't afford them since I don't have a job.  

My folks want me to go back to school, but I don't know if I'll get into grad school because my school raped my GPA because the ridiculous standards, which no one seems to comprehend...My last two years were where I did best too, but no one cares about that for some reason.  Basically, it looks like I'll end up going to a community college for some course work.  Don't get me wrong, that is fine, but this transition is just eating away at my soul because I reviewed some of the course curriculum and I already understand everything that they are trying to explain...Are there some other options that I've just neglected?  Btw, I can't get a part-time job either because the employers expect that I'll be gone within a week or two of hiring me even though I tell them otherwise.  So now I'm stuck doing odd jobs &amp; freelance work as it comes down the shoot.  Sorry if this story came off pretentious..., it's been a weird couple of months.

The following is a list of things we, the young, graduated, and unemployed wish you knew.

We are not lazy.  We have done what all the articles say, and we have treated looking for a job like a job.  We have applied for more than 100 positions at this time.  We have had interviews, phone interviews, follow ups, you name it. None of them have panned out.  

Please do not look at the gap of employment in my résumé as a reason not to hire us.  If anything, it is a reason to hire us.  We appreciate the value of a job, and certainly more than we did after we’d been searching for a month.  We are not just working hard to find a job, but are willing to work just as diligently to keep a job.  We are the people that will go above and beyond and will never give up.  Otherwise we would have by now.

Offering only entry level positions that are internships and not extending internships to non-students hurts.  We will prove our willingness to work while working for free.  But you have to let us.  75% of positions we come across that are not internships or part-time expect 3-5 years of experience.  To bring you that, we need your help, and we are willing to be molded.

For those businesses that take the time to reply to applications, thank you.

Help?,JohnJacobs,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q2prr/iama_college_senior_who_has_no_idea_what_to_do/,"I'm graduating this spring with a BS in Statistics, and I honestly have no idea what I want to do with my life. Obviously, something to do with my major as I do like numbers. I haven't done any internships or co-ops so I'm worried I may have screwed myself over in the job market. I am a hard worker but getting the job and proving that I am a hard worker is the difficult part. I have been considering Grad school but getting in and paying for it will also be very difficult. I know it is a long shot wondering if anyone else is like me out there or was like me but I was just curious if anyone has any advice or tips for a stressed out college senior.

tl;dr Stats major has no direction and could use some advice. "

q1wlj,1,2012-02-22,[College] What foreign language should I learn?,JDBAZ,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q1wlj/college_what_foreign_language_should_i_learn/,"So I am currently a Freshman at my college, Northern Arizona University, and they recently introduced a program called GSEP. You can read more about it here: http://international.nau.edu/GSEP/Info/GSEP-overview.html

Basically, the just is this: While enrolled in your normal Computer Science classes, you also take foreign language classes. This is either in German, French, or Spanish. In what would be your senior year of school, you travel to a foreign country for a year. Obviously this is a country that speaks that language you are learning. 
For 6 months you attend a university there, taking a very light course load, mostly consisting of liberal arts classes and only 1-2 actual Computer Science related classes, which will transfer, and thus count towards my degree at NAU. You then have a 6 month internship at a company, obviously somehow relating to Computer Science. You then come back, and finish your degree in your 5th year. At the end of all of this, you end up graduating with the following:

* B.S. in Computer Science
* B.A. in a foreign language
* 6 Months at a foreign university
* 6 Months at a foreign company

Now, my question is this: What language should I learn? I took very basic High School Spanish, and have forgotten it all since then, so I feel as if I am basically at the same level in all three languages. I am leaning towards French, only for the reason of my sister and brother in law traveled in France and loved it. Is one language better, in the sense of there are more Computer Science jobs in a country that speaks that language? Even if I don't end up working at a job overseas, I feel that it would be an amazing experience to have, and I don't think it can ever really hurt having a foreign language degree."
q1qn6,0,2012-02-22,Non-technical IT internship--is this helping me at all?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q1qn6/nontechnical_it_internshipis_this_helping_me_at/,"I'm a junior computer science major aiming for IT (I suppose my ultimate dream is sysadmin). I just started an internship which is in the IT department of a great company. I took the offer because, well, there were no other positions in my area, and it was my first opportunity to work in my field. I know that internships have the stereotype of being coffee-fetching jobs, but my duties are basically glorified proofreading of benefit information before it's packaged and sent to clients. I don't mind doing this, but should I look for an internship that will give me hands-on experience in programming, infrastructure, or...anything? Should I work hard and ask for a transfer later? Or just accept that an IT internship is an IT internship?"
q4m69,1,2012-02-24,"Help. I'm good at what I do, but I hate it.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q4m69/help_im_good_at_what_i_do_but_i_hate_it/,"I don't know if this is the appropriate subreddit for this, but here goes anyway.

I started programming when I was 14 and started making mods for quake and stuff. I just started getting hooked. I was at the top of my class for math and I took every single possible AP math class I could take (Statistics, Computer Science, Physics, etc) but I always had this lingering thought in the back of my head that I didn't really like it.

Anyway I eventually got so good that I basically had an internship for $15/hr land in my lap as a Junior in high school, I was the kid at my school making the most money. Sure, it was really hard work but I made a shitload of money.

However, I saw the other jobs that other kids had, like McDonalds, Baskin Robbins and Target and stuff like that and I saw all the fun they were having and all the friends they were making and I kinda got jealous. I basically just sat on a computer and programmed while these other people got to interact with people.

Now, it's my first year at Uni and I'm majoring in computer science (obviously), but I *really* don't think it's for me. Sure, I'm at the top of my class right now but I am seriously not enjoying my life. Like, **none of my friends like computers**. I think that says a lot about me.,I have nothing in common with my comp-sci classmates so I made friends elsewhere. 

I'm really fucking scared, I'm so good at this shit it's unreal but I fucking hate it now. In a perfect world, I would just change majors. But I'm so good at programming, it just feels like so much wasted time, effort and potential. I honestly have no idea what I would do for a living other than computer science but I think I'm about to break. I can't take it anymore. I want a life. I want friends. I want to party. I can't relate to anyone else in my class. it sucks.


Does anyone get me?

I'm an intern programmer and my knowledge is limited.  Most of my experience is with C# and secondly java.  

The task I'm trying to complete seems like it should be easy but my inexperience with scripting or javascript aswell as http methods is next to none.

To the problem:  I'm looking to simulate and automate two button clicks, with the browser already open.  And perhaps automate population of a form field (textbox), but that would be icing on top.

This is obviously a simple task done manually, but I'm not really sure how to attack the problem through code.  How do I invoke a method or trigger an action on javascript?  

My guess is I might be able to spoof the http request headers (get/post/etcetra), but my knowledge on that is very limited.  I downloaded a program which records the get/post headers.  Assuming this is the solution, how do I send these to the website (using preferably C#)?  I don't even need to receive the returned content, I just need to trigger the event.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What's the difference between an angel investor and a VC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u6pju?context=5)|Broadly speaking an angel investor invests their own money and may not do it full time.  A VC is a professional who invests other peoples' money in a fund.  Also angels tend to invest earlier in less developed companies (sometimes called seed stage).
[Are there generally legal or structural differences between angel and series A funding?  I know that angel rounds are usually smaller but it seems like there is more to it.  What constitutes ""closing"" a round, does that mean that all the equity that you're going to sell for that round has been sold?  Is it generally the case that no equity changes hands until a whole round closes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ue3o8?context=5)|While most angels are coming in at a seed round (pre-series A), that's not always true.  I've participated in Series A funding before as an angel.  Seed rounds can be done as convertible notes which is popular now and basically is a loan convertible to equity on the same terms as the next, Series A round.  This avoids negotiating terms and valuation before it makes sense to do so since a VC will likely want to dictate these.  There are drawbacks.  Seed round docs or docs for angels used to be less sophisticated / simpler in terms and conditions but nowadays I think this is less so.  Angels are investing in more developed companies and so are asking for much the same things as VCs so structurally they may be similar, especially if groups of angels are investing together in a syndicated deal.  Closing a round literally means signing the docs (getting the equity or notes) and wiring the money.  Popular these days is the rolling close where there will be multiple closes as money comes in, however as an investor you really want a minimum before any close because if the company doesn't raise what it wants that greatly magnifies the risk.  Also all things being equal you want to wait as long as possible (maximize your optionality) and close when the full round closes.  Which is why sometimes companies offer incentives to people who close early.
[What kind of covenants are there in the converts? Like can you convert given specific credit events or do you have to wait for the next round of equity? My thinking with your system is that your writing paper, for which there's presumably no secondary market, and in the downside case (start up blows out before they can raise the next round of funding) you're the only capital in the company, so even if you have recourse, it's not to anything really. Meanwhile you're debt, so until you convert you have no say in corporate governance... So it's sort of a catch-22 right? You don't have any real recourse unless your upside case proves out, at which point recourse wouldn't really matter. Seems like kind of a shitty deal from a fixed income POV. How do you protect yourself against the downside?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uerqd?context=5)|Yes you can convert on specific credit events but as you say it doesn't matter.
[What is your view on ""lifestyle"" businesses?  Ie. those that make their owners a nice bit of money to live on comfortably, but allow them to spend very little time actually working.  Do you think those are great?  Or do you think those people are missing out on huge opportunities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7axr?context=5)|Funnily I think many owners of lifestyle businesses never actually reach that goal of working little.  Keeping a business going through all the ups and downs is hard and you can never really trust someone else who is just on salary to look out as you would (as an owner).
[Pardon my ignorance in this area, but are there other types of exits beyond selling your stake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u9p4d?context=5)|You don't have to sell it all and then there are all sorts of things like earn outs, restrictions, etc.
[Is this something an angel investor would be interested in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u6otx?context=5)|I don't know your space but there is no reason why angels wouldn't invest in OEM or suppliers to OEMs so long as it is a scalable business model that can payback the investment with a gain!
[What are OEM companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uj93x?context=5)|Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer.
[How did you get into it? What education? Background? Parents come from money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u701k?context=5)|Kind of accidentally honestly.  People I knew were looking to found a company and I liked the idea and had made a little extra money from working on wall street so put it in.  Frankly I was completely unsophisticated about it but was excited by the opportunity.  Plus I still had a bit of the entrepreneur in me from etechtransfer.  There were a lot of twists and turns from there but as time went on I heard about more companies and it went on from there.  Originally I'm an MIT Engineer.  No family money.
[Course # at MIT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u9w4w?context=5)|6.
[Did you even have a chance to invest into twitter/facebook early on? Or similar question, what company became successful but you weren't interested?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u74j0?context=5)|Nope.  Better question is would I have invested had I the chance.  Honestly I didn't really care for either when I first heard of them.   Frankly I haven't been doing this full time or near full time until recently (~2 years) so there haven't been any huge successes yet that I know of where I declined.  There will be!
[Proof please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u6nnp?context=5)|Just tweeted this iama.  you can see my companies on my profile.  http://www.newcanaannewsonline.com/news/article/Stamford-Innovation-Center-unveiled-to-the-public-3333718.php  http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Stamford-Innovation-Center-lands-500-000-aid-2970722.php Not much left on the web on etechtransfer but here's an article: http://knowledge.emory.edu/article.cfm?articleid=179  At one point three of the founders (again not me!) were on the cover of the Industry Standard.
[Just curious about your thoughts on Angelist. How do you like it? How often do you use it?  Also from a start-up Point-of-View, do you think it's easier to get attention, and reach out to angels. Any tips or other comments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7nu0?context=5)|I like Angelist a lot.  Naval is doing great things with it and it is getting a lot of traction.  As I mentioned to him the flow on there is surprisingly good and in some cases better than I get through my local angel group.  Perhaps because since it is public people self-filter or peer-filter out the really bad ideas... Attention is easy to get but really do you want it?  Meaning buzz can be gotten but is often fleeting.  In general, I think startups should make as much progress as they can without taking outside money or only friends/family.  If you can get all the way to making revenue (or profit) even on small scale then you'll get the attention you need to scale up, no worries!
[How do you compare potential value of a smaller idea/product that might be more niche or a larger (but more high risk/reward) opportunity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u6u46?context=5)|Personally I like ideas that don't have to be home runs to succeed.  World changing potential is great but let's be honest, there are few of those ideas and the ones that get there often evolve a lot (facebook is a perfect example).  Break up the larger idea up into concrete executable smaller ideas and dominate niche by niche.  [insert cliche here like walk before you run]
[Also, what kind of returns do you expect if the company becomes successful? Do you think that investors put too much pressure on startups to have an exit strategy and help everyone cash out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uc53l?context=5)|There definitely is a lot of pressure on exit strategy and the more money you take in in later rounds the more pressure builds.  That's why you really shouldn't take money unless you really need it because the incentives can get misaligned. That said early exits often make sense for the entrepreneurs too and it is important to have founders who are starry eyed enough to shoot for the moon but who are practical and understand when they've done well enough along the way and external concerns just make it impossible to really grow as fast or easily (such as lots of new competition, big entrenched player is throwing money at it, etc)
[What is the timeframe for that? How does it work--do they pay you after raising bigger money from venture capitalists? Isn't that sort of close to a ponzi scheme?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uc8u9?context=5)|No one is promising any returns so it's not a ponzi scheme.
[For those seeking angel investors, what is the best way to find one?  Once we find one how do we convince you to invest in a start up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7fev?context=5)|Reach out to angel groups in your area or on angellist (which BTW is a great newish site bringing together angels and companies).  As for the convincing have a great idea and a great team to execute it.  Know what you don't know and be honest about weaknesses.  Get us excited about building a business with you!
[How did you get started in your career? Did you build your way up from nothing?  What is the best advise you can give about being successesful in the corporate world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ueh5y?context=5)|I did some internships while in college and was recruited by Lehman Bros my senior year.  I started off in the front office as a jr trader = coffee boy.  Then went back to tech as a consultant at JPM but it wasn't long before I left w/ some others to found a startup.  It went on from there.  The corporate world is a tough one.  I think the number one thing is to understand it is all about people and that there is a lot of politics.  So just being right isn't enough, you need to make sure you get everyone going along with you too.  I don't think I ever completely learned that.  Also you should understand where the money gets made and be as essential to that as you can.  Of course startups are kind of non-corporate which I like ;)
[One last one...  I consider myself an extremely savvy marketing person with a very broad digital background who has been very successful at what I do in the digital marketing space for some pretty large companies.  With that background, is there any sort of place for a person like me who does not have a Finance/Wallstreet background or who doesn't have a successful list of startups they've created to join a VC firm in some capacity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7bjx?context=5)|As an employee off the bat I'd say no.  If you want to get involved you should start by networking and becoming an advisor/subject matter expert where you can leverage your background in a way that benefits them.
[, whats your first tip to a person who is not necessarily a designer/developer but wants to start his own startup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u84q5?context=5)|First tip: get involved in the scene and meet people doing it.  See my earlier response but in particular you should come to the Stamford Tech Meetup.  Despite the name, it isn't all for techies.  Also get involved in startup events like the startup weekend stamford we are hosting soon.
[Yeah I've been to a few of the Stamford meetups, thats actually how I got my current position.  I saw at the SUWeekend you have a ticket for non-developer/designer.  What exactly do you expect someone who attends as that category to do at the event?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u89xv?context=5)|Join a team!  I know other startup weekends have done it differently but really I think broader teams are better.
[Which investments/companies have panned out and which have failed? What lessons have you learned from each?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ueu2m?context=5)|As I've said below I've had limited gains/losses and most investments are ongoing so I can't talk specific names.  That said major lessons learned are: 1) Team ability to stick together in rough times with the same goals and commitment is critical.  This was a huge issue in my own startup failure and in my largest investment was an ongoing struggle that led to 3 of 6 founding team members leaving before management could stabilize enough for the company to mature.  2) Always be analytical not emotional in investing.  On my investment where I had to write most of it off I didn't put my usual rigor into the market opportunity and long sales cycle because I knew the founder very well and the company too.  3) Growing customers/revenue too fast can be a killer.  Keep your eye on expenses.  I'd heard this before anecdotally but one company just scaled up and up and when the recession hit they were caught with a too large office, too many staff, etc.  4) VC/PE and institutional money in general play for keeps.  If there is something in the contract or DD they can exploit they will, so make sure everything is in order.  5) On that note run the company professionally.  This means things like keeping minutes, voting on board meetings, audited financials, etc.  Act like a larger, professional company or you won't ever get there!  6) You need a strong supporting team not just a single or two strong founders.  Especially technical, financial, and marketing.  If these skills are represented the company will spend time finding people after the money comes in.  Individuals should be identified ahead of time.
[9 member team = 2 full-time co-founders , 3 partners (engineers), ( 4 friends &amp; family investors all strong techies) everyone having stake in company.   4000+ hrs already put in (each day/hour can be pointed and accounted for, just in case :)  Launching pre-beta (productized) on 29th Feb, looking for angel investors, to bring everyone on the ship full time.  Will you spare sometime for introduction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u8lc3?context=5)|Sure tweet me your info.
[How do you pitch your idea to an Angel Investor without them stealing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uawor?context=5)|In general you shouldn't pitch pure ideas because pure ideas don't get funded.  You need some traction (prototype, team, etc).  Also I can't speak for every angel investor and I'm sure there are bad apples out there but most of us don't have the capability to execute your idea and just like you certainly couldn't do it without a team.  Even if I could execute it if I think your idea is a good one and I think you are a great jockey (see above) then why would I steal the idea vs backing you since you've already taken it somewhere (presumably)?  Especially since doing that means there is a motivated and angry person out there doing the same thing who can also sue me?
[I live in a city famed for it's abundance of angel and venture capital and am a partner in a kitchen-sink start up. The kicker is, the money is focussed on tech and bio-pharma and we're in music... Do you think it's possible someone might invest in music for vanity purposes ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u8y08?context=5)|Lots of people would want invest in music for vanity purposes so they can say ""I found that band"".  It's up there with restaurants and bars.  How many actually do I bet is limited though.
[I am a PhD student in Nuclear Engineering right now, thinking about my plans after finishing my degree.  I read economics books as a side hobby, but have no real business-type skills.  If I want to commercialize my research, what kind of market would I need to attract an angel investor?  I understand that I really need a Day 0 product that I need to develop and show to potential investors, but what kind of return would they need to see?  Also, how in-depth would research of that nature need to be to be realistic?  What kind of business plan would I need to show them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ukwcr?context=5)|Hi you've got a lot of questions and I really am not the best person to answer them plus it would take quite a long while to do so.  You should speak to the commercialization people at your university and they can get you going.  End of the day though if you have no real business-type skills then you need to partner with someone who does.
[What's a good amount to start angel investing? I know Angel investors aren't considered Accredited investors by the SEC, but are there any legal hoops you have to jump through? At what point did you hire a lawyer to deal with your deals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u8pkn?context=5)|Angel investments are by definition highly risky and illiquid so you shouldn't invest money you will ever need.  What that amount is is different for each person based upon their needs/lifestyle.
[How did you originally qualify to be an accredited investor? I'm not sure I'll be able to get to the point of $200k annually or $1 mill net worth easily. Should I go the route of opening a business investment company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u9myi?context=5)|I think qualifying as an accredited investors is the minimum before you can make investments.  Of course the gov't is looking to lower the barriers on certain types/sizes of investments.  I'd wait on that.
[Do you happen to know of any one/site/groups who do what you do in western continental Europe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ub1sl?context=5)|Sorry I don't.  I know Europe has a lot more funds than angel investors though anecdotally.
[What are your thoughts of getting an MBA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7uvz?context=5)|Ok broadly speaking I think an MBA's top value is in the people you meet (networking) and in the name on the diploma.  In this economy given the cost I think anyone should think hard about the actual value versus two years of learning by doing.  Can you tell I never got one myself? As an entrepreneur or as an investor?
[Hey rich 1 percenter stealing from the poor, get off the internet!  All kidding aside, do you think capital gains should be taxed at a rate closer to income tax?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3udnsm?context=5)|Nope.  Unless you inherited it, you paid income tax already on the money you used to buy the asset that you were lucky to have capital gains on.  Even if you did inherit it, if it was in a year other than 2010 (recently), you paid estate tax.  So capital gains are already double taxed.  Furthermore I should be incentivized to put my money to work by investing it in stocks, bonds, real estate, and yes startup companies (which by definition create jobs!)  And I think the AMT already causes capital gains rates paid to be higher for big earners.  I think our tax code is hideously and needlessly complex and full of loopholes, fix that not the capital gains rate.
[Ok, I've got a great idea and need money to pay a programmer - probably less than $25k. Infinitely scalable and ridiculous profit potential. Your wheelhouse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ubo0u?context=5)|If that's what you need and potential is as huge as you say then you should borrow that money from friends and family so you keep all the equity.  Seriously.  Don't reach outside unless you absolutely need it.
[Do you invest in technology biz, or any kind of start up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u8d3m?context=5)|I'm pretty broad and have invested in pharma/biotech, sales/marketing, ecommerce, fashion, etc.  All of my investments have a technology component but these days what doesn't?
[I work for a startup that is seeded through a VERY wealthy individual. We are a SaaS company with patents. The market we're trying to sell to right now has a sales cycle of about 1.5YEARS. Every day, I lose a bit of hope for longevity, and for ultimate financial success here. Is there any way to get in touch with you when you're done with this AMA so I can pick  your brain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7hzf?context=5)|Sure.  I'm @tedsensei.
[I have a very successful website that is read by most hedge funds, investment banks, and securities law firms in the United States.  I do this on the side in addition to my full time job working on Wall Street.  I would like to expand this website but need capital and time to do it.  Do you suggest I quit my job before reaching out to angels or contact angels while I still have a seat and get soft circles and a lawyer retained?  In addition, can I contact you offline for further advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u95s4?context=5)|First I think you should make sure that you aren't in conflict with any policies of where you work.  Assuming that you are ok then sure, stay employed while you get everything else lined up.  Since you've been able to run it successfully while keeping a day job nothing should change.  If your plan to expand makes sense and you get a good read on capital, then you can quit and be happy.  Clearly your investors will want you 100% focused on the site after that.  Some may care that you are working a day job now but honestly I think most will understand, again provided that the site is doing well that's the most important thing.  Caveat: they probably won't fund your salaries or whatever on the assumption that you have savings from keeping the day job for so long.  @tedsensei.
[It seems like there is no room for young people in VC.  Is there any entry-level way into the field?  You would think there would be plenty of associate level work to do but these positions don't seem to exist.  It seems like I have to either launch a startup or have a tremendous amount of wealth to start doing VC as a career.  Any idea how one would make the career transition?  I'm in the Northeast.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uaim1?context=5)|I don't know firsthand having never worked at a VC, but I hear where you are coming from.  Fact is there are way more people who want to get into it than there are spots because it simply doesn't take massive teams to do the work (and they can't afford them anyways).  This is one of the cases where you might actually get an MBA so you can network your way in and have the ground level skills through internships or whatever.  Also many people transition to VC/PE from working at banks.
[However, nabbing 10-30k from a single Angel isn't really enough for me to quit my job and invest heavily in the business.  Do you recommend finding a group of angels?  Do you usually make investments with three or four others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u9omy?context=5)|See above, I don't think it will happen that you'll get money to do it as a side business, frankly it isn't fair to the investor that you have such a huge hedge/out.
[If one has a great business idea with a business plan that doesn't require too much capital, say &lt;100k. Should one take out a business loan or seek capital from a VC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uh20s?context=5)|I think you'll find it difficult if not impossible to get a loan for a business plan if that's all you have.  Same goes with a VC (plus that size is way too small for them).
[I should also mention one does not like to share profits. Is there an agreement one could put in place stating that you can make 100-300% back on your initial investment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uh20s?context=5)|Not sure what you mean about sharing profits?  Legally you can cap returns through some kind of buyback clause, but I don't see why an investor would agree to do that given the risk/reward.  After all, if it fails are going to guarantee they get their money back or some part of it?
[Well isn't that part of the risk that VCs take? They either get a healthy return on their initial investment or lose it if the business fails?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ulmq7?context=5)|Right but then why should/would they agree to cap those healthy returns if the downside is not similarly capped?
[So what would you do if you were the guy with the business idea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uq00i?context=5)|I've been that guy. Take it as far as you can without taking money or taking money only from friends and family.  Then when you are ready you can bring in investors if you need it.  If you really can't do it without lots of money, break the idea down into smaller bits that are probably more realistic to execute on anyways.  Then by the time you really need money you'll be able to get investors on terms more like you want.
[Which verticals is your accelerator fund most excited about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uah7o?context=5)|Right now media is a big deal, especially in Stamford as more production facilities are moving in.  Similarly there are a lot of opportunities in healthcare related companies.  But we are open to all verticals.
[Do you invest more in the horse or jockey?  (idea or entrepreneur)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uah7o?context=5)|Definitely the jockey.  Most if not all companies pivot through several ideas IF they ever win the race.
[I have an invention idea. Is it worth pursuing? It's not very technological, but it's original and (I believe) fairly useful. Do you ever consider these projects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ucm8n?context=5)|Personally usually not because I have limited connections in the consumer goods type businesses plus it is very marketing ($) intensive.  That said if it is a good idea you should go for it!  What space is the invention in?
[I'm also working on a startup in the music space (and no not another Internet radio platform) and planning on launching prior to SXSW. We are considering angel investors but we're incorporated in Illinois (I'm the lone NYCer). How urgent is it to reincorporate in Delaware when looking for angel investment? Also, would you say it's worth paying a lawyer for a few hours of their time to go over the terms and services, etc prior to launch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uh2az?context=5)|Is it a C corp?  If not then you should take the time/money to reincorporate as a C in Delaware if you are seriously looking to raise money.  However you can always do it as a conditional to the raise.
[No we're an S corp. I was told that most startups should incorporate as a LLC, so C corp is new news to me. Can you explain that a bit further?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ulqx6?context=5)|There is no one obvious answer other than S corps don't work for angel investors and any kind of pass through tax treatment won't work.  Unless they aren't investing in equity.  That said people will do just about anything I guess, I'm just saying most won't.  If you already have an S you should just go to C which is ultimately what you must have if you want institutional money at any point.  Here's a quora: http://www.quora.com/Should-a-tech-startup-incorporate-as-an-LLC-a-C-Corp-or-an-S-Corp-Why.
[How do I begin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ucr29?context=5)|Honestly I don't know but maybe someone else does?  I would guess you need to make or find someone to make a prototype first to validate it actually works.  At the same time figure out the market for it so you know how to position it.
[Thank you! Maybe I'll be able to afford my swimming pool of gold sometime soon..... Haha. Once I've done those steps, could I message you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uk1dg?context=5)|Sure - I'm on twitter @tedsensei.
[How many private message did you get from redditors who want your money ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ubadq?context=5)|Would you believe just one!
[Did you interact with ray dalio or paul tudor jones? if so, are they as crazy the stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uac4c?context=5)|I did and seriously both of them are market geniuses.
[What are your thoughts on the show Shark Tank?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ubdju?context=5)|I watch it and I think it is ok since it exposes people to the angel investing world and to people starting companies (creating jobs!) Except Burnett made it too human interesty and blubbery.  Oh and some of the deals are ridiculously overpriced (which I've started to tweet about).  The original show is called Dragon's Den and is all over the world.  I'm a big fan of the UK Dragon's Den which was the first popular one.  1) The Dragons aren't as big a-holes and really try to give good advice and help even when they must be harsh 2) There isn't a huge amount of backstory, it's about the companies and investments 3) They don't want one up each other just for the ""drama""
[Can you go more into ""recovering wall streeter?""  BTW I am in Stamford too!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uaoiv?context=5)|I used to work at banks and hedge funds.  I don't anymore so I'm recovering from the experience.  It can be extreme.  Fun too but extreme.
[How old are you and what is your net worth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uf53z?context=5)|Put it this way I'm an accredited investor.
[So, you went to Stamford, did you?! Not as good as Hawvawd.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uez0p?context=5)|Actually I went to MIT &gt;&gt; Hawvawd ;)

q3ssi,3,2012-02-24,Somewhat confused about my options,SonOfSpades,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/q3ssi/somewhat_confused_about_my_options/,"I am about to graduate university with a Computer Science degree, with a Minor in Geomatics, and i am somewhat confused as to where i stand/go from here. I have taken almost all of the Geomatics courses offered by my university from Remote Sensing to Cartography, unfortunately I feel really confused as to where I fit in. 

A bit of backstory, my first coop internship was with Environment Canada, working as a developer, coding applications (in C++) to process/convert/etc satellite imagery into formats that were more usable for the analyists/science people, following this I ended up creating/working on extensions (or add-ons as ESRI calls them now) for ArcGIS, along with other various tasks. I really had no understanding of what a “Spatial Reference” or what “Symbology” was and why it is so important, at the time. However I loved the work, so much that I ended up doing a minor in Geomatics, and ended up working with Environment Canada for two years on and off, as a developer (for coop).  Also for the last year I have been rewriting/porting (Ugh Avenue)/updating peoples Python Scripts/Geoprocessor tools, ArcObjects/ tools and extensions. I have been doing this for free, to try and get more experience.

I tried to get into and contribute to the Open Source GIS Community; however I never really was able to get into it. However I do love the open source community, libraries such as GDAL, Mapnik, and even applications such as Geoserver / Postgresql + PostGIS are invaluable, and I have used them a fair bit for my classes/thesis/personal projects.

Skillset wise however the majority of my experience is using ArcObjects / Python / GDAL (Since working raster’s in ArcObjects/arcpy + numpy is slow and horrifying). However I do have a fairly good grasp of the open source GIS tools, especially when it comes to a lot of the Web GIS stuff. 

I somewhat feel I over specialized with ESRI, and should have instead been more focusing on the general areas of GIS. What should I be focusing on? Furthermore where do GIS Programmers really fit in?

So here's the dilemma:

My college is on the quarter system which gives us the flexibility to take quarters off as we see fit.  I am scheduled to take the upcoming spring and summer terms off interning.  

I have been extremely fortunate to have already accepted two internship offers: Company A for the spring term, and Company B for the summer term.  However, just today, I received an offer from Company C, and this really is my dream internship.  

So, I want to do an internship at Company C in the summer, but want to find some way to push back the start date of Company B's internship to the spring.  This would mean Company A gets the ax.

How can I go about making these changes without hurting anyone's feelings/getting blacklisted?  

Thank you all so much!"

[¿ What scarred you for life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxs6t?context=5)|The one thing I will NEVER forget is a young girl who hung around on the weekends.  I had a suspicion that she was younger than 18 but she claimed she was 18.  When I asked to see her ID, she showed it to me and it looked legit (holograms and what not) and said she was 18.  I come in one weekend and ask where she is because she was not around.  It turns out she was a runaway who got sucked into the sex trade which is rampant in Ohio and was shipped down to Columbus.  Guys were passing her around upstairs for 10 bucks a pop.  She was 14.    I felt fucking horrible for not trusting my gut. I guess I will tell you something else since I already posted something about a young girl who was a a runaway and was passed from guy to guy for 10 dollars a pop.  Another instance involved another prostitute.  She was legit mentally handicapped, could barely function.  She started showing up towards the end of my time there.  She was passed around as well but I believe her rate was 5 for sex.  Apparently she was having a heart attack and a guy just put her in the elevator and pressed the down button so she would come to the lobby.  The elevator opened and she was obviously in need of help.  I laid her down and called an ambulance.  It turned out it wasn't a heart attack but she turned out to be alright and showed back up later that night.
[Since when is the sex trade rampant in Ohio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyh9v?context=5)|Toledo is a huge hub for interstate human trafficking.  I will find some stats if I get a chance.  I'm not insulting Ohio, it is just that you can get to somewhere like 75% of the country within 24 hours from Ohio. http://www.examiner.com/women-s-issues-in-toledo/recent-study-cites-toledo-as-fourth-worst-city-nationally-for-human-trafficking-offenses.
[Did you make friends with any of the people there and what did they think of you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxv69?context=5)|Oh yea of course.  There were about 150-200 residents there. I tried my best to help everyone.  When I first showed up they thought I was a cop because I was white.  There was a guy James who would come and mop the lobby every night at 3 AMish.  We built a pretty strong bond.  I helped him make a resume and he eventually got a job because of it.  I found out that he had never eaten out at a breakfast restaurant so I took him to breakfast one morning after I got off and he had a blast.  The funny thing was he ordered a burger and fries for breakfast.  There were plenty of people I made friends with they were usually older than me though.
[What can you tell us about your views on systemic problems? That is, on a macro scale, what problems do you see with the overall system (i.e., the governmental response to poverty via the policing system/war on drugs, welfare system, social services, education, etc) that have impacted the lives of people where you work? Do you have a sense of what changes could be made to improve these people's lives over the long-term?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyixj?context=5)|As with anything else on the macro scale it all comes down to money.  These residents cant afford to pay 1000+ dollars of rent every month so they are ignored.  Columbus is also trying to gentrify the west side where these projects are so they are in talks to blow this building up because they dont make money off of it.  The police really could give two shits about this place.  I called the police plenty of times and it would take them an hour or more to show up. That's what pissed me off the most.  They would show up, write things down and leave.  Even if we had video footage they would say that a detective would be there Monday to investigate and the detective would never come. This happened twice. If you do not have money you are fucked. The fucked up thing is that say a person who is paying 20 bucks a month in rent gets a job.  Their rent immediately goes up to about 460 dollars a month.  Most jobs residents got were minimum wage so how are you supposed to work you way out of the system when the system keeps taking any money that a person makes. I do not see a wide spread change such as tearing the building down and giving residents housing assistance working for everyone.  I talked to residents all the time about how life could get better and it seemed like a more micro approach would work.
[460 dollars a month? I live in Columbus and that's more than I pay... Is that comparable to other apartments in the neighborhood?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v4sn4?context=5)|I am not sure.  From what I saw while I was driving around that part of town there are not too many other apartments.  The location is ideal though.  Downtown Columbus is a half mile away.  Like I said rent was on a sliding scale, however I did not dig deeper into how they decided those rates.
[Did anyone ever lie about if they had a job to keep their rent down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v0mx5?context=5)|Yea...I even advised a few to do so...
[What was the racial makeup of the residents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uy620?context=5)|Racial makeup=80% black, 19% white, and two mexican guys.
[Was there ever a time where you saw someone being treated unfairly or being taken advantage of because of race, age, ethnicity, etc? If you saw this, did you ever feel compelled to do something about it? Could you have done something about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxsz6?context=5)|The Housing Authority (CMHA) really treated these people like dog shit.  Most residents barely paid rent. Rent is paid on a sliding scale so some residents paid like 20 bucks a month but that might have been 50% of their net worth.  Anytime ANYTHING went wrong in their apartments (flooding, heat not working in the middle of winter, AC not working in older residents apts in the summer) residents had to wait until monday.  I did my best to hound them until they sent someone out.  Sending someone out meant paying overtime and they were too cheap for that.  Maybe three times they sent someone out in the year I was there.  I tried to help and have basic mechanical skills but I am limited in my abilities to help.
[So you saw a lot of misery. But with 150-200 people there, and you with a (remarkably) open compassionate attitude, I'm guessing you also saw some good people trying hard to make good lives. Can you recall some things that *pleasantly* surprised you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyc7q?context=5)|Oh yea there were plenty of people who just had slipped in life and they were working hard as fuck to make it back in their lives and when bad shit happened to them I just felt horrible because I knew they were working.  One big success story was that guy James who mopped the floors, he helped out anyway he could around the building.  Whenever pipes would burst he would be there to mop up the floor and put buckets down.  He would wash and wax floors. He got back on his feet. Got a job. And because of all of the work her put in around the building the building manager actually paid his rent for a year. I would say 2/3 of the residents were hard working people who either were injured or just kept fucking up and ended up there.
[What was the most dangerous situation you were put in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxt1v?context=5)|There were plenty of times I had to defend myself.  One time in particular a couple was walking into the lobby to go up to their apartment.  Another couple came up behind them (who did not live there) and tried to snatch the ladies purse and beat up the guy.  I hopped over the desk and had to ""L"" the one guy out until he agreed to leave.  I saw his lady Friend reach into her purse and pull out a knife at which point I let them go.  They left and I called the police.  I believe they were caught later.  I HATE bullies and to see that just pissed me off.
[What is ""L""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uymlg?context=5)|It is a choke hold.  Looks almost like a sleeper hold.  One arm goes across the throat and the other one behind the head.  It immediately shuts off the airway.
[""L""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uynmg?context=5)|Sorry it must be something we called it growing up.
[Kill niggers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzo1t?context=5)|The funny thing is, the couple who was doing the robbing was white..
[What? o.o.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyp06?context=5)|I explained it above, it was a chokehold. I am sure it has many names.

[What was the biggest moral decision you had to make there? and how great was the racial tension between you and the majority black population there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyb5t?context=5)|Moral decision....that is a tough one.  I would say always just trying to remain unbias no matter how shitty a particular resident had treated me.  I  was threatened pretty much on a weekly basis. I just brushed it off.  But the next week they would usually be apologetic (and sober) and would ask for some kind of help.  There wasn't too much racial tension. It wasn't like they hated me because I was white.  Once they got to know me and realized I had grown up in Baltimore and was not just some rich ohio state student they started to accept me. However I was called ""cracker"" and ""honky"" on a regular basis and I had to explain to them that this wasn't ""the jeffersons"" and those words dont sting anymore.
[What was the craziest thing you saw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxrxn?context=5)|There are a lot.  I wouldn't say this was the craziest.  I mentioned my craziest in a previous post.  A particular resident was really off the hook.  Let's call him E.  He was addicted to crack and would wander the streets all night and just steal from people (how this guy survived this is beyond me) but he would show up every night with a cart full of stolen goods/shit he found in the dumpster and try to sell it to me.  I started calling him Bubbles but he didnt get the reference. The craziest thing was probably this twenty something year old guy who had alot of women in and out of his apt.  One day during the day shift (I wasnt there but saw on camera later) a girl came and started arguing with him in the lobby.  He beat her within an inch of her life.  Closed fist punches and everything.  Once she was on the ground he booted her right in the jaw.  Teeth and blood were everywhere.  When I had gotten to work I noticed the stain and asked the working second shift what that was and he said it was the womans blood.
[""He just waltzes in there, and becomes the king of the carts. What the fuck does he think I'm supposed to do? ""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uy85j?context=5)|Yea man I am from Baltimore, so any chance I get to quote the wire. I take it.  I actually did a project at OSU which involved videos and references to The Wire...
[What is the story that you would most like to share with us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxwni?context=5)|There are plenty of stories.  There was alot of crazy stuff there.  I mentioned some already.  One story that comes to mind was with this resident nicknamed Frog.  He was hooked on crack.  Right before I left he got hooked on bath salts which is a rising craze among addicts because it doesnt show up on piss tests.  He attempted to commit suicide and almost jumped but the fire dept saved him.  While I was there two people jumped (1 survived).  Two guys died from medical reasons.  One guy died from going fishing on a boat while drunk as hell and falling in the water and did not know how to swim.  A lot of misery there.
[What do they do with bath salts and how does this get one high?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyt1r?context=5)|Haha I am still learning tryin to figure it out.  From what I have been told you snort em and it is just like a coke high.  I hope your not gonna go out and start snorting haha, shit will fuck you up.
[Was there a housing police force that policed the area?  If not, was it just the city police force?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxt6y?context=5)|Yea, they came by usually once a night.  But they were pretty much rent a cops even though one was cool and former Air Force.  They were not armed.  Pretty much stopped by every night around 2 AM to take a shit in the employee bathroom haha.
[&gt;One day the cop arrested CT for a humble.   Do you mean that the cop's intent was to humble CT, or is ""humble"" some kind of slang for an amount of drugs or something like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v1yc2?context=5)|Its slang, sorry its habit.  It means a minor misdemeanor charge (i.e. disturbing the peace etc.)
[What is the drug scene like in a project high-rise?  Is it run of the mill crack and impure heroin? Or since it's Ohio is meth a big deal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyv9y?context=5)|Not much meth.  Mostly crack and heroin. We had dealers come in and pay residents to move in with someone else so they could just set up shop in an apt and people would go right there.  They would usually last a couple of weeks and word would get out and they would either leave or be kicked out.  Like I said the police were useless. While I was working, there were two big drug guys everyone would go to for their shit.  One used to be a cat burglar who would pay hookers so he could go down on them (not the other way around haha), and the other was more of a stone cold dealer, never talking unless he needed too and people respected him.
[1) Did the residents ask you for money/handouts? 2) Did you ever give money to residents? 3) Ever get mugged/robbed or items stolen while on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uytbv?context=5)|1.)ALL THE TIME! haha.  every night it was ""hey john, you got a dolla?"" Usually people would come with four quarters and ask for a ""hard dollar"" because the dealers didn't like change 2.) No, I would sometimes give change for a dollar if i knew they were using it for laundry 3.) No but someone did put nails under my tires so that they would go flat.  One of them did, I was lucky all four didnt.  I was careful to keep all my stuff locked up and my car within sight in the parking lot.
[&gt;Hey john, you got a dolla](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v6av4?context=5)|I need dolla dolla....dolla is what I need.
[Did you ever have to take the witness stand in court for something that went down during your shift?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uy88q?context=5)|After that attempted robbery the columbus police took my info but I was never called.  The guy who was working during the beating of that woman was asked to be a witness but turned it down.  He was changing jobs soon and didnt want the hassle.
[Good luck, and congrats. My wife's an LISW, MSW, from OSU.  *edit* I had asked first if graduation was in June, then remembered OSU is switching to semesters, from quarters, and it all made sense. You going to go to grad school at OSU?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v23ey?context=5)|No. I am moving back to Baltimore and going to grad school at the University of Maryland. Not at OSU.  They are still on the quarter system so technically they have 3 or 4 graduations a year.  I planned it so I graduated this quarter so I can get a jump start on getting a job.
[This is off topic but I'm thinking about joining the military to help pay for college. Are you happy with your decision to do so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v1soh?context=5)|I do not regret the experience.  I do regret not being more prepared to handle my recruiters.  The GI Bill was def worth it but make sure when you go in you are doing what you want to do and not what your recruiter nudges you to do.  What branch are you considering?

[Were the police shown the video evidence? what did they say about it? What is the reasoning behind them not making an arrest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v7cqr?context=5)|Yes they were shown evidence...they said I detective would be along Monday to investigate further....no detective showed up....it happened multiple times.
[Jeez.  How many justified arrests were made while you worked there in comparison to all the crime that was going on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uz6j0?context=5)|Honestly, one.  A guy named E who I compared to Bubbles from ""The Wire"" was arrested one time for selling stolen goods.  It was some shameful shit. Cops were there almost every weekend but no arrests were ever made.
[Sounds weird.. but has someone ever died while you were working?  Natural or otherwise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyp6l?context=5)|Oh shit...I almost forgot.  This did happen.  I think my second month working there.  A woman came in looking for her brother.  I called up to his apt but there was no answer.  She said that no matter what he always had lunch with their brother every saturday and he had not shown up or answered his phone.  I got a sinking feeling when she said that. I called the police (this had to happen for me to go into someones apt without their permission) they came and I opened the door and saw this guy laying there.  He was dead and I had to go down there and console his sister and nephew.
[Oh man, that sucks for them.  You ever find out what it was from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzk25?context=5)|He had heart problems.  I asked around and people told me it was a heart attack but I never saw a medical report or anything.
[So what's the solution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uybei?context=5)|There is no solution really.  I could take it on a case by case basis but it is up to the people to want to change.  Believe it or not some people loved that existence and did nothing to better their situation no matter how much I tried to advocate for them.  They would just keep making excuses. It's sad really.
[If you had the capability, would you dust off and nuke the whole site from orbit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyojv?context=5)|No haha, although after some rough nights I wish I could.  I did joke that we should somehow get the drug dogs into the building for a surprise raid and I would sit outside in a lawn chair drinking beer and laugh at how many drugs are thrown out the windows..
[My dad worked at a liquor store across the street from the projects, he always had a gun on him, in plain sight did you do the same?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uygad?context=5)|No I never carried a gun.  I am pretty good with my hands (boxing, wrestling etc.).  I know the corner store workers by the projects here had a gun.  A guy came back pissed off because the store owners pulled the gun on him for apparently no reason.  I didnt believe the guy at first but I could see how distraught he was.  I felt bad for him.
[Which do you think comes first; homelessness or addiction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyvkj?context=5)|Addiction definately.  Most of the residents were referred there from a local shelter called the faith mission.  None of the ones I talked to that used to be homeless were clean while they were homeless.
[Sorry, read through a little bit more and wanted to ask another question.  You're from Baltimore, where the drug trade and problems with the city was much publicized by The Wire (and David Simon in general).  Then, you worked in Columbus, which I think most people would be surprised had a ghetto at all.  Anyway, do you think the publicity of Baltimore's inner city helped it?  Does Columbus struggle to get help/resources because of an out of sight/out of mind mentality?  Or, do you think it has no effect at all?  Lastly, I'm assuming you're white because of your white flight comment.  Did race play any role in how the tenants treated you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v9hk0?context=5)|The only thing ""the wire"" helped was to open up people's eyes to a society they had no idea was 10 mins away from their fed hill rowhome.  I have not seen any reform or resources thrown to the west side of Baltimore since the wire came on the air although the ports which were focused on in season 2 seem to be doing a little better. Columbus's west side has its own reputation which is very well known.  Politicians know about it.  However right now it is going through a gentrification process.  A casino is being built and I believe 2 public housing complexes have been destroyed (dont quote me on that figure, I know of one for sure Riverside Bradley).  The projects that I worked in are scheduled for demolition but the date keeps getting pushed back so who knows.  Some resources such as section 8 housing vouchers are being thrown their way but besides that there is a long way to go.  FInally race did play a big role at first and in time that dwindled.  At first they assumed I was a cop because I was white, and then people took a long time to warm up to me which I expected.  After they realized I was not just some rich Ohio State University kid whose mommy and daddy paid for everything they warmed up to me pretty quick.  I said before that racial terms like Honky and Cracker and Whiteboy were thrown around but they never affected me.
[So, I notice a lot of negative questions, which is normal, but as someone who spent  years living in and around the projects I always was impressed by the underground economics of the place.  The residents are seriously very ingenuitive and find interesting ways to make money (fixing things that are FUBAR, getting ppl. free cable, making homemade meals for lunch etc...).  What are some interesting ways you saw people making money?  Also, as far as gangs go, did you notice the gangs and other organizations helping to police the community, or in your eyes were just making everything worse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v9dd6?context=5)|Oh many the economy of the projects was amazing.  You nailed it.  People would make money doing anything.  Some people would clean your apartment.  There was one guy who would fix your car, another who would wash it.  Women would do your hair.  One sign I saw hung up offered to actually bathe people (this included a foot scrub and cleaning behind the neck haha).  There was always a way for people to make money. As far as gangs go, there was not too much activity in the actual project.  Dealers were there, however gangs were not their muscle at least in the building.  In the surrounding communities they were active.  However the dealers did try to help the residents.  They bought a TV for the lounge area, they would order the boxing fights and throw parties, and they would order pizza for random people and sometimes even pay peoples rent.  However if you got in debt to the dealers you better believe you would do your damndest to pay them back.  As long as you were on their good side you were fine.  However, I have digressed.  To your question of self policing, most of the time this is what happened.  People would fuck up and others would either help or punish whoever was involved.  Police were called quite often but it was mostly for minor squabbles. I hope I answered your question.
[Did any of the statues or props in the inner city houses come to life overnight?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzfq6?context=5)|Naaa I dont think the golden tablet was there...probably stolen by one of the fiends and pawned.
[To my knowledge there is really only one true high rise projects in Columbus, by osu east? Is this where you worked?  Assuming you went to osu, how would you compare where you worked to the section 8 around campus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v1cg3?context=5)|The one I worked at u can see it from 315. It is called sunshine terrace. I'm not sure if there are others..its on the westside by mt carmel west. I did not hang out too much by the on campus housing I live up in Dublin. So I can't compare.
[Also a question. ive done work with at-risk kids in these kinds of projects.   Are there any programs in place by you to help keep the kids off the streets, and out of the whole poverty cycle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzhoi?context=5)|There were not any kids in these projects except for maybe those that visited on weekends.  We had one little guy call 911 and hang up in the lobby and all kids of cops and fire engines showed up.  I do work with at risk youth at my internship and there are alot of programs to help them get off the streets.  Two are LiFE Sports and Camp Mary Orton's Wilderness bond program.  Both can be found online..
[Why is it relevant that you're white?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v4w1e?context=5)|Its not.  I was just putting it in the title to get people's attention...it worked.

[Why did you feel the need to call out that you are white?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v18kz?context=5)|Gotta be honest on this one.  It was kind of a big deal with people around here knowing that I was a white guy working in a predominately black housing project.  I could care less either way but it was just habit I suppose..

q627d,3,2012-02-25,The pain of an EET major.,ChristianCMcKay,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/q627d/the_pain_of_an_eet_major/,"A few months back I got my AA in Electronics Engineering Tech.  I'm currently working on a 4 year, but just because I know I'll need experience, I start looking for jobs.  Hoping to get something in my field with an employer who would understand that I'm in college and will have to have my school hours off.  That would be kind of nice.  I could get some experience and make some money doing something in my field.

I start looking online to see what I can find in the area.  Nothing.  No job for 50 miles.  I finally think to myself, ""kinda sucks, man.  Maybe I can find some kind of paid internship or something then.""  After a few days of searching for that, I find nothing.  No paid internships.  No unpaid internships for a 100 mile radius of my area, not that I could drive that much in my car anyway.  It's old and the engine has to be at 4,000 RPM's to do 70.  Not the best of ideas in a 23 year old car with over 200,000 miles on it.

So as if that's not enough, lets get on to actual school.  At my old school, the EET program was so heavily underbudgeted that my first semester there, I had to fix the trainers.  Not to mention that the program turned out to be such a joke that there were people graduating that didn't understand how to wire up potentiometers.  Not through fault of the teachers, either.  Every time some kid ends up not knowing anything and fails a test, he goes and bitches to the dean of students who was more than happy to talk the teachers into giving away passing grades.  I did alright in the program though.  Friends with the teachers there.  I was a TA for one of them.  He retired after having been a control engineer for almost his whole life, and is the reason I want to go into control engineering.  However at this point, it's starting to look like just anything in the field will be a godsend.

That being said though, there were certain things I didn't learn at this school, not because I couldn't, but because it wasn't taught due to the incredibly low bar.  Things that I didn't know I needed to know.  Now that I'm in a university, the bar has been raised significantly, and I'm trying to catch up.  That's okay though.  I'm going to be okay there.  It's just a tough catching up process.

So I'm in school, looking to make some money and my options have been reduced to unpaid internship when I left off.  It's not making money but at least it will get me that pesky experience thing that all employers keep asking for on entry level jobs.  It's an investment.  Well I can't get it still.  There's not one.  So what are my options down to?  I applied to work at Autozone yesterday.  The same job I applied for in high school.  I also looked into TA jobs for first and second year EET courses since I had already done that and was damn good at it, but the only way anyone knows to contact the guy in charge of that is on e-mail and he never answered mine.  I could go flip burgers, but it kind of stings to know that I graduated college having been on the Deans list 3 of 5 semesters and used what I learned to work in food service.

And who do you talk to about feeling that way?  My dad things I shouldn't even bother working because it will take away a lot of time from school.  My mom won't talk to me because she's afraid I'm going to ask for money to pay for school.  My girlfriend works two jobs and is in college.  She works harder than anyone I know and whenever I try to talk about it to her she takes it to mean that I'm insulting what she does and how much she gets paid, which I'm not.  Society has started their deal about how even as a college graduate, you shouldn't feel like you're too good to flip burgers.  I hate to say this too, because it makes me feel pretentious, but I do feel like I'm too good to flip burgers.  I have a skill that I worked really hard to learn and spent the last few years of my life trying to be great at.  I was always told I had to go to college to avoid this exact thing.

So who do I talk to about my problems?  I talk to you, Reddit.  Out of everything else in my life, writing these rants about my life and what a waste it seems to have been up until this point gives me my only serenity.  Thank you for listening.


**Tl;Dr** I feel like my AA degree isn't worth the paper it was printed on, and I'm ranting.  Reddit is the only place I can do it."
q8uqd,11,2012-02-27,Breaking into the ECE field,unspokenToken,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/q8uqd/breaking_into_the_ece_field/,"I hope this is an appropriate subreddit for this kind of question. I am graduating soon with a degree in Computer (and Electrical) Engineering from a Candian University. I have no real internship experience and have worked as a programmer for the past few summers. I really want a career in embedded systems development, so for the past two years I have been playing with micro controllers in my spare time.  Unfortunately, I can not find any work in the field of ECE, and out of desperation I have accepted a job as a Java developer for a small software company. 

After the initial relief of getting a job, I realized that my engineering career just went down the drain. Might as well burn my degree and melt my iron ring. My friends have tried to comfort me by saying that ``experience is experience'', but I'm not convinced. Do I need to look into going back to school? I can't find a grad program that I think will benefit me. In the opinion of an experienced embedded engineer, would you consider hiring someone with a B.S. in ECE (with some spare-time projects) and a few years of on-the job experience in Java programming (sigh). I've heard that the US is the mecca for Electrical Engineers; Should I look into moving to the US? Would an M.S. from a US University help?

tl;dr: Got degree in ECE. Good GPA, extra-curriculars. Can't find job in ECE. Accepted job as a Java developer, but really want to work in embedded systems."

 - I have done some programming in C++ for a couple classes, as well as HTML and JavaScript just for fun in my high school days. I wouldn't say I'm an expert coder by any means but I am comfortable with programming. I've always generally been glued to a computer so I know my way around them and I can easily figure out anything I don't know.
 - I've worked on several class teams ranging in number from two to six people and in purpose from weekly laboratory experiments to semester-long projects. I get along well with people and have plenty of experience putting together technical reports.

I have been employed at a sports and fitness facility as a lifeguard since 2005, and was promoted to pool manager in 2010. 

My main responsibilities are to maintain proper water balance in the pools and spa and to ensure a safe environment through consistent enforcement of rules and timely and effective response to emergencies. 

I also supervise an average of 10 lifeguards, customer service representatives and maintenance staff.
The pool sees a lot of traffic and I interact with people of all ages and from a wide variety of backgrounds.

I'm not exactly sure what I want to do in the engineering world, but I am generally more interested in testing and evaluation (or research), product development and possibly maintenance roles. I am, however, certainly open to other possibilities. I am generally introspective which lends to strong analytical and evaluation skills as well as creative problem solving and a penchant for seeing the ""big picture."" 

I'd prefer to stay within about an hour from the Baltimore area."

I guess this will be the first post on here, so wish me luck!

I am currently in my 3rd year studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at CU Boulder.

I am very excited to be looking for an internship for this summer.  I currently live in Boulder, but my lease is up in May, so I am completely free to move. In fact, I love to travel, and I have never lived anywhere outside of Colorado so the prospect of moving out of state for an internship is actually quite exciting. 

Anyway, I am looking for hardware or software internships. I have experience in C/C++, Java, Android, Arduino, Nios II, ARM M0, and soon a bit of MIPS.  

I am confident using MatLab, Mathematica, LTSpice, SolidWorks, Emacs, and Eclipse.

By may, I will also have completed all my required analog analysis and design classes including microelectronics.

I am currently enrolled in a digital design lab in which we are linking the ARM M0 board to an Android app via Bluetooth and I have been enjoying it greatly. This tells me that embedded design might be my specific area of interest.

Other than engineering, I love music passionately. It would be amazing to get work in digital audio systems, although I do not really know where to look.  I love to ski, bike, and read books. Pretty standard Colorado behavior I suppose.

I would love to find a company that values creativity and passion, as I think they are my strongest traits. I really do love working with technology, and I think there is a beauty well designed tech.  I am hoping to find a place where I can help create something I am really proud of. 

If I sound like I might be a good fit. Please PM me for Resume, Cover Letter, References, etc... and I will surely provide in a timely manner. 

Hope to hear from you, and thank you for your time!

q87i1,11,2012-02-27,"My mom is diagnosed with severe depression, what can I do to help her?",blackhawknl,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q87i1/my_mom_is_diagnosed_with_severe_depression_what/,"So my mom is diagnosed with depression she got from a burnout working at a doctors clinic as an assistant. She's been walking around with it for the last 5 years and went trough therapy, medication and the like. 

At the moment she receives Electro Shock Therapy. This means that she has to go under treatment twice a week, where they apply little pads or something (don't know how to call it in English) to her head and shock her brain whilst under narcosis. 

This treatment has severe side effects to her brain meaning that her short term memory is totally gone. Dory from Finding Nemo describes the current situaton the best and I'm not kidding. She asked me 3 times in the time span of 5 minutes if I liked my current internship at the IT company. And everytime when she comes home from the hospital it's always the same. She will tell me what she ate whilst in the hospital and that the staff there is very nice to her and so on...


My question is as follows: What can I do to help my mother deal with this, or to improve her recovery?


I try to help her with this situation by being very tolerant of the things she says and does. Doing my chores, talking with her and trying to get her to open up. She is very introvert with her feelings because she thinks people won't understand the things she is going through right now. This also presents a problem for the people working at the hospital. She has to mention when she's feeling down or insecure so that they can help her and monitor her progress.

But my dad is a different story. He's not the best at dealing with things like this so he is always joking about how she forgets stuff and impersonates her when we're eating dinner etc.

I think my dad isn't making things better for my mom as she is already having a very hard time dealing with this depression. I feel my dad is actually making it worse for my mom.

Can anyone here on reddit, who may have been through the same problems with a relative or a close friend, help me and my mom getting through hers?

**Edit:**
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Thanks for all the kind answers my fellow redditors. I really appreciate all the help i've gotten so far.
Just to clarify things, my mother does not have suicidal tendencies. The main thing here is that she is extremely occupied by thoughts and such. She has become very introvert and sees going to the supermarket or gas station to get cigarettes as an enormous task. Same thing for going to church. Everything she has to do besides staying indoor is seen as a task. She is affraid to run into fermiliar people, having to explain them how she is doing and the like.

Also, my mother ""hurts"" herself unknowingly. To be more precise, my mother used to pick the rims of her fingernails. I don't know how to properly explain that but in stead of biting nails, she bites her fingernail-rims. (I also have this tick). But ever since she was depressed, she started to rub her thumb on her lower arm, producing rug burn marks on her arm. Because of this, she became even more insecure because she doesn't want people to see this and think: ""Oh wow that's weird!"" or something like that. Even to the medical staff that have seen this sort of thing many times. We tell her to stop when she is scratching or rubbing her arm again, but since she has very short/no short memory at all, it doesn't stick. She won't listen or remember.

If there are any questions, or you want me to clarify things, please comment and I will try my best to explain.

Thanks again reddit!"
q7w1j,0,2012-02-27,My boyfriend just broke up with me via text at midnight on the eve of a series of stressful events. What's one of the most inconvenient break ups you have been through?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q7w1j/my_boyfriend_just_broke_up_with_me_via_text_at/,"I'm sure this has done a million times, but I just needed to vent. I have been stressed out for a matter of months because of a series of major events in my life. Focusing that down to the past three, my grandmother just passed away in January and I wasn't able to spend much time with her before she died. I was busy working a full time job, going to school full time, and participating in an internship that had the promise of becoming a full time job. 

I've been dating my boyfriend since the middle of November. He is my coworker and I was hesitant to start a relationship with him for a myriad of reasons. We finally decided to be serious after about a month or so of fooling around and having fun. I haven't had more than a day off from work, my school, and my internship in over two and a half months. I haven't had more than two days off of work or school in about a year. I am wearing a little thin. 

This quarter also just happens to be one of the hardest quarters in school that I have ever had. For one class alone I have had two to three projects due a week. I am a graphic design student so this means full fledged projects with design briefs, concept sketches, digital roughs, the works. I ended up dropping a class and turning my internship into a class just to make things more bearable for myself.

ALL of my free time that wasn't spent doing homework I spent with my SO. I would stay late at work to spend time with him on his shift and get four or five hours of sleep just so that we could spend some quality time together. 

Three weeks ago I got offered a full time position at my internship. Two weeks ago I put in my two weeks notice at my current job. Last week for no reason at all, my boyfriend decided he wanted to take two days extra off this week because he felt like it. This ended up screwing up my schedule for my last week of work and messing up my schedule with my NEW job, because I didn't realize they would schedule me for as many shifts as they did. 

We got into our VERY FIRST fight about this on Saturday when I saw the schedule. I told him I was mad and he didn't understand why. I explained it to him and he didn't really say sorry. Then out of nowhere, he texts me tonight to tell me that he thinks I am a very pessimistic person and that I'm too emotional for him. I tell him that if he feels that way, maybe we shouldn't be together and he responds with, ""Well, if you think that's for the best""

So he broke up with me in the middle of the night, while I was working on a homework assignment for school. I also have to be at my internship at 9AM tomorrow morning and the class that my assignment is due for is tomorrow night at 5:45. I have several other huge projects coming up right now, my best friend is leaving the country for two years in two weeks and that friend also happens to be my room mate and I need to find a new place to live by the end of the month. Not to mention the fact that I still have two more days of work left at the place where my now exboyfriend works. I do not want to have to see him both of these days (and I will have to see him). This couldn't be a more inconvenient time to break my heart and trust in men. The assfucker.

TL;DR: My life is like a damn country song. Boyfriend breaks up with me, grandma dies, best friend leaves the country, have to move, and have to see boyfriend at work since he's a coworker.

So tell me Redditors, what's the most inconvenient break up you've ever been through? "

Summer 2009 - internship at unrelated company
Summer 2010 - internship with ABC co (they offered me a FT job starting Sep 2011)
1st part of 2011 - temporary job at unrelated company to hold me over until Sep 2011
Sept 2011 - current - job with ABC co

I liked my internship with ""ABC"", but I've since learned that I don't want to do consulting work. Too much stress, traveling, long hours, etc. Honestly, I'm pretty burned out by the job and the fact that I have no social life because I'm always working 50-80 hours a week.

I've started looking at opportunities elsewhere, but I am afraid that having 4 different positions in 3 years might make people think I am a job hopper when they're skimming my resume. It may look like it on the surface, but when you look at the details, 2 were internships, one of which lead to my current position, and 1 was a temporary job I was doing until the F/T offer became effective. How should I outline my job history so that I don't scare recruiters away?"

I have a few options right now:

A) Graduate in May with my MechE Bachelors and go work where I interned, doing aerospace interiors (seats, lavs, etc.) Not really my area of interest at all but it is aerospace related, so maybe experience there would transfer?

B) Graduate in May and continue my job search with my experience as is, while living at home....really not hoping for this one. I've put in a ton of applications, gotten one interview which went well, but they only had one position, so I am in limbo, not rejected, but no positions to put me in. I had another interview that I am still waiting to hear from, all this from over 50 online applications.

C) Not graduate in May and spend the summer and fall finishing up the 24 or so credits for my Masters in engineering. Then find a job from there, hoping that the Masters + Bachelors + experience will push me higher up on the list for many of the jobs I am applying to.

All of this needs to be decided in the next two weeks or so. I would love to hear from anyone in the industry as to what they think might be the best course of action. One thing I kind of wrote off was applying outside of the industry, as I am very set on working in aerospace but if its a viable option to later then come back in I could look into that. All in all... having a tough time finding an aerospace job, and not sure which direction is best for my future.

q9u21,4,2012-02-28,Do people think its fair that while the law has been followed my girlfriend and I just had our holiday completely fucked?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q9u21/do_people_think_its_fair_that_while_the_law_has/,"Here's the story. We were due to have a holiday at the Mantra Erskine Resort in Lorne (We're Australians, Lorne is a few hours drive from Melbourne) and we had a room booked for this weekend. We had been assured over a month ago when my girlfriend booked it that everything was fine. Today rocks around and at 5:00pm the hotel rings us up and tells us they had an ""IT problem"" and that the whole place has been double booked.

Now I should be fair. They did offer us a stay in another resort about an hours drive from where we had originally planned to stay. However we had planned other things in Lorne, including a massage for my girlfriend which was part of the deal with the room we had booked. However because this was booked with another company, in order to get this massage we'd have to drive for an hour just to attend the massage, and then drive back. 

They then offered a refund, as required by law but nothing else was offered. I understand that monetarily we haven't lost anything here. However, we now have no holiday destination and everywhere we look is either completely booked or far too expensive. We both have started back at University now and will not get any time off probably for another year as I will be most likely be busy throughout the middle of the year and my girlfriend has another internship planned for the same time. 

I know its very much a first world problem but we're both feeling pretty shit, especially her as she's just been completing an internship in which she has not enjoyed very much and this was going to be her reward for sticking with it.

&gt;November 04, 2007

&gt;Unpaid Internships - Common but Illegal

&gt;A common, but frequently unreported labor violation is the use of unpaid interns in violation of minimum wage and possibly overtime laws.  The scenario is fairly typical: a company offers an opportunity to ‘break into the business’ in exchange for the intern working for free.  You see many examples of this in the entertainment industry.  In fact, despite jobs sites such as Craigslist prohibiting the posting of unpaid “internships,” you can almost always find one posted.  Some companies try to get around the law by requiring that the internship be part of a college program.  However, there is no exception to the law allowed just because the “intern” may receive college credit.  While it might be possible for a college credit course to require some type of training for a company, the vast majority of these internships are in violation of Federal as well as California labor laws.
&gt;
&gt;In order to qualify as an unpaid internship, the requirement is simple:  no work can be performed that is of any benefit at all to the company.  That is, you can not deliver mail, sort files, file papers, organize a person’s calendar, conduct market research, write reports, watch television shows and report on them, read scripts, schedule interviews, or any other job that assists the employer in any way in running their business.   
&gt;
&gt;Examples of internships that have been legal are where the job is a “dummy” job.  For example, there was a case of an internship for working on a train.  The company had the interns driving trains from one end of their yard to the other under close supervision.  The moving of the trains was completely unnecessary and was just being done to train the potential employees. As such, no “work” was being performed, so the internship was legal.  On the other hand, if the workers were moving the trains as part of the regular re-positioning of the trains, but were still performing it under close supervision, they would be required to be paid for the work.
&gt;
&gt;Thus, if in the entertainment industry, you read scripts that have already been read and rejected by the company and the company will not use your input in any way but is simply instructing you on how to read scripts, then they would not need to pay you for your time.  However, if you read the scripts and perform any work that is used by anyone in the company to make any type of decision about that script, then you must be paid for your time.
&gt;
&gt;Another common type of unpaid internship is in martial arts schools that require students to teach classes in order to receive additional belts.  This practice is illegal unless the student is paid for the time.  Because the act of teaching a class is work that benefits the employer, it must be paid for.   
&gt;
&gt;The U.S. Department of Labor has outlined a list of criteria that ALL must be met in order for an internship to be unpaid.
&gt;
&gt; 1. The training, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to that which would be given in a vocational school;
&gt; 2. The training is for the benefit of the trainee;
&gt; 3. The trainees do not displace regular employees, but work under close observation;
&gt; 4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the trainees and on occasion the employer’s operations may actually be impeded;
&gt; 5. The trainees are not necessarily entitled to a job at the completion of the training period; and
&gt; 6. The employer and the trainee understand that the trainees are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training. 
&gt;
&gt;From the above list, #4 is really the key one – all the others will follow from whether the employer derives any immediate benefit from the activities.
&gt;
&gt;The main reason that you do not see more lawsuits regarding unpaid internships is that the interns are very unlikely to sue.  In most cases, they fear being blacklisted, as they will undoubtedly need to use the internship as a reference to get any future work.
&gt;
&gt;This is where California’s Private Attorney General Act comes in.  Because this law allows anyone at the company to sue for labor violations, even if they themselves are not affected by the violation, it is now possible for these companies to be brought into compliance with the law.  If you work for a company that uses unpaid interns and would like to put an end to this illegal practice, you should consider bringing a Private Attorney General cause of action.
&gt;
&gt;Of course, if the internship is work, not only minimum wage must be paid, but also California overtime (8 in a day / 40 in a week) as well as meal and rest breaks."

I personally believe that I'm fast at learning computer languages, from my experience, and good at self-teaching myself things. I don't make it to class very often as a MechE student due to unrelated reasons, but have self-taught most of the material and am passing all of my classes. 
Anyway, the internship was offered by a family friend, and I'm assuming it's related to Intel. I asked him for more job specifications, and this is what he replied:

**A Strong knowledge of the Microsoft .NET framework: VB.Net, .NET Framework Class Library**

**Object: oriented programming, Classes, encapsulation, data abstraction and abstract data types, DLL, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Exception Handling, Files and Streams, Regular Expressions, GUI, GDI+, Multithreading, Binary and/or Hexadecimal, Data Structures, Arrays, and Software Debugging**

**Experienced or Familiar with Electronic Signals: Software DSP, Electronic theory, Understanding of Digital Storage Oscilloscopes, Knowledge of PC architecture**

Please let me know if it's possible to learn all this stuff! At least a basic knowledge, where I won't feel overwhelmed by everything going on. I have until early June to learn everything, and can probably allocate between 3-6 hours a week on learning programming. Thanks guys! Let me know if I should post this in any other subreddits as well.

**tl;dr: I got offered an internship, but only have some basic MATLAB programming experience.**"
