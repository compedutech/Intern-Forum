Besides that I have been working two years on campus as tech support in a team of 12 for the college and surrounding farms and extension centers. When I mention this to recruiters though I usually get shot down with a ""We want to see more extracurriculars and different experiences. "" I really haven't had time for clubs and stuff since I spend most of my time working and studying. I thought the job experience would get me a good head start though. Right now I am taking summer classes and doing some Security/Pentest experience on my own.

I am currently working in a customer service role to pay the bills and would like to work for a start up company which is offering an internship (paid through monthly honorarium) with applications due June 30th. I do not meet all of their qualifications such as ""two years of professional writing or equivalent"" but I feel that my writing is strong enough to overcome this barrier as is reflected by my work throughout the years. 

I submitted two pieces of work which I custom created for them but I feel that my application would be bolstered if I was able to work for them for free. I feel this internship would be incredible experience and I want it badly.  So I'm curious, what do you guys think is the way for me to approach the company and ask them this? Should I just call them and present my ""work for free,"" proposal after waiting a week or two to see if I get an interview? Should I email? 

Please help. Thank you. "

Really need your advice",lantom,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/381e1k/female_se_getting_really_frustrated_at_work_some/,"Second company I've worked for, been here ~1 year. I was able to tell myself 'not every place is like this' last time, but now that it seems to be following the same pattern, I find myself really frustrated and am hoping to get some advice.

Problem is, people *assume* you have no idea what you're doing, until you prove them wrong. (i.e. it's a high priority feature. we're going to let Matt handle this.)

And then even after that, if I happen to do something faster/cleaner than someone, the reply I often get is something along the lines of 'wow you did it faster. I must have really fucked up.'

There's another experienced (female) SE who's really good at what she does, and I've noticed that people are condescending
 towards her sometimes too.. (mocking her for little things)

Anyway, I was usually one of the stronger programmers in my classes and at my internships, so I think I have the skills to do well. Problem is, there's always some indignation and resentment if I happen to do something faster or correct someone. There have been several cases where they were wrong, and I said something (in the gentlest manner possible, because I should know that by now), and still, they get pissed off.

So the question is, how do I get past that people who don't know me immediately assume I don't know what I'm doing, and how do I be a strong performer without coworkers getting pissed off?

Edit: for clarity, 'Matt' joined around the same time (a month later than I did), but there was more confidence in him and other guys who started around the same time

381j6c,2,2015-06-01,Got dismissed from college after my first year. Waiting for reply to appeal. Next steps?,collegebootedme,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/381j6c/got_dismissed_from_college_after_my_first_year/,"I had a 1.9 GPA both semesters, and I'm beating myself up thinking about how getting a slightly higher grade in two classes could have kept me there. 

I sent an appeal letter a few days ago. To summarize, I was in a manipulative relationship most of the year, my family was going through getting my brother off drugs and keeping him from failing all his classes, I have family history of social anxiety and my dorm environment wasn't effective for being studios. Obviously I didn't blame my failures on these entirely, I take some blame too. 

I also pointed to my success in a campus campaign, all my past jobs, my high schools and my current internship to show that I was capable of what's being asked of me. 

My solutions are mostly to start going to counseling services, communicate my problem areas to all my teachers, and to use time between classes to do work (versus going to my dorm, I wouldn't live on campus so this isn't an option anymore.)

I have not told a single soul. I'm very embarrassed. This is not like me at all, and I'm not the type to admit I need help. 

I would rather not tell my parents until I get a decision back, because what my brother is dealing with right now is exponentially more stressful, and I want to know my plans before I make them worry about me too. 

What I'm wondering is: 

Would you think they would let me stay given my circumstances? 

This college is far from home, and my sister and I have already got an apartment from next year. Rent is too high for only one of us to live there. Is it reasonable to ask my parents to support me financially partially if I do not go to school, and work full time instead? 

When should I tell my parents? 

Thank you. "

Disclaimer: Sorry if I ask questions that have popped up already; I need answers to some more personalized questions.

I'm pretty new to this subreddit -- I stumbled upon it over at r/compsci and I can't believe how practical it is. Anyways, it's pretty simple. I'm planning on majoring in computer science at Vanderbilt University over in Nashville, and I want to make sure I'm taking all the right steps in order to eventually have a successful career in the cs field. What can I do regarding the following areas in order to be in good shape?

* Internships -- I'm planning to snag one summer after freshman year; does anyone know a relatively good starting company around the Nashville area/in general? Also, how are interns usually treated? I feel like I won't be able to contribute much but I'm a fast learner.
* Languages -- Right now, I only know a little bit of Python, HTML, CSS, and PHP. What are the most important languages to study so I can get a head start on them?
* Software engineering is my end goal. Glassdoor displays the national average salary for software engineers to be $90k. Is this really accurate? I see people on this subreddit working for $50-70k (even the ones not fresh out of college). 
* Side projects -- is it feasible to have enough free time to work on side projects? (On a related note: do employers care if you work on a personal project at work if you're ""caught up""/does this happen often?)
* Education -- What courses should I concentrate and focus on that will dominate most cs/se jobs? Database structures/algorithms/higher math? Is a bachelor's enough to enter the workforce? I don't really want to pursue a master's but should I? On another note, I plan to one day have a business -- should I get an MBA to make that easier?
* Work -- I've heard that software engineers usually lack a social lifestyle and are uptight... do you see this around your work? What I mean is, do people know how to relax, grab a beer, hang outside of work, etc? On a completely different note, how hard is it to ""rank up"" in the ladder? (Employee -&gt; Manager)

Thank you guys. Any other tips in general will help greatly.

I'm a recently hired IT intern at a popular website at their HQ in New York. I'm gonna be a junior in college soon and I'm a consultant in training at my school's IT office. I'm very happy with my prospects but I have to admit that I don't really feel challenged or like I'm learning much; most of my job has just been Mac OS imaging and helping people set up computers. I'm a new hire and after speaking to my managers they basically told me to not expect to work too much or hard considering my not-so-stellar, but average pay. I always ask if there's any more stuff around that I could help with but my manager never has much lined up for me, even after asking for any additional tasks. My main gripe is that I feel like I have way too much downtime which I spend browsing reddit and doing other stuff whenever I'm done with any work that needs to be done. 

I guess what I'm asking for is if there's anything you guys can recommend I should study or familiarize myself with when I'm just sitting around on the computer, cause that's pretty much 80% of my job. I'm pursuing a CCNA cert but I would like to learn additional stuff. Is there something like a Code Academy version of IT stuff? I'm very lacking in coding knowledge and experience and have always assumed that those topics were more suited towards CS."
383a3e,158,2015-06-01,"Did any of you ever watch the show ""Dr Melvin's Advice""?",Domthecreator14,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/383a3e/did_any_of_you_ever_watch_the_show_dr_melvins/,"I know, you might be thinking ""great another scary story about an old show."" But please listen, I need to tell somebody else about this. 

"" Dr. Melvin's Advice"" was a show that ran from 1995-1997 on public access. This show was on the public access channel for the following cities: Syracuse NY, Buffalo NY, Tampa FL, Orlando FL, Allentown PA, Lowell MA, Phoenix AZ, and Boulder CO. 

This show was about a doctor, Dr Melvin, giving children everyday health and safety tips in the form of skits. I watched the show as a kid and I used to think he dressed funny. He was very Patch Adams-esque. He had long brown hair, looked like he was in his early 30's, very tall, built more like a linebacker than a doctor, he was pretty tan, but his most striking quality was his voice, he was so soft spoken. Anyways, his show was very reliant on the children that appeared on his show since they were the bulk of the cast. There were only two ""constant"" adult cast members: Dr Melvin, and his male nurse, Carson. Carson always weirded me out as a kid, he was a nearly overweight man in his early 20's, he was pale, bald, had icy blue eyes, and his voice was very raspy compared to Melvin's. Carson also wore a more ""traditional"" medical outfit in contrast to Melvin's more ""fun"" doctor's outfit. 

I remember one of the last episodes. I was 4, it was mid October 1997. It was Dr Melvin's annual Halloween show. I was able to watch this episode after I contacted the studio that produced the episodes (I'll get to that later). 

The first skit featured Melvin and Carson going through a haunted house. Melvin would jump at every little scare, while Carson had a blank look on his face. They came to a carnival themed section and found a boy in tears, lying on his side. 

""If you go through a spook house and get too scared, do what this boy is doing. Find a place away from the people walking by, curl into a ball, and yell for help. A worker is bound to help you."" 

But after Dr Melvin finished his speech, the music in the scene got very loud. Then, a clown would come from behind a flap behind the crying boy, and he would scare him, causing the little boy to cry and scream louder each time. All while Melvin and Carson sat there, watching, the boy looked genuinely terrified. This happened twice before the scene switched to an unmasked clown patting the boy on the back and leading him towards an exit. 

The second scene started with Melvin and Carson walking down a sidewalk at night while kids in costumes ran around them. 

""There are lots of dangers on Halloween. One big one is that there are some people that may want to take you. They view you as a prize so they'll try to snatch you right up. If someone you don't know is trying to get you to go somewhere alone, find the nearest adult or yell for help. But if someone decides to take the prize for themselves, then you'll need to fight for your life. Claw, kick, punch, and when you are able to, scream the word 'fire' as loud as you can. Do anything to get away."" 

The scene switched to a little girl (about 12) in a witches costume walking down the street. Behind her, a blue windowless van quickly pulled up. What struck me as weird was that the van had cloth over it's license plate. Why would a van need one if they were just filming for the show? But anyways, the back door slid open, a very skinny man with incredibly large hands jumped from the van and on top of the girl. The girl began screaming and was pulling on the man's werewolf mask. He was grabbing her waist, trying to throw her into the van, but the girl threw a kick right into the guy's balls. He fell to his knees and the little girl sprinted away. Then, a man from off camera sprinted into view, he ran right at the man in the mask and threw a kick. But the camera began shaking and it cut to black before I saw anything connect. That scene was so intense. 

The third and final scene took place inside a kitchen. Dr Melvin sat at a breakfast bar while Carson was holding a pixie stick. He was wearing a classic ""dad sweater"". 

""Kids, you may have heard that some strangers want to ruin Halloween by giving poisoned candy to kids like you. But this is very untrue. The only poisoned candy given out has been from the victim's own parents. So don't show your parents this part."" 

The scene stayed with Melvin as he went over how to tell the difference between actually sealed and re-sealed candy for various types. After all of that, the scene switched to Carson pouring something from a vial  into the pixie stick, and him giving it to a young boy (about 9). The scene switched again to Carson tightly holding the same boy as he began to convulse and fake foam came from his mouth. This was the first time I saw Carson smile through out the whole episode. 

So there you have it, my favorite episode. So now do you remember Dr Melvin? Well if you do, then I'm about to ruin your childhood. A lot of people may know Melvin and Carson by different names: the Dream killers  of Orlando. Yes, ""Dr Melvin"" and ""Carson"" (real names: Frank Jackson &amp; Harold Preston respectively) murdered 11 children and 3 parents through out the whole time that ""Dr Melvin's advice"" was being filmed. How did I learn all of this? I'm an intern reporter, and my final report is a piece on something that affected our childhood! 

But to truly understand what these children went through, you need to know how they got their victims. ""Dr Melvin's Advice"" got their child actors through their newsletter (which I subscribed to). Every week, three subscribers would be picked to be the main stars in an episode. The children would be flown to Orlando (where the show was filmed), they would film, and then they would be brought to one of the many theme parks by the crew. Now there were over 45 ""main"" children, but only 11 killed right? What made them so special? Well all 11 of those children and the 3 parents were from either the Tampa or Orlando area. Frank and Harold did this so their deaths wouldn't be as suspicious compared to the children from other states. Plus, the killings would rarely take place near the set, but other places in Florida. BUT their ""signature"" was very closely related to their show. In fact, many of the more fatal injuries/situations on the show were pretty much re-enactments of their crimes! The ""dream killers"" would kill their victims, make it look like an accident, and replay the event on their show. They were sick fucking people. 

So how exactly did they get caught? Well, the same reason the 1997 Halloween special was one of the last episodes. The girl from the second segment on that episode was actually killed right after filming. Apparently during the filming of that segment, the actor playing the abductor (who remains unknown even today. Nobody fitting that description was ever on the show before) got too handsy on the poor girl, and her father was furious. He ran into the scene before it officially ended and beat the shit out of the ""werewolf man"". Well that night, the girl and her father were abducted from the studio parking lot and were drowned in a harbor only 4 miles away from the studio. 

So this event already had police eying the studio, but what was the final nail in the coffin? Well, the candy scene foreshadowed an event that would take place on that Halloween. Frank and Harold poisoned Frank's own niece. ""Luckily"" this crime was too close to home for the two men this time. Frank became the main suspect of his niece's murder, and was apprehended on November 5th, 1997. But Frank somehow must have known that this was coming, because he warned Harold, who fled the country that same night. Sadly, Harold still hasn't been found. 

When I talked to the studio about Harold, they told me that they think they know where he is. In France, three children and two adults have been killed in ways that paralleled exact ""accidents"" that happened on the show. Tiny details were discovered which led the French authorities to figure out that these deaths were homicides, not accidents. 

But even though French authorities have been looking for someone that fits Harold's description, they have come up with nothing. It's been nearly 20 years, more than enough time for Harold to change his whole  identity and  appearance. I tried to figure out how exactly a ""sidekick"" on an obscure public access show could afford to do all these things, but things weren't adding up. 

How exactly did Frank know that the police would be coming for him? Why would Harold go to France? His only family in Europe lives in Ireland. Why exactly were these killings not a big deal? I had heard about them, but only considered them an urban legend until a few months ago! I did some heavy digging and found out some crazy stuff. 

Two other hosts that worked for that same production company were criminals. A puppeteer who was a serial rapist, and an old ""aunt Jamima"" like cook who was convicted of killing 12 of her neighbors in a mass poisoning at her local block party. Why were criminals so attracted to this company? Well, all roads seemed to lead to the company's CEO at the time. A french national who had his own shady past. 

Brook LeGue, the owner of the production company, spent 5 years as a relief worker in Nigeria and the Congo. The town that he spent his first year with began attacking neighboring towns after he left. They said that they were trying to appease ""The snake God, Damballa"". 

LeGue ""somehow"" acquired an insane amount of wealth in Africa, and came over here in 1988 and created his own production company. Another thing to note is that each crime committed by his workers were in a ritualistic way (like Frank &amp; Harold killing and replaying it on their show). After Frank was arrested, LeGue killed himself 5 days later. The ""official"" report was that he was battling depression. But some say it was because he was afraid that some shady shit would be discovered. 

So why did the killings get no airtime? Well it's probably because in 1997, the production company was being assimilated into a certain Media monster who also was involved in Orlando. The merger was completed, the Mouse stole tons of show ideas, and the company was spat back out independently in 2005, under new management. 

But what makes this whole story ""creepy"" besides the fact that two men used their TV personas to murder children? Well this all happened in February. I did my piece on the killings on February 26th. On March 3rd, the production company and I both received and email from an unknown person. 

""Le médecin est en"" (The doctor is in) written 15 times. 

Since then, four more killings have occurred. But they've been too comically similar to the show to be a coincidence. One boy was found with a wig that matched the boy who suffered the same (fake) fate on the show. Since I know a lot, I've helped consult the French authorities since then. 

I wish that I could end this story with ""he was caught"". I wish that this story ended there, but I'm afraid we won't get to that point. The influence that LeGue had must still have some merit, as it still seems to be protecting Harold. But I want justice, I want the good guys to win this time."

My task is to update one spreadsheet with the contents of the other spreadsheet. Here's how the two spreadsheets relate:

Main file – SCSM Groups and Members… | SCSM_membershipMGR file |

Active Directory Name | Group Name | 
Member Login ID | UserName | 
Member Name | Name | 
Manager | Manager | 

I have to: 

1. Add any new user records from the membershipMGR file to the SCSM Groups and Members file

2. Put “not a member” in the Member Status column on the main file if there’s a user that’s no longer in the group from the membershipMGR file

3. If there’s a new group in the membershipMGR sheet that isn’t in the main file SCSM Groups and Members then add those records to the main file.

4. If there’s a group no longer in the membershipMGR file but it’s in the main file, then under the Group Status column, type in “Group Removed”.

I don't expect all of this to be solved by formulas, but if some of it could be done with formulas, that would be excellent (It's taken others 5-7 hours to do this manually and I don't have that much time). I can post some images of the workbooks if that would help. 

Thank you so much for anything you can help with!

This is going to be long because I'm a wee bit overwhelmed and don't know how much detail is required. There's a woefully subpar tl;dr at the bottom. Also, I'm brand new to reddit, so please be nice about formatting and the like.

I'm 23, and recently came into what is, to me, a large sum of money (thanks, grandpa). After paying off my student debt, I have $44,000 left over. I already have an emergency fund of $5300. It was $6,000, which is just under 3 months wages, but I had some medical bills this month. I'm hoping to replinish it ASAP.

Here are my financial needs/goals, ranked from most immediate to least immediate:

- I'm moving across the country in the fall (BC to ON). Some of my furniture has to come with me. I don't drive, and I won't know anyone in the city I'm moving to, so I'm going to have to hire inter-city movers who can drive across the country and unload stuff into my new apartment for me.

- I'm going to graduate school for a year in the fall (eight months in the city, and then a four month internship that could be there or somewhere else, and will likely be paid). The program is ""fully funded."" I don't have an official dollar amount yet, but I do have a minimum, and it should be enough to cover my tuition and my rent, and food for eight months.

- I will likely have to move again after my graduate schooling is completed. The field I'm going into is a lot of contract positions, and there aren't a lot of places to work in my field in the city I'm going to grad school in.

- I grew up poor, mostly due to my parents' poor financial planning. I've been doing the best I can (with the exception of choosing an oversaturated work field) to make sure I'm not poor.

- I'd like to retire one day. Maybe even comfortably.

- NB: I have no intention of buying property anytime soon.

All of that said, here's what I'm planning to do with the money I have.

- $12,000 liquid for moving expenses in the fall. Hopefully this will cover a trip out east in July to find an apartment, the actual flight when I move, and to pay movers to move some things I can't get rid of without causing WWIII in my family. Anything left will be used to pay expenses while I'm at school.

- $15,000 in a GIC ladder - $5,000 year 1, $5,000 year 2, and $5,000 year 3. My idea is that I can the first GIC will mature in the middle of my internship, and I can use that $$$ to move to a city with more job opportunities if required (if my internship turns into a full-time job, then I have money to put somewhere else). It's also nice to have something low-risk when first starting out.

- $17,000 (the rest of it) into a Tangerine TFSA. I'm leaning towards the Balanced Growth portfolio. I turned 18 in 2009 and have not yet opened a TFSA, so my understanding is that I have $41,000 of contribution room. I was paying $400 on my student loans every month, so I'd redirect that money to my TFSA until I start school.

... I have no idea how to TL;DR that. Uh... **tl;dr, a future student wants to keep ~1/3 of their $45,000 inheritance liquid, 1/3 in a GIC ladder, and 1/3 in a Tangerine TFSA. Good idea or needs improvement?**"

The company's hiring process was easy and the technical questions were all basic so I didn't feel as overwhelmed as I do now. I wasn't able to get an internship because I switched my major late in college from and unrelated field (biology) and took summer classes to try and graduate from school on time. Basically every summer was filled with classes and I havent had a real break from school in ages. So I have no real work experience but I have listed all my major projects I worked on in school that are relevant.

Fast forward to now, I'm overwhelmed between applying to any jobs that I possibly can find for junior java positions and I'm even considering applying to internships. I spend hours applying to jobs but barely get a response from 1-2 companies despite applying on a plethora of sites (indeed, dice, glassdoor, linkedin, stackoverflow etc). I don't know what to focus on at all. Should I be working on projects and learning new technologies? Should I be working on my interview/algorithm skills which generally suck? How do I balance doing this all without feeling so worthless everyday?

My general schedule is wake up and apply to any jr. java positions/entry level java jobs. Then I start to teach myself various new frameworks/languages. I'm planning on somehow also adding the cracking the coding interview book in. 

Is this the most effective way to go about doing things? I feel like I know nothing x.x

384oq7,331,2015-06-01,I can't remember how old I was the first time I saw him. (Part Three),RanRent,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/384oq7/i_cant_remember_how_old_i_was_the_first_time_i/,"[Part Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/37zz88/i_cant_remember_how_old_i_was_the_first_time_i/)

I still don't know how I managed the courage to blink. 

But the very second I did, he was gone. 

Just like that. Just like my mom had described in the car...gone as quickly as he had appeared. The man in the top hat, the one that I hadn't seen since that time he appeared in my bedroom window, was now fresh in my memory. I'll try to do my best at describing him:

- I'm 5'10. His face was lined up with mine in the reflection on the glass, but he was bent down. So I have no idea how tall he actually is.
- He looks exactly like a person. No sharp teeth, no more black in his eye than anyone else. His fingers are regular length. I know this sounds kind of ridiculous, but I can't remember what he was wearing. In my head it just looks black.  
- He smells horrible...like the sewer.  

The second I saw that he was no longer behind me, the second my mom started to regain some color in her face, the room felt immediately...warmer. Like we were stepping inside for the first time after a storm. My brother was the first one to speak:

""He's gone.""

I was next:

""He was standing right behind me...I could see him in the glass.""

My mom just swallowed loudly. My best friend looked confused, but scared. 

""I didn't see anyone,"" he finally said. ""I looked at the steps and there was nobody there and I was standing right here the whole time...I didn't see anyone behind you either. But it did get pretty cold...""

It was then that we were startled by the front door opening. The sounds of my dad and sister's voice rang through the empty house. When they got into the kitchen, I saw my sister was finishing up a cone from McDonalds. She still had her dance uniform on. My dad explained that they had went to get ice cream afterwards because Becca behaved so well and apologized for being so late. He then greeted my best friend and was asked to speak privately by my mom in the other room. My sister sat down at the table, obviously unaware of what had happened. My brother and best friend and I were all still standing up, our chairs pulled out from when my brother had started screaming before. My heart still racing, I tried to calm down. I didn't want to make sense of what happened, not in front of my sister at least. Maybe not ever. I kind of just wanted to forget it all happened. Trying to look natural, I sat back down at the table. My sister had taken my mom's spot, which was across from me. My best friend slowly sat down too and my brother eventually went in to my parents room to speak with them.  

My best friend pulled out his phone -- I remember how shaky his hands were -- and I could see he had a missed call from his dad. I remembered I still had to bring him home...but I didn't want to make the drive back to my house -- although only three minutes away -- alone. And I bet he didn't want to spend the night here. Texting his dad in response instead of calling, he looked up to me. 

""I don't know what to say. Or what to ask.""

I made a face, nudging my head toward my sister. Like I said, I didn't want to say anything in front of her. I didn't know what my parents were saying in their room -- I was hoping my mom was talking to my dad about what had happened so we could do something about it, whatever that would be. Getting the hint, he decided to try to lighten the mood by speaking to my sister, who was sitting quietly. 

""So Becca, how was dance?"" He sounded loud in the quiet house.

My little sister looked up from her ice cream cone and smiled. In response to his question, she started laughing. The laughter caught me so off guard that I started laughing too. Eventually my best friend joined in and we were all laughing, although I don't think any of us knew why. Holding out her ice cream cone to my best friend, she asked:

""Want some?"" 

He smiled at her politely. ""No thanks, Becca.""

My little sister shook her head. I rubbed my arm. It was a little chilly in here still. 

""Want some?"" She repeated. 

I assumed she had to be talking to me, then. ""No thanks, I'm okay. You can finish it,"" I said to her. 

Again she shook her head no. I started to feel uneasy as my best friend made a face. ""Man,"" he said. ""It smells like Lucy farted in here."" He plugged his nose, looking around for one of my dogs. They were nowhere to be seen. ""Do you smell that?""

I did. 

It was then, as I stared at my giggling little sister, that I realized she wasn't holding the cone out to my best friend and she wasn't holding the cone out to me. Instead, the melting ice cream she was holding was directed toward the space between us. 

Before I had time to react my parent's door slammed open, my brother running out. My mom followed, with my dad behind her. I noticed he still had his keys. ""Come on,"" he said to me and my sister, sounding annoyed. ""Lets get this over with.""

Dropping my best friend off at his house along the way, we did the only thing my mom said that had helped in the past -- we went to church.

Luckily it was a Wednesday, which meant they had a night service. Youth group was also that night, although they had left almost an hour ago. The only people that lingered were a few ladies in the parking lot and the man that was supposed to clean up the buildings at night. That and the pastor. My mom had called on the way there, but the secretary had left hours ago. We were left to knock on the doors and ask for directions from the man that was cleaning. We caught the pastor in her office. She looked like she was just about to leave, but she invited us in anyways. My mom gave my little sister her phone to distract her and started talking. 

Basically she told her everything she had told us. From the job at Granny's Donuts to the creepy cop to the time at the museum to what had just happened in the kitchen. The rest of my family sat quietly as she explained. When she was done, the pastor -- who had done as much as blink -- calmly asked her what correlation she thought the thing in the top hat had with the cop from when she was younger. My mom explained:

""I don't know. My run in with that officer was the worst thing I had ever experienced in my life at the time. And then, when I saw the man with that hat, that became the worst thing I had ever experienced. After remembering being told that he was into demonic didn't really--"" 

The pastor interrupted her, a weird look on her face. I followed her gaze back to my brother, who was sitting beside me. His nose was bleeding. 

""We'll start right away,"" I remember she said. 

We followed her into the chapel, where she had each of us lay down on three or four chairs that had been lined up to form a bench. One by one, she asked us if we were willing to accept Jesus into our lives, and prayed over us as she fanned us with a sheet of some sort. I was the last to go. And if I'm being honest with you, I laughed the whole time. I don't know if it was because I was lying down on children's seats and getting fanned with a napkin or if it because I was finally free. 

I didn't have any problem saying yes to accepting God into my life. I had always been a Christian, although as I grew up my faith wavered. It went all around as I learned to question things, to not see everything as being so black and white. But because of those children's seats and fanning napkin, my faith has been restored.

That night at the church happened almost two weeks ago exactly. 

Two days ago I found this website. I decided here would be the place to share my story. 

That night -- the night after I first clicked to post -- I had a real hard time sleeping. My day was good, though. Regular, like it was before. I spoke to my best friend that night, who's off doing an internship for the summer now. I brushed my teeth like normal and closed my blinds and turned my fan up on high as I got under my sheets. But for some reason, that night, something felt off. The last thing the pastor said to us before we left and she invited us to the service on Sunday was this:

""I don't know what's out there. Nobody does for certain. But I do know that what I'm worshiping in here, whatever I talk to at night...that thing, that creature, that being...it's good. Whatever you were dealing with...""

She didn't need to finish. We knew what she would say. For some reason, she directed the last few sentences to me:

""Fear is what they live on. That's probably why you saw it resurface after so many years. You had your memory of it and spread that memory to your brother and then your mother. Don't mistake its interactions with your sister as anything but malignant. You have good on your side now, but it's up to you if you keep it that way.""

I'm scared. Last night was fine, and I fell asleep to happy thoughts.

But I still think I made a mistake. I don't think I should've posted this in the first place. 

I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens.

One particular thing that I am struggling with is whether to prioritize finishing up computer science courses before gen eds. By this I mean pushing most my gen eds till senior year. The reason I am considering doing this is to get as many computer science courses on my resume as I can before applying for internships (I realize the courses are not directly transferable to the real world, but they have to be more useful than some random gen ed). Or would this be a stupid idea, because I could use the gen eds to balance the exhausting computer science courses?

The position was labelled ""CS Intern"" and it is for a company that works very closely with the city.


I guess the interns are also responsible for IT problems for a sector of the building (it is a huge city building).

The only time I'm learning any programming is when the other intern is teaching me, but only because we are bored -- not because we were assigned anything.


Is this common for an internship? I kind of feel like I have way too much downtime. I asked if there was anything I could help with, but there was nothing.

386hsm,0,2015-06-02,Forced gap semester,thepenofthemorning,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/386hsm/forced_gap_semester/,"Hey everyone.

I've just finished four years at a college working toward a computer science bachelor's degree. However, I failed a bunch of classes (for personal reasons, not because they were difficult) in my last two semesters and ended up not graduating. 

I'd planned to resume classes in the fall and finish up my degree that semester, but because of my poor academic track record, it looks like the college is going to block my registration for the fall semester, saying that I need a break from classes.

So now I find myself in limbo. I have about six months and no plans for how to spend them. I've got some programming skills (years of classes + a couple of tech internships) but no idea how I should use them. I don't think I can get an internship in such an awkwardly-placed time frame. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can use the next six months productively?"
386yin,1,2015-06-02,Is It Possible to Obtain Enough Knowledge about High School Math in Two Years For a Computer Science Degree?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/386yin/is_it_possible_to_obtain_enough_knowledge_about/,"More details, I have zero knowledge of high school math currently. I am not helpless at math. During high school I did well at math when I tried, I was able to solve math problems my teachers had to look up. The problem is I am a high school drop out and lack strong math skills.

My GPA is around 80% in science, social, and english. Math is currently the unknown. I take a distance learning course in Canada. I estimate it would take one or two years to get my high school diploma. I guess I am asking if it is possible to obtain enough knowledge about high school math in two years to meet the requirements for Computer Science?

I am interested in Computer Science because I enjoy programming. The way code is and how it works interests me. I have researched various degrees and Computer Science seems to be the most worthwhile because it opens up more job opportunities and it is versatile.


I was thinking of doing Computer Science as a degree and getting an internship for investment banking. Plausible plan or should I get a reality check?

Edit: I am mainly looking for advice. If it is possible, what would you advise is my best option? If it is not possible, what do you advise I should do instead?

I'm in need of some career advice. I finally managed to get myself into a luxury position (yay!). My situation is as following:

Last summer I've received my bachelors of law at a University of applied sciences. At the moment it is damn near impossible getting a job in the legal field, even for masters graduates (most of my classmates are now working at a cash register or in the greenhouses, masters graduates mostly work as secretary’s).  Now I’ve done a remarkable internship, at which I’ve been given the responsibly of representing well over 100 clients, negotiated on their behalf and represented them before a court of law. This is HUGE on my resume and I really liked doing it.


During my studies I had a side job in IT, because I was unable to find a job in my field after graduating I started working for the IT company fulltime. I am working detached so every few months I'm switching companies/jobs which I kind of dislike because of the uncertainty.


I've now been working at a helpdesk for 5 months which sucked so bad, it was monotonous and didn't challenge me the slightest. It is boring and feels like I’m throwing my education out the door. It isn't really paying well, but a job is a job.


Because I was so bored job at my and scared I would be stuck at a helpdesk the rest of my life  I was sending out my resume like crazy but didn't get one invite for an interview.


Now the thing is: I always do my absolute best, whatever job I'm doing and my employer has received fantastic feedback about me and I've been following courses from which I received very good feedback.


My assignment at the helpdesk is almost at an end and because of my results my employer found a job as a business information manager at a huge multinational. The job sounds like a great challenge and a lot of fun. But, coincidently the same day as I was offered this assignment I got invited for an interview as a paralegal and was offered the job. 


I honestly don’t know which one to pick. I think that because there are way more qualified legal counsellors then me, I will hit a wall soon career wise. On the other hand, it pays like 30% more than my current job because I have a degree in that field. 


It feels like I am at a huge T section in my life, am I going for IT or legal? Perhaps I could use the job offer as a paralegal as leverage for a better salary?


What would you guys advise me to do?

The metal Worldstrafer/spirit golem floated ominously in the void. At least, &lt;ke Ahiaan thought it was a spirit golem. It's what that twin headed grand magus told him, anyway. It certainly didn't look like any spirit golem he has seen before. For one, even with his lack of knowledge of magical theory, he could see that there was nothing conductive to magic on it. For two years in school, he got one thought drilled into his head: there's a reason the Unity favours [Ssallglu]/Nikh!o construction: the former provides structural stability, and the latter conducts all the magic the vessel might need. Still, &lt;ke's job was not to think, but to work. Another thought drilled into his head, albeit in a different school.

His job was simple: get close to the... thing, and attempt to establish a mental link. If things got bad, he had an enchanted discblade ready on his side. The twinhead assured him he won't need it, but one cannot afford to be to careful with a species that almost blew itself up into oblivion. Several minutes passed, just getting close to the hunk of metal. Several microasteroids tried to ruin his day, but failed miserably; the spacefaring shields were of an exceptional quality. Finally, he got to the point he could touch the thing. It was far bigger than it seemed at first, a detail which elicited an involtary twitch from &lt;ke. Still, he could not be afraid, he wasn't paid to be afraid. He began moving his mouth mandibles to get into the right state to establish a mental link. The movements continued until the spell was successful and...nothing.

&lt;ke did one thing, and he did it well, that thing being mental linking, but didn't take an expert to notices that something was amiss. Normally, a successful mental link would find the lifeform the caster is focused on, or, failing that, the nearest reasonable lifeform. This complete lack of anything only happens when there is nothing alive anywhere near the caster. The answer was clear: this thing wasn't a golem. In fact, this thing wasn't even alive. To be honest, there was reaction: a *""tktktktktktktk""* fron &lt;ke; his species' equivalent of a sigh. He doesn't get paid enough for this crap. He raised the Longspeaker, and let the other side know: *""The target isn't alive, First-of-Many, requesting different strategem.""* The other side was confused.

The *other* other side was confused as well. Back in Darmstadt, Henrik Braun's mind was bursting with thoughts. This was actually a proof of us not being alone in the universe! He would have jumped for joy even if the FTL drive simply worked properly. Unfortunately, that proof seems to have caused quite a few medical emergencies. The excitement of an alien being was too much for some, and for others, the sheer terror of alien spacefaring bugs achieved the same effect. Some people were convinced that the whole thing was an elaborate prank, and angry voicemail flooded ESOC.

That was beside the point. What was important was that, somehow, this alien lifeform was surviving the vacuum of space, it was somehow moving without any obvious means of propulsion, and it just finished waving its mandible things at the camera. Clearly, this was technology beyond anything humanity has ever witnessed. How could one even contact with such a thing? The Helios wasn't built with first contact in mind, at least as far as he knew.

Fortunately, Gunther was wrong. Thanks to a last minute petition started by one of ESA's interns, a microphone and a speaker were built into the Helios. How can you say no to half a million people, especially when the entire idea only required one gigabyte of data and some extra wiring? And, as if on cue, the responsible intern burst into the main control room. Her name was Maja, and right then, she was screaming in her own language and flailing her arms about like an tube man. It garnered a few laughs from her fellow countrymen, but otherwise left the control center even more confused than it was before. After that burst of (what was presumably) joy, she went up to Gunther and said, with oddly-accented English: *""Sorry, boss. Had to get that out of my system. Did you turn on the microphone yet?""* Mr. Braun responded, with his own, German-accented English: *""We have a microphone?""*, to which Maja responded by pointing to an icon on his control screen. Some time later, contact was established with Helios.

However, before we get there, it would be a shame to leave out what happened with &lt;ke and the twinhead commanding him, over at Alpha Centauri. To be fair, it wasn't just the two of them. While &lt;ke was generally being confused by the metal monstrosity, his commander was listening to his woes aboard the Forgotten One, a Worldstrafer orbiting one of the system's planets. Besides his commander, the who's who of Unity was present, even High Councilor [Aaaeee Gooeeh] who was last seen in public some 34 years ago. The commander themself was the First-of-Many of Unity's xenobiologists, although the Unity concept of xenobiology differs from our own, hence the title grand magus. They were [Garu'Sera], and they belonged to the [Hing'du], or rather, what was left of them. They fought for recognition for years, in the face of prejudice. So many times, they were denied employment, because ""we have a more suitable candidate"". They knew they were lying. It was all the result of thinking that, if the [Hing'du] cannot keep their planet in order, they sure cannot keep a job with high responsibility in order. [Garu'Sera] cannot falter now, even though it seems that reality itself is conspiring against their success. No laws of reality will stop their big break.

[Garu'Sera] responded, their two heads speaking as one: *""It could be some kind of a magical artifact, ready for activation. Search the structure for some kind of a switch""*. With that said, their heads were as two once again. [Hing'du] had a curious ability to grant their two heads limited autonomy. This proved incredibly useful for the purposes of critical thinking, but it had the downside of requiring a lot of energy. Some say this biology was also responsible for the Incident, and are partially correct. Many do not know a single fanatical group was responsible for the destruction of [Garu'Sera]'s lost homeworld. At any rate, they were thinking.

The command he send to the spaceborne Takaih was really a way to stall and make the many officials beside them think that they have the control. To be honest, they had no idea what to do next. The guess of an artifact was highly unlikely, based on what little they knew about humans. Their knowledge of humans was severely limited. Mind reading has yielded little, as human's concepts of their magic are too incomprehensible. The anatomical and mental insight gained from some captures before the Incident also yielded little, as they were only able to capture dead specimens. The Incident happened before the authorization for sapient capture could be given, and by then it was too late. [Garu'Sera] hoped for a miracle. And it came, in form of a message via the Longspeaker: *""The target is speaking. Do you wish to respond, First-of-Many?""*

Back on Earth, Henrik was speaking. He still didn't quite see the point of putting sound-based communication systems on the Helios. He highly doubted the aliens could speak any of Earth's languages,not to mention the fact the ship was expected to be in a vacuum. Still, it didn't hurt to try. After several variations of greetings, the scarab somehow lifted its box, and began to speak, or at least, it seemed like speaking. The language was odd, full of clicking and hissing noises, but it seemed to have some sort of order to it. It wasn't the first time the scarab did what it did, and it was still equally confusing on how exactly it manipulated the box. It was probably a communications device, but, first off, it seemed to be moving on it's own accord, and secondly, there was the question of why would Helios be able to even hear any sound. Henrik concluded that is was probably some form of highly advanced, invisible air envelope.

The importance of the mechanisms of space travel became irrelevant, as the scarab turned the box toward one of the cameras on the Helios. It revealed a hole, and from that hole, came oddly accented, fragmented, and occasionaly, oddly voiced, but perfectly comprehendible English. It stated: *""We wIsh* ***to*** *undErstand: what invIIIIsibleh spirIt is within* ***your*** *contrapshhuhn?""*

This question only raised further questions back at Darmstadt. Slow, methodical discussion followed for the next two hours. It did not lead to many revelations on either side. The humans were able to understand that there was some sort of an alliance named Unity, encompassing multiple sapients. As for the nature of their technology, the aliens insisted it was magic. Some of humanity's xenobiologists argued that the description was just a ploy in order to fake weakness. At that point, every human on the planet had their own opinion about the aliens. The internet blew up, literally in some places, as older nodes struggled to keep up with the load.

The discussion ended with the conclusion that direct contact between Unity and humanity was necessary for true understanding. Besides, &lt;ke's spacefaring shields were running out and needed to be replaced. In orbit around Earth, a Worldwatcher was ready to do just what was required.

Aboard the Radiant Homeworld, throughout the first contact, a heated discussion was taking place on the safety of humanity and whether they deserve a place within Unity. Whatever their thoughts might have been, the High Councilor has decided: the vessel was to disembark on Earth. While [Glubarrtuu] didn't agree, orders were orders, and he was the commander of the Radiant Homeworld. It made some movements with his tentacles, and a transparent form of a [Ssulb] crackling with energy appeared. [Glubarrtuu] spoke: *""Star Spirit, calculate a course for the launch location of the* ***Helios****""*, with the last word being mentally projected instead of spoken. The Worldstrafer's name became known after the talk with the humans, as well as the location of their launch pad; a welcome certainty in the face of confusion.

On Earth, a giant mob of people was waiting near Helios' launch site, located in what was known as French Guiana. It is there that humanity was to first see alien life, face to face. Some enterprising individuals already set up, setting various snacks and refreshments. It was technically illegal to do something like that, but the convenience of something like that was too great for the armed forces in the vicinity to do something about it. Speaking of armed forces, there were many of them. The forces of the AC, the American Confederation, were easily the most numerous, but not by a long shot. The intended effect was to impress the aliens, and possibly prevent any Earth invasion takeovers.

Finally, the Radiant Homeworld touched down, its form disc shaped and coloured black with numerous white spots, seemingly placed without any order. It floated a bit over Earth's surface, and    priest-emperor Zetkah's honour guard were the first aliens seen by humanity. Soon after them, the emperor himself followed, along with [Glubarrtuu] and !a-haka. After them, the entire multiracial crew of the Radiant Homeworld followed. Watching them, with gauss and laser weaponry trained on them, was a whole slew of soldiers and APCs. Behind them, many xenobiologists, linguists, and any relevant experts that could arrive in time. Behind them still, masses of people, ready to witness history. It was a sight to behold.

Before anyone had a chance to talk, something unusual happened: The priest-emperor knelt before the soldiers. Kneeling carries the same meaning in Krikrogah culture as it does in human culture. His honour guard followed. !a-haka tucked in her legs, a different gesture with the same meaning. Soon after, some of the human officers started kneeling too. In a manner of seconds, almost every sapient around the Radiant Homeworld showed respect. Even [Glubarrtuu], with its cynicism in the first contact, gained faith, and rolled up its many tentacles.

First contact was a success.

3883uh,5,2015-06-02,My poems have disappeared from my journal and replaced with chicken scratch. I haven't opened it since I first noticed this weeks ago. Should I open it again? I'm curious.,ciaodanielle,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3883uh/my_poems_have_disappeared_from_my_journal_and/,"About six weeks ago, things were going really well. I accepted a new job, adopted a puppy from the shelter in town, started seeing someone new, and even began to cope with Ryan’s death in a healthy way. I revived my running habit. I started eating healthier. I found a reason to get out of bed every morning. The world was finally turning around for me.

For months, I struggled to find closure after Ryan’s suicide. We weren’t dating or anything, but I had a crush on him for years. In college, we had astronomy class together. It was a gen-ed requirement for our college. We hated the class and one day, started bonding over it. We groaned at another busy assignment, next to the pile of books we’ve yet to read for our other classes. It was so fucking stupid. We later found out we were both literature majors, looking to get our writing out there eventually.

In mid-December, we went out for drinks at the college bar down the street to celebrate our creative writing capstone. Despite the prescience of our forty-something professor, Ryan saw this as an opportunity to get hammered. He ordered a few rounds of bourbon, and it was likely he was already tipsy. He kept a flash in his back, denim pocket. He started ranting about his girlfriend, that he’d been seeing for nearly eight months at that point. He recited an argument from earlier that day. 

“Hey, Lauren, how much should I spend on a Christmas gift for you?” He asked.

“Use your fucking judgment,” she replied. “I can’t believe you’d commodify our relationship with numbers.” 

Ryan was a devoted anti-capitalist. If it were up to him, he wouldn’t exchange gifts at all during commercial holidays. However, he was also a recovering addict that replaced alcohol with opiates and the rest of our class had to hear about his fight. It’s totally normal to fight with your significant other and talk about it, sure, but he was four drinks in and saying goodbye to everyone for the night.

I should’ve stopped him that night. I just didn’t know how. I didn’t want him to hate me for “misplacing” his keys. He for sure didn’t want to hear a lesson from me.

I spent my last semester of college abroad. In South India, the Internet was unreliable and spotty. Even when there was a fair connection, it still was subpar and fairly ineffective. For someone that adores the web, it was painful. It was also painful for Ryan, because we had limited contact. One afternoon, I found a backlash of Facebook messages from him. He broke up with Lauren finally, only a day before their one year anniversary. He thought she’d be heartbroken, but the roles reverse. She moved onto a guy she started talking to and flirting with before she started dating Ryan. Ryan sunk into a depression and struggled to stay alive. He told me he wanted to kill himself. I told him I was there for him.

When I had Internet, we talked for hours. We typed away, despite that I was on the other side of the world. He told me he stopped drinking. He came to the realization buzzed driving was threatening everyone else on the road and worried his close friends.

While abroad, I bought a leather journal for him. He could replace the flask in his pocket with this little book. It was handmade by an Indian native. 

I soon enough returned home. I was in transit for nearly thirty hours in a row between flights and cab rides. Although I enjoyed my trip, and would do anything to travel back to India, I was eager to reconnect with friends I hadn’t seen in months.

I logged onto Facebook. I didn’t have any messages from Ryan. I clicked on his profile for any recent activity. I read an array of posts on his timeline, from relatives and friends, in his memorial. He did it. He fucking did it. Shit.

One night, Ryan relapsed and drank himself to death. He slipped in the bathroom after taking a shower (probably while drinking) and went into a coma. His father noticed the bathroom door was locked the next morning. He pried it open and found his son, unconscious. Ryan was rushed to the hospital, but it was too late.

So that brings me back to six weeks ago. Sorry for the brief ramble. I promise it will all make sense. Anyway, things were going great. I couldn’t have imagined, once I learned about Ryan’s death, that I would bounce back so quickly.

I have a habit of staying up late. I’m sure you can relate. Even though I wake up for work at the crack of dawn, six o’clock on the dot, I write poetry past midnight. After a few poems were published in an anthology by a local publishing house, they asked me to prepare a manuscript for an independent work. My goal is to reach seventy pages. Right now, I have about half of that and I’m still revising relentlessly as I go along.

Six weeks ago, I placed my journal by my bedside, next to the lamp. It was a little after one in the morning. I started writing in that journal I’d originally planned on giving to Ryan. Why not put it to use? It’s silly for me to keep that without anything in it. Besides, Ryan would genuinely want me to fill it with poems. I turned the light off. Moments later, I heard a thrashing THUD next to me. Alarmed, I flipped the light on. The journal fell to the ground. Relieved, I left the journal on the ground and turned off the light again.  I must’ve placed the journal to close to the end of the table. I fell into a sleep almost immediately. 

Work got busy and I stopped writing recreationally so often. I’d recently accepted a new job at a local newspaper, so I did a fair amount of writing and copyediting all day. I started going to bed earlier because long days began to exhaust me. I was only the youngest in the newsroom, next to the intern that bought coffee for the office everyday.

Last Friday, I finally started writing poems again. Often, inspiration finds me even at the most stressful points of my life. I wrote a few verses and scribbles in Ryan’s journal. I quickly grew tired. I closed the journal, placed in on the table beside my bed, and turned the lights off. And there it was again. 

THUD.

I jumped up from my pillow and turned the lights again. It was the journal, planted on the carpet next to my mattress. I recalled my memory of the similar event, weeks before. I picked up the journal to write a poem about these two isolated events.

I flipped through the pages of the journal to my recent poem, to find a place to right a new one on the next fresh page beside it. I couldn’t find the poem I’d just written. I flipped through the entire journal, back and forth over and over again.

The poem, I’d written nearly ten minutes ago, wasn’t there. Maybe this was a dream? I have sleep paralysis and often experience vivid hallucinations while dreaming... of course, I was moving, but I didn’t question it. I dropped the journal on the table and turned off the light. I drifted away to sleep.

The next morning, I decided to carry the journal with me in my bag to work. Perhaps, during down time at my new job, I could spew out some verses during breaks. As expected, I had some inspiration while writing an obituary. The obituary person was out for the day and we needed a dedication for our weekly issue.

I searched for my previous poem to start a new piece. Just like the night before, that poem wasn’t there. Instead, there was chicken scratch handwriting in its place. It read: “I want an end of this pain.” I wanted to scream, but given my situation, I didn’t want to appear insane. I sat in silence and utter fear, towered over my tuna sandwich.

I got freaked out and left the journal in my desk. When I arrived home that night, I inspected every single crevice in my home. I made sure to lock every door and window in my apartment. I slept with the lights on. I switched journals. When I turned off the lights to sleep after a night of writing, I didn’t hear any more thuds.

I kind of forgot about the situation, actually, until this afternoon. I misplaced one of my favorite pens this morning and naturally, rummaged through everything I own at work. This included my desk. I uncovered Ryan's journal. I shoved it back in the desk.

That was about fifteen minutes ago. I've been contemplating on how to approach this situation. I'm unbearably curious about what's happened to the journal. Was I hallucinating? Was it a dream? Was my memory playing a game? I'm not sure what to believe. I'm also nervous about opening the journal, because I might not like what I find. I'm finally at a happy place in my life after months of depression. Should I open it? Do I ignore and pretend what I saw a few weeks ago was just an illusion? What do I do? "

388868,3,2015-06-02,Biological Father in Arizona Seeking Custody of Two Sons in Florida (in Foster Care),They_Beat_Me,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/388868/biological_father_in_arizona_seeking_custody_of/,"My ex and mother of my two sons (13 and 16) allowed her two older sons (both mid-20s) to live in her home in Florida.  The older boys (not my biological children) have a pretty extensive criminal record with a history of drugs.  

In November, their home was raided by the local sheriff.  They found three guns (including a modified/shortened shot gun and a semi-automatic rifle).  The older boys were both charged with several meth crimes (distribution, etc).  They are awaiting trial in jail as I type this.  My ex was not arrested, but my boys (and her daughter from the next baby daddy) were taken into foster care.  
I have been consistently blocked from seeing and speaking to my sons for several years.  I have spoken to them only once in the last five years total.  I continued to send cards, letters and attempted to call with little contact.  No letters have been returned.  My gifts (shockingly) got to them while my ex takes credit for them.  My ex and my children have been moved so many times over the last decade that the kids have not had time to make friends or stay in one school more than a year or two.
When I contacted the case manager to tell her that I intend to request custody, she spoke to my ex (who is ""not getting doing her checklist"" - whatever that means).  My ex told the case manager that I'm not paying child support (sent statements from the State of Florida disproving this) and that I abandoned my sons to move to Arizona.

I admit that I was kind of a loser before moving to Arizona.  Since arriving, I graduated from ASU with a BS in Political Science, married a wonderful woman, started going back to church, got a great entry level position with a major fortune 500 company that provides amazing benefits, start a paid internship teaching (part of my grad degree) in August.  In other words, I have a loving home that provides continuity and a future.  I fear that if my ex gets custody back (odds are slim according to the case manager) that the boys will fall into the same life that their brothers have found.

I really need guidance.  Any advice will help.

I've been lurking on this thread for a few months now, since I discovered that I really wanted to become a teacher.
I'm graduating in two weeks with a B.S. in Computer Science, and I must say a career in that field is not really for me. 

I live in Los Angeles, CA, and we have a District Intern program that I'd like to apply for NEXT Spring/Summer, as well as maybe try for TFA/City Year? All else fails I'll apply for a credential program and hope to god I get some sort of financial aid.

Until then, I have a year or so to kill--I need a stable, full-time job.

Any recommendations on what sort of places or positions to look for that would help my teaching endeavors?
Thanks all!"
388k44,77,2015-06-02,It's never too late to find an Internship,sneak156,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/388k44/its_never_too_late_to_find_an_internship/,"Tomorrow is my first day at an internship at a very large satellite/networking company in the north east. I applied for this internship a week and a half ago. 

I'm going to give a little background about myself, and if I can find something this late into the season, you can too. I was originally a philosophy major my first year in undergrad on a premed track, and I decided that I like tech and computers way more and ended up switching to computer engineering at the beginning of my Sophomore year. By that point I had nothing to put on my resume, no relevant course work, no experience, nada. So I didn't apply at all until my second semester where I finally started taking some C programming classes, circuits, etc. I waited all the way until April. I sat down and applied online for hours and hours and nothing. I can't count how many rejection emails I had gotten. I then decided to take  a more active approach to my search for an internship. I started pestering my professors if they knew anyone that was hiring and if they could ask any of their contacts. The semester had ended and I still didn't have a job (May 19th). So I got even more proactive, I started looking up engineering companies and called them asking if they were looking to hire any interns for the summer. This worked surprisingly well. Through this way, I landed 2 interviews. Since April, I've had 6 interviews and as of today I have 3 job offers where the one I accepted is 12 minutes away from my house door to door at a huge multinational company where I'll be doing software engineering. I got this job through a professor who referred me after the semester had ended. I physically went to the office where I spoke with the HR manager in person and handed her my resume. 

My experience is this, the online application system is a black hole. Don't waste too much time in this method. Focus on networking. I went to career services, I called people, I physically walked to offices to apply. Talk to everyone! I landed an interview by talking to an acquaintance of mine (whom I hadn't talked to in years) I ran into at a wedding who's father worked as a software engineer and introduced me. 

It's never too late and if you're still bummed about an internship, start calling and start talking. My friend landed an internship in July where she worked with AutoCAD and was later offered a full time position after graduation. 

Good luck!"

Like I said before I am an auditor, IT systems auditor/consultant to be exact. When I am sent in to audit a software/system I don’t just look at just the software/system itself, I look at everything that has control or influence over the functionality and security of the software/system everything from AD policies to the guard at the door. It seems trivial but security is a cumulative effort. Most people never realize this, this is a tale of one such audit.


It was time for $Big Bank’s independent review of security controls for all vendors and systems that touched customer data after a very public and embarrassing lawsuit over privacy, (sorry can’t say the details but it involved a corporate customer’s data ending up in bad hands and a massive, quarterly profits affecting massive, out of court settlement) so it was time for some [surprise audits](https://youtu.be/7WJXHY2OXGE). They needed to plug any holes since precedent had been set and it would be open season on them if it wasn’t plugged and someone got enough evidence to sue. AMC, my firm, got a decent share of the pie and being the lowly walker I am I got an insignificant outsourced ~~cold sales caller~~ business developer shop to audit. 

The shop in question was a small operation, the owner, 7 dedicated ~~cold callers~~ outreach personnel and the IT Guy. They had a simple home built browser app that they used to receive and process raw customer data from the bank and schedule and categorise their ~~cold sales calls~~ business development calls. Surprisingly the app was pretty damn good considering how home built apps for corporate work usually turns out. I mean the kid, yes it was a kid from college who did it, did his research and basically cloned what is normally sold by FOOL^© but for a fraction of the price and very specific algorithms to get what the shop needed from the raw dumps. He even applied best security practices on authentication, usernames, passwords, etc. Alone the software would have passed with flying colours, but of course no software is an island. 


Since it was being hosted on an AD controlled server and on and AD controlled workstation I had to review the AD. Everything was default, big no no. $Big Bank gave specific recommendations about AD security, audit trails, complexity, etc. that had to be signed off on and inspected. My thoughts, they changed them back after the bank’s review because reasons I guess. 


AD isn’t too bad, easily fixed, let’s look at the database, I should mention that the kid who made the software also offered to support it at a fee but the company cheaped out and turned it over to the in house IT who to be honest was not the brightest bulb. He ia is also the Database Admin, I am sure you see where this is going. They used phpmyadmin for their database. That by itself is not bad but it’s openly accessible via the web but with proper security its not bad. The administrator account was the default account “administrator” password “”. Red flag, big red flag.


I requested to see the tables where the data is store, they were all open, no attempt at obfuscation, with credit, debit and account numbers not obfuscated infact they were clearly visible and distinguishable. This was looking really bad and it got worse.


It was a small shop so they didn’t have a server room but repurposed workstations sharing desks with other users. The database server was under the IT guy’s desk and the main application was hosted on a server that was under the receptionist’s desk. I should mention that this was a home office, literally, it was half of the owner’s residence and the receptionist and IT guy both worked in the living room right next to a regular residential door. The PC’s didn’t have regulation HDD encryption, two factor authentication and they weren’t even bolted to the floor or something. 
 
Needless to say this looked bad. I wrote up the pretty damning report, it was sheer luck a bot hadn’t gotten into the DB and stolen the data and got back to the owner and the bank, he had 45 days to change it or lose the contract. He was of course panicking because the bank was 100% of his business. I told him the best thing he could do is get it fixed ASAP according to the guidelines in the report because the bank wasn't kidding around this time. Since it was a pretty small operation it wouldn’t be too hard. 

15 days in I made my follow up visit and to no one’s surprise IT Guy was gone. The owner was able to get the original kid over to fix it and when he heard he was an intern at IBM he offered him the job, so far its looking good but they are going to cut it real close, I honestly do wish them the best, the owner seemed like a genuinely nice guy even if his business makes my stomach turn.

I graduated with my degree in computer science with a minor in math over 3 years ago with a mediocre gpa.  My job offers for cs were 40k or so salary. I graduated with student debt and my parents died when I was younger so I had no security or nest egg. Also I felt a little burnout so I went to the oilfield doing MWD instead. My company required an engineering degree normally but took mine. I made over 6 figures every year I've worked and was planning to make more this year before the oilfield crashed.  Ive managed to survive 3 rounds of layoffs and according to my boss I'll manage to survive many more or even the shutting down my district. I've advanced very fast at my job and I'm good at it.  I think that's a talking point I can use in an interview for an entry level cs job?  Anyways I'm burntout on working on oil rigs. 12 hr days are a blessing honestly. I find myself working over it seems majority of the time.  I'll be on an oil rig with no women, alcohol, privacy, decent food for over a month at a time in the middle of the gulf of mexico. I've helped out in the office on an 8-5   schedule before and even though the work was tedious I found it easy and my quality of life was vastly improved. Girls don't like it when you're gone all the time. Try to stay in shape for amateur boxing when there's no gym or anywheres to run or even do pushups on your rig and you're gone over half the year. Anyways I'm planning on making a move to nyc because gf is moving there for work. I'm also ready to get out of the south and get into an office. I can't do anything related to my current job over there so I'm touching up resume to get back into a cs job. Any of you been in a similar situation where you coding and try to get a job? How negatively will it reflect on my resume when I put last 3 yrs at a company doing nothing related? I know to keep quiet about my current salary because they will be worried about me leaving. Previous cs interviews for me were fairly simple technical questions which I'll have to touch up on I know. I was able to land offers in college without an internship but how much is that going to affect me trying to find a low paying entry level job in nyc?"

First, since my graduation in December, I have been working for a public entity doing not very interesting work, and they may not sponsor me in the future (my boss is taking his time answering that). So I have been applying to several places, but the majority don't offer visa sponsorship for the positions I apply.

My Strategy:
 - Extracted company names that sponsored visas in 2014 and 2015 and organized in descending order, and began applying from top down (Infosys, Deloitte, IBM, etc..)
- Applied through my university career website, and through each company's career website (taleo, succesfactor, etc..)
 - I have a BA in Computer Science (high GPA) from a small liberal arts school, and a MS in Systems Engineering from an Ivy league school (but low GPA).
 - I am applying to analytic/software jobs such as:  product manager, business analyst, data analyst, risk analyst, financial analyst.

Results:
 -Majority of companies (including large ones like IBM, Aon) won't sponsor for the positions I qualify, only for software development. Sadly, I haven't had internships, or work experience in programming.
 - I have had over 10 phone interviews just to realize they don't or they may consider international students, but I don't get a second interview. 

Any advice? How should I change my strategy to land a job?My OPT just started in April, so I should have 27 months left because I have STEM extension. "

So, when I got home, I went on their website to check what positions were open for that particular store, and it showed that there were openings for cashier/clerk...
I tried calling him, to ask about it. He gave a greeting, and I thought he sounded kind of gentle and nice, but as soon as I asked, ""I heard that you were hiring..."", he quickly turned it around and did this really audible and annoyed sigh, and in a lower/annoyed tone of voice said, ""We're only looking for supervisor trainees"", and I said ""Ok"", and then hung up RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of when I said ""Bye"".

I mean, I understand if he's busy or annoyed at getting too many calls, but I am still a customer there, and this felt really mean of him. I don't think I did anything wrong, I just did what I was instructed to since the website did not work. I would have been fine if he had tried to be more polite, and at least say bye, instead of having this, ""Ugh go away"" tone and hanging up while I'm just trying to politely say bye.

Maybe I had too high expectations, but is this normal? The last place I worked at(a paid internship), the manager was very nice and friendly, so I don't really know anymore. It could be because I had the previous job from a program for disabled students, that maybe that previous manager was nice to me, and maybe all managers are like that?

I do have anxiety and depression, with anxiety being the worst, so this does really put me down, but I think I reacted as well as I could have, and I'm only feeling the struggle now while typing this, questioning peoples' rudeness.

I had always liked the cashiers there, because they were so friendly and nice, but now I think I might feel awkward walking into the store."

TL;DR: My employer wants to hire me as a full time employee temporarily (for ~1 month) until I can be hired as a salaried employee. I have a target salary but since there is a difference in responsibilities between full-time and salaried I am not sure how to negotiate. 

More info:
I am currently a Programmer Analyst intern since last June located in Bakersfield, CA. Since starting, I have been working on projects with other salaried employees. My schedule has been flexible because of school and now that I am graduating I am told I will be offered a salaried position. However, there is currently some corporate rearrangement going on and there is a hiring freeze. This means that approval from high up in the (large) company is needed for hiring me as a salaried programmer.

I am told that this means I may have to wait until the new fiscal year (August 1st) before I am hired as a salaried employee. In the mean time, they want me to become full-time with increased pay (my previous pay was based on my school experience and was $13/hr) I do not know how much the full-time pay is but it is apparently causing additional problems for HR because it is a large difference.

As a salaried employee, I am hoping to make $65,000 to $70,000. How should I negotiate my wages if I am hired full-time? A salaried employee has additional responsibilities (like on call support) that a full-time employee would not have. Does anyone have experience with this? Do I try to negotiate for a wage equal to my desired salary?

Thank you very much for your time.

I'm out of school, didn't finish my degree. Specific questions are below. Thanks for looking.**

I started coding at age 14 on a MUD, over the next 12 years it remained a hobby. Didn't go to college after high school, worked full-time mostly in service/support call-centers from 18-25, left my job as a licensed insurance claims adjuster and worked on the US census in 2010 as a sort of regional supervisor/trainer, made good money and saved it all for school. Got unemployment benefits, went into college full-time at 26 and had benefits for nearly 2 years - hard to turn down, mistake in hindsight. I held a perfect 4.0 for 5 semesters in Physics and used Python &amp; C++ for simulations and numerical analysis. I started to lose interest in where Physics was going to take me career-wise so I switched to ""Computer Information Systems"" as my school didn't offer CS or SE. I did well for the first couple semesters but my GPA slipped a bit. I found it easy and boring. I was coasting.

Finally I hit a class where OOP was dissected and it all clicked. We weren't going deep, just small console apps that didn't *do* anything. I looked forward in the curriculum and saw little new material coming my way; nothing about Linux beyond Unix file systems, nothing about version control, no portfolio-worthy projects. I stopped going to most classes April/May 2013 and ravenously put in 15-30 hour coding binges building Java 2D games. I didn't use any frameworks and really delved into game logic &amp; OO design, studying it in books, lecture courses, and youtube. I used my physics knowledge to manually implement simple physics. I let myself get terrible grades, even missed a couple exams - but I was building *real* stuff. It felt so good.

Bitcoin bubble began rumbling that summer, I started building mining rigs and daytrading crypto. By early 2014 I was addicted to trading profits. I completely abandoned that semester 4 weeks in, I really thought this was it: daytrading was obviously a great career and I was great at it (derp). I dove into Linux and started coding crypto-related projects. Made my own altcoins (never released them), a C# trading app that interfaced with exchange APIs to automate trading, a couple utilities to help me notice news/events in the market, etc. I learned about Linux, VMWare, VPS, and CLI tools that would be relevant for an entry level sysadmin or NOC type job. Linux was demystified and I got comfortable on git - awesome. I expected to get all D's or F's that semester - instead the school withdrew me on my behalf. I now owed grant money back but I wouldn't find that out for another six months when the bill came. I thought I had my career as a trader.

By August the markets were very different and profits had stalled. I still had to pay bills and eat - no problem, my bankroll was still solid - I'd ride it out. Long story short I started gambling (margin trading) on unregulated exchanges, Bitcoin kept falling, I was living entirely off of my bankroll, and by Nov-Dec 2014 after some huge losses I briefly tried real ForEx trading but finally resigned to the fact that it was over - this wasn't my career, I just lucked out. I started looking for jobs. I interviewed around my non-tech town but my lack of a paper credential or real experience at an IT job was a brick wall. A couple guys were intrigued about my crypto adventures but no one was impressed... with so few software jobs around here they could pick an experienced professional.

Frustrated, it was now the start of 2015, I couldn't afford to pay back my grants to get transcripts - gambled it all away.  I found bootcamps - couldn't afford those either. Maybe AppAcademy? Ok, time to learn webdev. I obsessively dove into The Odin Project to prepare, 15-30 hour stints again, learned a ton of new stuff. March 2015 family tragedy, the last of my money and the next 2 months of my time was needed elsewhere; coding was on hold. A few weeks ago in May a distant relative offered to cover the deposit for AppAcademy if I get in. I brushed up on what I was doing and I applied very recently - I'm hopeful but I'm not banking on it. I redid my resume this past weekend taking advice from reddit. I signed up for a ton of meetups in my area to try to network better. I'm willing and even eager to relocate. I just need *something* - a job, a chance, AppAcademy - whatever. I read threads on reddit saying they're having trouble finding people who can do FizzBuzz or a merge sort and I'm shocked. I know I have the chops to excel in an entry level position.

Thank you so much for reading if you made it this far.

**So, my questions:**

1) Should I just start shotgun blasting out resumes to Cali, Seattle, Denver, NYC? [Anonymous copy of resume] (http://www.mediafire.com/view/rvvaxrq7crb0wh1/anon_resume.pdf). Is my lack of transcripts/degree/certs just as much of a barrier there as seems to be in my non-tech hometown?

2) I'm willing to work for minimum wage or even free if it involves code or a terminal so I can finally get my hand stamped to be in the IT/software club. I'd rather code for free than go back to mindless office jobs. Can I get internships out of school? Is my age (now 30) a massive problem? I'll take *anything* to get started. I realize I screwed up coasting on benefits and lucky timing crypto adventures during school instead of working.

3) I'm not exactly afraid of the whiteboard, I prototype/brainstorm on paper and whiteboards all the time. I'm pretty confident about a lot of basic DS &amp; Algo's (stack, queue, LL, recursive algos, sorting algos, etc) - but reading *Cracking the Coding Interview* made me feel like I'm not ready in the slightest. I just read it over the weekend and intend to keep hammering out challenges. Is every interview process and whiteboard session in tech cities as comprehensive and intimidating as the ones described for the top companies the book?

4) Any suggestions? Did I get serious too late? Did I screw myself with the past 5 years of no official paychecks? I filed my crypto stuff in taxes but no one around here takes my crypto stint seriously as a job, even though I was putting in 100+ hours a week on it and living off it. Any guidance would be massively appreciated."

**Background and miscellaneous crap first (I have no clue what's relevant and what isn't):** I'm a caucasian male from Brooklyn at the end of my junior year. My mom has a bachelor's degree from Pace University. My dad has a bachelor's degree from NYU, master's degrees from CUNY Brooklyn College and Fordham University, and is currently a PhD student at Adelphi University. I suffer from panic disorder w/ agoraphobia so staying at home in NYC might serve me well (or kill me, I'm not sure). We're nowhere near well-off, yet my parents insist that they want to pay for my college. I have no idea what I want to major in. I think I want to be a doctor but I'm far from sure. Majors that I've been interested when browsing include Biology, Neuroscience, Anthropology, Political Science, Public Policy, and International Development Studies. Schools that I'm heavily interested in include CUNY City College (Macaulay Honors, possibly also the biomedical program, but I'm not hopeful on making either), SUNY Stony Brook University, SUNY Binghamton University, University of Toronto, McGill University, and New York University (ridiculously expensive and I have no idea how my family would afford it). I love living in the city. I'm particularly attracted to McGill due to the reputation, cost, being far away from home, quality of education, and the opportunity to immerse myself in the French language.

I know I should have started earlier to get better chances. I have had 4-5 phone interviews, 2-3 technical interviews, and 1 onsite (which I didnt do too well but get the results in a few days). Oddly, a google recruiter contacted me 2 days after applying so I have that interview to do. I have a 3.2 gpa, technical work at campus department, no internships at tech comapnies, and 3-4 Android projects.

I have exhausted indeed, glassdoor, dice, linkedin, and other job board new grad/entry level software engineering positions. I dont know what to do anymore besides just applying to more. I just need to get my foot in the door but I dont think many companies are willing to accept a new grad with little experience. 

Any advice, feedback, etc is welcome. I know there are no magical solutions so even resources/tips to find more jobs is welcome.

Edit: I never said or think the Bay Area is the best place to work nor do I think its some kind of Disneyland for SE jobs. I live in the Bay so that is naturally where I would apply to work. The Bay and Silicon Valley are large areas and have lots of opportunities but I feel I have applied to most of the job opportunities or at least those jobs are getting increasingly difficult to find.

I work basic tech support for a company that has roughly 700 employees. I do much of the easy tasks whenever we get requests into our ticketing system. Mostly toner changes some troubleshooting and installing software here and there. This is my second time at the job as I have only worked there during the summer as a sort of ""intern,"" but I have learned a lot and have seen a fair share of ridiculous requests and issues. My future posts, will be shorter and better formatted as I get the hang of typing these up. To the story!

This happened just a little while ago. I end my day at 5-5:30PM. One of the analysts in a different office takes over watching what issues come in after my help desk cohorts and I leave for the day. My mom, who also works in IT at this company is in charge of the 24/7 phone. It's name explains itself, it is used to go over what issues come in after hours and reply to anything that is especially urgent.

She picks up the phone and begins reading one of the emails that came in,""The laptop bag I was using to store the tablet in has been stolen from my car. Can you shut off the tablet ASAP?""

I chuckle, ""Well, that's not happening tonight.""

Some background, One of our junior network admins spent several hours creating the image to drop onto the tablet and then I spent another hour packaging that one and a number of other tablets to be shipped out to our sales people, who get pretty much whatever they ask for. 
Of course, there's nothing we can do at the moment. Tomorrow morning is going to be interesting. I will update with more information as we research the issue. 

Thanks, Theprofessor23



EDIT: The one way we could track it would be to turn the Verizon Air Card that is installed in it, back on and have them track it. That didn't seem like an option that the team was going to take. The sales guy will just have to file a police report. Not a storybook ending, but that's how the cards fall in this case. "

My time in university was rushed; I transferred from a state university to a ""better"" university after 2 years because my parents kept nagging at me that the former wasn't a real university. (For those of you familiar with colleges in California, I went from a CSU to a UC.) I then proceeded to cram in classes and summer sessions, because my parents kept nagging at me to graduate within 4 years total and that they didn't have enough money to keep me in school. So I graduated, without an internship, without talking to any professors/counselors/whatever about my career choices and where to go from there. I finally got my current job through a friend, after half-assing the job search for half a year. I've been at my current company for just over 3 years now. Didn't do much for the first year an a half or so because the team I got hired onto kept running into rough patches with managers, and frequently didn't have one. And I was stuck working with a ""senior"" software engineer who frequently didn't understand the task given to him and refused to listen to anyone else opinion.

**TL;DR**: Rushed to get a degree, never did any internships, only got current job through connections. Had current job for 3 years, with the first year and a half pretty much being wasted.


I just recently had my first software release of any kind, an Android app that is meant to be used along with one of our hardware products. The reviews on it are terrible, because of a certain way the app behaves. And because of that, the reviews on the hardware are terrible too. I made fixes that completely changed the way the app behaves and now we've been trying to push an update to the Play store for a month now except... The QA team keeps finding new bugs. Nothing that crashes the app, just UX related things.

This is the first Android app I've ever written, this is my first time coding in Java, and I was the sole developer. I'm actually a little proud of myself for how it turned out regardless of the bugs. But I just feel so shitty about my abilities as a developer. We're blocked on releasing the update that we desperately need, but QA keeps finding these bugs due to my shitty coding.

Is what I'm feeling normal? Is this software update QA process normal? What should I be doing to avoid these kinds of situations in the future? I feel like I'm missing something important in the development process that no one ever told me about..."

I was wondering if anyone has some insights to help me.

This summer I have two options:

1.) Find an engineering related summer internship.

2.) Start early this summer on my graduate practicum project so I will be able to accomplish a bigger project.

My M.Eng program is only 2 semesters long (9 months). I will be taking 7 grad courses (spread throughout both semesters) on top of the graduate project. 

I was hoping to start early this summer on the graduate project with full-time effort from July - August, and part-time effort from Sept to May. This is only if my summer is available. 

But if I do a 9-week internship this summer instead, I don't know what show-worthy practicum project I can do within the time-frame of 9 months (Sept - May) on top of 7 grad courses. At the same time, an internship is valuable to get a job after graduation.

I am grateful for any advice. Thank you guys!"

 One of them basically entails teaching younger children how to write basic code in java and build stuff with Arduino kits. I don't know if there is any financial compensation for this one, but I'm meeting with the coordinator tomorrow for more info.

 The other one is an internship for an IT Support Specialist role. It pays 12$/hr , but since I'm not even an IT student I don't know how beneficial it will be. However, I do work for the IT department at my university as tier 1 support and this internship is essentially ""tier 2"" support. I can use this internship as a way to get promoted to part time tier 2 at my universities IT department when school starts again this fall. It will basically pay a little more, and possibly open more doors if I want to continue working for the employer or my schools IT department after graduation.

What I really want is to earn a more prestigious internship next summer once I have learned more skills. Will having an internship this summer help with that? Any suggestions as to which one I should go for?

- I've had a job and two design/architecture-related internships that are also leaking into the summer
- intended to transfer into Berkeley or LA for architecture/CMU for industrial design

I know, I know. I fucking blew it. These are top tier schools and even if I had a perfect gpa this summer, it'd be difficult for the colleges to see past my dismal fucking first semester gpa. I also wouldn't be able to remedy the D in time for UC apps, so it'd look worse. I probably shouldn't apply immediately this fall, but I still will just to chance it. Now that the pity party's over, just how likely would it be to get into these schools in those majors. How good do my ecs have to be to carry me over, or is it impossible?

I'm a 3rd year environmental engineer from Canada.  This summer I have gotten an internship working for the 'Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation' partnered with the Vishwakarma Institute of Technology in Pune, India.  I am living here for three months while helping design this deployable toilet system and I'm looking for some help/ideas that we could use to help complete this project!

The project:

We are trying to design a toilet system that is completely off the grid, requires no external energy, and is not harmful to the environment in any way.  Money is also an issue, we are looking to be able to mass produce these toilet systems for around $800 US.  The most difficult aspect of the design is that toilet system must be able to last for ~5 years without any maintenance.  What we have so far/what we are looking into:

-A septic tank system that runs under thermophilic conditions (2 compartment septic tank that use 'I' or 'T' baffles)

-This will be connected to a pump that will pump water through 2 self backwashing charcoal filters (After testing, this still leaves some suspended solids in the liquid, not sure what else to use? membranes clog too easily and can be quite expensive)

-For disinfection we are currently looking at 3 options; Ozone, Solar Disinfection, and Biosand Filtration.

-Ozone is looking the most promising and we are set to start testing it in the next few weeks. 

-Solar Disinfection is cheap but can't work at night/monsoon season/with bird faeces blocking the sun

-Biosand filters seem very cool/interesting but issues with backwashing (dump and swirl) and time (allowing the biofilm to generate)

-We plan on using a solar panel to run the pump, possibly the ozone generator, as well as to help heat the septic tank to thermophilic conditions

-The biogas created within septic tank/digester will also be used to help heat the tank 

Any help or ideas will be greatly appreciated by our design team and more importantly by the people this system is going to help.  Thank you!"

Currently I've been interning at a mobile apps company for the last 2.5 weeks, but I'm starting to feel like maybe I'm just not cut out to be a programmer.

I mean, I'm fucking lost. Maybe it's due to the training, or maybe I'm just terrible at programming, or maybe it's both. For my training, my supervisor just linked me a bunch of websites with tutorials for Android development and gave me a few simple app challenges to program. I'm just so fucking lost. 

Every day I just read up a bunch of tutorials that make no fucking sense to me, try to mash the example codes together with my codes and somehow figure some way to make the damn thing work. I get it done eventually, except it takes me twice the time and I still can't quite seem to grasp how the system architecture works. It hurts my head trying to figure things out that my brain usually shuts off from stress an hour or two after lunch. Yeah okay I can tweak someone's code to make it do what I want, but if you left me alone I'd have no fucking idea what to do.

And I guess I'm feeling a little bit demoralized because I always thought mobile phone programming is ""easier"" since the framework is already provided and you don't need to code things from scratch, but I'm struggling so hard with it now. I have classmates who can code amazing apps and they were self-taught. But I have no bloody passion to go study all of this on my own.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Apart from that, I just have so many people giving me a completely shocked expression when I tell them I'm a programmer. I'm a girl and everyone always asks me why would I want to do something like this. People (including colleagues) often tell me that I'm gorgeous, speak really well and have a really nice voice, and they even go so far as to say that it's a waste to keep me copped up behind a computer screen.

Sure, I know it doesn't matter what people think as long as you enjoy what you're doing right? Well, I'm not sure I really enjoy it either. Apart from whatever I listed above, I was also quite a different person when I entered my computer science course. Shy, nerdy, ugly; didn't talk or socialize around much; always alone, but I'm completely the opposite of that now. When I look around my department, it's filled with socially awkward foreigners from Vietnam, Myanmmar, India and China. And these just aren't the kind of people I look forward to being around every day at work. I tend to click better with girls and so far I've mostly been hanging around with people from the other departments rather than my own.

I'm really lost with what I want to do as a career. What other jobs besides programming can I do with a computer science degree?"

Since there is so much information in a PDB file and it's not just a list of numbers, I don't know how to start. I have [ProDy](http://prody.csb.pitt.edu/) installed and that has functions to parse PDB files. Is there a way to bring those methods into the Spark Python shell?

Edit: 
So far I followed this [tutorial](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html) and created an RDD of the pdb. So I know how to count the number of items in the file and view the first line, but I'm stuck otherwise...

I just finished my sophomore year in high school, and, my grades were terrible. I want to pursue a degree in Computer Science/Computer Engineering.


I got a C+ recently in AP Calculus AB, and I don't know what to do now, I was literally crying when I got my report card and now I am all depressed. I will be going to BC next year, so hopefully those grades can compensate.


For now, my GPA is:

 
Weighted: 3.79


Unweighted: 3.35


Total: 3.8


However, by end of junior year I should be able to increase my grade dramatically up to a 4.04 because of AP classes.


Is there any other way for me to increase my chances to get into college going into junior year and senior year. For example, is there anything I should do in my college application that can help to boost my chances?



Here are some stats about me that could go into consideration:


-California Resident


-Asian Male


-Total 11 AP's projected: AP Calculus AB+BC, AP Computer Science, AP Statistics, AP World History, APUSH, AP Psychology, AP English Language, AP Chemistry, AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP Physics C: E&amp;M


-Finished AP Calculus AB and APUSH


-AP's will be either 4's or 5's, but mainly 5's


-2350 SAT


-I will be applying for Computer Science/Computer Engineering


-Currently won first hackathon I ever went to, will be going to more hackathons sooner (win maybe 3-4 more?)


-Leader of Website of Robotics club (future president?)


-Outreach in the Appalachian Mountains to help restore the environment as part of community service, as well as helping locally for the poor


-Over 150 hours in children's museum


-In school's Math Team and Programming Club Leader


-Knowledgeable in more than 10 programming languages


-Piano for 7 years


-First one in family to go to American college


-Planning to do an internship somewhere?









Also, with these statistics, which universities will I have a chance to get admission into?

If I get into one of these schools I will be more than elated- I love almost any of these schools equally:


-USC


-UCLA


-UC Davis


-UCSD


-UT Austin


-Georgia Tech


-Carnegie Mellon


-UC Berkeley


Saftey/ I will be not happy to get into any of these:


-UIUC


-UC Irvine


-San Jose State University


-Cal Poly SLO




I am literally feeling so depressed because of my GPA right now, because I badly wanted to go to UC Berkeley. Is there anything I can do at this stage that can help me stand a chance against other applicants? I still have all of junior year and senior year to make a ""difference"" to help me stand out, I just don't know what to do. Sorry for the billion questions and the wall of text, but I appreciate any kind of input. Thanks."

I am ecstatic but at the same time very nervous and scared. She wants to take things slow, which I completely understand, but I don’t know how to handle this or how I should be. I want to spend time with her when I can (havent seen her in a year) but I don’t want to be needy and I want to know that she needs me as well. I’ve changed for myself and of course, in part, for her, but she hasn’t done much (aside from being more understanding and letting things go), which I value just as much, but I feel like she has all the power to make or break. Do any of y’all have any advice for me? Things to do and not to do, to look for? She has said previously that she still has feelings for me, although that was a while back, but the talking only increased, so I believe it safe to say that the feelings still remain, just not like they were before. Thank you for listening!"

I went in with little to no programming experience, but I seem to be able to pick up on everything pretty quick. Granted I am a sophomore, but I feel that I am not learning much that will be able to get me an internship or have anything to offer at an internship which would obviously be extremely useful when looking for a job. I feel that I should be doing more to help myself but am not sure what to do or where to start that can really help me get the knowledge I need. I really want to excel in my field so I guess what I'm asking is what is your advice to a college student studying computer science to get the skills needed that they don't teach in school? Or what would be helpful in starting a path towards a career?"

I'm quite upset. I was scheduled to start working at a well funded start up next week and I got a call today saying that ""our (they) hiring needs changed and we can't take on any interns."" At the moment I'm screwed for the summer; it especially sucks since I turned down an internship at a major tech firm for this company. 

Does anyone know of any companies still looking for interns? It's really late in the game I can't imagine any are companies still hiring for the summer. I can show my resume to anyone who may want an intern. 

Thanks! "

I'm not supposed to be here -- as in on Reddit -- right now. I'm not supposed to have another part of my story to tell. 

About a month and a half ago, things started getting a little weird for me. I started seeing friends in places I knew they couldn't be and started hearing noises I knew I shouldn't be hearing and my dogs started barking at things that wouldn't normally have been barked at. This was all, I assumed, due to the fact that a cop that had become obsessed with my mom when was younger had cursed my family with something that could only exist in a world where hell is real. We dealt with these problems for a little while, until a week ago, when everything finally resided. I'll post the links to my first few parts up above so you can check that out to fully understand what I'm saying. And then, just a few days ago, I decided to post my story on to here. 

I know it sounds ridiculous, I really do. To sit here and try and tell you that my family and I were being tormented by a demon in a top hat sounds ludicrous and to tell you that our solution to get rid of it was to go to a church and have ourselves prayed over sounds even worse. I was surprised when I got comments of disappointment on my last update, with people saying things along the line of:

- I hate when the story ends with the family being prayed over. It's so cliched and overdone. 
 
and:

- Great story, but disappointing ending! Just not super believable. 

I was even more surprised -- offended, even -- when I got comments of people making fun of my story and what happened to my family and I. 

I'm sorry that my ending was too cliched for you. I'm sorry that you love hearing stories of demons taking over and ruining peoples lives, but hate it when they end on a happy note. Realistically, people, if there is a hell, then there is also a heaven. 

Despite the comments, I was just relieved to have gotten my story out there and off my chest. I was proud of myself for not fictionalizing anything. I was proud for not acting like I was writing this story on my phone because I was in a rush or claiming anything had happened to me when it didn't. So I decided to go out and get off of here for a while. Go enjoy my summer for a bit -- get some sun, go to the beach, get pumped for next semester and talk to my best friend about the internship he was doing this summer...the one that I'll be joining him on next year. Unfortunately for me, I didn't even last one day. 

For yesterday morning, it happened again. 

I woke up pretty early for a summer morning. I had no work that day or anything, but a daily call from my best friend scheduled at some time before nine had me up. I stayed in bed when we talked and kept my curtains drawn. I could hear my dad and sister downstairs, the television blaring. He would stay with her until her nanny got there at around ten, when he would leave for work. My mom had already left and I figured my brother was still asleep in his room. When the call was over I got up and opened my blinds and turned my fan down to a lower setting. I waved downstairs to my dad who was getting ready to leave -- the nanny had just gotten here, as made clear by Abby and Lucy's barking -- and then locked myself in the bathroom for a shower. Throwing my boxers into the hamper, I turned the water on and waited for it to get warm. 

It didn't. Sticking my hand under the shower head, I was surprised by how cold the water actually was. It was too early for the hot water heater to have been turned off so I tried turning the water off and on again. This didn't really help too much, so I decided to just make my shower quick. Taking no more than five minutes, I dried myself off with a towel and got dressed. When I got downstairs to eat breakfast, I was greeted by a note on the table. Written in my sister's nanny's handwriting it said something along the lines of:

*Taken Becca for a walk. Didn't bring a key. If you leave please keep front door unlocked. Thank you!*

I proceeded to make myself breakfast and head back upstairs, logging in to my computer. I went around online for a bit until I got a text from my neighbor, the one I mentioned very, very briefly at the beginning of my first post, where I brought up the fact that I work at Chipotle with my neighbor and my best friend. My neighbor is the one that got me the job in the first place. I guess she was just heading out for work when she sent me the following text:

Kiyah: Hey, just making sure nobody's kidnapping Becca. Saw her holding hands with a fat lady down the street haha

I responded immediately, laughing. 

Me: No, she's all good. It's just her nanny or whatever to help watch her over the summer when my parents are working! Speaking of which, is that where you're going now?!

She took a little while to respond. Becca and her nanny where still not back from their walk. 

Kiyah: ""Yeah, I just got here lol I'm in the parking lot now. And oh that's cool, but why did they hire two? Has Becca gotten that out of control?! Hahaha

I made a face. 

Me: Two? As in two nannys? 

Kiyah: I really need to get going! But yeah? Does she not actually have two? Did I actually just witness her kidnapping? lol

Me: No, seriously...she just has the one! The fatter lady, right?! I hope that's the only person she was holding hands with...

The last series of texts she sent me made the hair on my arms stand up.

Kiyah: I mean she wasn't holding hands with the guy, he was just kind of walking behind them

Kiyah: I guess maybe he wasn't with them? He was walking kind of close though 

Kiyah: He was also dressed kind of weirdly. Not like the fat lady. He was wearing all black and had this weird ass hat on

Kiyah: A top hat, I think

Kiyah: But anyways I really have to go so see you later! 

I waited after that downstairs for Becca and her nanny to return. And when they did, it was just them. No man following behind them or anything. I quietly asked the nanny how the walk went and she said that it was fine. She also commented on how chatty Becca was being today, remarking that her speech therapy must be going well. 

I asked what she meant by that and the nanny responded with:

""Oh, I don't know. Just chattier. Happier. She kept turning around and waving. I thought maybe she was just interacting with the neighbors around us, but I don't know. I think she might have an imaginary friend! She kept calling his name and telling him to hurry up, it was--""

I cut her off. 

""His name?"" I asked. 

The nanny frowned, surprised that nobody else in my family had heard her mention this before. *She talks with him all the time when I'm here,* she told me. She then told me his name. I could swear that when she said it the room got a little colder. 

And then that's it. Nothing else weird happened that day or last night. This morning was fine and this afternoon is going well. But I don't know what's going on. I thought that maybe I had made a mistake by telling my story on here and that by paying him attention, he would come back. I think I've just learned, though, that he never left. 

I don't want to say his name. Not unless, of course, you think any of you can help. I googled it and got nothing...nothing related to a man in a top hat, at least. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to tell my parents...I'm probably just still anxious, right? Kids have imaginary friends...and if her nanny said that she's had him before then it's probably harmless. I just can't shake what Kiyah sent me. I tried calling her last night to ask her again about it but she didn't answer. I sent her a text this morning too and she still hasn't read it. 

I can hear my little sister giggling downstairs now and I'm scared. Any help would be appreciated.

I don't know what I am doing anymore. I recently married and my spouse decided we should move states for a fresh start. It went terribly. We thought we could find a job and a little apartment then move on to our future careers, but no. We were desperate for work, and took what was offered us. It's retail.

Both of us are college graduates. My degree is a useless General Studies degree. My original degree was going to be in Social Work, but after a falling out in an internship, I had to either choose this degree or not graduated at all. His degree is History. He wanted to be a teacher but now he says he doesn't know.  I plan on returning to college once I am considered a state resident in a year (that's the wait time to be considered resident). There, I plan on taking Computer Science.

I want to be in software. I am reading books on Python, Java and Jquery, and C. But now I fear this won't work. I can't find an apprenticeship in my area, and with the deadline of having to find our own place coming dreadfully close, I am beginning to lose all hope. If we can't find an apartment, we will have to live in a tiny cabin with my husband's parents. I feel so embarrassed because we made a risk and it failed miserably. Now I want to pick up the pieces. I just... I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like it's all over.

(Sorry if this is not the right format or type of posts),TheHamburgerlar,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/38fw79/career_advice_job_change_background_sorry_if_this/,"I'll keep this as short as possible, since well, I'm at work and nobody wants to read a summary of my life.

Long story short, I graduated in December 2012 and landed a job at a small bio company shortly thereafter in June 2013. As for what I do, it had nothing to do with my degree (like in many cases) but it was my first ""high"" paying job and I enjoyed the money/experience I was getting. Fast forward 2 years later. I feel like I've experienced all I could experience here and saved up enough to do what I want for a while (it was never really about the money to begin with, but the money and safety and health benefits kept me around for an additional 1year).  It's not that I absolutely hate my job, because it's so easy I have time to do whatever I want (ie: Facebook, reddit, youtube, phone), but I do feel like I'm wasting my time now and this is definitely not a career job. This is not a career job and I do not know how stable it will be in the future (50k/year + benefits at the moment but there's no direction or growth possibilities and I'm only 26) I wish I took the time to learn more skills, which I'm doing now for SQL, but I do not know how much that will apply for me in search of a new job more towards my future/career.

So that's my current situation. Here's a short summary of what I'm doing and where I want to go.

Graduated: Undegrad BS in Decision Science (Business, Data Analysis, Management) 

Experience: Sales at Gap, Intern at a Developer company, and currently a Bio Company

Brief Current job description: Bio company looking at compatibility of patients to the device. (Ie: photos come in of the patients from hospitals. I kind of examine it and put it into files send it to my higher up to see if they are compatible to use the device.) in addition to this, I record everything on Excel and Netsuite and write reports here and there about the Rates that are ruled as compatible or not compatible (reasons why it might not be) - **this is the only thing I really enjoy about my current job because it has somewhat to do with my skills/strengths.**

Skills: Primary Excel, learning some SQL basics which I really hope might help me land a job as a Data Analysis or an Analyst for a particular business.

TLDR: **I want to contribute to the growth of a company and really analyze the business aspects of things. And I know my excel skills are relatively top notch for what businesses looks for in an analyst. IE: Basic Formulas, data filtration, pivot tables, formatting spreadsheets, and graph creations. I'm trying to learn more right now such as SQL and apply it to my resume/assets but it might be hard given how that's unrelated to my current job right now. I've also reached a threshold at how much more time I can waste here. It's difficult enough waking up every morning and round trip driving 2+hour in traffic to do something I don't have any desire to do.**

Suggestions on what to look for on sites like indeed, careerbuilder, etc and job position titles that might be viable to what was posted here? I'll post my resume in the resume section too for critique but this might help me get a jump start in my search for a career job.

38fype,2,2015-06-03,"[Long] Turning 18, need to move but no where to go.",ImNearlyHomeless,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/38fype/long_turning_18_need_to_move_but_no_where_to_go/,"This is a fairly difficult situation (at least for me), and please forgive me if you don't understand some parts that I may cut out just due to them being too personal. And thanks in advance for taking the time to read it. Sorry for such a long thing, but I feel like I needed to say everything in order for it to make sense... and I had to get this off my chest after all these years.

So let's see.. where to start.

I'm the 2nd oldest child in a family of 5. I have 3 sisters: one older and two younger. I don't have any brothers. We (my 2 younger sisters and I) live with my mother, as I'm currently 17 (i'll be turning 18 on Sunday) and finishing school this month. 

My 3 sisters all have the same father, but I don't. Without disrespecting my mother, I'll just say that she was 19 when she had my oldest sister and with a guy I'll call Joe. She fell in love with Joe at a young age, but didn't marry him and living in the city, it wasn't too uncommon for that. But when she was pregnant with my oldest sister, he started to hurt her and so she left him and began to live alone.

 I should also note that her side of the family is a bunch of racist alcoholic nooks who don't give a damn about anything but themselves, so nobody was there to help her. She had also got into some drugs and violence, but she was never a hardcore addict and she absolutely doesn't look it today. She'd been involved in minor gang activity, but the gang wasn't very large and they apparently didn't have a problem with her leaving (as she was pregnant). 

&gt; Randomly inserting this, but I should say that my mother is blind in one eye, and she doesn't own a vehicle nor can she drive. She got her license suspended after receiving too many DUIs (at age 18).

So after leaving Joe, she had my first sister. Everything was fine for her, since she had previously worked at a diner and was able to support her and her new daughter (my oldest sister). A few years later, she started seeing another guy and that's how she got pregnant with me. Though, like with Joe, he became violent and she left him. And shortly after my birth, she returned to Joe (I don't know why) and eventually had my other two younger sisters. I don't know why she did these things, but I can't hate her for it and there's no point in judging her now since it will do nothing but make her feel useless, which I absolutely do not want to do. There's nothing I could've done, we're all different and we all make mistakes and poor decisions sometimes too.

When she had my last sister, she moved from the city, with all of us, to New York. She was unemployed after I was born, since she was receiving money from Joe. After moving to New York, we lived alone for a few years and everything seemed to be okay. She was receiving social security / disability (I'm not really sure which or how it works.. sorry. I also can't explain why, because I'm not too sure), as she still does today, for 4 children so supporting us was not a problem. However, neither my father nor my sisters' paid child support so that was an unfortunate burden but we never struggled for food or clothes or any of that. In New York, we moved to a very very small town where we still live today. This town is beautiful, however there is nothing to do and the nearest fast food restaurant is an hour away, and there are scarce amounts of jobs which usually require a lot of physical labor (such as farming).

She met a new guy, I'll call him Tim. Tim was a great guy, I really mean it. He was the father I had always wished for. He loved the outdoors, he was really friendly and funny, he had a good job, and he was just an honest guy. When my mother began dating him, she fell in love again. But I think that she felt that this was definitely love compared to the other two times. She was really serious about this guy. And for the next few years, they dated and became engaged, and overall everything was great. We were financially stable, everyone was happy, and we had a nice home. We later moved to a larger house, simply because the first one was a 3 bedroom, and 4 bedroom would've suited better so my oldest sister could have privacy and we could have more space and such. There were also 3 of us in school, and my youngest sister began the year we moved. It wasn't a far move, just a few miles away.

Everything was great, including the new home. But a year or two after moving, Tim got laid off from work. This was around 2006 or 2007 when the economy in the US was kind of going to shit (or I think anyway, somewhere around then..). Unemployment wasn't really helping much, so Tim searched for a job and found one just a few hours away. Tim owned a vehicle and such, so it was fine. For a while again, everything was okay. But when my oldest sister, who I'll call Haley, was 18, she became really depressed. School was difficult for her, like for a lot of people, and she was bullied daily. The school she attended only had 200 students and it was a K-12 school, but bullying happens everywhere and her classmates didn't like her for reasons I don't know. She became anorexic and suicidal and she cut her wrists. One day when she cut too deep, am ambulance was called and she was brought to a hospital an hour away (as it was the only city with a hospital capable of such care). This happened multiple times, but eventually my mother couldn't handle it anymore and made the decision to send Haley to a mental hospital where she could be helped by professionals around the clock. Keep in mind that the rest of us 3 were children, so we were scared and we didn't really understand what was going on. 

After a few months, Haley seemed to be doing well and returned home, but changed schools. For a while it was okay, but again Haley fell into a severe depression which led to self-harm and then back to the mental hospital. This happened a handful of times, around 6 or 7, but then my mom had met with social workers who thought the best thing to do in this situation was to switch my sister to a different mental-hospital-like residency where she could feel more freedom but also be safe and not being a danger to others in our home. Every few months, we'd visit her and everything was kind of okay. But as a result, my mom didn't receive money for her (since she was not living with us anymore), which wasn't initially a problem.

But of course, for whatever reason, my family doesn't seem to have the best luck. While my sister was away, she decided to come out and say that Tim had molested her. Despite the fact that people knew she was probably lying, New York especially takes it very seriously and investigates these crimes. Immediately Tim's reputation was ruined. He lost his job, he had to move out from our house because he was a 'danger' and he had to move back in with his father. This wasn't only a huge problem for Tim, but also for us. This meant that the only income my mom received was for us 3 remaining children, which really wasn't a whole lot. At some point, they cut the amount they were able to give, for reasons I'm not sure of. 

After a few months of looking into Tim's case, they found him innocent. However, it was decided by social services that it was best if he didn't return home simply because there would be too many questions asked and living in the small town we did, our family would have a poor image. So he left.. and we haven't talked to him since.

This is where things really began to fall apart.


So now my single mother was supporting a family on disability/ss checks. If anyone reading this receives them or know someone who does, you'll know that it helps but it's definitely not something you can raise a family off of in the 2000s. Food stamps don't go as far now as they used to. And 3 growing children and an adult eat a lot more food than people may think.

So now, for the past few years, it's been a struggle growing up and my mom has done everything she can to make sure that we're doing okay in school and that we have food and clothes and things to make us happy. She always put us first, and I always worried that she wasn't happy and that she never had much of her own. But she smiled as much as she could in front of us. 

When I hit 9th grade, I became depressed just from all the stress around me and academics suddenly mattered and were a bit too difficult for me. I was suicidal and I attempted suicide once, but I was more concerned with peoples' feelings if I was gone than my own, so thankfully I was able to control myself and talk myself out of it. Despite not feeling like dying, I still felt like shit and I didn't give a damn about school and I cried a lot. I didn't have any friends, only classmates I occasionally talked to. The teachers didn't understand and some didn't even care at all what I was going through. The school counselor was a bitch and all she cared about was people saying she did a good job, when she did the opposite. Throughout my 4 years of highschool, she hadn't helped me at all, and even made some of my situations worse. I felt like I had no one, but I kind of went on feeling empty for the rest of my 9th grade year and barely passed with a 70 GPA (per 100 scale). To add to it, we have to buy our own review books to study for the regents exam, which we will use in class (Regents Exams are just New York's official tests). We all had to bring in $5 and the school covered the rest of the money, but I literally didn't have $5. Five whole dollars. So as weeks went by, the teacher would ask me when I would bring money in, and I said soon.. I didn't know what to do. Well one day, the teacher flipped out on me and yelled and said it wasn't fair to the rest of the class that I wasn't bringing in 5 damn dollars for a review book that I needed in order to pass the class. I'm a pretty strong person emotionally, but this really made me break down and cry.. It's so hard to believe that you don't have $5 until you really just don't have it. Nobody understands until they're in that position. I talked to him after class and explained that I just don't have $5 and I won't have it anytime soon.. and it was as if something just clicked in his mind and he looked at me and said that it was okay. But the way he said it was like he kind of understood, or at least a small bit.

In 10th grade, it got even more difficult. On top of everything that was going on, my mom was diagnosed with throat cancer, lung cancer, and another cancer (I can't remember). She 
underwent multiple surgeries and thankfully was able to have all the cancer removed. She also got her thyroid removed, and was put on a lot of medication (on top of the rest of her medication such as xanax). Being the 'mother' of the house, she felt like her role was crippled and that there was nothing she could do until she recovered. It was difficult to try and care for her, since my two younger sisters aren't the most cooperative of people.. but we managed. 

In my 11th grade year, my mother was better but our financial status was the same: horrible. Not being able to drive anywhere and having to rely on our grandmother to bring us anywhere.. not having food after the 15th of the month because food stamps didn't help that much.. Having to go to the food shelter every week just to try and help, and it still wasn't enough.. Living in an old house that was disgusting and had black mold on the ceiling in the bathroom and exposed pipes everywhere, and shitty wallpapers and really needed painting and yardwork.. Couldn't afford paint for the house, couldn't afford gas for the lawnmower, couldn't afford anything for house repairs. The whole environment just kept the mood low.

And now, senior year, I'm finishing school. This is the year that most people finalize their college decisions and attempt to get some job shadowing experience or even internships if possible. I also did a job shadow, and it was great. But that's not really important. 
So in the location I live, it's impossible to find a job. Even 14 years after living here, there haven't been any new job opportunities. If I could find a job here to support my family, by all means I would. But it's just not an option. This year, I made college plans but of course it was impossible for me to follow through with them. I want to study computer science at a college that's right for me, not some shitty dumpster college that's overpriced and has a horrible environment and tons of campus crimes. But I just can't afford it. Even the cheapest of the community colleges isn't an option, because I can't pay the smallest fees. I have applied for at least 50 proper scholarships, and I have only received 2. One only applies if I go to that school, which'll be a $2500 discounts from a $50,000 yearly cost.. impossible for me to even dream of. The other one applies only if I maintain certain grades for the first two years, and it's only worth $200.. sure it's $200 more than I had to start but.. it just feels like nothing... like a drop in the bucket that has evaporated. I have absolutely no money for college, it was impossible to start a college fund, and there is no place here to work where I can save money to do anything. I hear about all my friends going to these great colleges, because their parents can afford to help them and because they already had a good financial setting they will have no issues going to any university they'd like. But me.. I can't even go to an okay one. It's really hard to hear your friends talk about it all the time, and when they ask you... what am I supposed to say? I just tell them I'm taking a gap year, because it's the easiest to say. But in reality, I know I'm fucked and I don't have any idea if I'll be able to go to college. 

So the college and finance issues have gone all this time, until now.. and it's the final problem to just kill me inside.


Since I'm turning 18, I'll no longer be on my mom's SS case... meaning that she'll receive a reduced amount of ss money as well as food stamps. After figuring bills for the month and food and budgeting everything.. I know that it's impossible for me to stay here. It's just not. And I don't know what to do. I can't afford to move out, and I have no where to go. No friends or family to stay with, and no where to offer me a place in exchange for work. I'm in such a bad position, and I'm so confused and upset and I'm trying not to be depressed because it would only make things worse. My mom really doesn't want me to leave until I'm able to go off to college or have a good job. She's not ready for me to stop being a child, like most mothers. But my mother.. she often asks... ""Am I a failure?""...

If you've never heard this question, it's the hardest one I've ever had to hear. My own other asking me if she's a failure. If she's a bad mom. If she could've done anything differently. If she made too many mistakes.. 

Of course I tell her no and that she's a great mom, but just the fact that she thinks about it.. it's really upsetting and I hate to see my mother that way, it's horrible and I'd never want to wish the same upon anyone. 


By July 1st, bills will become too much of an issue and we'll essentially be evicted from our home since we'll be unable to pay rent with all of the other bills. 



I really just don't know what to do, and I've tried anything I can think of. I've asked for professional help and they all give me ambiguous answers like ""have you asked __? oh, they can help you"" which leads me to the next person, and the next.. I spent so much time looking for aid, but there's no one there to help.


And I don't want to be selfish, but I feel like it's my turn to be able to explore life and find things that make me happy and pursue my dreams. I want to go to college. I want to become a software engineer. I want to have a girlfriend, and later a wife and family. I want to travel the world. I've studied Japanese for almost a year now, and I want to study abroad in Japan and even work or live there for a while if possible. I study so much about things I want to do, only to find that there's no hope for me right now.

And some may think ""Well, if you can program stuff, why can't you work from home?"". Well I could, but it's not as easy as you think. I'm not an amazing programmer. I've taught myself everything, and I've only been doing it a few years. I've never worked for a large company, and mostly did small hobby projects and the only money I've made is from private projects for games. I'm not innovative, as I don't have the creative mind to come up with ideas. I'm more of the person who can learn and implement something that already exists. But even then, I'm not a professional programmer like some people may think I am. 

    
I don't really know what else I can say now, but I may edit the post later with some details I forgot. 

Thanks for taking the time to read it.  I really appreciate it.


TL;DR turning 18, have no money, can't go to college, need to move out to help family but no where to go."

38g4od,1,2015-06-03,My roommate is some kind of crazy,vegella,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/38g4od/my_roommate_is_some_kind_of_crazy/,"So my roommate is some kind of klepto or crazy or something. 

Lastest issue is some yarn I left lying around.  I was making balls out of two 500 yd skeins I bought.  One of them got massively tangled and I had to go on a business trip, so I left it out because she said she'd like to give untangling it a go.

I get back and she finished... she said it took her an hour. Strange, since I spent a good 3 hours and got only about halfway through it. But whatever.  I looked at the ball today... and it's only half the size of the other ball. They were the exact same length/size/brand/everything.  Both balls should be the same size.  It's pretty obvious she untangled it for an hour and just cut it to say she was done, which would be whatever... if she had been the one who dropped $30 on it.  If she couldn't untangle it, she should have just left it.

Second problem has been my misplaced packs of birth control.  Every other month or so, I won't be able to find my new pack anywhere.  I'm pretty disorganized and absent minded, so at first I figured I was just misplacing them and would go call the gyno and get another one. Except it's now happened 8 times, and I'm being careful about it now.  Come home from pharmacy, put in drawer next to other pack... and then it's gone the next evening.

I go on a lot of business trips unexpectedly, but she NEVER throws out my leftovers for me in the fridge.  This would be another ""it's whatever"". BUT. She says she's thrown out ""some things"" when I get back... and only my chocolate/chips/ice cream/liquor/etc is missing.  You know, the things that wouldn't go bad.  That salad though is degrading into a pile of mush at the bottom of the veggie crisper though, without fail.

There's also the weird issue of where she says she shares a bunch of hobbies with me (anime, metal, knitting, reading)... but she's never heard of anything I talk about.  I'm not 100% versed at any of those, to be sure, but most people have heard of Pride and Prejudice and a large proportion of people at least know that Cowboy Bebop is an animated series. She allegedly speaks close to fluent French (it's even on her resume), but my boyfriend (who is from there...) can't understand any of the phrases she rattles off.  She backs this up with ""I can't really understand his accent in English either"".

Allegedly she got a job at our crappy company (we work at the same place) because she couldn't take the stress of filling out more than one job application; but she had a 4.0 GPA and a prestigious internship with a major company in our industry, on top of a million scholarships that made her ivy league school ""pretty much free"".

There was the pizza incident.  Me, her, and another coworker were going to order pizza.  She got so mad we didn't want to order from Pizza Hut she STORMED OUT of the room... it would've been fine if she preferred the taste of that to the local place we were ordering from, but she swore up/down/left/right/sideways that the Pizza Hut pizza was a better ""deal"" than the local place, when the local place not only has cheaper pizza's but also gives you every fifth pizza free.

This is slightly more confusing, due to my unwillingness to give out personal info.   There was also the infamous ""contracting"" incident, where she was sent to a client site allegedly to do something relating to some skill she doesn't have yet.  However, she was supposed to perform some other task entirely not related.  The other guys from our company at the site didn't care, since the job she thought she was doing is annoying and tedious.  But the job she was sent for never got done, so the that particular client will only continue their contract on grounds she never goes there again.  She had a meeting with the local manager about it, and her supervisor wound up just getting written off for ""communication issues"".  Possible, but I got sent out for the job after her, and the email the site managers had all included that her task SPECIFICALLY was this one thing she never did.

Strange girl.  She probably has issues.  Thank god I'm moving next week."

38h3nb,4,2015-06-04,Should I learn a new technology stack for internship in California companies?,zero2g,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/38h3nb/should_i_learn_a_new_technology_stack_for/,"Hello. I am currently a 2nd year undergraduate student studying computer engineering. The school I go to have a huge coop program and this fall will be my 3rd internship.

Currently, it is the application period to apply for a position for next term and so far, I have been unsuccessful. The jobs that I have applied are all at start ups or well known companies in California or Washington state (Redmond, Seattle, etc...). Out of the 50 applications I have sent out (our limit for our first batch), over 40 of them have rejected me so far and I have landed absolutely 0 interviews.

Personally, I do not think it's my mark (Currently 3.5 C-GPA, 3.8 previous term) that is affecting my possibilities of getting an interview. I have a fair bit of side project (3 hackathons, a bunch of small random side projects to display my knowledge of algorithms and data structures, working on a fairly medium sized full scale application and also android apps. All are published on Github) along with good evaluations and experience from previous work terms (Full stack dev (Angular, C#, SQLite), App dev/QA (Python, Java, C#)).

When I showed my friends me resume for them to help me understand why am I not getting any interviews at all (my friends have what I would say comparable to what I have, either a bit more side projects or a bit higher mark, most have already secured 3 to 5 interviews), their biggest criticism is that ""No one in California uses .NET or C#"".

On my resume, I do mention the Microsoft technology stack a lot (As I am most familiar with it out of everything). I have mentioned C#, .NET, ASP.NET, Azure, Visual Studios, etc... Now, personally I don't know very much about rumors and stuff, I did check out some of the job qualifications and there is overlap for Java, javascript, python, C++ which I know. There's also technologies like Ruby, NoSQL, PHP, Objective -C which I have yet to learn. I do find usage of Microsoft technology to be more rare in the job postings from California companies at my school.

Basically, the question I have is, with the Microsoft Stack, what is my chance of me finding a good internship in California (in like a big company or a start up)? If it's bad, or if it is more beneficial for me, should I learn a completely new stack that does not rely on the Microsoft Stack and familiarize myself with technologies that is well, considered to be more ""hip"" and ""popular"" in California?

Note, I am not saying that the Microsoft stack is bad. Personally, I love working with the stack because it is so simple, C# is a very elegant language and Visual Studios is awesome. I have bragged that in hackathons, esp working on an app that needs to connect to the internet, I can deploy the back end REST API in a few hours onto Azure. It is definitely a pleasure to use it but I am afraid that since it's not well, ""hip"", it doesn't help me finding good internships in California.

Thank for your help and input."
38hngg,1,2015-06-04,Are friends and family investments a valid data point for investors?,thinglistr,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/38hngg/are_friends_and_family_investments_a_valid_data/,"To keep it short, my parents are giving me what essentially amounts to &gt;&gt;$25k for ""anything I need to do"" to get thinglistr running. While this is *EXTREMELY* helpful (I've already used ~$800 of the funds to incorporate and will be using ~$300 for a small experimental ad campaign), my raising target is ~$150k and they don't have that at their disposal. 

Based on my calculations, this will be enough for me to concentrate on this full-time for a year. I'm the sole developer/founder/salesperson/support lead/social media intern and am somewhat confident that I can raise a team and launch the first public beta of this sucker in six months if I had no full-time obligations. (At the very least, this will help me get someone who can offload my social media responsibilities; social media done right takes much more time than I thought!!!!!)

Because I work full-time however, not only do all of those estimates increase by 2-3x (I can spend six hours on it per day, and that's on a *really* good day), but it also introduces a lot of context switching that slows down both sides of the development pipeline (I've got to roll this *really important* piece of code, but my mockups suck so I need to fix those eventually; shit, I have two coffee/pitch meetings this week and I need to get out early enough so I can post/tweet some events during happy hour to try and gain traction, etc.).

I am also wary about spending that entire investment since, well, parents.

Is this something I can mention to angel investors that I pitch thinglistr as positive reinforcement of the idea?

Me and my partner are currently building our new project in stealth mode. This Project-X took off and spread like wild fire and the fast growth created intensive growing pains.

We're major (double major) geeks and really love the process of creating technology to solve everyday problems. Sure, making money is important but if you are able to solve a problem with your idea, revenue will follow soon after. We are firm believers of that process.

A major trade off to the profession that we've chosen is that we don't get to rest, we're ultimately time-broke and we miss opportunities to meet a lot of cool people from gatherings and online communities. Is this the lifestyle that you are looking for? What do you strive for?

We are shorthanded and we were in the process of putting out feelers for developers and interns in the Los Angeles area but realized there are so much talent nationwide, why limit ourselves? Ultimately, it's the people that makes or breaks a startup.

This may sound cliche, but I have been wanting to work for Google (or any other big SV company. I always associated California with Google) for almost 5 years now. Due to high school and other responsibilities, I never got the chance to really learn more than basic programming.

I am a prospective first yr student as a CS major, and I want to spend the summer before univ learning algorithms as deeply as I can. I have begun [this] (https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/p/challenge-find-minimum-in-subarray) course, and I'll finish it within a week.

What should I do this summer to maximize my chances of getting a Google internship? Any Waterloo specific tips? Like scoring good on course XXX (that way I can brush up my basics in that course)?

How to get resume noticed in the horde of resumes of upper year and more qualified students?

Also it doesn't hurt that they pay handsomely. I talked to some people and they say if I get an SV job at big companies, I can easily save enough money to cover 2A's fees.
So, yeah. that's that.

Thanks for reading!

They seem to like and trust me a lot but dealing with the company's annoying sales goals, working alone 90% of the time, and having to call security on unattended children on the daily is getting taxing. 

I'm in 2nd year of college for Computer Information Systems and I have been unsuccessful as of late with trying to find an internship. However I actually landed an interview for a paid $9/hour IT intern position at one of the best companies in the city. Obviously I'm excited.

However I'm still weary. I don't know how long the position is for, what the hours are like, and really anything else aside from the title ""IT Internship"" and that it seems like I'm under qualified. Also I was going to save for a car but if I get this job most of my money will go toward the train to get there.

My question is do I have to go into this interview with the full committed mindset that I will take it if they offer it to me? Also any other thoughts on my decision?"
38irrl,2,2015-06-04,Long Hair Internship Help?!,DTraindom,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/38irrl/long_hair_internship_help/,"Hi everyone. I'm new to this forum and I was hoping that you guys could help me in this time-sensitive situation I am in. 
 
I'm going to be a senior in college majoring in mechanical engineering and as you all might know, internships are encouraged for the eventual job hunt after graduation. 
 
I got into an industrial engineering internship at a Fortune 500 company with damn good pay ($18 hourly) but it's not totally relevant to my major. It involves a lot of logistics which I am sure I can turn into a positive for future interviews. 
 
The issue is my long hair. My internship, which is for 11 or so weeks, has guidelines which require me to cut my long hair. It took me years to grow it to the length I like. Given that a very poorly done trimming (in which I lost hair that will take several months to a year to grow back) made me pretty sad, I think that cutting my hair even more will probably hurt my psyche. I'm already wincing on the inside just thinking that I have to cut it. 
 
I know some of you might think that I'm being a pussy because I'm so attached to my hair, but really, I feel it's the same as asking a woman to cut her hair, which can be devastating, I believe. So please, I'd appreciate sensitive advice. 
 
Anyway, I had to leave work and come back with a decision tonight or tomorrow. My boss was pretty nice about it. He knows the sacrifice behind the long hair and told me it is my decision. But I don't know what to do.
 
Oh and before I put up my questions, I wanted to make a note on my hair. It's not scraggly, greasy, or bad-looking. I've gotten compliments on it by girls. A girl has asked me how I keep it like I do. It is presentable hair. 
 
Here are my questions:
 
Is this gonna be the deal for the rest of my engineering career? Can I never have long hair in the industry?
 
If I get one to no internships, will I be able to find a job as a mechanical engineer somewhere? Or am I gonna be screwing my self over by not taking this one internship?
 
Any advice will be greatly appreciated. 

EDIT: Just for reference, it's taken me two to three years to grow it to this length. It will take me that long to grow it back. 

EDIT 2: I cut my hair. I might get it back to its original length in a year or so. If it keeps proving to be such a sticking point despite accumulated experience, I guess it''ll be cut again. 

Thanks for the replies, everyone. Much appreciated.

38jucm,3,2015-06-04,"TIFU by leaving the country, making someone homeless and begging for a ride home",drinkingonthejob,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/38jucm/tifu_by_leaving_the_country_making_someone/,"In response to a request from /u/weddle32 from a comment I made on another post a while ago

Like most, this did not happen today, but about 10 years ago. And sorry for the long winded-story. 

I was an intern in Washington, DC and one of my friends was an intern at the Canadian Embassy. They were having a meet and greet and he invited us to partake (fellow interns in DC always look out for each other when it comes to free happy hours). It was a Friday night and he reminded us to bring our passports, since you are technically going to that country's property when you're at their embassy. 

Anyways, we get in and I see my buddy behind the bar. Two options: Canadian beer or Glenmorangie 18 year old scotch. Guess which one I ordered. Apparently everyone had been asking for scotch and coke all night, so when I asked scotch on the rocks, he was not only relieved, but he filled the Solo cup nearly to the top with that delicious whisky (single malt out of a plastic cup? Poor form, Canada). I drank at least two of those, the two that I remember. That was my first fuck up, which led to several others. 

We left the embassy (were politely asked to leave) (it was the Canadian embassy, of course they asked politely) and head to a bar. One of my friends had the bright idea of letting me ride her bike around downtown DC. Black-out drunk. Thankfully I didn't die or kill anyone else, but the only reason I know I was on a bike was because someone took a picture of it. I don't remember the bar at all. 

We head to our friend's apartment in Georgetown (in a high rise building) where we played beer pong all semester long. Despite being obliterated, my roommate and I run the table. And we very loudly celebrate each cup made and each win. Someone knocks on the door and asks for the music to be turned down and the yelling to stop. Twice. At some point, we realize that the last Metro train will be leaving shortly. We high tail it out of there and barely make the train

The moment we get on the train, we both pass out. Thankfully we did not need to change lines. Just a long one hour or so ride out to Alexandria, VA. I wake up. The train has stopped and the doors are open. Something is wrong. There is no voice announcing the stop. There is no one on the train besides me. The smell of puke is pungent in the air. My second fuck up: I fell asleep and missed my stop. 

I look over at the seat where my roommate had been sleeping. He's gone and there is puke on the floor in front of his seat (this is his second time puking on the train after a long night of drinking btw). I walk out onto the platform. I am completely unfamiliar with this station because I've never been out this far. I wander around and find a worker and ask how I get back to my station. I can't. The trains are done for the night. She rudely points me in the direction of the cab stand and walks away. 

When I get to the cab stand, there are none there. I call for a cab, but no one is answering. I only have about $7 in my pocket anyways. I'm not sure which direction my neighborhood is in, how far of a walk it is and I'm still quite drunk. I'm starting to get very nervous. As I'm slowly starting to freak out, a newspaper delivery guy shows up in a station wagon. He must have seen the look on my face because when I went up to him to ask for help, he was immediately reassuring and helpful. My stop was only one station over and it was the next stop on his route. He offers to drive me home. I was extremely low on options so I say yes. 

I get into his station wagon and it is filthy. Garbage and newspapers everywhere. He is super nice and very talkative. He takes me right to my apartment building and refuses to take my $7 and wishes me well. I get into my room and my roommate is fast asleep. Bastard. 

When I wake up the next morning, we recap. My roommate puked on the train, and like we did the last time it happened, he got off the car we were on at the next stop, and got into the next metro car, not wanting to get blamed for puking or have to pay the fine for clean up. In his drunken state, he forgot to wake me up, or make sure I got off at our stop. He thought my story of how I got home was hilarious. Bastard. 

Time for the final fuck up. I called my buddy at Georgetown a day or two later to tell him about the funny story of the rest of our night. He wasn't surprised because he had news too: they got kicked out of the apartment complex. Like I said, we had partied and played beer pong there a lot that semester. That night was the last straw. They had to move out immediately. I apologize profusely. He is very easy going, says it wasn't our fault, there were plenty of other times that we weren't around and they had huge parties, this was just the straw that broke the camel's back. For about 5 years afterwards, every time I saw him, I apologized, and he just laughed it off, never held it against me for a second.

Tl;dr: went to Canada, got blackout drunk off scotch, partied too hard, got stranded, took a ride from a stranger and got my buddy kicked out of his apartment. Still feel kinda bad to this day

38jyif,7,2015-06-04,Is exodus the only way?,Enquivator,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/38jyif/is_exodus_the_only_way/,"Background: I am chinese. My parents were from Singapore, an island nation in South East Asia, emigrated to the US in 2000. I spent a great deal of my life in both countries and I hope this allows me to provide some insight and perspective into the differences between the asian and american culture. 

My family is predominantly christian although my parents were converts. My upbringing was fairly strict but not absurdly so. Major gripes growing up included a fixed curfew which is common to most teenagers of all races. Parents rarely praised or criticized me as is the standard in asian culture. They were interested in my grades but not to the point where they expected all As although I did ended up performing fairly well in my academic path due to my own convictions. Mom had several unsorted psychological issues and loved to play the victim and guilt trip and if the above failed, would fly into a mad rage and would threaten to commit suicide but in her defence, was also a decent provider. 
Dad was quite violent but not to the point of abuse and loved to throw stuff around, break furniture and was quite mean to me when I was young and often scolded me for trivial things. Who reprimands a 5 year old for breaking a cup? However, he has mellowed out later in his life. 

I got by my young days by ignoring them and their drama and even as an adult, I do maintain occasional contact but the bonds that were never formed can never exist.

Disclaimer: The following statements are just my general observations. Do not be offended if they appear to be unlike your situation because some of the statements I make are also contrary to my own experiences and are just what I observe to be the norm. 

Whilst hierarchy is prevalent in all cultures, in asian culture, it seems to be overly emphasized and used. 

It generally implied at many levels and contexts that a hierarchy exists. The limitations the hierarchy can have on one's freedom vary, with mild limitations being required to show simple respect to severe limitations being required to accede to every single request and to take verbal and physical abuse.

Personal experience: I had the rare opportunity to intern overseas in the same office as a general manager during one of my college semesters. The company was predominantly chinese and the female general manager was being verbally and mentally harassed by the managing director, by his lack of direction, ridiculously huge workload, incessant screaming, frequent overtime (8am-9pm) and the unfair pinning of blame. As an american chinese, I was shocked and asked her why it was neccessary for her to take all this abuse and to report this to HR. She declined and told me that their corporate HR existed only to serve administrative functions such as the processing of leave and recruitment. I was in huge disbelief at the vehement way the company chose to do things and at the general managers quiet resignation to her unfortunate fate. To a 3rd party like me, this was clearly bullying bordering on abuse but because of the strict 'hierarchy' my general manager did not dare to speak out or seek redress and her only avenue of relief was through complaining to me and the other interns to which we sympathetically complied. My general manager was probably one of the nicest person I have ever met whilst interning at the company.

It is easy to find fault with the people directly involved. Most sane americans would be condemning the managing director to hell and rightfully so. However from day to day observations and hours of recording minutes in top level meetings (yes they made us interns do that), I found out that the managing director's ideas, which were honestly quite good, frequently shot down by the CEO. Furthermore, during company events, the managing director brought along his family who were quite happy and well adjusted and he offered to pay the tab for all the interns. He was also extremely polite to us out of the office. So what could have caused such this person to have such conflicting personalities? Hierarchy. When out of the office, the managing director appeared to be a fairly cool guy but in the office, he became a demon once subjected to hierarchal pressure. 

To some of us in the west, it seems unfathomable that one would be able to switch 'faces' so easily. To us, we would accuse such a person of being underhand, sneaky and generally lacking sound morals. However this is because we denounce the notion of a strict overbearing hierarchy based on the society in which we were taught and grew up in. To us, anything that requires us to be two-faced is absurd and childish. Even in our corporate world, whilst 'politics' can cause people to backstab or bully, this is generally due to the desire to climb the corporate ladder or to victimize but not a result of complying to hierarchal norms.  For example, the boss might verbally abuse the worker because he is in a foul mood or is an asshole but generally the worker accepts that this is wrong behavior and does not need to take this 'bullshit' unless he needs the salary. Most provokation or disregard for rights would at the least elicit a negative response or even a decision to quit.

However, asians with a traditional mindset truly believe that they are to follow the hierarchal system. So adamant is their belief that it overrides their sense of logic and becomes ingrained into their personalities. They genuinely accept that it is ok or at least, cant be helped for someone higher up on the hierarchy to take liberties with them. This notion becomes almost religious-like if you will. This also translates into familial roles as well whereby parents expect their children to comply and similarly, these parents are to adhere to the wishes of the elderly without question. This is a result of a deepset tradition where boundaries are not clearly defined. I am sure that the concept of asian hierarchy was not developed to subjugate inferior people but rather to teach the importance of respect for seniors and to acknowledge that they have had more experience than you and hence, are able to guide you. However, nowadays, it seems as if some asians have neglected the true meaning of structured obeisance and used the hierarchal system as a tool to project their own deficiencies and insecurities onto people weaker than themselves.

What is the relevance of me telling all of you this? Most threads I have read on this subreddit seem to culminate in an exodus from their homes. From an outsiders point of view it seems like a disappointing thing to happen and especially so when it heavily affects this minority. I wish to help people who have cut ties find peace.

And after all of this, who get the blame? The parents for being demanding, overbearing to the point of abusive? Or the tradition aka 'asian heritage' that has caused all these inconceivable ways of doing things? 

My perspective is that there is no simple answer but rather because the american culture espouses ideals that run contrary to most conservative asian values. As such there is little common ground and young people growing up in america and saying the pledge of allegiance almost everyday would not be able to understand what their parents believe in and vice versa regardless of which is right. So if you have to go on your exodus to find freedom because you were oppressed or harmed at some point in your life, find peace by knowing that it was neither your fault nor your parents' fault that it happened and that at some point of your parents' lives, they too had suffered oppression but were unable to break out of its cycle because they were in less of a position to do so. Do not guilt trip (this is becoming an increasingly common word here) yourself or others. Things just did not work out.

Oh and if anyone wants to know what my personal stand is on this issue, lets just say that had I not come to America, I would probably not be writing this article now.

38kanj,3,2015-06-04,"[C# &amp; SQL Server] Internship starting in a few weeks, coming from Java what should I focus on to be proficient in C#? Feeling a little overwhelmed..",BinghamL,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/38kanj/c_sql_server_internship_starting_in_a_few_weeks/,"I am ending my second year of programming in school in which I've spent most of my time using Java. I did take a quarter of C, so I'm at least familiar with it and it's concepts. This summer I have an internship using C# and SQL server. I will be using .Net also, which as far as I know is some medium where you are able to combine languages into a single application, yes? I've never used .Net before so I'm not sure what I should focus on reading about in that area.

Anyway, so far I don't know what my project will be in this internship, or what I will be doing specifically. So for now I'd just like to get the basics down. What are the biggest differences from Java to C#? For a lot of the C# code I've looked at I can understand it completely or very near completely, but when I read beginner's guides or the like there are a lot of things mentioned that I don't understand, and I would like to know which ones I should spend the most time on to be functional.

SQL Server seems to be pretty straight forward, but are there any challenges you've faced with it? I've only written one program that used SQL, and it was pretty easy to read up on to figure it out. From what I've read so far, SQL server doesn't look any different, but I'd hate to come in under prepared.

In summary, I have a good background/understanding with Java, and I've been exposed to C, and had minimal exposure to SQL (all of which were in a school setting). In a few weeks I have to have the best understanding possible (given the timeframe) in C#, SQL Server, and using .NET. What would you suggest I spend the most time on studying/reading/practicing?"
38kbgj,0,2015-06-04,"Somebody close to me has died, but I don't know who it is yet",pleasehelptimejump,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/38kbgj/somebody_close_to_me_has_died_but_i_dont_know_who/,"I have this problem that started when I was in the second grade. I don't really know how to describe it. I wouldn't call it ""time-travel"" per-se, but I don't know any other close explanation. 


The first time it happened to me I was sitting in class and the teacher (Mrs. Jacobs) was reading a story to us. I can't remember the story but right about half way through speaking Mrs. Jacobs suddenly skipped to the ending sentence of the story. I was confused, but nobody else seemed to be. She had skipped a good 10 pages of text but when I looked around everyone was sitting and patiently listening as if nothing had happened. I didn't think much about it then, maybe I was just confused. That night when I got home my mother told me that my grandma had passed away. 


Now I didn't put together this ""time-skipping"" experience with the death of my grandmother right then and actually kind of forgot about it.
Fast forward a couple years and I'm sitting on the sideline of my rec league soccer game. I wasn't the strongest player so my coach had taken me out of the game at about the first quarter (this was kid’s soccer so we played four quarters instead of two halves). Then bam it was the end of the game. I didn't know who won or lost because I didn't see any of the game, it was first quarter then it was final whistle. I didn't tell anyone and didn't ask anyone about the score because I didn't want people to think I wasn't watching the game. Walking back to the car my mother got a call on her phone (it was 2006 so yes, cellphones existed). The call was about my Uncle, he had died in a car crash on the way to lunch during work. 


This is when I started to put together my weird time skipping with the deaths of people close to me. The only two people I have ever known to die had died during this time skip. I was spooked, but too spooked to tell someone. I didn't want to get in trouble for this.


Nothing happened until just this year during my freshman year of college. I'm up late studying for midterms and suddenly 3 hours have passed. It was about 4 in the morning so I didn't want to call my parents to check if things were okay. It would surely be suspicious if I called and someone happened to be dead right then. So I waited, I tried to sleep but I just ended up tossing and turning all night. Finally at about 7:30 AM the call came in. My mother had woken up to the sound of a gunshot. My neighbor had killed herself. My neighbor was my best friend, we grew up together, went to the same schools, dated for a bit at the end of high school but broke up when I left for high school and she stayed home (she didn't get into any colleges). I still cared for her and this one hit me the most. I try not to blame myself for her death but I don't understand.


I have always wondered that maybe I am killing these people during these times. Maybe my soul leaves my body to go end these lives. Each person that has died has been wanting death. My grandma was slowly dying, with bad Alzheimer’s and nothing left. My Uncle had just been laid off and left by his wife. My neighbor believed she had no future or life ahead of her. Maybe I’m being sent to do the deeds for these people so they don’t have to?


After months of grieving I am back home from college and I have a summer internship, each day at work I come onto reddit nosleep looking for someone who has a similar problem to me. I haven’t found anyone yet but I have seen that people here are getting help. So please, if there is anyone out there that knows how to help me I need it.


I haven’t received any calls yet but I know it’s coming."

Secondly, I appreciate **any** and **all** advice given regardless of how hard it may be to hear.

**TL;DR - Went to a private university in Florida and accrued a substantial amount of Student Loan Debt (roughly $30k in my name and $150k in my mother's). I have paid my loans down considerably; however, my mother who works retail for around $7.50 an hour cannot afford the payments and I cannot afford to help. Have consulted a lawyer and got a friendly ""you're f@#ked"" in reply.**

Now before I begin, I want to state that I don't consider myself to be a ""bad person"". At the time I was accepted to the university I was, I was so excited and naive that student loans seemed to be something I could pay off easily with a job in the future. After my 5 years in school (did a three semester internship), I was left with roughly $30,000 in student loan debt while my mother had taken out Federal PLUS loans in the amount of nearly $150,000. After graduating, I was lucky enough to immediately land a job that paid pretty well and I started paying back my loans as aggressively as possible as well as trying to help my mother with her's. Very quickly, I realized I was unable to sustain bills on my own by helping her with her loans and we put the loans into deferrment/forebearance and they have been in that state pretty much since.

For the last two years, I have been losing sleep and getting sick over the large looming black cloud that hangs over my mother's head. I did some research and Parent PLUS loans fall into a very particular category of loans that is not fortuitous for those who take them out and end up not being able to afford the payments. From my understanding:

* Parent PLUS loans **cannot** be discharged even in bankrupty (with the exception of a hardship bankruptcy that is nearly impossible to get)
* Parent PLUS loans cannot be put into the repayment plans of Income-driven options (i.e. Income Based Repayment, Income Contingent Repayment, or Pay as You Earn)

I truly don't want to rob tax payers or ""steal"" my education. Initial talks with the lender a few years ago basically stated there was nothing they could do past the extended repayment plan (which now would equal about $1200 per month). After speaking with friends and family, I was referred to a lawyer who specialized in student loans to some degree. He basically stated there was nothing he could do as they couldn't be discharged in bankruptcy and that all the lender would be able to do from now on would be to garnish my mother's wages and retain any tax refunds she receives.

I'm hoping someone here has either run into this situation before, knows a lawyer who perhaps can help, or knows of a miraculous solution that won't put anyone in jail or on the streets. Either way, I appreciate you reading and providing any input. Also, it just feels good to get it out there.

I'm willing to answer any questions I can in order to get the best advice possible, but I'll list some I think you may have below:

* **How much debt is there on the PLUS loan exactly?** Currently sits at $174,623.30. It's divided between a private lender ($130,714.50) and the Department of Education ($43,908.80)
* **How much does your mother make?** She has worked retail all of her life (no secondary education) and only makes $7.50/hour right now and roughly a yearly gross income of $14,000
* **Where are you located?** My mother and I are both in the US living in Georgia at the moment. We lived in Maryland while I was at school and my school was in Florida.
* **Have you made any payments?** Yes, back in 2011 I made three months of payments when they were around $900 per month. I was unable to keep up with them so we put them in deferrment and now the monthly payment would be nearly $2000 per month
* **Have you researched your available repayment options?** Yes, Graduated Plan - $1401/month, Extended Standard - $1419/month, Extended Graduated - $1240/month, Income Sensitive - $1145/month (all of which neither she nor I can afford)
* **Do you know how much forebearance/deferrment you have left?** No, but I'm willing to ask the lender if that helps. Currently, we're scheduled to start making payments again on 15 August 2015."

I am a senior at Miami University with a Computer Science concentration.

I am familiar with Java and have been part of a team to develop an android app. I also have some experiences in C++ and Python. I believe that I am a very capable programmer; therefore I can adapt and work in tasks that may arise. I am seeking an challenging software engineering internship that will lend a “real-world” aspect to my education while completing my undergraduate degree.

During the past school semester I have declined multiple internship offers to come to San Francisco to work at a company involved with mobile payment transactions. I have moved across the country for this opportunity only to find out two days before I start that: due to a change in the leadership and structure of the company my offer was rescinded. ([thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37rxux/company_terminated_my_internship_offer_after_i/))

Summer internships at this late in the year are hard to find and I am ready to start as soon as needed. 
I truly appreciate your understanding of the situation.

I would like the opportunity to further discuss my experiences and qualifications with you.

For clarity: I am a student intern, and asked to scan our domain for web application vulnerabilities. So I fired up Kali (which I have a little experience with) and started a scan. A couple of hours later I pissed some people off because it was generating a ton of traffic, causing performance degradation, and mailbombing departments and userpages from form submissions. 

For the record- I am using Arachni at the moment, but I plan on using BURP too. 

Does anyone have any experience on how to avoid this issue? I did  some research on arachni and found this response:

# Can/should I run a scan with no POST commands? 
# Could I identify pages by pattern (e.g.: contact.php) and eliminate those from scanning? 
# Any other suggestions?

So far I have only taken Poli Sci 4 and I really enjoyed it. For next semester I have already signed up to take Econ 1 and Stat 21 as my last requirements for the Econ major. By the end of next semester I will have basically all of my general breadths, AC, and R&amp;C done. Just have a few questions about possibly double majoring.

Unfortunately I did not find an internship or job for the summer and instead I want to take a community college class or two in my time off. I could use this opportunity to knock out the other lower div PoliSci pre-req or possibly the history requirement. However, would it be possible for me to use an upper div Econ elective (such as 113/115) to fulfill it?
Additionally, are there any Econ/PoliSci double majors that can share their experience? I'm fascinated with political theory and want to take those classes out of my own interest. Thanks!

I can't seem to recall a lot of the stuff I've learnt over the course of the last 4 years. I can remember the rudimentary concepts of the subjects I've learnt, but the more advanced concepts are kind of a haze, i can remember that i did it but I don't think i will be able to solve it if I was given the same problem right now. I mean, I took Controls in the Fall/Winter semester and i don't remember anything substantial other than the basics and some intermediate concepts. Is this true for most of you here? cause i feel like im kind of an imposter of sorts.

This brings me to the next question, I have been very interested in designing/building stuff (as i expect most of us here are), so statics and dynamics were right up my alley. However I had little to no interest in Thermodynamics/fluids (ill go so far as to say that I resented studying fluids). I passed those courses, with decent grades but it feels like the only reason I studied them was not out of curiosity/interest but I did it anyways since it was a course requirement. I am an avid reader and I love sci-fi, and you know sometimes after you watch a really good sci-fi movie/read a good book you tend to reflect on the how things function in that universe even if its just a story. It feels like whenever I come across stuff like that and read up on these concepts(such as thermodynamics) I'm much more interested in knowing more about it as I read through it, compared to when i learn the same concepts and eventually forgot them when I took it as a course. Do any of you have the same experience or were you naturally curious about everything you learnt from your courses? Me not being interested in the subject matter consequently meant that I didn't put much effort/ work as i probably should have.

I did a 1 year internship at a big oil and gas company and I learnt a lot on the job and i found that people were helpful whenever i had questions and highly appreciative of the work I did. While I am grateful for the experience (and and much needed money haha) I felt that it stopped becoming a potential career and turned in a 8-5 job that I showed eight months down the road. I felt like a drone working there and while I am not bothered by repetitive tasks/work, the job just became mundane once I stopped learning anything new from it. I was not really satisfied(and happy) with my work, every engineer i worked with had the same ""oh you are doing an excellent job"" whenever I asked them for any positive criticism. I feel that working at a large company isnt exactly for me right now, and Id be much happier working at a small company since i think it will help me be well rounded( and I get to see how a company actually works and not just the engineering aspect of it). Right now I think i value experience over pay, and I feel that I can risk it now when im young(i just turned 22) and have little to no responsibilities. Now with oil and gas not exactly booming(and since Im in Alberta, Canada where Oil and Gas is the major industry), should i apply for small companies(where I think Ill be more happy and productive)or should i take up just any job i come across given the market right now? Im sure there are more people who were in the same situation as me, and I was hoping that someone could give me advice based on their experiences. I am hoping that my one year internship and my experience with school's solar car team will help me out.

*phew* thanks for reading!"

They put me in basically what is the IT group and my primary job is to document their current systems as there is no current documentation.

I'm rather disappointed because I am finding that no actual design engineering happens here.  For the record, I had no idea what my specific job would be until 2 weeks before I started.  I guess I can't expect much from my first internship but I really wanted to design something; you know, actually use something I learned in school and apply it to real world problems.

https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a.html
Quoting from there, written by Brian Harvey:

""61A: New curriculum, everyone works at the same pace, four units, combines lecture/lab/discussion, uses Python.

61AS: Best CS book ever written, everyone works at own pace (can be spread over two semesters, or can add a fifth unit of advanced topics), 2-5 units per semester, mostly lab, uses Scheme.

If you can't stay disciplined about doing the work without a fixed schedule imposed, take 61A.""

So now, this fall 2015, 61A is offered by John DeNero and 61AS is given by Paul Hilfinger. I know both are great, legendary professors.

I opened this thread specifically to compare your experiences. There are a lot of resources to compare 61A curriculum to 61AS, and they are so minimal that Brian Harvey summed it up with three sentences there. I don't think Python/Scheme thing will matter that much since the idea is to learn programming and one can learn a language in free times.

(Just to make a context: I have almost six years of programming experience, internships in IT companies and AP CS 5 credit) 

So what will the difference between 61A and 61AS in terms of difficulty, time consumption, materials learned, usefulness? According to schedulebuilder grade distribution CS 61A seems to have a better grade distribution. Apparently, neither of the classes has a curve (correct me please)."
38n0fb,0,2015-06-05,Is C++ 11 a good bet to get in Google's undergrad software engineering internship?,NLKNguyen,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/38n0fb/is_c_11_a_good_bet_to_get_in_googles_undergrad/,"**Note**: This is not a question about what language is the only one I need to know. It's more about what language the interviewers like to see.



I plan to apply to [this](https://www.google.com/about/careers/search#!t=jo&amp;jid=59615001&amp;) next time, and I'm considering which language (C++, Java, Python) to focus on. I'm not worrying about solving coding interview questions. What I concerns about is what language the recruiters like to see, and whether or not focusing on C++ 11 will actually work against me. 


This [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433484728&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&amp;pebp=1433484731526&amp;perid=1W0SSSQ3QKC79NY08SGN) book written by ex-google interviewer strongly suggest that Java is ""the best"" option partly because everyone can understand and because you need to do a bit of manual work to show your understanding. 


On the other hand, this [quora post](http://www.quora.com/Do-interviewers-frown-at-potential-hires-when-they-use-Ruby-or-Python-to-solve-an-interview-question-instead-of-C-C++-Java)'s answers from some interviewers at big companies saying their preference toward scripting languages because the code to solve problems will be shorter and easier.


I like C++ 11. I think it's cool, and the new language features make a lot of coding shorter than Java (at least for usual coding interview question), and I want to show my interest and understanding of C++ beyond the scope of school teaching. However, not everyone is familiar with C++ 11, and they may question my sanity of why I don't use something simpler and more productive like they say, for example Python.


I'm a project-driven learner, and working on different programming languages is not an issue for me. I actually enjoy learning different languages and technologies. But I want to get in Google's undergrad internship. So, should I not focus on C++ to get a higher chance to get in? 


P.S.: I intended to contribute to an open source project that uses C and Lua, but those languages are not listed in the preferred languages of Google's internship. With my limited time before they recruit again, I want to do something more relevant. Should I do it, or maybe building some Android app or Django web app will make my resume looks better?

38ntrj,2,2015-06-05,TIFU by sending a voice recording to my ex-girlfriend,jbarnes222,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/38ntrj/tifu_by_sending_a_voice_recording_to_my/,"

I was at a concert last night with a bunch of my friends. We pregamed before at my buddies apartment which is a 10 minute walk from the concert venue, so convenient. Anyways, we get to the concert before the headlining band is performing. We have no interest in the opening indie acts, its a free concert anyways. We all have to piss so we head over to the portapotties. Of course the lines are absolutely ridiculous, we end up standing there waiting for 45 minutes in total.

A bit about my ex-girlfriend. We dated for less than a year during my senior year of high school. This dating occurred about 3 years ago. The breakup was about as rough as it gets without becoming violent. Hooking up with friends, having make-up sex, getting into verbal fights at parties, playing the ""I'm over it"" game etc etc etc. I could count the amount of times that we have spoken to eachother since then on one hand, and these times were brief.

Anyways, while we are waiting there in the potty line, after getting separated from a few of our friends as so often happens at concerts, my ex-girlfriend comes stumbling along. 

We immediately make eye contact, I smile to be friendly and she covers her mouth with her hand and while looking at me says something to the person she is with. I raise my eyebrow at her and she saunters over, opening her arms for a hug. I go for it, and she grabs/scoops my ass with her hands during the quite short hug. I back away and get a little pissed that she did that, but I don't outwardly show it. She starts talking about some shit, honestly I don't really remember most of what she was saying but she was flirting with me pretty hard. Then she starts talking to my friend about how she was looking up peoples bank accounts at her new job because she has access to that(she got an internship at M&amp;T bank) and she didn't know it was illegal and thinks its hilarious. Then she starts saying she could look up my information, but says she didn't and laughs. I laugh, give her a smirk and say you could try, but I don't use M&amp;T bank. That kind of blows her mind for a minute that not everyone uses M&amp;T bank. She keeps talking to my friends acting as if they are best buds, and then out of the blue starts critiquing my body language. She says why are you so mad, you are clenching your jaw. I did not realize I was clenching my jaw, I do it out of habit. I ask her why she isn't with her friends, and she says she got lost. I say she should go find them and she tells me I should take a chill pill. A Waiting in line for 45 minutes to take a piss in a heavily used portapotty is shitty enough, let alone having to deal with an ex while in line. 

Anyways, she insists on cutting us to use the bathrooms before us. As she leaves, walking through our group, she whispers in my ear ""I hope that girl is for John*(my friend) and not you"". I don't know how to take what she says, my friend asks and I tell him and he gets pretty pissed off. It is his girlfriend and he kind of takes it as an insult. I think he does because my ex-girlfriend had called and left me voicemails before calling girls I was with ugly and shit like that after she had seen pictures, and my friend John had been there to hear them. So to him he takes what she said something along the lines of, ""That girl is not good enough for you, but she is good enough for your friend""

Thank the lord she disappears for the night.

Fast-forward the concert ends. We go back to my friends apartment and hang for a while. All of us leave except John and his girlfriend because its his apartment.

We get back to my friends house, and its 3 of us guys and 1 girl. My one friend goes to sleep and us others are just talking about life and having really awesome conversations that seem to only happen late at night for some reason.

Its 2am when I get a text, and whaddya know its my ex girlfriend. She's apologizing for her behavior(nice!) and I wait because I know there will be more. Whenever she has done this in the past, theres usually a slew of messages. Then comes the, ""I miss you"". I have no intention of responding, I don't want to go down this road.

My friends obviously ask who is texting me, I tell them. We start talking about the concert. Then we are just talking about my ex-girlfriend and I, our rough breakup, and such. 

I look down, and I see that I have sent my ex-girlfriend a fucking voice recording. I recorded a portion of our conversation while we were talking about her, and I was saying how embarrassed I was of all the shit that went down.

I had no intention of responding and I fucking recorded the worst conversation of all on accident and sent it to her.

I immediately texted her ""that was completely unintentional""

Then my friends made me realize that makes me look like I meant to send that on purpose.

TL:DR I accidentally sent my ex-girlfriend a voice recording of a portion of a conversation I was having about her.

I would prefer if it's within walking distance to UCF campus. Also should note that I'm a guy. PM me if you have anything available? Thanks."
38oitx,4,2015-06-05,TIFU by arriving late at work.. again.,atheisthotdog,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/38oitx/tifu_by_arriving_late_at_work_again/,"Little background story:
I'm a lazy person by nature and I always have overslept classes in school.
I think I had overcome this this year (school year) since I was working almost 24/7 on my final school project that would Grant me an internship if I did something better than the average joe.
Since september I struggled to come up with a 3D game made on unity, I did my presentation on April, they loved it and gave me this internship.
I'm in a really big name company where I live, it's not about programming but it's a really good opportunity.

Skipping to the present: 
My work here has been easier than what I had to do in my school to come up with a 3D game, I was averaging 3-4 hours of sleep EVERY DAY. 
I also didn't have ANY vacations, after my presentation I got immediatly contacted to start working next monday (it was friday when I got it). 

When I noticed the niceness of people and the easy time I'd have here my mind kinda decided to play tricks on me.
Basicly now I'm oversleeping my two allarms by hours. I wake up at 11~12 am and I should start working at 9 am (I take roughly 2 hours getting to work). 
I started out by making excuses to my supervisor saying that I was taking this pill that really makes me sleepy, that excuse kinda weared out itself.
So today, I overslept again, for the third time this week. I arrived and it was a little different than other times. (Usually my supervisor greets me asks what happened, I answer with silly excuse and I start working, averaging the 6 hours a day [which is the standard time i'd do anyway])
When I got here noone was near my desk (my supervisor sits next to me along with 3 other co-workers), so I thought, nice, I can sneak in, turn on computer and pretend I'm here for a while.

I did that, and while I was opening my briefcase I hear some voices on the other side of office, they were all having a meet.
Hm... so I guess they saw me coming in, this is really bad since I really have no excuse on why I'm coming late.

My supervisor leaves the meet and sits at his desk, asks me what happened and I said : ""I'm late, I'm sorry."" He kept looking at me like: ""is that it?"" and I stood there saying nothing, working. ""He then standed up, went to pick some water for himself, and stopped right in front of me with that motion of :""oh, I wanted to tell you..."" and says : ""We gotta talk Atheisthotdog, you know that right?"";
I asked: ""Sure thing, wanna talk now?""
he said : ""No, I have this meet, we'll talk after it""
I asked : ""What is it about then?""
he answered: ""About your internship.""

And here I am now, writting you guys this to kinda relieve some stress out while waiting for his meet to end.

Also, I did everything I was asked to do, way before the deadlines, they just don't give me alot of issues to solve hence being a laid back job.

TL;DR : Got late to work, boss told me he wanted to talk about my internship here..

38omvx,0,2015-06-05,Now I am desperate- how do I get out of the service industry?! Did I miss something??,Tomatoes_for_u,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/38omvx/now_i_am_desperate_how_do_i_get_out_of_the/,"I posted a longer version of this on ask women a while ago because I didn't know this sub existed. I'm 27, have an Associate's degree, continuing for a bachelor's, have an apartment to pay for, need full time work. I am a marketing/advertising major and would prefer a job or paid internship in that field (can't pay rent with unpaid) but I am not limiting myself to that field. Any 9-5 Monday through Friday would be great.


I am soooooo fucking sick of getting paid in cash at night. Every bill I have, including rent, takes out of my bank account. I make almost daily trips to the bank to put in night deposits (about 5 nights a week) last night I didn't make the trek after work and met up with my sister at a brewery instead, then I wake up to find I owe $60 in overdraft fees. All I want is a steady paycheck with direct deposit. Weekends off. My boyfriend works 9-5 an I want more time to see him. I have friends I used to be very close to who I haven't seen in months who have day jobs. I want time to do things after work. 


My current days are like this: wake up at 10:00, do stuff around the apartment (empty dishwasher etc), change into work clothes, eat a late lunch, go to work and bust my ass for old people who might tip well sometimes, leave and drive to the bank to make a night deposit, go home watch a TV show and go to bed. Sometimes I meet up with my coworkers at a bar but it's not too often and usually on a night with cheap specials. On my days off I see my boyfriend. I have next to no money.


How I want my days to be: wake up early, go to work, eat lunch at work, finish workday around 5 pm. Then either go to my boyfriends house and work on our garden or go out with him or just chill and watch Netflix. Or, maybe meet up for dinner with my friends. Or, go do something active like rollerblading and biking. Or, just do chores and watch tv. Cook dinner more than eating workplace food. SO MANY OPTIONS. Budget better, put the lessons I learned in personal finance class into place.


This is what I've done so far. I need something that pays $14 / hr minimum:


- send out resumes and applications to over 50 companies that I've found on indeed and Craigslist. Some days I send out 10 some days just 2 or 3. Some I am qualified for, most I don't meet the qualifications but I KNOW I could do well if given the chance.
- gotten an interview for an internship through someone my boyfriend knows in my field of study. I did very well in the interview and it looked promising but they had to wait until my school semester was over because I had day classes (working around my current work schedule). When school was over they had already hired someone bc they needed to fill the position sooner.
-gotten offered interviews from 3 different scam ""marketing"" companies who are actually door to door sales, their websites are only for potential employees and do not cater toward clients or even mention who their clients are. When I asked one of them who they represent they said the couldnt tell me for ""legal reasons"". -_-


I am on a timeline here, I need to find something before August so I can register for night classes. Another semester of working around a waitressing schedule is another semester of missed opportunities. I have a linked in profile that is well written  but very few connections. I don't know how to meet people in the field I want to work in because people don't wear t shirts with their jobs printed on them (well I do, lol) but mostly everyone I know is either a server or has a masters degree, no in betweens. 


What can I do? I'm getting so depressed barely making rent and I want to enjoy my life and my late 20s before I have to start thinking about starting a family and all that stuff. I want to travel a lot and have fun and not worry about if I will make the same amount this week as last week :("

38oowk,3,2015-06-05,"Looking to improve self-image in various areas, 20/f",RawwryRissa,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/38oowk/looking_to_improve_selfimage_in_various_areas_20f/,"Hello, r/selfimprovement!

I am a 20 year old female currently home from college for the summer. Since I graduated high school, I have found myself struggling to figure out ""who I am"", and as a result have struggled with some anxiety issues the last few years.

In the last year in particular, I have been having a hard time. My long term boyfriend of four years broke up with me. It has been almost three months since the break up occurred, and we are attempting to be friends, but I constantly find myself thinking about him and comparing my life to how his is going. In fact, I recently went out with him to take a ride in a new car he recently purchased. Despite the fact that nothing happened and we had a good conversation, I went home that night and was unable to get out of bed for the rest of the night. I constantly focus on the fact that I feel as though I am ""not good enough"" for him any longer, despite him attributing some his current success to my help throughout high school, and him stating that he wants to ""live the college life"".

I am dirt poor right now, and unable to keep gas in my car. This has led to me taking a minimum wage job in a field that has nothing to do with my interests (I am an Animal and Veterinary Sciences major). It is also causing me to have to leave an internship that I was really excited about participating in, because of the cost of transportation and my inability to sacrifice work to attend the internship at least three days a week. I am also struggling to find a place to live in the fall when I return to college, because my would-be roommate abandoned me because I couldn't pay my portion of the rent at the time we got accepted for the apartment.

Because of all of my stresses, I find myself eating more than I should, not exercising, and falling into a general rut of self-pity. I attend college with the goal of becoming a Veterinarian, but recently have been finding that I don't have enough confidence in my ability to succeed. I tend to sit and think that I should improve my life, but never actually get up and do anything about it. In fact, last night I sat and made a list of things I wanted to get done today, yet it is the afternoon now I am still sitting in my bed.

So, in short, I'm looking to improve various areas of my life. I want to become better at handling a friendship with an ex while being happy with my own achievements. I want to be satisfied with the money I make, and understand that just because a job isn't in my field, doesn't mean it's worthless. I want to eat healthier and exercise and generally become a happier person.

Any help, whether it is guidance, suggestions, or a finger pointed in the right direction, would be really useful. Thank you."
38ousz,0,2015-06-05,This beautiful girl lives in my father's house with me and I don't know how to deal with her.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/38ousz/this_beautiful_girl_lives_in_my_fathers_house/,"So I'm 19 and just finished my first year of college and I'm home working at an internship over the summer. So my Father took it upon himself to hire this 20 year old girl at his company and since she has family troubles he offered her to stay in the house for a while (in the room across the hall from me). So we got pretty close the past week or so. We haven't actually had sex but we've done pretty much everything else that would come before it. But the problem is she is wary to do stuff with me because she lives with me and she is employed by my father. So if shit hits the fan her life could be really shitty. But because I'm just home for the summer, we think it is not a good idea to attempt to start a legit relationship. I can tell she is conflicted when she is laying with me because she resist contact but then goes against herself. I guess what I want to know from you guys is if I should try to stay away from her or just keep doing what i am doing. I know my father is very against nepotism and I try to tell her that but she still is unsure. We keep having super serious conversations and it's very stressful because if we weren't in this situation it'd be completely different.

Thanks in advance"
38oxct,2,2015-06-05,How do I quit?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/38oxct/how_do_i_quit/,"I'm quitting my job as soon as I have another one lined up -- which is looking like it might be soon. I'm leaving partially for personality issues (there are some huge communication issues at my current job and I often don't feel respected) and partially for career reasons (I'm underpaid and not focusing as much on my area of expertise as I was lead to believe I would). I would much rather focus on the latter for my reasons for leaving, and leave out the former. However, as I've never quit a job before, I'm incredibly nervous and would love some input.

- The prep: I feel like I should go in with an outline of what I can do to ease the process (I'll give 2 weeks notice). There are two interns that work in my department and are likely to handle a lot of the work I'm leaving until they can find a replacement. Is there anything else I should think to prepare or have a plan ready for?

- The actual process: I'm planning on having a conversation with my boss that morning. How do I frame this? I feel it's likely for her to take it personally and be upset because they need me. How do I mitigate that?

- The letter: My understanding is I should also send a more formal notice after our conversation. What should this actually say?

- Maintaining relationships: My boss is close to other personal contacts and I would like to avoid leaving on a bad note. What should I do in order to be the best departing employee I can be?

Thanks for any advice or experiences you can share!"

A little bit about me is that I started to pick up the CS major the 2nd semester of my freshman year (started off pre-law) and I feel very, very fortunate enough to land an internship in the first place. I'm getting paid by the month ($1k), which I really don't care about because I just want the experience. I have decent experience in C++ and python.

Now at this startup I'm working at, my assignments are basically things I've never worked with before. And it's been about a month in and I'm still very shaky with some of the new concepts (a lot of cloud-based and mobile stuff).

I feel like a fraud. I know there's the imposter syndrome so maybe I have that right now. But I was pretty confident with my CS skills in the two classes I've taken.

Is this normal? I feel very useless. Do people who have full time positions spend long periods of time not actually contributing anything to the company but learning ""knowledge"" instead, but this ""knowledge"" may or may not help them accomplish their assignments?

TL;DR: First internship, I'm a rising sophomore who has taken CS classes for 1 semester. No idea what I'm doing, I feel guilty, like a waste of money. I'm trying to learn and do my best by asking questions, but it's been a month and I haven't gotten anywhere. Is this normal?"

This summer I'm doing a Big 4 cybersecurity internship in Atlanta, my home city, and I graduate next spring with a bachelor's from a large southeastern state school.

I was hoping that those of you in NYC/Atlanta (or elsewhere) could give me thoughts on other criteria I may not have considered, and all feedback is very appreciated. Here are some pros and cons I'm working with now:

**Atlanta Pros**

* Lower cost of living 
* Fairly good network in place, lots of friends and family + interning here
* Hartsfield-Jackson Airport &gt; JFK/LGA

**NYC Pros**

* The lifestyle/culture
* Public transportation

Really I want to go to New York, I'm just worried that starting fresh with my network, especially from a southeastern school might be tougher on my career.

I used a [MAXIMUS VI HERO](http://www.amazon.com/MAXIMUS-VI-HERO-Motherboard-Generation/dp/B00CXIVEA2) and put everything into a [Thermaltake V71 Tower](http://www.amazon.com/Thermaltake-Power-Supply-Tower-CA-1B6-00F1WN-00/dp/B00IS8P4YI).  
  
I learned this year that moving a giant tower is not fun, especially when you have schooling, internships, and jobs that have you consistently moving. So I started a project to shrink down my tower into a smaller tower.  
  
  
My current hardware is:  

Intel Core i7-4770K  
Crucial M500 240 GB SATA  
[VGA EVGA GTX 760 2G](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130932)

I want to move those over to a [MAXIMUS VII IMPACT Mini ITX](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MI8D1YE/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=MU9TAJJ9LISA&amp;coliid=I1P2BOCHIYIWP0) and put everything into a [EVGA Hadrom Hydro Tower](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IKDFMN4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=MU9TAJJ9LISA&amp;coliid=I1112NENWSYOE3)  
  
  
So here are my questions.  
  
First and most important, will all my components fit into the motherboard and tower? I've read a lot on the dimensions, and I'm pretty sure it'll work, but I want to make sure. Especially the EVGA Video Card, it's pretty big.  
  
Second, the current tower I have is large and thus gives excellent passive cooling to the processor and video card. Will I need to think about cooling components (i.e. liquid cooling) because I'm packing everything closer together. Losing half a grand to overheating is one of my nightmares.  
  
Three, are there any other suggestions for motherboards and/or towers? I'm completely open to different towers and motherboards; if the two I've picked won't work or if there's just better options.  
  
Please help, and thank you Reddit.

It pays $10/ hour and I live in a major metropolitan city so I wouldn't be able to afford housing unless it transitioned into full time. If I live with my parents, the commute is a little over an hour each way. I don't want to move home, but if I take this I'm definitely going to live at home until it transitions (if it even does).

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I plan to get into PC gaming especially since I'm alone for most of the Summer and who wants to make friends? But I'm also a CS major who likes to mess around with a bunch of different programming projects, at my internship this summer I'm learning a bit about how to use CUDA (Nvidia GPU programming package) and want to be able to utilize this from home.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I'm interested in getting into the virtual reality scene so I wanted my build to meet some or most of the specs for that.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

My budget was between $800 and $1000 but being a little over is okay with me.

38rf4f,2,2015-06-06,Can anyone provide some insight on this HR behavior?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/38rf4f/can_anyone_provide_some_insight_on_this_hr/,"Backstory: After my last job failed to mature into an internship like my company confidently said it would (I guess I believed them for some reason), I've been frantically trying to to find a new one. Since I'm no longer tied to the reigns of my current region, I started applying out of state where my brother is attending college in hopes of being able to share an apartment with him while he goes to school and I work. Long story short, I found a great company in my target city, I've completed a total of 4 interviews, 3 on the phone, 1 in person. I thought all of them went very well and my experience is directly in line with the position. It has now been 6 weeks since my first interaction with this company, and 1 week since my last interview (a phone interview). Here is what is currently happening:

Monday morning I get a call early in the morning from the Sr. HR manager of the entire corporation who I've been in contact with throughout this entire process. He says the following:

&gt; ""I am going to call one of the references that you provided in your application. ... you should hear back tomorrow.""

At least that's what I thought I heard. I was a little groggy still since he woke me up with his call.

So Monday passes and there's no call on Tuesday. I talk to one of my old coworkers on Facebook at the company where my reference works at and he mentioned that my reference was out of town until Thursday. So I think it's a good idea to send a quick email to the HR manager giving alternate references from that same company.

Now it's Wednesday, and I get another call from the HR guy saying,

&gt; ""I was going to talk to [the HR manager at the branch that you applied for] today but she was out of the office. But I just wanted to let you know that everything looks very positive, we're still interested in you and you should know soon.""

So, from what this sounds like to me is that they're actually interested in me and they're just ironing things out and setting everything up to make an offer. Would I be correct in saying that? I'm really not sure at this point, because all of yesterday (Thursday) and today (Friday) I haven't heard anything back from anyone.

I was really hoping to find out this week because I need to start looking for housing in that area and I'm really getting anxious over the whole thing (like I wasn't already anxious enough) especially since he keeps saying he'll get back to me ""tomorrow"".

Does anyone with insight into the HR world know what's going on? Sorry if I sound impatient, it's just all I've been able to think about for the last few weeks, I really need a job."

Not going to build it for about two months but I wanted to know what you all think my build will look like. I am just so excited. I just got a paid internship in my field and it may turn into a full time job. I am really happy and I love this sub, all the builds make my mouth water and get my heart pumping. 

I am curious about 4k gaming but that seems expensive right now. 1080p used to be expensive but now it is reasonable so I am thinking I should wait on that as 4k will eventually become reasonable. I am interested in a build that can be upgraded to 4k if possible. I do not know much about SLI. What would you recommend? 

Also I would prefer an orange/black or orange theme if possible.

38rvqz,1,2015-06-06,I'm a complete failure.,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/38rvqz/im_a_complete_failure/,"For the past 4 years I've been working toward a computer science degree in college. Last fall I failed one of my major classes and the deal was that I would have to retake it with at least a B- if I want to stay in the major.

This quarter I've been retaking that class, and again it's been really really tough. The final is this Monday, but the professor offered a large extra credit opportunity that was due yesterday. Whether or not I get a B- and stay in the major pretty much rests on this extra credit project.

Turns out that the project is almost impossible. I tried working on it with classmates, but my classmates gave up. I tried paying over $100 for a few hours of guided programming time with a tutor, but he couldn't completely get it himself either.

The deadline just passed and I was able to turn in a functioning project, but one that mostly does not fit the project requirements. I do not expect to receive much credit for my attempt.

Thus, I will most likely be kicked out of my major.

Here's what makes it even more awful: I was very very close to graduating. So close that my family is coming to see me walk at the graduation ceremonies next week and finish up a few credits in the Fall. They made travel arrangements a year in advance and they've been looking forward to it for so long. I'm absolutely terrified of how they would react to me failing out of a degree about my lifelong passion, especially considering my parents have paid for my entire tuition and most of my living expenses.

I'm also terrified of how this is going to affect my career. I have an internship at a hugely well-known company lined up for this summer, but after that I don't know what's next. Sure, I can spend another year in school and still graduate with a general science BS and ""almost a computer science BS"", but that's obviously not the same to employers. I won't be able to compete with my classmates in the job market even though I'm just as qualified, if not moreso thanks to this internship.

I don't know what to do. I'm lost. I'm scared. I've failed myself and my family despite tearing myself apart for this degree. I don't know if I have the will to go on."

In Business Informatics you study economic basics, IT basics including programming and combined fields. 

Starting from the 4th semester i noticed that my only interest was in the programming classes i had so i started to learn on my own to get a little bit deeper into it. 

The problem is that i have so many other difficult classes that i cant really concentrate on programming so much.

Overall i am at a beginner level i would say...i know the absolute basics of c++ and java(bit more java than c++), i am ok with html5 and cs. 

But i guess thats not enough for a 6 months internship since i cant really programm anything besides maybe a basic calculator or beginner stuff like that. 

Should i still try to get an internship in that field or is it not worth trying ? Has anyone experience with that ?

It's not my first full time job, but it's the first time I've ever had to work on code for 8 hours straight. I find myself spacing out very frequently. I'd say most of my day is spacing out with some coding peppered here and there. I know it doesn't sound like much, but sitting in one spot trying to focus for 8 hours feels like I'm in high school detention or something.

I'm used to my university schedule, so this full time work schedule is somewhat foreign to me. I have to be at work for 9 hours (1 unpaid lunch hour), but it takes me almost 40 minutes to get there. So in the entire day, I wake up at 7 AM and get home around 6:45 PM. I don't see the sun or my girlfriend or anyone I care about. When I get home, I have maybe 4 hours to myself before I go to sleep and do it all again.

That's enough complaining. So my question is, how did you get used to this type of schedule? How did you keep yourself from day dreaming the entire day away? How do you manage your personal life when you barely have any time to yourself? The last question is especially important to me. The salaried employees at my job work nonstop. When they go home, they log in remotely and keep working. I can see them making commits at like 11:00 PM. It's absolutely insane. I don't want to live like that the rest of my life.

I'm sorry for complaining, but I really want to succeed at this job. Not only that, but I want to enjoy it too. I like the work itself, but I feel like I could do a better job in half the time if I were working from home. So what's a new intern to do?"

I've been a lurker in this subreddit and it's about time that something happened to me.

I'm moving to Portland, OR for an internship for the summer. It's very hard to find a short-term lease in the city because it's a landlord's market at the moment. The apartment is brand new--we would be the first tenants. It was very attractive deal because they gave us 2 free weeks of rent. We were promised an apartment on June 1st but because the apartment continues to not pass inspection and obtain an occupancy certificate, my roommate and I were put into a hotel. We were told that the hotel would be paid for and we would not have to deal with the lease until we sign and move into the apartment on the 8th with the 2 weeks free offer still standing. 

On Thursday, we were told that we were to be put into a temporary apartment on the first floor and start paying lease. We were weary because there's still a bit of construction but it was fine--whatever, we just needed to move in. The apartment is nicer anyway--only downside is the dust.

This morning, I received a call saying that the 1st floor temporary unit we were supposed to be put in did not receive the occupancy certificate and so we will not be able to move into that apartment on the 8th, as promised. They have extended our stay at the hotel until Thursday. Not only did this news happen, they told us that they are requiring us to sign a lease starting yesterday Friday, 6/5/2013. They want us to start paying the lease yesterday and are justifying it because we are staying in a hotel under their charge. They want the lease signed within 24 hours.
 
We have furniture in their storage unit. Couches, mattresses, and home furniture. If we were to look for a new apartment, we'd have to somehow cover for the moving truck and find time to find a new apartment. 

What should we do? Do we have to proceed with this lease? Is taking them to a small claims court an option?

Update: Oops forgot something. They mentioned to comp the prorated rate in our lease but it is still in the lease contract they sent over 15 minutes ago."

It's only been a few days, but I've been taking some time to soul-search and figure out exactly WTF I want to do with my life.

After lots of Googling and encouragement from the girlfriend to try something new, I think I've landed on a new career path: IT (Systems/Network Administration, specifically). I've always enjoyed screwing around on the command line, playing with hardware, and figuring out how to hook shit up. I also have a reasonably-high tolerance for bullshit, so I figure it's right up my alley. I've been dabbling in this sort of stuff since I built my first PC at 13 and I still find it interesting, so I figure it's a good sign. Plus, I feel like I'm decent at it (with some training I think I could be pretty kick ass). 

My basic plan of attack goes like this:

1) Continue doing freelance design work to pay the bills  
2) Get a few certifications (need some help with this one)  
3) Apply for internships and/or entry-level gigs  
4) Nervously wait for responses and contemplate my poor life choices  
5) Profit (maybe?)

I feel like this is both doable and affordable (since I technically don't *need* a full-on degree), but I'm looking for a gut-check anyway. Thoughts on this?

Assuming I'm not completely nuts and that I'm going to go for this, I'm going to need a few certifications. Which ones would be the most time and cost-effective in getting my foot in the door somewhere? Security+? CCNA? MSCA?"

So I worked the part time job I hated and hoped to find a job. I applied to everything and went on interviews. But nothing worked out. I didn't get my big break. But through it all I had my man. He believed in me. I moved in with him and we were happy. We cooked together we shopped together and everything was amazing. Except I felt like a failure. I didn't leave the house except for going to work. I was depressed. He was the only thing that made me happy. He joined a school club and made friends and went on a club trip to Seattle where we planned on moving next year. He texted me and called me the whole trip telling me how much he wanted me there and how much he missed me. I picked him up at the airport and things immediately felt different. A couple days after he told me he didn't feel as into this anymore. He felt like he was going through the motions with no feelings. We talked more. I said it doesn't feel like this is done and he agreed . A little time went by and he was unhappy still. I said give us a month we can try to work it out. He agreed. Two days passed and he wanted to be done for good. I told him I would leave for a month and we can revaluate. I left. I missed him like crazy. But I worked on myself. I got an interview for a paid internship that happened to be near him. I was excited to be turning things around. I wrote a long letter and put together a box of memories including a Playlist to remind him of our love and left them at his door. He went through it and came outside balling. I came in and he held me and we cuddled in bed. We then had tons of sex. And then he told me he was moving and wanted to show me his new place. We went and had drinks and food and took a walk around the lake and went back to his new empty house and had more sex. Then he asked me to stay the night and we could talk when he came home from work. Everything seemed great. He kissed me goodbye in the morning. We got lunch when he came home. We watched tv. And then he said to me he thinks I know how this talk is going to go. He made up his mind he wants to be done. He said he'll always have feelings for me and that he doesn't think he'll find anyone better but he needs to find himself without me. I'm crushed. He took our whole life away. All our plans are gone just like that. I never felt like this with anyone. I trusted him. My life felt over  And he gave up on me. I don't want to live anymore. I want to go to our house curl up in our bed and go to sleep forever. I know what days he works. I know what days I can do it. I still have the key to our place. The man I planned on spending the rest of my life with is gone. And so is every hope and dream I ever had. I want to do it. I want to fall asleep and never wake up in the bed we spent so much time in. We lived in that bed. We ate there we binge watched tv there we cuddled our cat there. I want to end it all there. As soon as possible.

At the end of the summer they offered me a part time job that worked well with my class schedule. Now, over a year since I first started, I am still working with the company. Because of this, I did not look for a summer internship and instead will just continue working here full time (till classes start again in fall). I was given one small raise (to $15/hr, am in Florida) when I was offered the part time gig. My question is, post grad, would it look better on my resume to have worked at the same company for 3 years or to have multiple different summer internships?"
38up2v,2,2015-06-06,Best path to follow with an MS in math?,christoffelcymbal,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/38up2v/best_path_to_follow_with_an_ms_in_math/,"Hey everyone! I'm a 30-year-old with an MS in math looking for advice on a career path in CS.

My bachelor's was in math, and I went to grad school for math. I passed my comps and oral exam, but after four years and a half-finished thesis, I burned out on the super abstract research. I also made some poor life choices that required me to have a full-time job to pay off someone else's debt. So I went on hiatus.

I spent the last three years tutoring professionally and halfheartedly planning to finish my PhD. Finally, this year, I came clean with myself that my PhD quest was over, and began thinking about a career.

I ran across some talks on SVMs and Neural Nets, and they rekindled my interest in CS. I watched all the online machine learning lectures from MIT and CalTech. I ran through Code Academy to brush up on fundamentals and I've been working through Project Euler in Python to cement them.

I love the combination of problem-solving challenge and real-world applicability that CS offers. My ideal job is heavy in math and making some kind of contribution to human knowledge. I imagine, however, that those ""cool"" jobs are reserved for people with heavy experience and qualifications, and I'm only packing one course in C++ from a decade ago.

I'll probably be moving to Boston this Fall to be closer to friends and family (although I was considering Seattle and open to other cities). I figure with the amount of colleges and tech companies around there, I might be able to at least score an internship. Going back to school to score a CS MS is very appealing to me as well. Concentrated study time and a degree would be incredibly helpful.

So I'm hoping for your advice. My main questions:

1. How do I address the issue of spending 4+ years and only coming out with a masters in math, for both employers and schools?
3. How do I know when I'm ""good enough"" to start looking for a job or internship?
4. Is there a good path to get to those kinds of cutting-edge researchy jobs?

Thank you all for your time! Sorry for the long read."

I'm a 22 year old paramedic. Throughout high school I wanted to go to school and eventually work as a programmer. I ended up becoming a paramedic, and I just don't want to do it anymore. I make decent money but I'm miserable when I'm at work. My problem (it might not actually be a huge problem) is that I dropped out of high school and ended up getting a GED. Would my best route be to do a couple years at community college and take as many courses that I could take that would transfer to a university and then transfer and finish with a CS degree? Does the actual school matter nearly as much as the knowledge/degree/networking does?

I know HTML/CSS, PHP, JS, and I've been working my way through some texts on Python and I'm getting a grasp on it. I obviously have more to learn and I'll definitely tackle that when I get there. Anyways, all that to say that I know I have an interest in programming. If my end goal is being a Software Engineer, would a BS in CS along with being a good programmer be my best bet? I assume internships and portfolios carry a lot of weight as well when it comes to getting jobs.

Finally, my question for people who started a four year degree in their mid-20s (or later), how did you do it? Full time student while working? Part time student? Did you just take the debt and get loans and go full time? If you could give advice to a 22 year old with no other debt who wants a CS degree, what would you say? Like I said above, my current plan is to take as many classes at a community college and then transfer to a large public university and finish out with a BS in CS.

I know alot of this information is in the FAQ, but it really helps to have an open conversation and get advice. Apologies if the above was rather scattered, but I'm trying to get past the fear that I missed my chance to go to school and I'm just hoping I still have a chance. "

I'm toying with the idea of pushing back my graduation to next Spring so I can do another internship this Fall.

Pros I can see:

- get to try out another corporate environment before I commit to full time somewhere
- get to live in a new city on their dime (this is a requirement for me to even consider doing this)
- get more time to study for full time interviews :)
- strengthen my resume for applying to full time positions

Cons:

- don't make as much money? (not totally sure about this since housing will be paid)
- career starts later?

The classes available to me this Fall vs. next Spring aren't really a factor.

Or maybe I can keep my December graduation and then intern again after that?

Thoughts are much appreciated!

I already accepted and signed the employment contract, and the condition of me having graduated is nowhere in the documentation I signed. In any case, I should be able to finish the remaining exams at most few months into my new position.

Can the company cancel the contract because of this?

38we0q,4,2015-06-07,Clinginess in friendships?,caladhielguar,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/38we0q/clinginess_in_friendships/,"Last year I did an internship at my dream job. My boss, Will, was really supportive and helpful regarding my mental health problems. He said I could talk to him any time if I was struggling, come sit in his office to have a bit of quiet time if I needed it, and gave me a week off when I was having medication-related teething problems. I can't explain how much I valued his attitude - I felt much better in work just knowing he was around if I needed him.

The internship didn't guarantee a position within the department and there were no openings when I finished, so I'm now working elsewhere which is alright. But I really miss Will being in my life. I am very introverted, I don't trust easily and I have an incredibly hard time talking about personal issues even to my partner. I don't make friends easily. When I left the internship, on my last day, he said if I ever needed advice or someone to talk to that he'd always be happy to help. And it's not like I've lost contact with the people I worked with - my parents live in the city the internship was based in so whenever I'm in the area I drop by and see everyone and they are always pleased to see me, Will included. Of course we all connect through facebook as well. 

My issue is that I feel this damned ache for the absence of him. I have had this a handful of times from ""mentor"" figures in my life. I feel like I need him in my life, even if we're only chatting about films or music or whatever, just casual conversation. But every time I try to initiate a conversation with him by email or facebook message, he seems very distant, very cold, and sometimes he just doesn't respond to me at all. I have tried just casually saying hello and asking how things are going several times, and once I asked him for advice on my career. 

I realise he has a very busy schedule. He is a head of department, he has two young kids, and he's had his own issues with mental health in the past. I try very hard not to be clingy because I don't want to be hassling him if he's busy and I don't want to scare him off either. But for some reason I can't manage to initiate a bond with him, or even get him to consistently talk to me. It really upsets me, though I am trying not to let my paranoia and lack of self-esteem put words into his mouth. He seems to talk to the other interns I worked with than to me. One of them is even such good friends with him and his wife that she goes to stay with them sometimes, and they went to visit her in her new job. I wish I could have that sort of friendship with him and I feel like there is something defective about me he wants to steer clear of.

I also worry that he is avoiding talking to me because since I left there have been two posts open within the department and I have applied for both of them, only to be turned down without even an interview or a response, just radio silence. The other manager and several members of the department pointedly asked me if I was applying for both of these positions, telling me to make sure I got my application in on time, and even when a position hasn't been in the offing they have said how they miss having someone competent around at work (the new interns got off to a rocky start from what I hear). I was given a glowing end of year review on leaving and when I've applied for similar jobs they have been excellent references for me. I just don't understand.

How on earth do I get him to just talk to me? How do I keep contact with him when he seemingly only randomly replies to me? 

He messaged me the other day to say he was sorry he didn't get to see me last time I visited and asked how I was. I said I was good, asked him how he was, asked if any of the sweets I'd dropped off for everyone were left when he got back and he didn't reply. After over a week I tentatively messaged him just saying ""Will?"", and he replied the next day just saying ""Hello Caladhiel"", without mention of my previous questions. I asked him again how he was doing. Still no response.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong and it hurts that someone I looked up to so much and found to be a comfort having around is so lackadaisical about talking to me. Maybe my need to not appear clingy makes him think I don't give a crap, but I have emotional issues that make me very wary of becoming clingy and judgemental. I don't want to fuck up this friendship. What do I do?"
38xluu,2,2015-06-07,Web Local Dev Environment,Sraaz,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/38xluu/web_local_dev_environment/,"Hi,

I started a project as the sole developer two years back as an intern. It had all the problems you would imagine an intern project would have. No source control, a single server which was both my dev and prod environment, etc, etc. 

It got popular and I was handed a junior developer. I added a prod server, database, git repo with auto deployment to our dev server. Myself or the other dev could create a branch on our repo, and it would automatically be added to our development server. I've been meaning to make some improvements so we could do local dev before things arrived on our dev server. The problem with the current setup is you need to commit all changes to see whatever tweak you've done, and it takes 6-10 seconds for the changes to appear.

I've been told that I will soon have 4 more developers (2 interns, 2 full time employees. half Windows, half Macs), and I felt the need to spend some time on local development. 

I previously dived into Vagrant, got things setup, but things were incredibly slow (external db call returned about 80 characters and took 8 seconds). I left it for a bit since I got a little busy. I decided to pick it up again to see if I could fix the speed issue. As I tried to get someone else set up, I ran into issue after issue* and I can't convince myself this is easier or more useful than just telling everyone ""set up your own LAMP or WAMP stack with OCI8 and install node"".

The application uses Redhat OS, Apache, PHP (to talk to Application Database and Active Directory), and an Oracle Database. The server also runs some node scripts for some back end data collection and manipulation. 

What can I do to get all these people I am handed set up so they can start developing? Is there really no simple way to make changes and see them quickly?

**tldr; current dev setup is awful, vagrant is not easy to use, what can I offer my co-workers for local development**

Thanks!

*Incase anyone wanted details on issues I ran into while trying to re-install vagrant:

*  [They needed to install Powershell 3.0, despite the requirement not being mentioned in Vagrant](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/3139)
* [Their path could not have a space](http://steve-jansen.github.io/blog/2014/03/13/tips-for-vagrant-on-windows/)
* [They were prompted for some password and told to try a fresh installation (which this was)](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/5153)

At this point I gave up and decided to see if there is a better way."

I'll have a good chunk of money saved ($20k+), and I'll be moving in with my SO, who makes a decent amount also. So bills and rent and stuff won't all be shouldered by me.

First of all thank you for your time.

**Background Information:** I am a 2nd year CS student. I'm doing well in my CS courses, I've completed many personal projects such as 3D OpenGL games, Android Apps, Websites, etc. Programming has been an area of fun and interest for me thus far.

**My Problem:** 

   I have recently started a Java Internship at a big company. It has only been my first week so far and my main boss (boss A) was gone this week. Boss A informed my second boss (boss B) of my programming task. This information is relevant because I have not been allowed to work on other projects until boss A returns. Long story short I need to work with a library called JRJC. I also need to use Maven in order to work with JRJC.

**Monday-Wednesday:**
During these days I spent my time getting situated in the company, researching my assignment, and waiting for an appointment to get JDK installed on my laptop. I had to first email a manager explaining why I needed JDK and then wait for someone to physically install it for me.

**Thursday:**
More struggle just trying to setup Maven with JRJC. At this point in time I've had two separate employees try to help me and they couldn't resolve the issues. I finally met with a third employee who sent me in the right direction.

**Friday:**
More struggle trying to setup Maven. I learned that another issue I was having was that Eclipse wasn't setup for the proxy / firewall that the company was under.

So at my first week I completed 0 lines of code. I still don't have Maven and JRJC working with Eclipse. When I wasn't bashing my head against the keyboard trying to get it work I was spending my times researching the technologies and APIs related and discovering alternatives to JRJC (and there are a lot of alternatives).

It has been incredibly frustrating not being able to setup an API. I have never had so much trouble trying to setup a project. I can't tell how much my lack of experience is effecting me or if I have been given a annoying project.

**Current Plan:**
So Monday I will meet with my main boss (boss A) and explain what my current situation is. I have plenty of alternatives to suggest and new ideas on how to solve the current Maven + JRJC issue.

**1.**
I understand that big companies need to be safe and careful but it's incredibly painful having to call the help desk every time I want to use command prompt in administration mode. How ss this the best solution for companies?

**2.**
Could I be doing something more in my situation? I already asked if I could help other employees with their work. How much time should I be spending at home trying to figure this out? As an intern is this expected?

**3.**
How can I demonstrate my ability to code without even being able to setup dependencies?

**4.**
What next steps should I be taking?

Thank you so much for your time and for reading.

TL;DR: I can't setup JRJC for Eclipse + M2E (maven). It's been a week now at my internship. It's extremely stressful spending day after day trying to setup dependencies for a project without being able to code anything.

I'm just kind of lost, and I don't know how to manage this summer in the best way.

About me:

Major in Computer Engineering, 3.81 GPA, ideally two more semesters left. I don't expect to get less than a 3.75 or more than a 3.85 by graduation.

I want to go to grad school for either Electrical Engineering or Robotics (Engineering), or something along those lines. I don't know where the connection between grad school and career is. Career-wise, I ideally want to do something medicinal/health-related like prosthetics or meaningful to life/science.

I go to a state school. (UMBC, if it matters.)

Two internships, last summer at NASA GSFC and this summer at JHU APL. Was a TA last semester for a circuits class. 

I did some research in Fall '14 and less in Spring '15, and I'm trying to finish my project this summer and hopefully get a paper done before applications -- I'm not sure how much time this leaves me. Honestly, I've been a pretty shit researcher; the project has been difficult to manage, especially since I'm basically the only one ""working"" (and I use this severely loosely) on it, and it's not exactly a career/study interest. Now, I feel as if it's too late to get onto a new project and expect it to help me with applications. Would it? (Even if it did, I would have to severely rearrange my classes, since next semester will be really bad.)

I intend to take the GRE this summer, provided that I need to. Which I'm assuming that I do.

I should be able to get pretty good/decent LOR from either internship supervisors, but I'm not sure if these matter. I could get a fairly good one from a professor I've taken several classes with, I think. My research mentor, no idea. Probably not, 'cuz I suck.
- - - - 
I'm not sure how I want to continue. If I get a job offer from a place I like, I think I'd take it.

Based on what I've said, where could I reasonably get into? If I stay in-state, I want to go to JHU. I've thought of Carnegie Mellon and some big-names, but, again, no clue how I compete.

Life is hard. Yikes."

I ended up switching into CS because I have friends in the field who made it sound really interesting, and it definitely is. I have been excited to go to school lately and that has never happened to me in the past. I can finish my degree (Major in stats, minor in CS) in three semesters (including the current summer semester) and be done in April. A Major would take two more semesters on top of the two that I'm already doing anyways for the minor (and to finish the stat degree). My GPA is in the 3.7-3.9 range (It's hard to calculate because my school uses a weird GPA system). I'm interested in pursuing a career in programming. Anyways, I have a few questions. 

1. Should I do a CS major or just graduate as fast as possible with a CS minor? 

2. I have been advised to work on my own projects on my own time. How do I get into that? I feel like I have too many options and don't really know how to get into anything. 

3. I've been looking at co-op jobs and they seem really scary/I feel like I'm not really qualified. Is this normal/do you have any advice for me?

I had one internship, but it was IT based, and I wasn't able to find a 2nd because I didn't cast my net wide enough. 

Really not a great situation to be in, but I can't change what's in the past. After applying to a ton of places, I managed to get some interviews that are coming up for QA style roles. The way I'm viewing it right now, is that at least this is a job in the industry and not totally unrelated. I am not the greatest programmer, which is something I'm trying to improve. 

I know QA roles are different in responsibilities and scope than a dev role, but my hope is get into a development role at some point. 

Am pigeon holing myself if I got and accepted a QA position? I'd like to have some upward mobility and not stay in the same role for my entire career. From what I've read on this sub, QA can vary widely from good to bad. Or is this a situation in which I should stop caring so much what other people think and just go for it?"

I haven't been able to justify the $99 a year to submit apps to the store, will I be taken seriously if all I have to show is my projects' code on my computer and apps running in the iOS simulator? In the worst case I'm willing to jailbreak my iPhone so I can show them things I've made running on actual hardware.

I'm a CS major done with the 2nd semester and moving to the third in a month, so that makes it harder.

Anyway one night browsing craigslist for internships I found one at a great company with a similar environment as Google (fun office doing similar work) and figured I would apply. Well they emailed me and I have an interview tomorrow! But I really don't know a whole lot about it other than its $9/hour so these are my questions for them. Any others I should ask? 

1. How long is it for?

2. What are the hours like?

3. What kind of training will I be getting?

That's all I got. Also I feel hesitant to take the job if offered. 1. I feel like I'm super under qualified having only done very basic IT problem solving in a CISCO class I took and working on my own PC. 2. I am hesitant to leave my retail job. It pays $9.80/hour and I work about 25 hours a week which is giving me money to save for a car next semester. I feel like with the IT job since it's in the city most of my money will go toward transportation. Also I only started the retail job last month so I feel its too early to leave however working alone most of the time, annoying company selling points, and the amount of children I have to call security to come get are getting annoying already. Also I think having an IT internship on my resume already would really help me. I suppose I could work both I was never hired as full time anyway. Any advice here?"

I have 2 years into a comp sci BA. I could finish it in a 1.5+ years, but possibly more to due to my current university basing its bureaucratic structure on the less efficient parts of the Soviet union. 


Option two is as follows. Transfer to a CC, get an AA/AS in Software development (which will be faster then the BA). I also would continue going to University for a BA, but it would be in Near East studies, which i could finish within the year (I got a ton of credits from my gap year and a half of religious study in the Middle East). I would also consider starting a master's program in order to seem more 'legit' when job seeking. 


Beside general advice, I am asking which path will help me most/fastest with employment. I have had a lot of trouble due to lack of a degree, in fact I had a job offer rescinded due to lack of degree. 

Thanks in advance!

I am a Canadian student studying Computer Science, currently in third year, heading to 4th year at the end of this term. I have done 1 year of work experience through my coop and at my last placement, I was given the opportunity to work part time (worked there for 8 months on coop and (will be) 8 months afterwards). This is a software development role at a non-software company. I plan to quit work, focus on my studies starting Fall 2015. 

Route 1:

I have planned the rest of my terms and calculated that I could graduate Fall 2016 (I enroled Fall 2012) with a double major in CS and Stats. 

Then I thought, should I go for another internship? Or should I graduate ASAP? 

Route 2:

I've been looking at IBM postings and I think it can dramatically improve my work experience if I were to have IBM there. Also, there are a lot of IBM positions offered to students. IBM prefers to high students for 12-16month terms, I'd be looking at graduating Fall 2017-Summer 2018 (depending on course availability). Also, I may or may not major in Statistics if I choose this route.

TL; DR: Should I graduate in Fall 2016 (w/ CS and Stats double major) or delay graduation so I can work at big companies like IBM (and possibly only a CS degree)?

edit: I should add that tuition isn't an issue."

I am going to post this into both subreddits because I'm having trouble deciding where to go.

I got an extension for my SIR deadline so I have until this Friday to choose.

I have visited both UCSD and UCI and I understand that both can be socially dead, this is not a huge factor for me because it's only 2 years so I don't mind.

My main concern is that I am going in the Econ major without 1 of the pre reqs completed (Econ 3). Also, I worry that the econ courses at UCSD are really tough and competitive.

As far as job prospects go for Econ majors, I heard that UCSD is the place to go because they get recruiters from the federal reserve and some big companies.

How is the job market for UCSD students? The networking? Any current alumnis out there that can tell me?

I have a friend that currently goes to UCI and he says the job prospects are pretty bad over there. 

The thing is I am looking to work in LA where I am originally from. Would UCSD's internships be mainly focused in SD?

Also, housing wise I am looking for a place to myself. I've dormed before and I did not really like it. I just need some space to myself.

Would it be a problem to get a place a couple mins outside campus and just drive to campus for class?

Or are there any cheap options when it comes to studio apartments near campus?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you so much guys :)

They've all been tied to the software side of things; some of it was programming in Python (instantiating classes to make use to functions), creating a string console output for selecting certain things to run, ect.

I've taken Mechatronics, and programmed a little bit of our state machines in C using a PIC32 microcontroller. Taken C Programming Class, but that's about it.

It warms my heart thinking there are people with their shit together who are willing to help people like me pick themselves back up. 

**Background**
I just finished my undergrad in Journalism and Political Science in May. Being the first in my family to get a degree is great, but I could only finish school by taking on an aggressive amount of debt. 

Before graduation, I had an internship at a major newspaper, was the editor of my college newspaper worked at a large law firm, and went to university in foreign countries for two semesters. I was certain I would be a superstar and work for a big company making good money like older friends.

Then graduation happened. 

For the last month, I've applied and applied and applied in my city with only one response. I can't afford to leave my parent's house to try to get a job in a bigger media market. 

Right before I finished, I talked to a law school advisor who agreed to help me apply in January for Fall 2016. I had taken a couple of international law schools and really excelled in them, but I've never seriously considered Law School because of the avalanche of negative news about unemployed lawyers. 

My plan is to find a job in pr, marketing or social media management until Aug. '16 so I can start saving and stabilizing my debt while working on my application and (hopefully) be able to move closer to a Top 50 school. But unemployment is a wakeup call. My parents have been understanding but I'm not sure if I should get a job at Arby's until I find a job in a field I have experience in. Is a month too short of a time to freak out?

I think I could make it as a lawyer and I would enjoy the work. But as I sit in a Starbucks and refresh Indeed, I worry that I'm warping Law School into a golden parachute to stay upbeat. Is Law School a golden parachute that's actually made out of gold (so it wouldn't work...) Should I just take a Xanax and just calm the fuck down?

Thanks for taking the time to read this if you did. I learn a lot from this subreddit.

*tl;dr* Graduated with journalism and poly sci degree but debt means reporting jobs are off the table. Is a month too short of a time to worry about unemployment? Is going to Law School realistic?

In that time, her “training” included working on garments that were sold for profit, and she did work that would generally be done by a paid worker. Interns are barely supervised by boss and are generally taught by other interns.

As compensation for the internship, the boss offered to produce final collection for the woman’s fashion program, free of charge. (Assembly of garments by other sources is permissible in program; student is charged with design/production process/everything else.) However, halfway through final production, the boss decided it must be paid for. No written contract or agreement was ever made, but given that not completing the final project would essentially result in failure, her hands were tied and a verbal agreement was made to continue. It would cost thousands, apparently, but it is under 10k.

Post-graduation, the internship became paid employment, though it was paid under the table in cash as a “contractor.” There was a somewhat shaky agreement that some hours worked would be put towards the amount owed, but no one in accounting/payroll ever kept track of this. However, on top of that the boss expected overtime (44+hr weeks) even though she would only work four days a week and be paid for 32h at slightly above minimum wage. To be honest, I am unsure if there is any record of official employment with company, as the company’s paperwork is miserably out of order, and finances are in absolute ruin. Even so, over the course of six months she accrued hundreds of hours of unpaid overtime. (I myself was working 60h weeks for 40h pay, but that’s a whole other story.)

After leaving the company late last summer, communication was largely cut off, but boss still sent occasional reminder email asking for payment. She has ignored these emails.

Today she gets an email threatening to sue for the amount owed. Boss namedrops a law firm that is potentially completely irrelevant – sports law! This firm is owned by clients of boss. These lawyer clients may have no idea they are being roped into this; boss has a habit of using clients in law for this purpose – he will threaten people who haven’t paid their bills with legal action from xyz firm without actually consulting with that firm. Irony: these clients are also in arrears to boss by a couple thousand dollars. If the lawyer clients are aware that their firm is being used, they may be in some sort of agreement to wipe away the debt in exchange for extracting payment, but I also find this doubt-worthy, as it is only a couple thousand on both ends. Boss is very much in financial tailspin and this strikes me as a desperate bid to get funds with a threat; he doesn't have the money to be playing with lawyers.

**Current action:** She is drafting an email telling him to sod off or she will expose him for his illegal business practices, which go far beyond what has happened to her. (Like I said, I am also a former employee. The horror stories can go on and on, lmao.) 

Thoughts? Suggested plan of action? Should she tell him to fuck off or just ignore him? Is she threatening him (legally speaking) by saying she'll air his dirty laundry? Could that open her up to backlash? Should I get involved? Depending on where things go, I would not be opposed to being involved legally, but for now I’m staying on the sidelines of this."

I created this resume using LaTeX and moderncv package. I wanted to avoid ""deedy"" resume as i did not like the look/style.

Other people have told me the following:

1. To not include contact details below my name in the top right of the resume. They said people would question if it's the same as the bottom and could be confusing.

2. To include only relevant hobbies that have ""produced"" a product. My web dev hobbies have a website I'm messing around with, but nothing thats close to production. My game dev is ongoing and is off/on based on how busy I am. During school it was hard to devote time to it, so its been just a learning experience (with some working code and frameworks I've made along the way). I want to include these to show I have diverse interests related to the field and take initiative to learn new techniques/standards, etc.

3. Don't include my job history as it's not ""professional"" programming experience (the job types i'm seeking).


I also have a few projects from college:


1. (Software engineering class) An android app that helps developers plan out and coordinate goals for a project. (app is not complete as we couldnt get a proper webservice to a database running)

2. (Mobile software development class) An android app for planning out stories/books/diaries, etc. (has workable features and could be finish given a decent amount of time investment, but is not play store worthy)

4. (Web software development class) A simple church based website with javascript, jquery, and php for a login system. Church users could log in, change profile info, upload photos, search photos, etc). This website isn't production worthy, but does demonstrate some working features if connected to a MySql database).

What should I do for an e-portfolio / put on my resume for these?

What do you guys think and what are good/bad parts about this resume?

What should be removed / added?

I'm a 20-year-old girl, I recently graduated from college, and I'm currently living in Antofagasta, Chile. I've only been here for a month so far, and I've only been working for two weeks. When I say ""working,"" I mean at an internship rather than a real job. I'm teaching English at a small language institute. I don't get paid much, but that doesn't bother me. Going into this, my expectations were that I would just about break even on this whole venture.

My motivation in coming here was to learn Spanish, experience a different culture, travel, gain work experience (both for my own benefit and for my résumé), and discover if I wanted to teach English as a career. I definitely feel like my Spanish is improving, as well as my teaching skills. However, I feel fairly certain that I don't want to teach as a career.

Also, the institute I work for is pretty disorganized, which makes my job more stressful and less enjoyable. I do often enjoy my classes, but I feel like novelty might be a strong factor in that. I also would say that I don't look forward to my classes; I'd much rather not teach than teach. I don't get paid much, but my hours are very flexible and I often get a lot of free time.

I've been considering alternatives to my situation because I don't feel fulfilled here. I know that nine months is a short time, but when I think about doing this same thing every day for nine months, I can't imagine it.

However, there are some solid benefits to staying here. I'm living nearly rent-free in a nice apartment downtown, close to my job, with the sweetest roommate in the world. Like I said, I get a lot of downtime--I'm not working 40 hours a week. I've been able to practice my Spanish. I'm making friends with students (who are about my age) and other teachers, plus I'm friends with many members of the organization that matched me with this internship (again, my age).

Obviously, there are plenty of downsides as well. The institute is so poorly organized that I can't plan classes until about 10 minutes before class starts. I don't always work with the same students; a single student could be taught by a different teacher every time, making consistency impossible. Students are roughly divided by English fluency level, but these assessments are inconsistent, and an ""upper basic"" student might speak English easily or might have a lot of trouble with speaking and comprehension.

Another downside is that the city isn't really that interesting. It's beautiful, but I haven't found much to do other than go to the library or mall. I go out on the weekends with friends, which is lots of fun, but by myself there's not a whole lot to do. I think I'd prefer a more modern city--or maybe one with more greenery. Either way, it's not my ideal place.

The bottom line is that I don't know what to do. I know that I haven't been here long, and I plan to stick it out for as long as I can. But at the same time, the main reason I did this was to have a fun adventure, and there are very few times when I consider this a fun adventure. I'm only 20 years old; I have a bit of money saved up, and I feel like this is my time to travel and make stupid choices, rather than resigning myself to nine months of doing work that is bearable, but that I don't particularly enjoy, in a city that is all right, but that I don't particularly enjoy.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

**tl;dr: Moved to Chile to teach English for nine months. I don't really enjoy the work or the city, but I don't want to give up. I also haven't been here long. What should I do?**"

Also, I need some advice/feedback until the applications.

I am an international Computer Engineering (we don't have CS here) student with a GPA of 3.36, though my CS-only gpa is 3.25. I did my exchange semester in UT Austin and I absolutely loved it. The university, the people, the city, the music, everything.. My CS classes in UT are graded A, A- and a C. I am currently not planning to stay in academia(although that might change if I do an MS) so my main reason to get in to an MS is to expand my knowledge in the field, get to live in Austin more and maybe get a job in the US(Austin preferably :)). I am mainly interested in machine learning/big data, that's why I want an MS in CS or stats.

I also did a (kind of)research internship at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona if that helps(related to networks). I also talked to one of my professors here lately about working with him over the summer related to machine learning/statistical analysis etc. I believe both of these professors will be willing to write a good recommendation letter for me. I am also going to write to my lecturers at UT Austin about a recommendation letter, but they will barely remember me, so I am not so sure of that. Unfortunately, when I was in UT, I took classes from guest lecturers from industry instead of CS faculty members at UT(pretty stupid, ha?).

I know my GPA is low for a top tier university but I think that doing an exchange semester in Austin might increase my chances to get in. I might apply for different universities like NYU or USC(I think my chances to get in to Stanford, Berkeley, Georgia Tech etc. are really low), so if you have advice or feedback about any other universities, they will also be appreciated. To summarize:

- Do I have any chance at UT Austin?
- Do I have a chance in a different but comparable university?
- What do you think I should do until the applications?

Thanks for taking the time to reply."

3985j9,0,2015-06-09,How Do I Ask My Internship Boss If They Are Paying Me?,Ddubblyuh,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3985j9/how_do_i_ask_my_internship_boss_if_they_are/,"I am interning at an independent film company this summer on a feature project. I've been working closely with the Producer (a professor of mine, and how I got the internship) as well as the Executive Producer/Director since early auditions in April. Mostly as a rhetorical and creative consultant, I've since been placed in charge of social media outreach and edited the newly created kickstarter campaign for the film. I've been working weekly with the crew, especially with the Exec. Producer/Director, and have recently been credited as Assistant Producer for the project!

Now, all the way back in April when I was offered this internship, I brought up the question of payment, and the Producer/professor of mine darted around the question, saying they would talk with the director about the matter, as well as offering me other ideas for payment in our partner studios-- which I haven't heard any more from since.

I've been keeping track of my hours since the start of pre-production, but as we are getting closer to production (and I'd be out of any other part-time work I can find for the entirety of production) and haven't heard from my producer/professor any more on the matter.

I tried subtly bringing it up to the Exec. Producer/Director who I've been working with, but they didn't seem to know what I was referring to. I don't know if my producer/professor ""forgot"" to talk to them about it or what, but I am getting worried as there are still bills of mine to be paid.

The experience has been amazing so far, and getting the Assistant Producer credit is huge for me, so should I not rock the boat asking about payment? Or should I bring it up again to my Producer/professor?

If so, how would I word it delicately, so they don't think I am pressing or ungrateful for the opportunity?

Thanks so much, hope to hear back soon."

PROS:  

* $103K base salary. Made $135K last year with bonuses/overtime

* Short commute

* Help people get better when they are at their worst

* Close relationships with colleagues. 

* Very flexible schedule. 12-hour shifts allow for 3-4 shifts/week, maximum. Vacations without using any vacation time. 

* Nights I'm off I can chillax at home and play games, etc.
 
* I'm damn good at what I do. 

* Job security.

* Hourly. Any time I'm in the building I'm on the clock. 

* Hopefully buying a house soon and changing jobs would gum up the loan process. 


CONS:

* Labor-intensive: patients are getting larger and larger. Back hurts from time to time. Tore an ACL once. 

* Depressing: most patients do not do well or we are keeping alive needlessly. 

* Toxic/backwards corporate culture at current hospital where nurses are powerless and bureaucracy is infinite. 
 
* Intellectually unfulfilling: 50% of my shifts are making sure the appropriate checkboxes are checked for the rare audit or court case. Literally no other persons will look at said checkboxes. Knowing at times what patients really need and not being able to facilitate it for any number of reasons not limited to but including interns, family drama, stupid policies, etc. 

* Ever since I've been on nights, I've had odd medical issues ranging from near-constant eczema, what seemed to be IBS for several months, insomnia, fatigue when I'm off of work, weird sleep-induced achilles tendonitis. These issues may be completely incidental to being on nights the last few years, but their correlation should be noted. 

* I can't see myself doing this for 30 more years until I'm retirement age. 

* High-deductible health insurance with HSA.   

* I work a fair amount of holidays and every other weekend, so I miss out on many extended family gatherings, local festivals, etc. 

* No real upward mobility without seeking advanced nursing degrees which are about 90% fluff and depress me to think about. 



**PROSPECTIVE JOB: NURSE EDUCATOR/SPECIALIST FOR LARGE BIOMED PRODUCT COMPANY**  
PROS: 

* 50-75% travel: Explore different areas, rack up frequent flyer/hotel points. Eat at awesome restaurants on company dime. 

* Company car: If I sell my current car, I would save approximately $600/mo in gas and carrying a car note. New car every 3 years. No worries ever for maintenance. 

* I already know the product well. I'm a tech geek and this appeals to me greatly. I'd be good in this role (at least as described). I'd be educating ICU nurses, so right up my alley. 

* No office 9-5. I'd either be remote out of home or on-location with a client. 

* I would return to a diurnal lifestyle and hopefully above-mentioned health problems would improve. 

* Essentially labor-free. 

* (Most) weekends and holidays off. Rarely might need to fly/drive out on a Sunday afternoon or something. 

* Slightly better health insurance. Stock. 

* Other fringe benefits: cell phones, laptops, etc. 

* I can see myself doing this for many years if it works out. 

* Upward mobility though it's in a corporate environment. More results based than requiring pointless additional degrees. 


CONS: 

* Initial offer expected to be 85-90K. Up to 10% annual bonus. Unclear of what cap is. It is salaried, so any overtime worked is unpaid. 

* Travel: I have three children. If I have to be gone for long stretches, it ~~may~~ will put undue burden on my wife. After a year of training, the travel requirements will hopefully be more local and car-based, so hopefully this is minimized. I also have to account for the fact I'm essentially gone for 12-16 nights a month at my curreny job merely by working them. 

* Huge multinational conglomerate. Stock prices are stagnating. Concern for long-term job security (although I guess I could always go back to being a bedside nurse in the interim).

* I've never been a corporate pawn and I have no idea how to fit into the norms of such a lifestyle. I've worn pajamas (scrubs) to work all my adult life. 

* Isolating -- any colleagues to speak of would be via conference call from another state. I'm probably okay with this, though. 

* Loss of flexibility with schedule. Vacations may depend more on when I can work it into calendar with product rollouts than when we would like to go. 

* I want to buy a house soon and changing jobs would complicate the loan qualification. 



**MY THOUGHTS**  
If salaries were equal, I'd chose the latter in a heartbeat. It has the potential to be more fulfilling to me as a person. The travel would be fun, at least at first, and if I were to move up the corporate ladder, its requirements would decrease somewhat. However, the thought of going from potentially $135K to 85K as the sole earner scares me. That's a *huge* potential decrease. That said, overtime at the hospital isn't as available this year as it was last year, and therefore I should base my salary expectations on what I am guaranteed- namely, 103K. In that context, I have to consider whether the fringe benefits and possible bonus on a salary of 85K would basically even out the differences. 85K with $600/mo savings in auto and a 10% bonus would be an additional 13.5K, so that's already 98.5K. I wonder, with taxes coming into play, if it's a wash.   
  
  


TL;DR: I have to choose between soul-crushing and back-aching for 135K or potentially fulfilling for 85K+fringe.

I graduated in December 2014 with a B.S. in applied math and statistics and a second major in political science. I was planning on seeking out a data analysis job or research position at a non-profit in NYC. I was recently diagnosed with MS and my mobility and fatigue levels are too unpredictable to commute the 2 hours (each way) to NYC every day. I've decided to find a job closer to home, but there are very few data analysis/quantitative researcher positions in my area. That aside, I don't really enjoy statistics or data analysis and I'm not very passionate about it.

I've wanted to learn more about web development for a while, but I've been focusing on my data visualization internship, which just ended a week ago. I've always enjoyed programming and discrete math way more than statistics and data analysis. I took the core Computer Science I/II classes in college (taught in Java, focused on programming fundamentals, OOP and data structures) and discrete math for CS. It doesn't count for much, but I was always among the first to finish programming labs in our lab classes - it clicked with me and I think I am good at it. I also took applied math classes like graph theory and computational geometry, which required writing an encryption decoder and a program to run a Graham scan (I did them both in Java). I am comfortable with the logic behind computer science and the concepts that cross over into programming.

I am not really interested in software engineering and pursuing Java, but I am very interested in web development. I'm not sure which aspect yet, but I think I would tend towards front-end/web app stuff. I know there are tons of jobs, some of which can be done by telecommuting and freelancing, which is very important to me based on the unpredictability of this disease. 

I know from searching reddit and elsewhere that the general path is HTML -&gt; CSS -&gt; PHP or JavaScript.

My question in general is: is this a viable career path for me to pursue, as someone with limited programming experience in Java? Is there any other path I should look into (like maybe Android development)? What do I need to learn to be as employable as possible? I know I need to start with HTML and CSS, but what comes after that?

The first thing I would like to do is to make a personal website for my portfolio of data visualizations and stuff made with ArcGIS. I already have the host and domain name, but I have not started learning HTML/CSS to build the bare bones of this website.

I have nothing but free time to learn, but I want to be absolutely sure that I am learning the right things in order to turn this into a career. I have no qualms about teaching myself and I'm ready to throw myself into this 100%, as long as I know it is viable. Any book, blog or video suggestions that could let me know what I'm getting myself into would be great!

Any advice would be appreciated so much. Thank you in advance!"

My question is: is it bad to not have any domain knowledge of a particular field? I was thinking about this because computer science and software engineering have applications to every field, but is it enough to just know how to program to become successful?"

I have been looking for jobs since then and because I have no preference yet as to where I would like to live, I have been applying to anywhere and everywhere.

Recently I was given an offer in Dallas, TX for 55k a year starting salary. Some of my friends who graduated with me are receiving starting salaries around the 70k mark, although they're going to be living in places such as NYC or Washington DC. My question is, should I take this offer or decline in the hopes of receiving a better offer in the future?

I should mention that I haven't had any internships for Software Engineer positions in the past and no prior individual projects.

I had an internship for a year under a reputable manufacturing company doing digital marketing/product content on the website and expected to get hired, but ended up not learning much and ultimately didn't get an offer, which is okay because the position would drive me insane. I graduated from a reputable school w/ a 3.0 and I literally lead all my marketing groups and I had fun doing it. I got along with everyone and felt comfortable in groups working on assigned projects. In terms of job opportunities, I get calls from recruiters for unreliable companies (consulting, recruiting, cold-calling). About 1/5 times I get a call from a good company for a phone interview, and end up butchering, stuttering, and forgetting how to convince HR. But, I’m just having massive anxiety because I feel I can’t find the right job and my true potential. I don’t want to do sales and calling, I want to be working with teams. But, at the workplace, I felt I had little confidence and felt the fear of opening up. Kinda weird considering I loved working at school groups. I want to learn but I just feel afraid when I speak out in a place full of older people that know what they’re doing. At my internship I was exposed to all sorts of concepts, marketing and non-marketing related, but communication needs to be worked on, I just cant get myself to do it. Digital Marketing and working with CPG brands is something I love and feel I can be good at it, however I feel I wouldn’t know what to do when I first step in the door of a job, making my anxiety skyrocket."

A few questions about my chances of working in the US, here is a short summary of my current situation:

- I have a Bachelor's Degree in Business
- I'm going to have a Master's Degree from one of Europe's best universities in Accounting and Finance in August 
- My work experience is mainly internships in Banking (including Investment Banking)
- I spent the last five months in the US on a study abroad exchange semester in a MBA program

I'd love to go back to the US to work there, but I also found a girlfriend during my stay there. I know about the H-1B options, but since it's June, is it true that the earliest starting date for work would be October 2016? Are there any other options I don't see? Would doing an internship for half a year in the US (and applying for H-1B in the meantime) be an option?

I'd really appreciate any help you guys can offer

Finals gotten in the way, but since it is almost summer, more tales for your enjoyment. On to the (recent) story!


About 2 weeks ago, Systems came in to upgrade some local servers (because they are improving all the firewalls and Anti-Virus because there has been some security breaches. (aka some code kitty's decided that a .ini file is cool) in addition to some needed firewall improvements, they also installed local, internal file servers. One for everyone, then a teacher, also a “Classified” staff server. Now, as crazy it seems, they are using OpenMediaVault.





WTF.





Consequentially, I already know the basics of OMV. (If you are wondering, it is ultimately the same as OpenNAS) Everything was running smoothly for a week, until...


Sysadmin ($Sys)

&gt;$Sys: GEEK! SHUT THE FUSKING SERVERS DOWN NOW!

&gt;$Me: Calm down bro. Which servers are you talking about so that I down cause the IT civil war.

&gt;$Sys: ALL OF THEM! KILL THE PSU! YOUR LOCATION IS IN ALPHA RED.


Now, alpha red means is not taken care of in 5 minutes, All the locations go down. Automatically. Now I know that this is a bad situation.


&gt;$Me: Seriously, calm down. What is it? Is it the Firewall, VVPS (Another tale), or the Fileserver?

&gt;$Sys:*Breaths* Someone dumped an unknown file that is gaining the SDR (Student Data Repsoitory) clearance. Unplug the server it has it's own UPS. You can't miss it, it's the spanking brand new one.


Internally hoping that the “secret” door is unlocked...


&gt;$Me: so I am here. I see the new equipment. There is also a terminal. OMV. Do you just want me do to a system halt?

&gt;$Sys: Wait, you know what OMV is? AND WHAT A SYSTEM HALT IS???


Facewall


&gt;$Sys: Okay then, send a halt to the server. Once done, kill the switches. After that, pull the Data Arrays out and have them in the front office with you.


Initiate me trying to type on a crusty, dust lined HP keyboard. Joyfully Pulling all the Fiber connections I can find, and flip the “ARRAY SWAP” switch. That was satisfying.


20 minutes later, $Sys, $Sys' intern, and the SUPERINTENDENT. (And pizza)




WTF^2




&gt;$Sys: You, just saved the entire network. All 50 locations. You've got the drives, right?

&gt;$Me: Of course

&gt;$Sys Int.: That sir, was live saving.


Now, due to privacy issues, I wasn't allowed to help dissect the file system. But, what I did find out that a Senior placed a hidden script into the startup folder, considering the server restarts every night that was an easy deploy, launched a Port scanner that found all the IP's for all the servers on the extended network. It targeted the Student Confidential Data server and started picking off of it and uploading to pastebin. It wasn't able to get any data.


Now, this is the first time I've ever talked to the superintendent, but he seems pretty chill. All four of us ate pizza explaining what happened. At one point, $Sys said,


&gt;$Sys: Geek, you just saved my job.


TLDR: Clara saved the Doctors job, again

A little background. 
I worked help-desk and with a small team that handled special projects, guest accounts, and deployment of new computers for a uni for about 3 years while I pursued my BS in CS.

I dropped off an actual resume to the IT departments of local cities. I figured if I'm going to go for it may as well go for a job that should have benefits. A long shot because I have no degree or certificates, just some job xp and references out the ying-yang (I believe its not who you know its how you know them).

So today I get a call from the secretary of ""local city #2"" informing me that the IT manger looked at my resume and while there are currently no openings if I would be interested in an internship.

So a few questions: 

1. Anyone one have any experiance with with IT internships?
  
     a. How did it go for you?

     b. Did you get the job?

     c. What did you gain from the internship?
2. Are government jobs as stable as one would assume?

3. Should I worry about not getting paid? Is it even legal?

To start this off, before I graduated (with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science) I did two internships with one company and received an offer from them. After a lot of thought I felt like the company was not the place that I wanted to start off my career.

I don't want to regret not accepting an offer from a company that I did not want to work for.

Right now I have been applying to countless of companies. Whatever few companies that I end up receiving interviews from I tend to make it to the last round but unable to receive an offer.

Now 6 months after I graduated I still have no offer. Will this start effecting my job search in anyway?

During these 6 months I have worked on a few projects on my own time (some freelance web development projects). Will this help fill in the gap of not being employed during this time?

Currently I am starting to learn Android development in hopes that increasing my skill set on my resume will help in landing a job.

Is there any advice on what I should do from now and on in my situation? I have been applying through website job postings, is there anywhere else that I can look into finding a job? 

I am unbelievably stressed from all of the pressure that is on me to get a job. Whether it is family (saying that I should have accepted the offer from the company I interned at) , the fact that soon I will have to start paying off my student loans, or simply the fact that this gap of no job can even make it more difficult to find a job.

Any help is much appreciated!

**Major:** Mixed tech/design type major, not very quant heavy

**GPA:** ~3.75

**ECs:** Nothing amazing, but I have some interesting research experiences

**Internships:** I have an internship this summer at a (rather boring) F100 in some sort of IT/PM type role.     



**Gameplan:** Read up on consulting case books, network over the summer (not sure about this because I won't be near school), polish resume and build up useful skills at my internship. Join the school business fraternity once school starts.


**Questions:**

1. Is there anything else I should be doing to prepare myself this summer? The fall recruiting season is just so soon. 

2. What sorts of job titles should I be applying for? I applied for general Big4 internships this year--I got an internship offer at one doing implementation (not what I want to do) 
without ever being asked case questions. Did I apply for the wrong position? 


3. Given my profile, am I a *fit* or am I lacking in some area?

I tried to break it down, but thanks in advance for reading!

I'm a recent grad from the University of Toronto - I got a BSc, but in Life Sci. I don't want to do the whole PhD/postdoc route, and I'd prefer to start working as early as possible, but in life sci career growth is severely limited with just an undergrad degree. So I want to kind of change fields a bit and do a CS masters to diversify my skill set, with the general goal of working in bioinformatics or health care systems afterwards. 

I'm looking at a program in India, and I'm looking for some feedback on it. I understand there are conversion Masters programs in the UK/New Zealand/US but I haven't found any in Canada. Also, cost is an issue - I would really prefer not to take out more student loans - I already have about 30k to repay from my undergrad. I have the equivalent of a dual citizenship in Canada and India, and I have family there so it would be easier logistically. 


**What**

It's a Masters in Computer Applications (MCA) - a 3 year masters degree for people who have undergrad degrees in areas that aren't necessarily computer science. I'm looking at doing it through IGNOU, which would entail distance based education. I'd be living in the Pune area, which is a tech hub from my understanding.

**Why this**

1. It sounds like it has a good foundation - [this](http://i.imgur.com/tcSFceu.jpg) is the program overview. I don't have background in computers, and this starts from the basics.

2. I'll have time for side projects to add to my portfolio, and internships, because I won't need to be in class full time (distance based)
3. It's cost efficient - it'll only be about $2000 total over 3 years, compared to and I won't have to start repaying my student loan debt (30k CAD) for another 3.5 years. 
4. It's a masters degree, so looks like forward progression.

**Concerns**

* How much theory do I really need to work in CS/bioinformatics? At what point does it start to give diminishing returns? Do I really need 3 years of study? 

* How would this kind of degree combination (BSc+MCA) be perceived if I wanted to come back to North America and work here? Visas aren't a huge issue - I'm a Canadian citizen. But, I'd like to know if I would be hurting my chances by having an Indian degree.

This next semester I'll be taking up a C++ course, and I was thinking of learning C++ to get ahead in the course while making my summer project. Game plan was, make a few C++ programs/game, then learn HTML/CSS/etc. to build a website and sort of showcase what I've made, and build up from there. But now looking more into the world of programming, it seems I should spend more time learning Python or other more up-to-date languages instead of C++. 

TL;DR - 
So basically my question is, should I learn C++ and get ahead for a higher grade in my future class, or learn Python for more functionality in the real world?

side note - sorry if my post is sloppy, first ever post on reddit. Constructive criticism welcome!

Edit: Thanks for all the input guys! I decided I'm going to go for JavaScript first, build the website and smack my project onto that, and learn C++ towards the end of the summer. "

So, my story is that after about 3 years of working in college restaurants, I left it to motivate myself to seek out my Internship, on the basis that I was too comfy in a job that I'm required to leave upon graduation.

It turns out that this may be the worst idea I've ever had. A few months later, nothing has happened, and now I'm sitting in debt and trying to find a non-campus job that I can at least keep post graduation to be financially stable again.

So, a few questions revolving around this situation:

1. What steps do I need to be taking to make the general job search go quickly?
2. What steps should I take to expedite my search for an internship?
3. How far into the future should I be planning ahead (up until I receive an internship offer)?

There are a lot of prejudices I had about a job search, such as applying to stores 1 at a time, committing fully to it, and that there will be a response of either denial or acceptance eventually. I'm wrong on all fronts, so this is more about what routine I should be putting into action, and how long I should expect to keep up that routine."

I just landed an IT internship at an awesome company. They never specified how long it is however the guy I interviewed with said they hired him after he graduated while interning there and that they have had a bunch of college interns. So I was wondering what happens after an internship when I have to go back to classes? Is there a possibility of coming back in the summer? Should I attempt to make my classes night classes to continue the internship? How does this work?

Is there a chance of interning the following summer or does it end and I look for a new one the next summer? Kind of lost how this all works.

Some are news sites, a few sports, a few net worth dot coms with celebrity net worth, etc...all using wordpress for the design, but all different designs. Some of them have contributing writers that are interning with me or just want to write, some have feeds from the other sites and some just don't get updated but maybe weekly or less frequently.

Now I did have over 200+ but I have let some expire, sold others on flippa and other sites. The reason I had so many initial is because I would build them up with interviews and exclusives from musicians, mostly rappers, and then my partner at the time would sell artists spots on my sites. so for example we would have an interview with Ice Cube on such and such dot com. then he would get them to pay for placements online, they would see their name on the same website as an exclusive interview with Ice Cube or whoever, and they would get happy. It turned into selling spots on blogs/websites for anybody, and we made a ton of money doing it from about 2006 to 2010. After 2010 the money slowed down from over 200k a year to about 75k then down to under 50 last year and even last year my partner was out, he was actually in college the whole time and wanted to be camera man for the nba but that's another story...but really the market we were in just got flooded with people doing the same thing we were, some just copying, others doing their own type of things, and I watched some of the people I started with 9-10 years ago turn into millionaires. I didn't, but whatever.

So now I have 88 average sites. Some are under a million on alexa, most are google page rank 2-5, but that doesn't matter. Some still get nice traffic which is like 2k a day. the worst get about 200 a day. So obviously they aren't worth anything on flippa or to sell. Since we put music on them that people could usually download, we lost our chance at google ads a few years back, but that money wasn't impressive, couple hundred here and there...

sometimes music labels buy articles, postings, and sometimes ads. It does suck maintaining them, hence the interns and some not getting updated.

I do have another source of income, but I know these sites are still worth something. I am just lost on what I should pursue.

I am def willing to network with anybody. These sites are great for SEO purposes, but I know I am missing something big.

So I ask, entrepreneurs of reddit, now what should I do?"

1. High School:
Volunteered for aviation museum in high school, graduated from high school with honors diploma, spent a lot of time in music programs

2. College: went to state school on music scholarship. Graduated from state university with a BA in Music (in 2013) and roughly $15k student debt. No internship during college, infrequent work during college, mostly in hospitality. I also took a year and a half from college to examine myself, I bicycled across the continent from coast to coast, and worked at a restaurant during that time.

3. After college: I moved out of my college town, held a part time job at a new city for 3 months, hated it, moved to LA for an internship in music. Hated it, moved back to my college town, held 2 different part time jobs, including attempting to be self-employed. Most recent experience was in an office at a non profit, was laid off after 6 months because of budget cuts. 

I'm having terrible luck finding new employment. Frankly, it's because I'm not really sure what I should be looking for. I know that I have a lot to offer, but I don't know how to package it, and I don't know what to apply it to. I feel that my background is eclectic and spontaneous and most employers don't want that. I don't feel at this moment that I have a ""trade"" of any kind either, so when people ask me what I do... I'm not really sure what to tell them. 

I know that I have good writing/editing skills, high computer proficiency, I'm an attentive listener, a highly critical thinker, goal focused, mission and values oriented, and very physically healthy (mentally... in a bit of a depression right now, but I'll get through it.). 

I want to do something that is more direct work, whether it be more physically direct, or more engaging with people... not behind a desk. I'm currently broke and any advice will help. I am willing to post pictures of my resume or answer any questions if that may help.

I am graduating from college in a few days, and my mom is coming up expecting to have a big talk about my future. Since high school, I've wanted to be a veterinarian, and basically all my internship/job choices since then have been about that. Recently, I've had a change of heart and decided that I no longer want to become a veterinarian. While I enjoy my internships at animal clinics and I love being around animals, I am not particularly drawn to it anymore. 

But the hard part is telling that to my mom, who is expecting me to apply for veterinary school this year. If I try to tell her that I might want to try something else, she tells me that I'm going to be giving up on my dream and makes me question what all the work I've done since high school is for. And in the past, I would also question what all the work I've done is for. If I tell her straight out that I no longer plan to apply to grad school, I feel like she would lose it. While I'm okay with trying different jobs and taking the time to figure out what I want to do, she believes that grad school is necessary and time spent doing anything else is just wasted. How do I tell/convince her that I don't want to go to veterinary school anymore without the conversation turning ugly?

39dj14,0,2015-06-10,Technology investment banking?,alazar221,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/39dj14/technology_investment_banking/,Hi reddit I'm looking for someone who can provide me with some insight into technology investment banking. In a nutshell i'm a high school junior and over the course of the past year I've been in between a lot of things that I want to do when I'm older. My first passion is technology. I love computers and phones and all that and reading up on whats new and updates. Everyone knows me also as that guy that can fix there computers and phones. My 2nd love is business. I did an internship at an accounting firm last summer in NYC and will be doing it again this summer (payed this time) and I really loved the atmosphere and work. Now here's the issues. Technology has always been more of a hobby for me the more I looked into engineering I realize I don't necessarily want to be designing this stuff but still it be a part of my career. And the accounting side I can see over time how It can get very boring. So after meeting a multitude of people and researching online a lawyer I met at a wedding who I told my story too suggested Technology Investment banking. He told me to look into the field and people like Micheal Grimes and from there I was very interested in the field. The thing is the information for this job online seems very limited you can't simply find information like most other jobs from big databases. From what I've determined is that i will most likely major in Computer engineering and go from there but I'm still unsure because of this lack of information online. SO USERS OF REDDIT what do you think? Is this a good field too go into and what are your opinions. Thanks :)

I am not prepared for the job market at all. I have no personal or professional connections, nor do I have internship experience (I have tried but the closest I got is an interview). Because I used to think of doing Master's, so I focused on school work (useless 3.82 GPA) and did undergrad research before changing my mind. Right now everywhere I look, I see either internships for current students or entry jobs that require 2 to 5 years of experience. It doesn't help that I am looking for jobs closer to Montreal but I don't speak good enough French for a workplace.


Admittedly I made mistakes of not going to tech fairs more often because frankly talking to the strangers like that is scary to me.  ideally I could get rotation engineer or engineer-in-training jobs which are reserved for new grads like myself. But the company doesn't list them on website.


I am losing hope. I have no standards right now and would literally take any relevant jobs anywhere. But even with attitude that there is little to nothing. I joke about taking some burger flipper jobs to my friends and they think it's stupid. But now it seems to be becoming a necessity

This is going to be pretty long, so I really appreciate if you take the time to read it, but I'll give a TL;DR at the bottom since I'm afraid I won't be able to compensate you (...yet???).

I'll start with some background (warning: gratuitous sob story)...I have a CE degree from a top 10 CS/CE/EE university (3.5 GPA). I took roughly 50% CS courses, 25% CE courses, and 25% EE courses. I've had 3 software-related internships at big companies (Medtronic, IBM, and Qualcomm) and a firmware-related research assistant position. I got hired right after graduation for a prestigious aerospace contractor doing FPGA development, but I left after 2 years without having another job lined up due to a mental breakdown caused by the intense workload (bipolar disorder did not help). I essentially did nothing productive for about a year, which I was fully aware was horrible from a rational standpoint, but I had savings and I was extremely disillusioned with the idea of returning to work.

THAT SAID, I've been struggling for the last few months to get even an entry-level position. It seems my skills and experience are far too broad and not nearly deep enough. When I chose my degree, I thought that would be a selling point, but in retrospect I probably should have gone with CS since I focused more on that, anyway. I have a little high-level software experience, a tiny amount of firmware experience, and a little FPGA experience...almost all the jobs I've seen want a lot of one.

I have had a large number of first-round interviews/phone screens, but as soon as they find out about the unemployment and/or the fact that my only OOP experience is academic they lose interest. I finally had a second round interview yesterday that seemed like a perfect fit, entry-level C++, but they went with someone with stronger C++ and Java skills. I have no Java skills, so I can't blame them.

I know the long-term solution to my problem is to actively develop my C++/OOP skills through projects, etc., but in the short term I am out of money and desperate.

So how do I market myself? How do I explain my unemployment without mentioning the words ""mental breakdown""? What kinds of jobs should I be looking for? What can I do in the short-term to make myself a more desirable candidate? What is the meaning of life?

Thank you so much for reading and I sincerely appreciate any advice you can give me. Mockery of my life decisions is also more than welcome.

I thought this was amazing because I did theatre all throughout high school. So I developed the perfect solution to getting experience. I decided that I would go back home for a few weeks and help out my old theatre group with their upcoming play. 

I was on my way to my hometown, which is a small, almost forgotten town in Indiana, with my father, who insisted that he pick me up and take me there. While we were on the road he decided to stop at some run down hardware store out in the middle of nowhere. It was getting dark out and I really didn’t want to go inside, I kind of just wanted to go home and deal with this in the morning but he insisted on going in tonight and told me that if I wanted to I could stay in the car. 

Me being the stubborn person I am stayed in the car. I wish so hard that I could tell you that something came out of the cornfield that night and scared me shitless, that I heard a scratching noise at the door, or even that I saw glowing red eyes out there and I couldn’t sleep or move or SOMETHING. Instead I fell asleep in the car while I was waiting. My dream was like one of those really creepy horror movies, like the Hills Have Eyes or some fucked up hillbilly movie. There was blood everywhere. It was all red, dead animals all over the place and there was a flashing light, kind of like those old motion picture reels. I woke up with a start as my dad opened the door. He made some joke about it looking like I saw a ghost and I just furrowed my brow wondering what the heck that dream was about. 

When we finally got home, my brother was in from college as well and I told him about the dream. He laughed at me and told me I needed to quit binge watching True Blood, and that I was getting the opening scene confused with a nightmare. I playfully punched him in the shoulder and laughed, which felt good after feeling so tense after that weird dream. After a few hours we all settled into bed.

There it was again the flashing light, the blood, and the animals. Everything was moving by so fast I don’t know what is happening and suddenly I stop. Like something that was spinning that you stop with your finger. It was so abrupt that I am thrown off balance. Then I see what stopped me. I stop breathing with a sharp intake of air. In front of me with both hands on my shoulder is a man. His face is scarred all around the right eye like some farm tool was used on his face. He had one hazel colored eye and the other one was pure white on the scarred half. He then begins shaking me and yelling “Don’t you DARE tell ANYONE about me again, or you will die!” 

I jerk awake covered in sweat, but I am back in my bed. I am home. I decide right then and there that I will not talk about this man because I fear that maybe, just maybe it is not just a dream. The only reason I even begin to believe this is because I believe that there are monsters out there, that there are ghosts, that not everything in this world has a good side. So for nights I stay awake for hours with the light on, not wanting to ever cross paths with this man again. 

Time passes though and as the show is coming to a completion the dream of the man begins to fade. If you have even done some work in the theatre it takes weeks to develop a stage design and then to build, paint, and add props. Where I went to school we would have little gatherings some nights too. One night I was talking with my ex who originally got me involved in the department and he still helps out with them when he has free time off from the police force he works with. We decided to meet up with a couple other alumni and just have a good time eating junk food and shooting the shit as they say. 

We started talking about the paranormal and nightmares. I remembered my dream, and since I hadn’t really had any more of them I decided to tell the group. As I was telling them I could feel the goose bumps on my arms and the air was so still it almost felt static with energy. I could tell that one of the other alum was scared from the look in their eyes. When I finished there was a silence. Then finally my ex started laughing and we all calmed down and laughed until our guts hurt. 

After eating 3 bags of Doritos and drinking almost a whole giant case of pop we all went our separate ways. Knowing that I wouldn’t be able to see the show performed I decided to spend the night in the theatre just so that I could look one last time at my design and take a few pictures for my portfolio. I ended up easing down onto the coffee table in the middle of the stage, it wasn’t the most comfortable thing to lay on but it was better than the floor. 

Suddenly I jerk up from the table to see there is blood everywhere, flowing off of the stage and onto the carpet. There are dead animals nailed to the walls surrounding the small theatre and I scream. I don’t know what else to do but to run out of the room. So I jump off of the coffee table and run up the short set of stairs, out of the theatre, and across the hall to the teacher’s lounge. Suddenly I felt that pressure of hands on my shoulders. I look up to see that man again and he just smiles and says, “I told you not to tell anyone about me.” 

I feel pressure around my ribs at this point and I jerk awake. I don’t know how I didn’t realize that I was dreaming but I’m still laying on the coffee table. I can’t get up, I try but there is something holding me down. I start sliding up on the table like something is pulling me off. I look down to see arms wrapped around me. These arms are coming from under the table and they are pulling me off. I grunt as I try to wiggle my way out of the grasp. I get to the point where my head is fully off the table and I glance down to see that man from my dreams. I have some leverage so I try to hit him with my head. Luckily I make the hit and his grip loosens. I break free and I run. I run so hard that I’m still breathing heavy writing this.

I got in my car and I drove to my house. The first thing I did was grab my computer so that I could let you know what happened to me. I don’t want to stay here too long in fear that this man is right behind me. Maybe, just maybe I’ll survive this but I really don’t think I will.

Despite my experience, I am getting a feeling I am losing to candidates who have a more relevant undergraduate degree.

I emailed them with my resume and they responded in what I felt was a condescending manner.  They told me that ""internships are filled by college students wanting to augment their studies with real world experience"". They mentioned that in my resume, they didn't see ""programming training or experience and you seem to be at a spot in your life where you need a job that pays the bills, not an internship."" In my resume, I not only discussed the computer languages I'm familiar with, but I also emailed them a letter describing some of my projects and personal, extra curricular education I've been pursuing.
While it's true that I am 29 and need more than an internship, I'm currently enrolled and pursuing a BS in CS.  I am not in a financial situation where if I interned and worked a part-time job, that it wouldn't be enough.  So my questions are: is this something that happens and since I'm just finally getting my resume out for internships, that I shouldn't be so easily discouraged?  Is there a way that I can tailor my resume to reflect my interests and/or experiences in schooling better?  Any help would be appreciated.

I haven't been fired before, so I'm really lost on what to do with myself. A few tech recruiters have contacted me, and I'm hesitant to follow through with interviewing for full time positions knowing that I'll be leaving soon.

I haven't worked a part time job in years, so I don't know how to get back onto the market, though that seems like the most logical choice. Still, my last server job was 4 years ago, and I'm afraid my degree and recent work experience would make me overqualified/undesirable.

I was hired as a marketing intern in college, and moved over to the sales side after about a year. It's a very small technology company with a start up feel to it, very flexible hours, very laid back culture, etc. However, the product I have been trying to sell for the last 2 years just isn't selling, and I'm losing motivation. I generally like working in sales, for example I loved retail sales, but this job has just become boring and discouraging. Moreover, I commute an hour and half to get to the office. My fiance and I have talked about moving, but ultimately I really really love where I live now and I don't particularly want to move. 

I was offered a job at a larger company about 6 months ago and I was thrilled. It was almost double the pay and a big career opportunity. The hours would be have been awful, and my commute would have been even worse, but atleast it was something different. But, the company I am currently with made me a very very competitve counter-offer to stay, which was more than what the large company offered me. Being only 23, I just saw dollar signs and decided to stay. 

Now it's 6 months later and once again I am miserable. I am making good money, but I hate going into the office everyday. I do the bare minimum of what I am supposed to do and it doesn't feel good. Every week I tell myself I will push more this week, but I can't seem to muster up the energy to do it. I know this isnt what I want to do for the rest of my life, but if I walked away from this, I don't know what I would do after. Also, I am making such good money and have such a flexible work/life balance, that I think most people would think I was crazy to walk away. 

What should I do? One thing I considered is seeing if they would let me drop to a part time work from home sales consultant, while I tried doing some other things, but I'm not sure how they would take that after they just fought to keep me full time. My job isn't difficult, but it does take a lot of training to learn the space, so it would be difficult for them to bring in someone new, so there's an element of guilt as well, that they've invested so much in me that I owe it to them to tough it out. 

Any help or insight is much appreciated! For reference, I am 24 with a BSBA. "

I graduated from a college that is ranked top 10 in computer science, but because I came in as a different major, and was pressured by my parents to graduate on time, I didn't learn a lot of the material really well. I was lucky to land internships through connections during the summer between semesters, so my resume is pretty solid. However, I have never read Cracking the Code, and tanked in my Data Structures and Algorithms courses in school, and generally have been a terrible programmer over the course of college.



**Now**

Despite being terrible at it, I've always loved and had a passion for programming. I spent the first week after graduation properly learning Java (I read Head First Java, and plan to follow that up with more hardcore Java books), and signed up for and plan to complete the Coursera Data Structures and Algorithms course. While waiting for the course to start, I started reading and working through every single exercise from Sedgewick's Algorithms (the text using by the coursera course).



**My question**

I was offered roughly ~100k from the decent tech company that I had interned at previously, and just to be safe, I accepted it. However most of the people on my team are middle-aged men who have stagnated, and are happy just working 9-5 jobs. The work is definitely not mentally stimulating. The company is not innovating, and I don't feel like I'll be making any impact on the world at that company. I feel like if I took a few more months off and completed the Data Structures and Algorithms courses (part I and II) and then really drilled the last 2 editions of Cracking the Code, I'd be better prepared for interviews. I yearn to work at one of the Big Four, or in a fast-paced startup that's doing well, and offers work that will be valuable to me in the long run.



**tl; dr**

CS graduate with a solid resume, from a good school, with no interviewing skills whatsoever, accepted a job right out of college at a decent tech company. The work is mind-numbing and not good for my career in the long run.  Working my ass off now to fix my interviewing skills. Aspiring to work at one of the big four/solid startup.



**Side note:** I live in the Bay Area (currently at home with my parents) so money is not a factor. I just want good experience at a good company that will help move my career forward.

Landed my first internship recently. This is my third week here. I work around 20 hours a week, but very little of it is actually programming. We work in a federal building with many floors, and we are the ""systems"" division. 

I find myself doing a lot of IT work, such as imaging/deploying computers, inventory, helping employees fix their computers. The only programming I do is some website programming, which is honestly very easy and just copy/pasting code or troubleshooting simple syntax problems. A lot of time is spent responding to e-mails and working with excel.

On my downtime I am just waiting for service calls or reading up on my own interests in programming. Now I did learn a couple of new things on the job -- computer networking and proxies (zenworks/novell), how to use git, basic web programming.. But my interests are rooted in Java, C++, actual debugging and problem solving.

Its an easy $15/hour, but I don't know if I'm wasting my time and should start looking for another internship ASAP. There are also expenses that don't make the $15/hour really worth it ($60/month for parking, dealing with LA traffic), but on the other hand the other interns are cool (and are leaving soon, so I may have to code more) and the hours are lenient. They are also willing to let me work until I graduate, and I should mention we work really close with the city.

Expecting to get some extra money from a summer internship, and I'm set on joining the master race.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Mostly gaming for stuff like Elder Scrolls Online, Witcher 3, League of Legends, Total War, Indie Steam games, and others. Will use it for other entertainment purposes like watching movies online, but its primary purpose is for gaming.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

Max settings, 60+ FPS, single 1080p 27"" monitor. This is all just what I'm leaning towards, because I don't have much experience with PC gaming beyond WoW on my laptop. I'm interested in the idea of a 1440p monitor or dual 1080p monitors, but I don't know what kind of upgrades that would require.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

~$900, although I've set up some IFTT alerts on the /r/buildapcsales subreddit. I'm away from home until August, and plan to order parts from now until I get back, so I'm hoping to find deals over that time for the parts.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

I love challenging myself. I love optimizing an algorithm. I love taking the time to learn a new language. I love making cool products for people to use. I don't, however, love the CS culture.

I only have a few friends in my CS classes. Plenty of friends in other majors. I just can't seem to click with most of the people I've come across in CS. I've gone to ACM meetings and they're not enjoyable. I'm not really friends with the other interns I'm working with this summer. Even the full-timers out of college are awkward to talk to. I tried my best to get to know the other interns, but after I while I began to realize how much I didn't enjoy hanging out with them. I don't want to play video games every night, I want to go hiking or play a game of flag football or watch the NBA Finals. People have different interests, I get that. I'm not saying mine are any better than theirs.

Another thing is the arrogance. It's like there's this cloud of arrogance floating over everyone and I hate it. A lot of the time I can't even ask a question without feeling stupid for it. What's wrong with genuinely helping someone? Why does everything have to be a pissing contest? Oh, and everything has to be debated! Everything!

Have I just had an unfortunate series of experiences? Does anyone else feel this way? Like I said, I do have a few friends in CS and they're awesome, so I know there are people to get along with. But overall I'm going nuts and it makes me reconsider my career at times."

This past week, his son was getting married and I was in charge of holding down the fort for the full week while he was away. 

I casually made my rounds around the office, performing the daily and weekly tasks as well as fulfilling the demands of users. The week was sailing by smoothly, until the head of Purchasing calls me on the workbench phone in a panic.

&gt;$PurchasingLady: Help! One of $OfficeManager's reports is printing out of the purchase order printer!

She's on the less tech-savvy side of things, and it was a short walk from my location to hers, so I told her to wait and I'd be up in a second to stop it. I left the workbench and climbed the stairs back up to the office. The entirety of the Purchasing office was waiting for me by the stairs. 

&gt;$PurchasingLady: I stopped the report, but now nothing else will print!

At this point, I started to feel uneasy about how she stopped the print job... I walked with them over to the print in question, and was slightly horrified with what had happened.

**She had opened the lid and ripped the toner cartridge out mid-print.**

I sighed, and began picking the jammed paper out of the tray and roller. After putting everything back together, I wrote out a note for the Purchasing department to press the button with red X on it next time something wasn't supposed to be printing, complete with drawing of the button. I suppose she did stop the report from wasting all the purchase order forms though."

39j01i,6,2015-06-11,"So, getting a CS degree on the side outside full time job. Hopefully switching full time. What do I do to set myself up for success in internship/job in a year?",programminghelp9,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39j01i/so_getting_a_cs_degree_on_the_side_outside_full/,"So, long of the short, I am currently 27 and working in a finance job as a licensed rep.  While I have learned a lot about investing on the retails side, trading stocks, etc. it's not really where I want to be long term.

I began pursuing a CS degree on the side (basically an undergrad without the fluff classes, as I already have a degree that isn't STEM related) outside my full time job a while back.  I have completed a few classes doing the program part time part time (Basically know C++ pretty well know on a basic level).  Also, I learned some Ruby and Java in the past, but its been a while since I used them.  Been doing well in my classes so far and really enjoy learning this stuff.

However, doing this part time really slows down learning this stuff.  So, I am very much considering leaving my job to finish the rest of my degree off starting in January 2016.  If I started full time, I would have completed all my classes by December 2016.  Although, they're really are only 10 classes I need to take to complete everything starting in January (again, because I eliminated the fluff courses with my past degree). 

With all that said, I really want to set myself up for sucess in the coming year.  I have been through college once and did it wrong.  Did the wrong degree, didn't go for the internship, etc..  Now, I know what I should be doing.  Getting an internship in the Summer 2016 and aiming to have a job by or before December 2016.

So, the main question I have is what do I need to do between now and May 2016 to land in internship at a good company realistically?  Please, keep in mind that I am basically limited on doing my classes outside work until December 2015.  I wish I could pursue massive side projects, but full time job+part time CS degree=not a lot of extra time to do stuff.

Second, what should I do to get a job lined up by December 2016?  

Last, around say January 2016, what side projects should I be aiming for and when should I am to have them completed by?  I realize the answer is, ""whatever your interested in"".  Well, I'm interested in a lot of things.  I think there must be some groups or websites that allow you to contribute to open source stuff.  Are there any good websites like that?  Are there any websites out there that list different paths you could take with a CS degree?  That way, I could explorer the different paths and see which one fits my interests the most?  

I hope these questions make sense.  Overall, I really want to get into this field because I enjoy coding and learning CS.  I have taken basic programming intro courses, done discrete math, doing assembly this summer, and moving on to data structures and algorithms soon.  I enjoy all this stuff.  But, I would like to set myself up for success come next year.  

Can someone out there guide me in the right direction for my situation?  Thanks for any information.

All of this material seems interesting, but I am not sure whether all of it is relevant to my goals, which are to code projects in order to have a chance at landing an internship (possibly in distributed systems) or conducting research next summer. Is it possible to postpone any of this material, because I will inevitably have to take a lot of courses covering this exact material in college. Out of these prereqs, which can I expect to read just for the sake of knowing the material and which can I expect to read in order to make projects vaguely related to distributed systems like a server implemented in C or a chat application. For instance, I’m not sure if after learning about operating systems, linux kernels, and unix programming I could actually code something significant or contribute to open source. If all of this systems knowledge is not too helpful in learning DS or coding projects vaguely related to DS/networking I would rather hold off on the material until I take the courses in college.

It took me almost 8 years to finish university. I was mostly just not present during the first 4 years, no valid excuses, was just depressed and lost.

Anyway, finally got my shit together and graduated but of course the damage was done. My GPA is shit, my self-esteem is at an all time low. I am much behind where I should be.

That being said, I have a versatile degree in manufacturing engineering from one of the top 5 unis. in my country. I have a short - 2 months - summer internship under my belt, at a relatively prestigious multinational.  I got a few interviews through online applications, contacts. etc. but thanks to my damaged self-esteem and inexperience, those interviews were shit. I did not get any offers.

I'd like to think I have some redeeming qualities but I don't know how/if those would translate into job prospects. Now, nobody thinks they are stupid but people seem to think I am smart. I am relatively well-read for sure and they might just be confusing the two. I speak 2 foreign languages, English and German. During my internship, I felt that I was much more qualified than the people who actually had the jobs in my dept. but again, I might just be delusional.

Another problem is the mandatory military service, companies over here expect you to have completed it unless you are an exceptional candidate they'd like to grab quickly. My initial plan was to get a job and enroll in a MBA program so I wouldn't have to do the military service for at least a couple of years longer but I can't do that now because I have no job/money.
 
My short-term plan now is to go and get this military service thing done. It lasts 6 months and I'll almost be 28 when I come back.

I plan to focus on getting relevant certifications etc. when I come back while looking for a job. Even now, I can probably get some insurance sales/call center etc. type of jobs. I don't know if I should just get one of those while looking or focus on searching.

My question is this: How can I explain to potential interviewers that I am not a total moron as the 8-year-long uni. adventure implies? How can I show them that I might be a better candidate than the next? What few interviews I had, they never got particularly technical so I doubt that'll be the turning point. I know I really need to polish my social/interviewing skills a bit for sure. But what else can I do?

(1) Work on a dashboard. This is more web-based and I'll be my own boss, reporting to my manager each week and asking for code reviews/mentorship from my manager's subordinates. It'll be primarily writing software. (2) Work on a two-man team on another project. This is more test-related, but I'll be able to work with two other people. It's unclear whether it is more software-based or testing-based, but I think it is more testing-based. I am interested in testing but it is only secondary to writing code.

The issue is that I really want to know what it is to work with people who write code in the industry, which is something I'd benefit from with (2). With (1) this will also be true but not as frequent. The thing about (2) is that it is more testing-based, and I prefer to write code b/c that's my internship and I'd like to tell employers this is what I did in my internship... so that's more valuable to me. I'd be fore-going the working (constantly) on a team part, though, which is also personally valuable.

I value writing code, but also working in a team. And it seems like I can primarily have only one or the other during this internship as far as I know. Which one is going to be more valued by tech companies in the future?"

I walk inside, arms still full with food, my key card, my phone, and my car keys. The second I open the doors, the warning that I have to disarm the security goes off. I immediately remember that the car was left there overnight and I start putting everything down so i can go into my pockets and grab my wallet which has the security code for me written down.

What are some good tips for my resume to get internships, since almost all of them require my GPA ? And is there any hope in the field for people with low GPAs ?

Also, any recommendations on books or websites to improve my studying habits/college lifestyle are welcome!

ps. Sorry for my poor english."

I am currently a Software Developer Intern for a Cloud Enterprise Company and upon returning to school, I have been given a few options.

Option 1: I have been offered an intern position at a different company starting in the fall (which means I will take a semester off of school), the pay is about 20 cents less an hour than what I currently make ($20).

Although the company looks amazing on a resume (wont say which for NDA reasons idk.....just being safe)

Option 2: Stay at my current company and get a raise (maybe), take a semester off of school and go back after the fall.

Option 3: Go to other company and do weekend developer work for my current company, they have listed this option for me because they value my effort here a lot. 

I'm not sure which path would be the best, and Im having a tough time deciding. My current company knows about this job offer, they aren't mad since I am just a student.

All help is appreciated. "
39mq36,4,2015-06-12,Inverted VM CPU response - two processes run 27% quicker than a single one. (x-post /r/virtualization/),bunabhucan,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/39mq36/inverted_vm_cpu_response_two_processes_run_27/,"tl;dr On vmware virtual machine servers, one process takes three and a half minutes, two identical ones takes two and a half minutes.

I have a horde of virtual servers and was configuring some software to multiple processes to parallelize a huge data load. Part of that process is to try to find out where the sweet spot is in terms of how many processes you can add before the CPU chokes. If one runs in 3m, two together take 4m, 3 take 7m and four take 20m then three processes per server is probably the throughput limit if you have limited hardware.

The behavior I see is:

1 process takes 3m21s - 201s

2 processes take 2m26s - 146s

Two processes running together finish in 27% less time than a single process running alone.

This makes no fucking sense unless the ""cpu"" we are seeing is constrained or set up wrong. 

The process I tested with is pure integer comparison and lookups. It generates, stores and then sorts (the same seeded list of) random numbers using lookups.  No floats, no disk access, nothing like that. The exe runs this code in a virtual machine (so a virtual host runs a virtual machine which runs an exe which runs a virtual(ception?) machine which runs my code) and gets executed at runtime. It is not at all challenging for modern processors. It repeats a hundred times for ~12m comparison for the result we see. If I run that test ten times I see slight variance on virtual hardware and almost zero variance on real hardware. I've eliminated many of the simple mistakes that might mess up the results - the test waits for the minute to tick over so they start at the same moment, that kind of thing.

I tested running one session on a 3.4 GHz desktop PC and saw the same process finish in 1m39s or 99s. The cpu never hit 24% utilization.

By that metric, the virtual servers are ""seeing"" a 2.3Ghz cpu with two sessions and a 1.7Ghz cpu with one session.

I know very little about virtualization hardware and configuration parameters. I spoke to the folks who run these servers and there was some mumbling about software versus hardware CPU virtualization. They ""pinned"" two CPU cores to one server but the test results didn't change.

In case my test was not representative of the actual data extraction I am attempting I tried two identical data extracts. I saw roughly the same thing. 4 sessions on 4 servers (one per VM) and 4 sessions on 2 servers (2 per VM.)

1+1+1+1 - 68m 61m 78m 85m - average of 73m

2+2 - 76m 71m 55m 56m - average of 64m

This is about what I would expect. The code being run reads data from disk, processes it horribly inefficiently and writes it out to disk in an xml type format. Slowly. My test only simulates the horribly inefficient processing part. I have no control over virtualception or the horribly inefficient procession portions.

My hunch is that the single session running on the ""dual core Xeon"" server is not taxing the CPU enough to trigger the ""yo, server no longer idle, get busy!"" flag and so it is being run by the intern CPU who is overworked serving too many ""idle"" virtual machines. Two sessions are enough for the intern CPU to let her tell Mr. Hypervisor who rouses some employee CPUs and get them out of the break room.

Questions:

Has anyone seen this type of problem before?

Are there standardized tools to ""exercise"" a CPU at some level of activity - X integer operations per second - rather than just try to peg the CPU? (I could come up with a level of activity that gets my desktop to 23% and repeat on the server.) 

What is the language of your people for this CPU virtualization and is there a faq or overview or introduction somewhere?

My product manager has lots of low level programming experience and understands how the computer works fundamentally. I feel like the stuff I have learned in school has somehow vanished. Like, there should be a so called ""fundamentals jar"" in my head of really important software concepts but I just don't think I have it.

I have taken most of the intense computer science courses such as operating systems, computer graphics, algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, object-oriented programming, and have learned how to use java in eclipse. I understand the basics of a cpu, memory management, system resources. I also understand basics of html and css. I feel very very weak though in the sense that I would have to relook aat a wikipedia page of these concepts if I were to have a discussion in them.

Anyways, is there a book that you think would help cure my self-doubt? I want to be very strong with the fundamentals so that I look like an attractive candidate for future job applications. Thanks!"

Some background: Me and my friend are first year Lithuanian international students in Denmark. In our college it is mandatory to take an internship after 2nd year and we got our sights set on U.S.A. (Columbus, OH most likely). And with that some questions popped up -&gt; 

* How hard it's to get an internship as non US citizen for Java/C# devs (Well 'devs' is a little exaggeration at the moment, but that's what we are focusing on right now)?
* On average how much money we should have before that for accommodation and so? We will be getting 2000 DKK (~300$)/month from our college, but I doubt that's enough?
* How frequent are paid internships in US? (Since that would make our lives easier with accommodation, etc.)

That's all, thanks for any information and sorry for probably sounding like a child with a dream, but we just decided to be really serious about this."

two weeks after being hired at this company, when I submitted my first code for review they told me to delete all my comments. their reasoning was that my code should be readable sans comments and if it isn't redable enough that it needs to be commented it needs to be refactored in smaller methods. I am certain they used the word ""unprofessional"" to describe the practice of using comments.

I went through all the files in the project, and sure enough there is not a single line of comments (apart some auto-generated lines).

-

I was always told that commenting the code is good. I believe those would are the principal reasons

 * anyone else reading it can follow along what the code is doing.
 * encourage the programmer to write code that makes sense. being unable to write clean comments would be an indicator that the code is too messy to begin with.

I will oblige to their conventions, but I thought it was a good subject of discussion to post here. to comment or not to comment? are comments an indicator of an organized, thoughtful programmer or a messy, spaghetti lover programmer?"

This may be an odd request, but there is a chance I will soon be hired for a resnet position without much prior training or experience in the field, and I'm looking for some tips and advice from professionals in the field. I'm not sure where this would best go so if you have a suggestion for a subreddit, please comment it!  

The background is I've been working with this school's IT department as an intern for a couple years, and it so happens that residential networking staff member who takes care of the student laptops/tech issues (as opposed to faculty and staff needs) will be leaving soon for other life plans. Someone is needed to fill the void temporarily--ideally, if I fill this position, I'd like to do a good job so they keep me around instead of hiring someone with more experience.  

My own experience working as an intern in the IT department has mostly been working with standardly-imaged machines, basic troubleshooting (Google), computer set-ups, imaging/multicasting and basic network closet troubleshooting. I don't know too much about hardware, networking or tech specs. In hopes of providing the department with someone who can fill the void temporarily, I've been given minimal training by the current resnet staff member for dealing with student laptops, mostly amounting to checking for unwanted browser extensions, cleaning out Flash Player, running MalwareBytes and one or two recommended antiviruses. He also recommended some resources to keep updated on new operating systems and tech news (related to making sure the school installs/software is compatible with new operating systems).  

I plan on referencing some malware removal guides for the common layperson to build upon the basic knowledge I've been provided. Do you have resources/knowledge you can share that would be useful for a person new to this kind of job with little training? For instance, should I make a system restore point every time I work on a student's laptop (for Windows, not sure what the equivalent would be for Macs)? What is a typical day at work like and what kind of knowledge is required for the kind of issues which come up that you  have to take care of?  

**tldr; might be hired soon for a job working with student laptops I have limited experience for. Asking for guides, advice, typical workdays to help me gain a better sense of what I can learn to help me when I start.**

Thanks so much in advance for your advice!"
39ob6k,5,2015-06-13,Working in engineering in the US with just an American PhD,potro777,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/39ob6k/working_in_engineering_in_the_us_with_just_an/,"Hey guys, I need a little help and a few tips from the Americans  engineers (future and current) in here :) . Im a recent engineer graduate from Brazil (electrical engineering) who in the next fall semester is going to start a master degree in Korea, and after that I plan to go for a phd in an american university, and hopefully staying for good in 'murica working as an engineer. The reasons why I didn't just went strait to a master degree also in the US is mainly because of funding and capability to land in a good institution. To explain better, I studied in a federal university here in Brazil, but since brazilians institutions do not have a very good presence in those international rankings, I feared that my qualifications would be overlooked when in comparisons with other international students. In Korea I got offered a full scholarship plus living expenses at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), which is supposed to be a pretty good school with significant international presence, so I figured that getting a masters with good grades and of course nice publications from there would give me a better chance of landing in at least a public ivy for my phd. I have no plans at all to work in Korea, I actually studied abroad there during my undergrad and did an internship at a big korean company, and over there I was able to see the horrible life of the asian engineer, which honestly I hope I do not get to experience.

So anyway, now that I already told a little bit of my backstory, I wanted to know the opinion of /r/engineeringstudents regarding my plans and my chances of actually succeeding in it :) Any of you guys have heard of KAIST? With a high gpa and good research experience, do you think that I would have a good chance getting into a top PhD program in America? And after finishing school, do companies hire foreign PhD graduates? What is the average salary that is offered to foreign engineers in this conditions?

Another thing that I wanted to ask is regarding acreditation. Brazil is not a signatory of the washington accord, but Korea is, so both my master and phds would be from accredited institutions. Would it be possible in the future for me to become a licensed engineer ? Or ABET just care about your undergrad??

Anyway, sorry for doing a riddle cosplay asking all these questions haha Any feedback, personal experience stories, tips and comments will be highly appreciated. Thanks!

* I am a university student from a European country where I have attended all my courses and I only have some projects left to finish in order to get my degree (I will probably finish uni by January 2016)
* I have been in a placement since February in a company in London as a software developer (kind of through my uni but not really).

Now my contract with the company ends end of August and the company really wants to keep me but that will depend upon how successful the company is going to be in the next 2 months.

I personally want to remain in London and finish my uni degree (the last couple of projects) from here but my main issue is financial stability. I am trying to prepare for the worst (in case the company goes to shit) and I want to not remain without a job after end of August. 

**Here is my question**: Is it possible as a student to find a developer job in London? Keep in mind that I have no courses to attend or anything, also I don't care about the job title all I care is that it pays good enough to financially sustain myself so if it even was an internship, if it paid good enough I would be ok with it. My plan B would be to find a shitty student job, I just want to fully explore the possibility of having a developer job before going for a shitty student job.

**TL;DR:** I am a student that has no courses to attend but doesn't have a degree (yet) and I also have software development experience. Is it possible to find a developer position in London that pays well enough to financially sustain myself or will I have to find a shitty student job?"

No one in my family or family friends circle has ever gone to college. I knew nothing about it going in, and just learned as I went along (costing me a few extra semesters). 

I am now in the same boat with graduate school. I have talked to a few professors about getting a masters/phd, but I feel their advice is bias (they all want me to stay and work for them) and may be outdated. I would really like to get advice from students that are currently in graduate school, know people in grad school, or have graduated with a graduate degree.

Here is a little bit about me:

I have an offer from a professor at my current school for an assistantship (Masters or PhD track). It would pay for my tuition and I would receive a modest allowance every month. 
Major: Mechanical Engineering 
School: A relatively small engineering focused, state, tech school (i.e. Podunk Tech). Although we are well known for our engineering program within the state.
GPA: 3.92
GRE: Just recently found out what this was. Planning on taking it before the end of the summer.
Graduation: Dec. 2015
Experience: Summer internship in local manufacturing plant. Accomplishments included doubling the output of the area I was working in. Although I was still not well received there (I was not invited back), I was more of a book worm at that point and did not know how to navigate the industries social landscape well. I am now currently doing research at a national lab on a fellowship for the summer.
Extracurricular Activities: I am a member of two engineering honor societies for which I tutor other engineering students and sometimes do some community service like pick up trash around campus.


I'd like advice on any of these questions:

Given my ""about me"" information, what level of schools would likely accept me and give me funding?

How much does the schools name/prestige matter for an engineering graduate degree?

Is a graduate degree a good idea for me with so little work experience, should I get an engineering job and then come back to school in ~5 years?

Is a graduate degree in mechanical engineering, likely in vibrations, a good idea at all? 

I am interested in all concentrations of mechanical engineering. Is there a concentration with a better job security and/or earning potential than vibrations that I should be looking for?


I feel really lost when trying to lay out my life after graduation right now. The only people I have been able to get advice from are some of my current schools professors. Any advice you have on life after obtaining a bachelors in engineering is appreciated.

I spent tens of thousands of dollars on a degree which has so far landed me in three separate kitchens around town, each barely above minimum wage. I feel like the biggest failure, not only because of where I am, but because of what I did or ended up NOT doing to get here.

No jobs want anything to do with me - International Affairs sounds like a cool thing to study (and it is) - but outside of government people don't know anything about what I've studied and are hesitant to trust my skill set. In conjunction with my lack of internships or any real academic references my ""career"" if we can call it that was dead ended before it began. On the flip side I could probably work in a kitchen the rest of my life doing terrible prep work and cutting my fingers off.

I'd do it over again if I knew how. But the more I read, the less I know. I'd go back to study computers. Can you get another degree? How do you even go about starting?"

I won't go into detail on the price. Apparently that's not very couth. But I'll tell you this much, it was a really good price. Downtown location, with some of the best restaurants and theaters just a stone's throw away. Or rather, a stone's drop from 32 floors up. It's a lavish one bedroom with a big patio and floor to ceiling windows that look out directly to the condos across the street. Even at the amazing price I nabbed it at, it's still a little expensive for me. But I'd wanted to live in a place like this since I was a little kid. And now I could finally afford it (kinda'). 

I was ecstatic to move in, and the first few weeks were like living in a Christopher Nolan movie. Waking up everyday to a huge, beautiful cityscape just behind my blinds. I would get dressed (everything seems cooler when you're in a nice 3-piece suit), get a cup of gourmet coffee (I just got a Keurig as a flat-warming gift) and just watch the city begin to wake up from my windows. You see people in movies do it, and it seems like such a bold yet boring thing to do. But, when you feel like you're on top of the world, sometimes you just like to appreciate the view. Worth every penny of debt. At least, that's how I felt at first. But, it wasn't long before something very odd spoiled everything I love about this place. 

Just last night, I fell asleep on the couch playing video games and being generally unproductive. I woke up around 3 or so in the morning, hunched over and the controller dropped at my feet. I was snapped awake by a cold chill that drifted over me like a phantom. I shivered and sat up, wiping the gunk out of the corners of my mouth. The cold felt like fingers creeping under my skin, and it shocked me into full awareness. 

I got up, in my underwear and t-shirt. No suit at 3 in the morning. I tried to shake the feeling off. The feeling like I was being watched or someone was stepping over my grave. I went to the kitchen and nuked a cup of milk and reached for my chocolate mix. I noticed the lights in the condo straight across the street flicker on. I glanced over, and saw a man closing his front door. I went back to what I was doing and just focused on my hot chocolate. 

I stirred my glass and started to take a slow and cautious sip as I approached my giant windows. I stared across the street and watched my neighbor come home late, oblivious to my attentions. I felt like Jimmy Stewart in a Hitchcock movie. Y'know, like a classy voyeur. I was just starting to convince myself I was ok when I started to get a good look at my neighbor across the way. 

I nearly choked on my drink when the man came to his window and looked out. It was me. It wasn't some guy who was the same sort of handsome, or really styled his hair and beard like mine. It was actually me. Like looking in a mirror, but 40 yards away and I wasn't wearing the same clothes. I also had a pretty disheveled head of hair and looked pretty grim.

I nearly shit a brick. I thought I was still asleep, at first. With all the creeping cold and anxiety, it made perfect sense I was having a lame nightmare. Just as I contemplated that theory, a splash of burning hot milk met the top of my foot. I jumped and spilled even more. I suppose the singing pain was clue enough that this was all real.

I didn't even care about the pain in my foot. I stood there in the small puddle of hot chocolate, pouring more from the tilted cup in my loose grip. My identical neighbor was imitating my window-watching habit, with his own depressing twist. It looked like I was crying, and I had been out in the rain, but there wasn't a drop all day. Hell, there hadn't been any rain for at least a week. He wore a wet, black leather coat. It looked nice. For just a moment, I wondered why I didn't have that same coat. The wonderment faded quickly as my doppelganger pulled a shiny black pistol from his nice leather coat. 

The other me started to heave with his intense sobs. He seemed to shout something directly at me, or maybe just at his reflection on the glass. He beat his fist against his chest as the sobbing got worse and his eyes bulged red. A word seemed to catch in his throat just as he pulled the gun up to his temple and squeezed the trigger. I watched my own brains get blown out all over the window across the street and 32 stories up. I couldn't speak and could barely breathe. I grabbed my phone to call the police, but I had no idea what I was going to tell them. Just as I pulled the phone up to dial, I glanced back across the street. The window was dark and there was no light from within. I couldn't tell if the blood was on the glass anymore, but it didn't look like it. 

I decided not to call the cops. At the very least, I'd sound mentally unwell. I'm not sure what to do, guys. I couldn't fall asleep after seeing what I saw. So, I came here, because hell if I know what to do. The sun's about to go down, and I've been glancing out of my windows every minute or two. Afraid I'll see myself again, a big gaping hole in my head and shouting like a depraved loon. What should I do, Reddit?

~~------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**Update**
Thanks for the advice, everyone. I'm still not sure what's going on across the street, but it's gotten much worse. 

I stayed up watching whatever I thought might keep me enthralled. Part of the awesome-bachelor-pad-package had to include a 55"" 4K TV, so I lined up a blu-ray watchlist and got a little drunk. After Fifth Element and a little over halfway through Inception, I had run low on my 6th Shiner and was running high on stored urine. I got up and made my way to the bathroom.

After taking a piss, I headed back into the kitchen and grabbed another Prickly Pear. I had just popped the cap off when I made the mistake of passing my gaze by the window. There was a single red light on in the window across the street. I caught a quick glimpse of two people this time. I ignored it and went right back to Inception. It was the hallway scene, and I fucking love that scene. But I sat there, and I couldn't focus on a single second of the movie. Instead, I found myself trying to use my peripherals to spy those big, dangerous windows that had been such a selling point when I was shown the place. 

Finally, I couldn't deny myself any longer, and I shot up and approached the window. I put my free hand up on the glass and leaned in to diminish the reflection and glare. There were the two dark figures, moving from one room to another in the dim light. I couldn't make out any of their exact features, but it was obvious they were a man and woman. They headed into a red-lit bedroom with a big king-sized bed and billowing white sheets. I couldn't see a ton of the room, but it didn't look anything like my apartment. Everything except for a Spider-man poster that I have. And in just about the same spot in my room. In the red light, I could see more of the couple. She had dark skin, raven hair, and a red two piece that definitely complimented her slender but supple figure. He had shoulder length hair and a stylish blue pinstripe suit. The angle she was in covered his face, and I couldn't see hers very well either. She sat him down on the bed, her back to the window. She started to slowly undress down to lingerie that could hardly be said to be clothing at all. She swayed in a slow and sexy rhythm, shaking her ass back and forth as she tossed her clothes aside. 

I had completely forgotten about the night before. Not a thought to what I had seen in that exact same condo just 24 hours ago. An ass like the one she had will kinda' do that to you. I suppose the Shiner wasn't helping any either. She started to bend over and push the lucky bastard in the suit down onto the bed gently. I took a hefty swig of the beer and leaned into the window even more, pressing my forehead against the cold glass. It looked like she either handcuffed or tied his hands to the bed frame. Some classic kinky stuff. I was not disappointed in the direction this was headed. Then, she sat back up again, and said something before getting up and walking away from the bed. The man in bed leaned his head up to watch her go, and I would've done the same if I hadn't then seen his face. It was me again. Even in the somewhat dim red light, I could immediately recognize my features. The thin eyebrows, slim jaw and cheekbones, and dark eyes. The hair was much longer, and he was clean shaved. But it was definitely me. I chugged the rest of the Shiner frantically, hoping the alcohol would just make me pass out and I could forget this moment. No such luck. 

My heart started to thump in my chest like war drums. The me across the street just laid his happy head back, rocking his feet back and forth. The sexy dark girl returned from the bathroom with something behind her back. She playfully approached and said something with a big smile. My counterpart laughed and bit at the air towards her, like a hungry wolf. The dark girl grit her teeth and without hearing it, I could tell she growled. She rounded the bed, her hands still behind her back. When her back was fully to the window, I could finally see what was in her hands. A knife. A big fucking knife. 

""Woah, what the fuck? Hey! Hey!"", I yelled in my own condo while I banged my palms on the glass. As if there was any chance the me over there could hear it. 

The dark girl swayed a little more, then started to crawl up the bed. Crawl over the other me. She still held the knife behind her back with one hand as she ran her body over mine. Sorry, over the other me. She stroked his hair with her free hand. My doppelganger smiled and leaned in to kiss her neck. She whispered something in his ear, then brought the big shiny blade out from behind her back. She yanked his head back by the hair and slid the knife across his throat. The blood poured down in a wave from one side of the neck to the other. She quickly straddled him and began to stab. And stab and stab. I couldn't see most of them, because her body was blocking a direct view. Thank fucking christ for that. But the blood. God, the blood just sprayed in every direction with each double handed thrust she made. It streaked across the walls, the furniture, the billowing white sheets. It painted thin, flickering red lines on the window. 

The sight of so much of what was pretty much my own blood, coupled with all the Shiner in my gut caused me to rush to the kitchen sink and puke. I didn't waste time to even rinse before rushing to my bedroom and grabbing my gun. Yes, I own a gun. A 1911. Another one of those things I always wanted and shouldn't have spent that much money on. I had no idea what I was going to do. I should've just called the police, like any rational person would. Instead, I bolted out of my room in my underwear and holding a loaded pistol. I looked across the street again, and there was nothing. No red light or streaks of blood. No murder scene out of a fucking HBO series involving yours truly. Just a dark and apparently empty condo. 

I sat in my own dark home, my recliner turned to the window. I had my gun in hand, thumb on the hammer. I sat like that for at least an hour after I saw that evil bitch stab me like it was getting her off. No lights coming on. No sexy dark girl cleaning blood off or tying up a bunch of trash bags. Not even a door opening and a momentary light from a hallway as she dashed out. Just motionless shadows and no sign of life. Finally, I got the nerve to turn away and put my 1911 down. I sat down at my computer and updated this thread. I'm losing sleep, guys. And I don't know if what I'm seeing is real. I really hope I'm not going crazy. I can't afford to see a shrink and pay for this place. You folks have to help me. I'm losing my shit. 

~~----~~

**Update**

I called off work today. It was raining like crazy (still is), and you could tell I wasn't the first person to call in when I spoke with the front desk girl. I knew I wasn't going to be able to focus on work today, and I had more important things to do. Like test the foundations of my sanity, for instance. I checked my 1911, put it in the holster, and put the holster on. I put my suit jacket on over the holster, buttoned it up, then pulled my raincoat on over that. I had an Irish coffee to bolster my courage and keep me on my toes. I set out from my apartment, and crossed the street in the heavy downpour. 

I approached the entrance to the tall grey building. I tilted my head back and squinted into the rain. I stared up at the 32nd floor. I didn't count them up, but I could dart my eyes right to the window straight across from mine. It was identical to every window above, beside, or below it, but I could recognize that one instantly somehow. I looked back down as I got close to the doorman. He smiled politely and opened the door.

""Hello, sir. Welcome."", he said as he held the door open. 

He didn't call me by name. And why would he? I'd never been in this building before, after all. I was relieved he didn't somehow recognize me. I half expected him to call me by my middle name and welcome me home. I just smiled back and nodded as I walked inside. I found the directory in the lobby. I looked up floor 32. I didn't know which condo it was. I couldn't just assume it would be the same number as mine, even though that unit was either vacant or unlisted. It didn't seem like I had a lot of options, and I'm not exactly a detective. I caught the elevator by myself and hit the button for 32.

The elevator up was a slow and anxious ride. The elevator car was old and vintage looking. It had brass railing and mirrors that were aged and dirty in the corners. The car shuddered to a stop on the 28th floor, and the heavy double doors creaked open. Standing there was a little old lady with a big silly hat that cast shadows on most of her face and upper body. She gave me a grin that was full of crooked or missing teeth. She waddled up beside me, pressed the number for 31, and stared towards the doors as they stammered back closed. We rode up the next 4 floors in awkward silence. Maybe just awkward for me. After all, I had a loaded gun nestled neatly under my arm. Somehow, being near an old woman made me more nervous about having a gun. As though it was way easier for me to accidentally shoot an old lady than a young person. She smelled something awful, too. Not just regular old-person-smell, or even trumped up dirty-old-person-smell. It was something new, distinct, and awful. Like a cloud of chalk in the air, mixed with burning hair. It was hard to breath in. One of many reasons I didn't strike up a conversation.

The elevator dinged at floor 31, and the odd old lady waddled back out of the elevator. She stopped once she was fully out and standing with her back to me. She turned her body to face me just as the doors started to close. I watched her smile at me with that horrible row of upper teeth protruding from her overbite.

""It's nice seeing you again, Mr.... You look much better."", she said to me as the doors shut closed right after. I didn't type it here, but she said my last name. I'd never seen the old bat in my life, but somehow she knew my name. That horrible fucking smile was the last thing I saw before the mirrored doors shut, and I was left staring at my own dumbfounded expression. I stood, frozen in confusion and at least a little fear and paranoia. The elevator rumbled to a stop again, and dinged at the 32nd floor. I hesitated a minute before slowly exiting the floor. 

I made my way down the hall, and began to get a creeping sense of familiarity. The old, boring beige wall paper. The antique, bronze light fixtures made to look like candles. The random red leather chairs down the halls, with wear and tear down their arms. It all felt like a hazy dream I'd had many times before, but always forgot soon after waking up. I walked in auto-pilot mode down the halls and to apartment 3213. The same number as my condo just across the street. I wasn't sure how I'd lead myself right there. The layout was definitely similar, but not the exact same as my floor. But here I was, like I'd been following GPS directions. 

I stared at the door for at least a full minute without moving. I was so worried about who would answer. If I'd see myself answer the door. What would I even say.

""Hey, I'm you... and I watched you die twice in horrible ways. Would you kindly cut that shit out?"" 

Yeah, I don't think that was gonna' cut it. But I pondered no longer and just manned up. I knocked on the door with just two quick knocks. 30 seconds and nothing happened. I didn't even hear anyone moving around inside. But I still waited another 30 seconds before knocking again, this time a little louder and longer. A few seconds later, the door across the hall behind me clicked open. I turned and almost gasped aloud. 

It was the sexy dark girl from the night before. Her hair was much longer, and she wore glasses now. But that was her. She smile sweetly at me, and spoke in a cute little voice.

""Can I help you?"", she asked from behind her thick glasses. 

I couldn't answer right away, but finally, I was able to speak, ""Uh, yeah... do you know who lives here?"". I motioned my head back to the door for 3213. 

""That apartment's been empty for months."", she shook her head, her raven bangs swaying back and forth. 

""Are you sure? There's not a guy living there that looks like me... like, exactly like me? Uh, my twin brother."", I asked, trying not to flip out right in front of her. 

""Nope, definitely not. I'd remember if a cute guy moved in across the hall."", she said as she giggled a little. I could see why the other me fell for the psycho bitch. Psycho gorgeous. She pulled one of her hands from out behind the door frame, and in it was a shiny little knife. My hand immediately twitched, trying to shoot to the 1911 under my jacket. I just nervously smiled instead as she continued. ""I'm actually baking some chicken right now, if you're hungry. You could call your brother. Maybe he lives on another floor?"".

""No, that's ok."", I said, trying to smile genuinely. I could feel the sweat start to gather just under my skin. I couldn't stop staring at the knife. ""I've gotta' go, actually. It was nice meeting you.""

""The pleasure was all mine!"", she called out in that adorable little voice as I turned my back to her and quickly headed back down the hall. She didn't seem to recognize me. Or she's so crazy that she'd forgotten she killed a dude that looked just like me the night before. I suspected the latter wasn't the case. 

I headed back out into the rain with more questions than answers. Went to a local coffee shop and whipped out my tablet. Just thought I should update you guys. I don't want to go back to that condo tonight, but I don't have anywhere else to go. Maybe I should get some really dark curtains or something before I head back home. 

~~----~~

**Update**

I don't feel safe in my condo anymore. Things are starting to escalate in a very strange and frightening way. Shit, let me explain.

I was feeling pretty haggard coming in from the rain earlier, and not to mention the mental roller coaster that going up there gave me. Seeing the dark girl with the knife. Inviting me into her apartment like a black widow spider luring her doomed mate. But she did look different. Her hair couldn't have grown that much in a night. And she didn't seem too thrown by seeing a guy she killed rise from the dead and knock on his own door. And what about the old lady and her horrid stench cloud. She knew my name. She said I'd looked better, or something to that effect. What the fuck did that mean? My head ached with questions and dread concerns. 

I stayed up late, mostly scouring the internet for information on the condo across the street and seeing if this sort of thing has happened to other people. Both searches came up with a whole lot of nothing. Nothing useful, anyway. I also spent about a half hour researching forms of dementia and schizophrenia. Just to be sure. I've always heard crazy people don't think they're crazy. I kept telling myself that, as though suspecting I was crazy was in some weird way affirming that I wasn't. 

It was just before 3AM when a light shimmered on from the window across the street. It was so instant that I couldn't help but glance over, and then it was too late to not stare. There I was again, slamming the front door to my other condo across the way. I had a long grey scarf and a goatee. I ran my gloved fingers through my hair in a state of frustration. I was cursing to myself over there. I knew that I shouldn't be watching myself again, but how could I not? How could you turn away from watching another you? Whether it was real or delusions of an ever fracturing mind, it didn't matter. I couldn't look away. 

The other me marched through his apartment, turning on every light as he continued to shout at himself. It looked like he was running his own name through the mud. Pounding his chest and slapping the side of this head. He started to go through his bedroom and pack things into a suitcase. That's when I started to look around his well lit condo and realize it was a lot like mine. I hadn't gotten a great look the night before, but this was definitely a different apartment tonight. Different furniture and decorations. To be specific, a lot of my furniture and decorations. It wasn't exact, but god damn it, there were a lot of striking similarities. I even recognized my Keurig in the exact same spot on the counter where I keep mine. I glanced back at mine, half expecting it not to be there. Like this son of a bitch across the street was stealing more than just my likeness. 

I turned back and the other me started to load stacks of cash from a metal briefcase to his luggage. Just as he was trying to zip the suitcase closed, my phone rang. Not just the other me's phone, but my fucking phone rang. I nearly jumped out of my own skin. I spun around and snatched it off the kitchen counter. It was an unknown number. I looked back across the street, and the other me was answering his phone. As he did, mine just connected on its own. I didn't even touch the screen. 

""Fuck."", I murmured, muffling myself as I did. 

I put a hand over the receiver end and pulled the phone slowly up to my ear. I could hear my own voice on the line, but I wasn't speaking. 

""Hello, who's this?"", the other me asked as I watched him from my window. Stopping what he was doing to take the call. 

""You know who this is."", answered a deep and raspy voice with a slavic accent. 

""Yeah... look, Demitri, I'm going to get you your money, I just need a little more..."", I pleaded before I was cut off. 

""Always with the excuses, (He said my fucking name. My actual first name). You bring me the money now."", Demitri said with a very angry tone. 

""Ok, ok. Look, I can meet you in two hours at that place on Broadway. I'll have your money then."", I offered him.

""Why not now?"", Demitri asked in a friendly manner. 

Just then, my identical neighbor's door burst open and three large men with tattoos and weapons rushed into the condo. The other me bolted like a god damn cheetah from his bedroom, across the living room, and towards the kitchen. Maybe that's where he kept his gun. Seemed like a bad place to me, especially now. Before he could make it there, one of the tattooed men took three quick shots at him with a pistol. His couch (which was exactly like my couch) erupted downy feathers into the air as the first two shots missed. The third ripped through my doppelganger's leg and he went tumbling to the floor. 

Two of the large men quickly grabbed me from off the floor and yanked my injured body up onto my knees. The third man approached slowly, talking and pulling a very large machete out from his belt. He seemed to be making some point as I panted and sweat, a muscle-bound ex-con pulling on each arm. The third man stopped talking and leaned in close to me. He stared for what seemed like a long, tense moment. Then he quickly raised the machete high and brought it down to the floor, cutting off my right arm in one swing. I could see me scream and thrash across the street as my blood sprayed all over my nice white carpet. 

The men holding me didn't flinch. Like they were at work. Before I could even register the level of atrocity playing out in front of me, the machete fucker hacked down on my other arm. This one took two strong bashes before lobbing off my other limb. I could feel my stomach wrench like Bruce Lee had been sidekicking me in the intestines for the last hour. I thought about getting my 1911 and just firing right through the window, but I couldn't move a muscle. Maybe I was just in shock, I don't know. 

I screamed and bled for a moment longer before the machete wielding fucker chopped into my neck with two sturdy whacks and my head hit the floor. It rolled a couple feet across the pretty white carpet, leaving a red trail behind it. The machete man grabbed my severed head by the hair and lifted it up to stare straight into my scared and dead eyes. He smiled with a row of regular teeth mixed with gold ones. He slowly turned his own head and the severed one to look out the window and directly across the street. At me. Right as he turned to catch my eyeline, the lights in the other condo went out. 

And just at that moment, a loud banging rapped against my door. I almost yelled, it startled me so bad. I immediately grabbed my 1911 off the coffee table and made sure it was loaded. I inched towards the door as the banging continued and started to shake my walls. My muscles began to tense the closer I got. My hands were shaking, but I was more than ready to unload a clip into a fuckhead with a machete. The banging kept getting louder and it seemed angrier. I cautiously placed the muzzle against the door and leaned in to look through the peep hole. Right as I reached my eye to the door, the banging stopped completely. I looked out and just saw a hallway. My heart rate slowed down just a little, and I opened the door to peak both ways. Not a single person.

I went back inside, locked the deadbolt, and busted out the black label bottle. I'm a few drinks in now as I finish typing this. I've got my Johnny Walker and my 1911, so at least there's that. But whatever's happening, it's starting to bleed into my condo over here. I don't know what might happen tomorrow night, but I'm not looking forward to it. 

~~----~~

**Update**

I stayed out pretty late tonight. At work, I did everything I could to keep my mind off of going home. I surfed a lot of Reddit, I tried to strike up as many bullshit conversations as I could, and I powered through the work I had. Anything to postpone the realization, that eventually I was going to have to come back to the condo. As the work day neared to a close, I started to rally a group to go drinking. On a monday night, I was just hoping for the resident alcoholics, but I managed to get a few lively souls to tag along as well.

We stayed mostly downtown, only hitting one bar on the northeast side for the first hour. Then we headed to my home turf. We went from posh little bars to loud crowded clubs. One of the interns brought a big ass bag of pot with him, and I didn't mind indulging everytime he rolled and lit a joint. 

He'd pass it to me pre-lit, with a big stupid grin and say, ""Here ya' go bro, you can have greens."". Don't mind if I do. 

We got drunk and stoned and I'm pretty sure Rick and Steve did coke in the bathroom at Bohanan's. I don't remember how it got started, but I even ended up making out with Cindy, the HR girl. Not my proudest moment, but she's kind of cute. For a solid two hours, I managed to push the whole matter of the condo out of my head. I just had a bunch of dumb, loud fun. 

But before I knew it, the bars were closing, and everyone was going their separate ways. I tried to convince Cindy to come over (not even for the sex, but just to have another person with me in the condo). She gave me a big kiss then said it was a bad idea. She got in a cab and smiled at me one more time before driving away. I wasn't too far from home, so I walked. Home. I don't even think of it like that now, but the word is familiar. 

I stepped into my building, nodding vacantly at the doorman as he greeted me. I dragged my feet through the main entrance and reception area, my head held low. I felt like a child on his way to being punished. So badly not wanting to go, but knowing I had no other choice. Dreading the inevitable is a really stressful feeling. As I entered the lobby, someone caught my eye. I looked up to see the smelly, little old lady from the day before. She was walking away at the other end of the lobby towards the elevators. 

""Hey! Hey, wait!"", I called out to her. She didn't turn around or even stop. She just kept waddling forward, her big stupid hat shaking with her awkward little steps. 

I raced after her, almost within reach just as she rounded the corner to the elevators. She was out of my sight for just a second. I turned the corner after her, but she wasn't there. Instead of running into her, I ran into a puddle of something and slipped onto my ass. Hurt like hell. I pulled my wet palms up to see what it was, and even before seeing the red, I could smell it. I was sitting in a pool of blood. It was all over my hands and clothes. I looked up and saw myself in the middle of the elevator hall. It was the me from last night, knelt down and both of my severed arms lying on the tile floor. The blood was mine, flowing out from the bloody nubs at my sides. My face was very pale and my eyes were wide. My head was tilted slightly back and my mouth was screaming, but I couldn't hear anything. I was so insanely afraid, but I still managed to start crawling backwards, away from the other me. As I did, the other me's head began to lean back even further. I saw a thin line of red appear on my neck and quickly grow into a canyon of red. Then my head simply fell backwards off my shoulders. 

I began to hasten my crawling. Just as my back hit an elevator door, I heard a *bing* sound, and the door opened behind me. I fell back inside the elevator, and immediately jumped up and pressed the Close Doors button. They closed and nothing reached in to yank me out before they did. I pressed 32 and that's when I realized my hands were clean. The blood was gone. I checked myself over and there were no big red stains on my clothes or shiny blood starting to dry on my skin. I was clean. I didn't know what the fuck was going on. 

As the elevator passed the 12th floor, it started to shake a little. It was an old building, and it wasn't the first time the elevator had the shakes. But then the lights started to flicker on and off, and that was both new and terrifying. I unbuttoned my coat a little for easier access to my pistol. That's right, I had my 1911 on me all day. After all the shit I'd seen the last few days, it seemed like a good idea. The flickering got worse, like I was back at one of the clubs from earlier that night with strobe lights assaulting me. Then the lights went out completely for a moment. It felt like a hell of a long time, but it was probably about 3 seconds. When they flickered back on, the old woman was standing right in front of me. As soon as I saw her, I could smell her. Like she appeared out of thin fucking air. I yelled in shock and immediately gagged from the stench. She just started laughing at me as the light continued to flicker us in and out of darkness. Her hiss like laugh made my skin crawl. I reached for my gun instinctively. The old lady flickered, laughing in the light for a moment before returning to the dark. When the light flickered back, the dark sexy girl was there, knife high in the air and already coming down. She was laughing too. I yelled more and opened fire. I shot three times rapidly. The muzzle flash lit the whole elevator with each shot. On the third shot, the lights stopped flickering and I was alone. There were three bullet holes in the door, but they didn't seem to go all the way through.

The door opened and I didn't even think. I just ran. I ran all the way to my apartment and quickly unlocked the door then locked it behind me. I backed away from my door, pistol still in my hand. I was sweating and could barely breath. Just as I backed into the living room, I heard a loud thud on the window behind me. I spun around, aiming my 1911 at my patio windows. There was nothing there. Not on my patio, at least. But across the street, there I was. And not just one of me, this time. There were three of me. One in every window of every room in the condo across the way. And the condo no longer looked kind of like mine, it was now an exact copy. The only thing missing was a confused and scared me, holding a pistol and staring out at myself.

The me in the bedroom was precariously standing on a chair, his neck attached to a rope, the rope attached to the ceiling fan. He stepped off the chair and his neck immediately snapped. His hands and feet started to shake and his body began to convulse. The me in the living room was being beaten to death by a man in all black with a ski-mask and a metal baseball bat. Each blow sent little clouds of red into the air, and I could see a big fucking grin through the ski-mask mouth hole. The me in the kitchen was getting ripped to damn shreds by three big dogs. Attacked by god damn dogs. *Why the fuck is this happening to me?* That's all I could think as I watched myself die three times at once. 

Then the lights in the condo across the street all went out at once. It was pitch black over there again. After a few seconds, my cell phone began to ring loudly. I never have that thing off vibrate. Before I could even pull it out of my pocket, my home phone started to ring loudly as well. Then my microwave timer began to sound. My TV and radio both turned on to very noisy programs at full volume. My alarm clock beeped piercingly from my room. The stampede of sounds began to work my eardrums over, and I felt like my head was going to split in half.

""Stop it, you mother fuckers! Leave me alone!"", I shouted, waving my gun around as though there were anyone to shoot or scare.

And right then, everything stopped. The TV and radio turned off, the phones stopped ringing, and everything else in the condo fell silent. Even I held my breath a little, making no noise, waiting for the next wave. Then, I heard the first one. A light scratching sound on the glass behind me. Then another scratch joined the first. Then another, and another. I slowly turned around, so afraid at the thought of what was on my patio and how it'd gotten there. Then I saw them. At least a dozen dead versions of me, scratching at the glass.  There was a me covered in burned flesh, and another with a metal pipe right through his chest. One of them bled from bullet holes over most of his body. Another had a huge chunk of flesh ripped from his stomach and neck, as though he'd been half eaten by something. And all of them were scratching at the windows of my patio with rolled back eyes and gaping but silent mouths. Just standing there, telling me I was soon to join them with their blank, lifeless eyes. 

I was so fucking scared out of my mind, I nearly emptied my clip at them. The only thing that stopped me, was the thought that breaking the glass would let them in. Instead, I pointed my gun and shouted at them to just go away and leave me alone. I could feel my throat start to burn, I yelled so loud and hard. And then, just like that, they were gone. It's not as though they even disappeared, they were just one. I blinked and my patio was empty. And thank god the scratching sound was gone. 

I'm at the end of my rope, Reddit. I don't know if I can keep taking this. And now I don't even know if I can leave my apartment. It's out there... whatever ""it"" is. Someone please help me, before I go completely insane... or worse.

39reh9,3,2015-06-13,Advice: I've been asked to make a career switch by a company,dtoxtwelve,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/39reh9/advice_ive_been_asked_to_make_a_career_switch_by/,"Background: I was an intern with Company A for almost a year. During that time, I handled significant turmoil. Company A lost an important employee unexpectedly and a significant amount of the workload was placed on me. I did well and impressed them. I finished out my internship with the company on good terms and went on to other things. I worked at another company for one year and did well there. I left a few months ago and have been job hunting since then.

Over a year after leaving Company A, the CFO at Company A contacted me and asked if I would be willing to do some contract work for them. I agreed, since the chance to make extra money never hurts. This was over a month ago. They used this as an opportunity to re-evaluate me and they were impressed with my work.

Last Friday, the CFO asked to me meet with me. She told me that I am a valuable asset that the company would be foolish to let go twice. The CFO told me that there are no current positions that utilize my experience, but that the company is creating a new Director of Communications position in the next month. The CFO told me that she would push for me to get this job. The CFO told me that the position  would offer me a 20% increase in salary of what I was paid at my last job. 

The change is drastic enough to call it a career change. That said, my job search is not going well and an increase in pay, responsibility, and having my own office seem too good to pass up.

Should I take them up on the offer? "

i really want to do well on this class because i would hate to get a C or F grade for a class i took over the summer ( i feel like i gave away my vacation just to lower my gpa)

but i don't want to drop it because i'd feel pretty bad knowing my parents paid for it (the only class i took over the summer)

39s0ya,3,2015-06-14,What am I able to do with my degree and current (lack of experience)?,amrd,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/39s0ya/what_am_i_able_to_do_with_my_degree_and_current/,"     I just graduated with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and a minors in math at an average university. However I don't have any intern/work experience in this field. 

     The past year has been really hectic for me, I didn't do an internship in the summer due to me deciding to go to China instead to be with my grandmother who was expected to die soon (she died Christmas week 2014), the family situation related to her declining health gave me quite a lot of stress which tanked my grades during the fall semester of my senior year and I even had to go back to China during the spring semester to attend the funeral and had to deal with a lot of stuff (arguments over inheritance and such) that shouldn't have involved me but somehow did. 

     I've applied to a lot of places after I graduated and haven't heard back yet from anyone (how long does it usually take?). Normally I wouldn't be too worried yet since I graduated college with no debt and have ~1 years worth of savings. My family however is putting on a lot of pressure to find a job which is stressing me out. All the jobs I'm looking at requires 2-4 years of experience and it seems most of the good internships want me to still be in college. I'm starting to worry since its been almost a month after graduation and I still have no real destination. I would really appreciate any advice that can help me figure out what to do correctly with my current education and lack of work experience. 

 TL:DR Family stuff happened so I couldn't focus on my college and after college matters. Now I'm graduated without experience and facing a lot of pressure to get a job from my family and need advice/help. 

EDIT: Resume: http://imgur.com/2XFY4sE
This is my resume for R&amp;D and lab related jobs. I use another when applying for medical device. Differences is subtract lab technique/equipment section and add medical device design knowledge + high school work where I worked at a Chinese restaurant during high school as a cashier/waiter and then became an assistant manager (technically in name only) for a little while before going to college due to me always helping the managers and workers there with English translations.

39s2tg,29,2015-06-14,"Something, or someone, won't let my sister wake up",not_bran_stark,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/39s2tg/something_or_someone_wont_let_my_sister_wake_up/,"If you have younger siblings, you’ll understand me when I say that they’re always “little” to you.  Little brother.  Little sister.  They can grow up, become adults, even surpass you in some ways.  But there’s always an element of protection we older siblings feel towards our younger counterparts. Despite the multitude of ways in which they can drive us crazy, we still love them.  We still protect them.


Keira is my only sister. The baby. We're close enough that sometimes we're mistaken for twins. We went to the same university. Live in the same city. Have keys to each others places. We tell each other everything. We’re not just siblings; we’re friends. It’s always been that way with Keira and me. I’m the big brother, the defender. She’s always been there for me in a more emotional capacity. When I'm down, when I get dumped on, or whenever life in general is going shitty for me, my baby sister is there to lean on, always with her gentle encouragement and kind words. She has such a talent for knowing the right thing to say.  It’s why she pursued psychology. She just *gets* people. There have been times I’m not sure what would have happened to me if Keira hadn’t been there to guide me through the darkness.


You may be thinking this is a creepy relationship, but I’m telling you it’s nothing like that. We’re just close. She’s my little sis. I love her. And I’m sharing her story because I don’t know what else to do now.


Let me tell you some more about Keira. She’s pretty. Dark hair, dark eyes, a smile that lights up the room. She inherited our mother’s features and our dad’s kind nature.  Naturally, she’s had guys crawling all over her since she was about 15. But Keira was always cautious. She was always very careful about the guys she dated, and I can count on one hand the serious relationships she’s had in all her 25 years. She always wanted something real. 


In January, Keira embarked on her last semester of grad school. She was well on her way to becoming a therapist. She had a good job and an even better internship lined up. Her grades were stellar. She had a close knit circle of friends, and a sweetie of a dog named Denver. Seemed like she was doing pretty well in this life. Intelligent, ambitious, kind. I was never prouder of her.


And then he came along.


Now, of course my job as a big is to look at all of my little sister’s suitors with a suspicious eye. My philosophy was to assume every one of them was an asshole until he proved otherwise. Luckily, all of her boyfriends had been acceptable. Her relationships ended on good terms. She was always so logical about the end of her relationships, and was back to her old self within a few weeks, taking the whole thing as a learning experience. Always the optimist.


But dammit, he *had* to come along.


I’m ashamed to say it. But the new guy, I liked him from the start. It was hard not to. He treated her like a queen. He reminded me a lot of her. Intelligent, ambitious, kind. That’s probably what drew them to each other. They met at a New Year’s Eve party and three weeks later they were inseparable. His name was Robin. Robin and Keira. They were the model of what an ideal relationship ought to be. They never fought. It was like they complemented each other perfectly.


I was happy for her, I really was. Even though it meant spending less time with her. I’d never seen her so alive and full of happiness.


But nothing’s perfect.


In March, Keira revealed to me a few things about Robin that bugged me. Not even consciously, but beneath the surface, what she told me had set off a feeling of unease I could neither put a finger on nor shake.


Robin was ex-army, which wasn't a big deal. But what I didn’t know was that he was suffering from PTSD, and didn’t seem to think he needed to get help for it. Keira wasn’t concerned by it. She promised me the biggest symptom he had was nightmares. And she told me that he had confessed his symptoms had lessened since becoming involved with her. It bothered me. I began to worry he might be using her to lean on; or that Keira with her background in psychology saw him as some sort of rescue project. But I trusted her judgement. And she was so incredibly happy with him. So I kept my mouth shut. Now I wish I hadn’t.


I won’t waste time with the details of their breakup; that will come later. What I can tell you is that one night in April, my baby sister showed up at my door absolutely beside herself. She went back and forth between jabbering at a million miles an hour and sobbing her pretty brown eyes out. And she kept repeating the same thing; “He was a different person...it was like he was a different person.”


I’ve never seen Keira so utterly morose in my life. She was downright depressed. Her sleeping schedule completely reversed so she was staying up all night and going to sleep at daybreak, only when she became too exhausted to stay awake. She quit her job because of this. She moved in with me because she could barely take care of herself. Her grades plummeted to the point she almost didn’t pass some of her classes. My sister was heartbroken, and it tore my own heart out to see her that way.



Fast forward to about a month ago. Keira’s depression had reached a point to where I was worried about her. Like genuinely worried I might come home to her body in the bathtub or something awful like that. I convinced her to see a therapist. She was ashamed for being so beaten down. Ashamed that someone else had weakened her so badly. But she went.


When she came back from her first session, it was not with the slightly more chipper attitude I had hoped for, but with a prescription bottle. At this point I was alarmed. The following conversation went something like this:


“Drugs? Seriously?”

She shrugged almost guiltily and I felt bad for sounding judgmental. Truth was, I was pretty amazed that this jerk had messed her up so bad that she needed to be medicated to resemble something of her normal self.  

“Yeah. It’s to help me sleep” she told me.

I thought about her strange sleeping habits of late and nodded.

“I guess I didn’t realize it was so serious” I said apologetically.

She shrugged again and sat at the table, staring downwards.  

“It’s just the dreams” she said quietly.

“Dreams?” I asked.

She sighed heavily and nodded.

“I dream about him every night. *Every* goddam night, B! And it’s always such nice dreams. We’re together and everything is alright. It’s like nothing bad ever happened. When I wake up and realize it was a dream...I just can’t handle it anymore. It hurts too much.”

Her voice had begun to quaver and I watched tears splash onto the table top. I walked over and squeezed her shoulder. No wonder she was struggling to move on.  

“It’ll be ok. You’ll get some decent sleep and you’ll be feeling better before you know it” I told her.

She nodded. “I hope so, B.  I just can’t go on seeing his face in my dreams and waking up to an empty bed. It’s cruel.”

“The mind can be a cruel place” I told her.



She took the pills that night, and every night for a week. And like a miraculous transformation, I saw my sister coming back to me. She took all the crap she associated with Robin and finally boxed it away. She got back to running with Denver.  She stopped moping. It seemed like all she needed was a gentle push in the right direction and she was able to take back the helm of her life.

After two weeks on the pills, her therapist said she could start to wean herself off of them. So she did. All was well until yesterday.

I came home from work to a dim apartment. Something was off when I entered. Terribly off. There were no lights on. No dishes in the sink. The place had a foreboding air to it, an uneasily quiet, empty feeling. I was about to decide that Keira had gone out for a long day of errands when Denver caught my attention. He was sitting on the kitchen floor next to a puddle of his own pee. He looked distressed, and paced to Keira’s bedroom door.

I followed him with fear in my heart. Was she dead? Had she cracked and taken her own life?  Was her evident recovery all a ruse to pacify me? My heart hammered harder with every step.  The door was ajar. I called out to Keira - no answer. Now I felt sick to my stomach. I made myself open the door to the bedroom, thinking awful things like how I would explain it all to our mother…
She was there in the bed. She at least looked very much alive. The first thing I did was look at the blanket pulled over her chest for signs of breathing. I could see movement! She was alive! Relief washed over me.
“Keira!” I said loudly, hoping to startle her awake and give her a good scare in return for the one she’d given me.
She sighed and rolled onto her side, facing away from me. She was normally such a light sleeper.  This was odd.
“Keiraaaaa” I called.
Nothing. Was she faking?  She had to be.
“KEIRA!” I bellowed, certain I’d catch her laughing, giving away her attempt at a prank.  And a bad attempt at that. Then I remembered she’d neglected to take Denver out to the point he’d pissed on the floor. With a jolt, I realized she would never intentionally do that to her beloved dog . This wasn’t a prank.
She breathed deeply. I walked to her  Concern began to rise in my stomach again. She was asleep. Fast asleep. I shook her gently. Nothing. I shook her more vigorously. I took hold of her shoulder and pulled her onto her back so I could see her face.
“KEIRA” I said sharply.
I was met with nothing but her pretty face, sleeping peacefully, with an almost serene, smiling expression about her.

Now I was good and worried again. Had she taken something?  Or been drinking?  But there were no empty pill or booze bottles in sight. She was simply asleep.
The next few hours were something of a blur. I called both her therapist and our parents, but I can’t remember who first. I got the voicemail for the therapist and hung up so I could call our mom. She came right over and after several failed attempts to rouse my sister, the decision was made to take her to the hospital.

And there, it got even weirder. After running every test imaginable on her, not a single doctor could tell us why Keira won’t wake up. She’s not comatose. She has brain activity - lots of it. She’s just asleep. And what’s more, is that they couldn’t, still can’t tell us why she won’t wake. We’ve tried everything - shaking her, pouring ice cold water onto her, making loud sounds. But she’s still asleep. She’s a mystery. The doctors are saying they’ve never seen this before. There’s some specialist flying in from Montreal as we speak. He’s our next best hope. 

I’m at the end of my tether here. I’m back at my apartment, back in Keira’s bedroom. I came back to search for clues; anything to indicate why my sister is in some sort of enchanted sleep from which she cannot wake. I’m scared for her. There’s something really fucked up going on here. I can’t explain it. But I can feel it. I haven’t solved the mystery of my sister’s inexplicable slumber, but I have uncovered some pretty alarming things.
First of all, there’s a note under Keira’s bed that I missed when I was in her room earlier. The handwriting is disjointed and sloppy but still distinctly hers. I interpreted it as best I could:
*He is mine and I am his. The illusion is mine. He exists. The other one is dead. I have to go back to the illusion. The illusion is real. I have to stay. I have to st*

And there it trails off into nonsensical lines, as though Keira fell asleep writing the note.
There’s something else. The pill bottle on her nightstand, the stuff she had been taking to help her sleep.  It’s not some sleep aid like I thought it would be. The label says *Cypripedium reginae*.
It sounds like some kind of plant. What the hell did my sister get prescribed? And how does it tie into her condition? Because it *has* to. People don’t just go to sleep and stay that way.
I’m taking this bottle back to the hospital and getting some answers. Maybe if they can figure out why she’s asleep, they can wake my sister up. And this pill she was taking is the key, I know it.  
I’m on my way out now. And I’m going to call Robin. I have a nasty feeling he might somehow have something to do with this.

What I have done there so far are Active Directory, accessing remote computers, imaging, setting up meeting conferences, A/V stuff (they have lots of tv screens), and assisting with tickets.   
  
  I have lots of downtime unfortunately (I always ask if there are any work for me) so I've just been reading some of their IT documentations (how their network are structured, etc). 
    
  I don't think I will have the opportunity to move up to a full position in this place as they have a very tight budget and are leaning more toward hiring another intern who's been there for almost a year, I have no direction to where I'm going after this (I have only taken 1 intro IT class in college, will take 6 and transfer to 4 year university after I.T associates in 1 semester).

39t273,5,2015-06-14,PhD vs work?,nctr,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/39t273/phd_vs_work/,"I'm soon going to finish my masters degree in statistics. I also have more than 2 years experience as a software engineer from doing freelenacing work during my studies part time during the semester and full time during semester break. I also have a internship as a data scientist as well as a published paper from a student research job.

So things are looking pretty good, I am currently applying to both PhD and work positions.

There are mainly three possibilties:

PhD at university 

- if computer science then good money, less than in indutry but not that much
- may be too theoretical
- takes up to five years

industry PhD 
 
- less money
- really interesting job description, at least on of them, for the other I still have the interview 
- not assured that I can actually finnish my PhD in the three years, then the contract runs out, still high probability to then work for the company (BMW or siemens) in a PhD position

Industry:

- most money
- two jobs I appplied to also seemed very interesting and exactly what I want to do (data science)
- maybe harder for career later when I have no PhD?

So my question is, how important is the PhD in your experience for a career in data science? What would you chose if you could between those three kind of job offers?"

I'm building a survey application for my internship. The survey contains slides, each with different input fields and such, and the end product will probably have over 30 slides. I've written a substantial amount of code already and the issue I'm running into is that I've been hand coding the slides in HTML, but that's going to get really, really messy when I start going over 10 slides. Not to mention if I make any change to the structure of my slides, I have to change all 30 of them by hand and that's not productive.

My solution: Somehow model all the slide data in the backend and dynamically add slide elements to the webpage. 

My question is on implementation. I've looked at angularjs and emberjs and I'm not sure if I want to put in all the work to revamp my web app to use these frameworks when I really only need to inject the modeled data into the DOM. I could easily do this with jQuery. Maybe these frameworks will help me more than I realize?

I have an important decision to make. I was accepted to the Online Master in Computer Science at Georgia Tech and I also was accepted to the Online Master in Software Engineering at Penn State.  Money is not an issue, ...I was wondering what program would be better in the term of ROI, recognition and would have a better impact in my career. 

Pros Ga Tech
Cheap 7k. Money is not an issue but things might change.  University has better reputation in technology field and is more concentrated in theory.

Cons
3 years to finish the master. No project option, just courses.  Its a new program so they might have a lot of things to figure out. They quit the subspecialization in Software Engineering and Databases.

Pros Penn State
I love the courses because are more centralized in software development process, project management etc etc.  It only takes 2 years to finish the program.  The master has the requirement to complete a project. 

Cons
I love theory but since this programs is more specialized in SE I think would be better to perform my job. What I'm really worried is that expensive 36K for the whole program and so far money is not an issue but I always liked to err in the side of less debt.  In the other hand, someone from GaTech might have a better starting salary than me just because of the name of the university.

Future plans:
I want to earn an MBA after my masters, I want to become a Chief Information Officer.

My background:

Some background information on myself:

- Attend a well-respected top-20 accounting program state school, headed back for an MSA in the fall. 
- Very solid and attractive extracurriculars, but nothing overly related to MC
- 3.5 GPA
- Previously interned in b4 risk group, currently interning in another b4 audit

After doing some soul-searching and research, I believe that MC is really where I would like to be. I feel as though the B4 MC groups may be a good fit for me based on my background, but I'm wondering if it's too late in the game for me to try to move that direction since I missed the opportunity to intern there. Furthermore, if I receive an offer from my current B4 audit internship, will that help me at all in trying to obtain a full time position in one of these b4 mc groups? I know these groups are fairly separate entities from a legal standpoint, but I wasn't sure what degree of interconnectedness they have from a recruiting standpoint. 

Any advice on if making this transition is reasonably possible and if so, how I should go about it besides networking, would be very appreciated. Thanks!"
39u1zc,3,2015-06-14,Question about what career path to take after CS degree? Is web dev oversaturated or going to be?,programminghelp9,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39u1zc/question_about_what_career_path_to_take_after_cs/,"So, I currently already have a degree and work full time in finance as a licensed rep.  However, I have no interest in staying on the phones or working this job anymore.  I am working towards a undergrad degree in Computer Science outside work.  Basically, since I already have my ""fluff"" classes done with my other degrees, I really only have to take 15 classes to complete my degree.

By the end of the year, I should have 5 classes completed.  Starting in 2016, I plan on leaving my current job and doing 3 classes a quarter (except during the summer, because I hope to have an internship then).  Obviously, one of the quarters will have 4 classes though.

With all that said, what would be the best career for me to focus on that could lead to a good initial position to start out in the tech world?  

I realize that there are a lot of possibilities with this, but I really want to get started on the right foot and focus on something for the next year that could realistically lead to an internship and a career next year.  

Someone has recommended to me either focusing on mobile dev or web dev.  I feel like going web dev, but I am slightly concerned on that.  With all the bootcamps (and all the people going for that field), would that be a bad idea?

I just feel like I want to start focusing on side projects on my own for now so that I can land a good internship next summer.  To do that, though, I obviously need to focus on a field that I want to go into.  

Does anyone have any thoughts on a good field to focus on and why?  Also, what are your thoughts on focusing on web dev?

Thanks for any information with this.

Now before you down vote this, let me explain. With a strong background in game design, (animation/rigging, modelling, texturing etc) is it possible to learn enough of c++ to ship a game? I know c++, or any programming language, is extremely deep and people spend their lives mastering, or trying to master the 'unmasterable.' I know it won't be easy, or simple, but I do have the drive to learn enough c++ to ship a simple a game. (My summer project). I'll have enough time, aside from working as an intern and writing a novel, to dedicate around 3-4 hours a day (for ~3 months). The alternative is that I use the UDK/cryengine and use the built in logic scripting (kismet/flow graph) to script simple logic, if my previous inquiry is dubbed impossible or unlikely by you guys. So what do you think? Is that enough time to become comfortable enough to write in c++ taking into consideration a game dev. Library?

Edit: I forgot to mention I have a fairly strong background in calculus/vectors, linear algebra etc, as well as a simple understanding of how programming works (Java 101) and then of course my background in design.

Edit2: I think there's a little bit of a misunderstanding, my fault of course, but I should've mentioned I don't expect to write an engine from the ground up. Just enough cpp knowledge to tinker with/modify one of those free-to-make game engines like unity/udk/cryengine.

Thanks!

39utxo,2,2015-06-14,"It is a catch 22 to be educated, but then lose your job, and trying to make new forms of income (legally), you apply for what society thinks is lower level jobs, and can't get them?",stephencrowe50,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/39utxo/it_is_a_catch_22_to_be_educated_but_then_lose/,"I think a new law of sorts needs to be established, that allows people who had higher level jobs of one sort or another, and then through let's just sum it up to bad luck due to a number of reasons, (either bad economy, the industry had a slow down, i.e. and was laid off) and thus lost that job, and now has to find new ways of making money to pay for living expenses be able to get what society deems as lower level jobs without having to fudge their resume.
This is the because I think I am facing this problem now. I use to be an archaeologist. I graduated in May 2002, and after finishing school from Suny New Paltz I went to Ireland to do a archaeological field school (aka dig) which is like an internship in most of other jobs, because most cultural resource management companies (the main companies in the U.S. that hire archaeologists to do pedestrian survey and field work); require all applicants now to have it under their belt before they can even try to be hired.
Anyway in 2006 after working for these companies for a few years. I got laid off from R.C. Goodwin and Associates, and about a month later I went to graduate school at Ball State University to get my masters.
Anyway long story short. Due to realities I was living with at the time, while I attended graduate school (though I considered this advance work in my field) I technically wasn't making any money. I could afford it for a little bit, because I had saved before, and though I was concerned about making no income, as I said I could afford it, and I justified it by telling myself, that I was finishing a advance degree and that when I finished I would get a better job in my old field to justify the time spent obtaining this extra piece of paper.
Anyway lo and behold, I don't graduate until 2012, due to unforeseen issues with finishing up the final graduation requirements. At this time I am already back home (meaning I had to move back in to old my old home in NYC), and I am in NYC. At this point I have applied to archaeological companies, even ones I worked for in the past, and I never got a response. I called some, but damn did they sound annoyed that I even called inquiring about the resume I sent to them, so I stopped this practice. Anyway I never heard back from any of them, except for one back in 2014, that was going to hire me, but due to the fact that I needed just a few days to get things in NYC settled, (due to the fact that I was working a part time gig job at this time) before I worked for them on another temp job (which was only going to be for about two months), this was too much time on their end to wait for me, so the job got rescinded.
Anyway, main point is so since officially graduating, I have just done part time gig work. It's ok as a job. I am not complaining about the job, but it is not a career, and it is one of these jobs that overtime, I feel they won't want to hire me anymore.
I can't really go back to school again, (since in this country) we charge students to learn a ton of money) before hiring any of them, and yet we live in a time where after paying that ton of money and time, your not guaranteed even a entry level job in the profession you chose to study.
Again I am now trying to move to a more steady job for the time being (as my gig job for a few months) has ended yet again in late April, (well though I worked two weeks ago on another). My main question is this, I have applied to what I deem more regular jobs in the last few weeks as well, but I haven't heard anything from any of them?
Is this because I listed my education, for a cashier job at petco and other similar jobs of this nature which society sees as low level? Even if I smudge it off, what do I say I was doing from 2006 to 2012, sitting on the computer eating bon bons lol. Yeah this was a joke, but I feel I am really in a bind that I can't legally get out of?
I have done other independent work since then too, and hopefully some of it will sell one day, but in the meantime I can't be guaranteed that it will ever make any money?
Furthermore, I have tried to learn new skills, such as java, python (two main programming jobs) since the hell I've been through since graduating from graduate school. Yet these endeavors are not overnight, and in this field things change fast enough, that I am wondering if I am just wasting my time, though I am about to learn HTML 5 too.
I say I wonder if I am wasting my time, because it seems that there was a unwritten law made in our society that the only people who are allowed to start out in a field are those that just turned 18?
Yet when I was 18, (wow that was such a different world) and it really wasn't a million years ago either), but I was as I stated here prepping for a different field so I was not focused on computers. Though sometimes I attack myself (being the gamer that I was) that I never considered that by switching majors to computer science that maybe I could get a job designing games.
I attribute that fault to what I call my generation or at least I had in our thinking which is called linear thinking. This basically just means that when I was starting out in college, it was during a time where so many people (were implied) that going to college for anything would lead to something better, and I think that whatever major you studied was going to lead to a specific job in that specific field for life, or then what was the point of going to college at all?
Anyway if anyone can suggest anything based off what I've said, I'm open and appreciative.
Thanks

So I'm going into my ""junior"" year at a University studying another field of Engineering. I've come to a realization that it is not the path I want to take and am going to make the switch to Computer Science with a focus in Software Engineering. Due to the change I have pretty much completed all the classes outside of CSC. So I will be taking a load of csc classes a semester which probably isn't very recommended.

1) I know this is probably on here more than once daily, but what would be the best in-debth guides that will put me ahead? I'm open to trying to learn all the languages and would really like to start working on my own projects before school actually starts back up.

2)Also, as I will be graduating in 2-2.5 years. At some point I will need an Internship or other ways of earning experience. Outside of internships what would be the best way of earning experience that I can put down on a resume? Would personal projects count as experience? 

3) I have three concentrations to choose from? What will I be learning differently in each of these? What jobs would I be able to go into with each of these concentrations?

- Software Engineering
- Computer Science and Second Discipline
- Disturbed Systems and Networking


Sorry for asking, I've just been researching it for the past week and no guides that I have looked at have really caught my eye.

I should mention 3 things:

1)  I'm a bit older than the average graduating PhD (29 vs. 27-28) because 

2)  Took some time to build a startup that did not work out, hence total PhD time was 7 years.

3)  Did two industrial internships while in grad school which I think a significant plus.

My last job was an internship in Washington, DC where I wrote policy and covered Congress for a national level non-profit organization. It was a great experience, but unfortunately I'm Canadian and hiring staff here don't seem to care that I met a Kennedy and sat in Senate committee sessions. 

Fast forward a few months and there is an election here in Alberta, and I end up volunteering for the party I like , who end up winning in a landslide. Suddenly my career options look better than they have in years. But, its been over a month since the election and all I've gotten for a response has been a text from a former staffer giving me an email of a guy to apply to. I've applied to work there a lot and its the same guy I've gotten zero response from in the past. 

Needless to say, I'm not too optimistic about finding a job there, but it still early I think. i keep reading in the news about how the new gov. has brought in people from outside the country and things aren't really in full swing yet. But I would really love to work for these guys and it seems like they're just not willing to give me a shot.  So I guess my question is do I wait it out? Or is it worth it to look elsewhere?

39yuja,0,2015-06-15,Should I move back home and enjoy college or stay where I am for career experience? [21][M],advicethrowaway4321,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/39yuja/should_i_move_back_home_and_enjoy_college_or_stay/,"Hi guys,

I apologize if this is kind of lengthy but I need some objective advice.

I am currently going to college about 3 hours away from where my parents live, and I'm going into my third year (junior year). I have in my time here made some great friends, and intern at a very selective organization that after 4 - 5 years of college, would be phenomenal on my resume. I have great grades (mostly As, 1- 2 b+) and am about to be promoted within my internship.

The problem is that I work every waking minute of my college life. I work 30ish hours a week, volunteer a further 10 - 12 (mandatory for the internship), and even then I'm not really able to cover all of my expenses. I can't afford a car, and can barely support myself. I haven't had any time or money to even think about a college girlfriend, and it's likely to stay that way until I graduate if my schedule doesn't get any lighter. Currently I've noticed my sleep schedule has been ruined, bad eating habits and usually tired which makes keeping up with my gym routines somewhat difficult.

My parents have been pressuring me to come home and finish school there. There is a university within the same school system that I can transfer to (it will delay me graduating about 6 months), but I could live at home and would be able to afford a car, could start to have proper relationships and enjoy my college life. My only concern is that I would be missing out on valuable experience from my internship/job that would greatly help me get a job post college.

So if you guys were in situation, what would you do? Have you been in a position like this before? If so, what helped you decide?

**tl;dr: overwhelmed in current position but set up for great career in several years; or move home and enjoy college/life.**

Thank you for any advice you guys have!"

After not to much trouble, I came upon the program called BrowserHistoryView which saves history from Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Safari.

  When testing it on my terminal and one of the users computers it worked, even exporting it to a CSV file and differentiating what history was viewed by the different users that used the computer.  However after trying it on about 10 other computers, all others gave me a blank history with the exception of one computer.  My first thought was that those users were using some form of a browsers incognito mode or actually deleting the browser history.  But after watching users leave the computer and confirming that they did not delete the history or use an incognito mode and still getting an empty browser history, I’m a bit perplexed.  Any ideas as to why it worked on my computer and two others, but not the rest of the computers I tried?

39z16g,7,2015-06-15,Do I have enough leverage to re-negotiate my salary after 3 months?,ropapsciss,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/39z16g/do_i_have_enough_leverage_to_renegotiate_my/,"So basically I got offered a job about 2 months ago, and accepted a low offer because I had no basis to negotiate at the time. It was 38k, which is a bit low for my position which is essentially a project manager/account manager for a marketing firm. I want to re-negotiate my salary after probation, and specifically want to call it that instead of a raise because that's really what it is. What I want is 45k, which seems a bit high considering my current pay but here are my reasons for why I think I can pull it off:

**Circumstances in my favor (I will not bring these up during negotiations):**

- Me and my manager are the only people who work with our current client, who happens to be our company's biggest client. The company needs me at this point and I would not be easy to replace very quickly.

- Some of the other new hires already get around 40k from what I know
- Someone who was newer than me and relatively bad at their job quit the other day, and the company made their best efforts to still not lose them.

- I know for a fact I handle more projects/earn the company more money than most people in the company, let alone just the new people

**Things I can actively say for myself during negotiations:**

- Always go above and beyond, i.e. staying late, coming early, working from home, etc. This is due to the nature of our client where I have to work extended hours, and the company has had trouble in the past with people who are willing to do this.

- My client relations are well established and heading in a very solid direction. I know the way our company works, the client's company works, and how to make them compatible. 
- Excellent employee relations. I have to work with different departments for our projects, and everything has gone smoothly.

- I can see a future with this company, and the company thrives on long-term project managers who are familiar with the clients, rather than just people using it as a stepping stone
- I got an exceptional review for the first half of my 3 months

**General Facts I will bring up:**

- Industry average for this position is 45k+

- I made more in my previous internship

- I moved to the city for this job (shows commitment) 


I know this much of a jump, especially in 3 months, sounds pretty unreasonable. But I feel like it's not only justified, but flat out unfair if I don't at least get countered with 43 or something. 

Let me know how I should approach this, certain things to be aware of/I should do/ I should avoid. I just want to make it clear that the ball is in my court... It really just comes down to how I play it.

39z5m2,3,2015-06-15,My student job is boring. Should I keep it or not?,Ate_a_muffin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/39z5m2/my_student_job_is_boring_should_i_keep_it_or_not/,"Hey CS Career Questions,

I'm a nontraditional student. I'm American, moved to Europe to join a spouse, and started a computational master's degree because I initally couldn't find work. I'm a competent programmer - I know I can keep up with my good classmates, and I place top third in my computational classes. 

I started a student job with a start up in my current town (minor European capitol, and I'm not here by choice). This was two months ago. I've been doing a fairly dull task for them, one that no one else wanted to do and needed to get done. I did good documentation, got praise for my work, got along with a micromanaging supervisor and my other colleagues. 

I'm going away for the summer, but asked them what I could expect in the fall. They told me I could expect work in my competencies - they consider this to be biology, however, and not programming. I can't seem to convince them otherwise. I'm interested in being a better programmer, and I took this job (which pays considerable less than my other gig) so that I could learn. Instead, I wound up on a project that required all of 9 linux command lines.

I'm not against shit work; everyone has to pay their dues. But I'm afraid they're never going to give me anything more challenging. I tried asking my boss a bit about it today, but since I'm gone for the summer, it was hard to get a definite answer. 

I'm trying to figure out the best thing to do in this situation - should I push harder for more challenging tasks? Move on and leave this off my resume? Keep working at a lousy job for a reasonable amount of time so I can put it on my resume?

My concerns are that

* Small community: There are only so many people in my field, particularly in this part of the world. I don't want to burn any bridges

* Reputation in the US: At the same time, I don't plan on staying here forever, and I'd like to keep my resume in good shape for the US. Coming here has been a terrible, terrible career move, but I'd like to make the best of it. 

* Scattered background: Aside from a few years in research science, my resume is a bunch of scattered (if pretty interesting) internships. I'm worried that it looks like I'm job hopping (I'm country-hopping, and the job-hopping is incidental). 

* Cultural norms: Here, it's pretty typical to see people work at one company for a ten-year stretch. My longest job has been four, but I'm late-twenties, so maybe that's not completely unreasonable. 

* Maternity leave: Okay, maybe this one isn't typical for this subreddit, but I'd like to have a kid in the next year or so, and Europe is much better for this than the US. Is it worth putting up with a dull job so that I can have more time with my future offspring (who, honestly, I'm not even sure I'll like all that much)?

A few other things - my soft skills are good, and I'm a decent networker, but I've had an extraordinarily hard time adjusting to Europe. Scratch that, my soft skills used to be good, but just don't seem to work in Europe. I lived in the US and Asia before, and always had a great time, but for some reason, I really don't like it here. I've also done a lot of other things in the past, which don't point straight to developer, but suit a small company nicely.

Thanks in advance for your feedback. "
39z6hy,10,2015-06-15,Concerned About My Probationary Period,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/39z6hy/concerned_about_my_probationary_period/,"I'm almost done with the first month of my 90-day probationary period of my first full-time job as a graphic designer out of college, but certain things regarding it are really starting to worry me.

The first thing that concerned me is that the probationary period is called an ""internship"" technically and we are called ""interns"" during that time period. I found out later this is normal for employees kept on board, but other things don't sit right with me either.

The biggest red flag I noticed is that I'm replacing another design intern who was also just out of college who was not extended. It's possible management felt she wasn't the right fit, but from talking to some coworkers, she completed her tasks on time and was under the impression up until she was told to leave that she would be extended. I've heard of companies rotating probationary people like this to avoid giving full salary and benefits, so that's what I'm afraid of is going on.

The person I report directly to though, has talked with me in long-term scenarios. Saying things about the future of the company and possible scenarios that involve me that are much further down the road than 90 days. This was comforting, but I haven't talked much to the head of the department, however as he and the president of the company are both on vacation for a while.

All I know to do is play it extra safe and get a lot of feedback about my work. I've scheduled a review with my direct supervisor to find out how I can be the ideal employee. But would it be a good idea to ask about this as well? Or even about the former intern I'm replacing? Perhaps I could contact the former intern myself and ask what happened? It was just a huge process to uproot for this job, and I'd hate to be going home in two months."

39zwx3,9,2015-06-15,Back at same company for Internship,RotaryRotation,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/39zwx3/back_at_same_company_for_internship/,"Hi All! 

I frequently lurk around here and love the advice a lot of people have to offer here. I don't post on Reddit, but I have something pressing and decided to create an account and get some feedback from the community: 

I currently am a rising Junior pre-engineer at the University of Washington (I will apply as a Mechanical Engineer next academic year). I also want to mention in the past worked at Tech companies (Amazon, Concur) while in High School. Now, I want to bring up my situation at school, my university (UW) follows a quarter system, and my very first year, I only completed literally a whooping 5 credits. I dropped my last two quarters and completed Hardship Withdrawals in some of my classes my very first quarter primarily because of family situations going back home. My family lives just 20 miles east of the University, so I found myself distracted to the problems. Though, I was fortunate enough to land an internship as a Software Engineer at what was a startup with ~200 people. The pay was $20/hour, which was seriously the most I have ever made in my life (hell, my parents even admit that they never made that much in their lives). 

I enjoyed my time at the company, and when the school year came around, I was offered an actual full-time position as a developer. I instead opted to work ~20 - 30 hours at the company and committed to school (I am a first generation college student, and I want to be the first in my family to grab that degree!), but my situation back home still existed. I ended up dropping classes again my first two quarters. My situation back home is entirely financial related, I was helping my parents pay off our bills, monthly rent and so on, so it was tough for me to digest all that few months ago.

When Spring Quarter cam rolling around, I seriously formed a fist with my hands and kind of punched myself (it hurt so bad that I actually had a nice bruise on my cheek for two weeks). It was out of sudden anger that I wasn't succeeding in school, and I am still in square one while I should be moving onto bigger and greater things already. I signed up for full-time amount of credits again, and I am proud to say, I managed to 4.0 every single class. I had an insane amount of motivation this time around, and I figured out a way to keep my tensions with my family back home, and instead focus on my classes, and just being at a great university. (not trying to show off, this is probably my first time I have been this excited in two years!) 

Well, rolling onto this summer, that same company I was already working at wanted me around, so I decided to commit for a full-time position this summer. I will be an Intern, working with the same team, though, the role is still Software Engineer oriented, just as before. The company itself raised a super nice seed funding just two months ago and has jumped to 370+ employees, so it is definitely an exciting time to be at the company, but my problem is, I am a Mechanical Engineering major. I chose the major because of all the career shadowing I did, and the insane amounts of research I did my off time that made me intrigued with the powers of an Mechanical Engineeringl Major. 

I am obviously happy about working at this company, but I have a bigger passion and interest. It is already way too late in the internship application game for this summer, but should I just stick it out this summer at this company, and grow more of my programming skills here? This internship is extremely out of my pursuing major, so I'd love to hear thoughts on this, whether I should just drop it, but in the case you recommend that I should drop it, what should I do with my summer? I'd have over 3 months of free time. 

Another thing that kind of got me was the pay, now I know an internship is all about the experience, but I don't come from a family that lives in a nice home and we have the luxury to buy things at our heart desire, I have slept in a 1 bedroom apartment for my entire life along with my parents and brother. I have some friends going off to big tech companies who are easily making $6,000 - $8,000 monthly at their internships, and it kind of makes me rethink my situation. While I acknowledge this company is growing, would it be smart to possibly ask for a higher raise, as I have been around for over a full year? Or should I accept what I am being paid? If I currently am being paid $25 an hour, would asking for $30 an hour hurt? I apologize if this just sounds purely arrogant to some people, I just want to define my worth and stand by it! 

I am already looking ahead for internships next year, and want to definitely do something in the Mechanical Engineering realm. I know a lot of people mention that Computer Science related internships make most of the internship money, but how much would an Mechanical Engineering internship make? Another question is, especially for big companies, do they cover housing if it required to leave the current city I am in for the summer?

If I were to stick around with this company, what else can I do to make myself extremely appealing to companies looking for Mechanical Engineering interns? In the Software Engineering world, we can always just develop side projects, push them to GitHub and showcase them, but what is an appropriate way to do this as an Mechanical Engineer? I want to make myself as appealing as possible to companies when it comes time to applying for internships again.

And lastly, with my situation mentioned, I am planing to graduate a couple of quarters late (technically be shy of a full 5 years at college), I am sort of leaning on possibly doing a Co-Op Spring Quarter of next year, just to build my my resume. Any thoughts on pursuing this? 

Once again, I appreciate all feedback, and apologize if my questions or tone seems out of norm, just wanted to get right down to the meat of my question :) "
39zzjo,33,2015-06-15,What jobs are available to Computer Science majors?,programminghelp9,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/39zzjo/what_jobs_are_available_to_computer_science_majors/,"So, I am currently getting a post bachelors degree (basically a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, without having to retake the ""fluff"" classes again for a undergrad degree).  I'm doing very well in my courses so far and really enjoy what I'm learning.  

However, I am to finish this program by the end of 2016.  My aim is to get an internship during the summer of 2016.

There are two things I'm trying to decide.  One, what I should be focusing on now to get a good internship/career next year.  Second, what options do I have really and what fields would be good to focus on for someone just starting out in things.

**FIRST QUESTION:**
Is there a website or something out there that gives a list of career options that a recent grad can get into realistically AND have good job prospects for the future?  This is a big thing for me right now.  I want to start focusing on side projects I enjoy AND set me up for success in getting into a field I want to get into.  All I ever hear is stuff like, ""go work out google"".  Well, google is a big company and does A LOT of stuff.  What fields can one get into with a bachelors degree for an internship or 1-2 years after graduating?  

**Second Question:**
What fields are showing the most promise for the future?  I know someone has told me to choose between web dev, mobile dev, and software dev.  Are those the big options for now?  I was considering doing web dev, but honestly get the feeling its going to be oversaturated soon with all the bootcamps and other things.  mobile dev seems interesting, but not sure that is a right decision either.  I know people say do what you enjoy, but financial factors matter too.

**Third Question:**
After answering the above, what do you feel someone should be focusing on for the next year to set themselves up for success at getting a good internship?  If you say side projects, WHAT KIND?  If you say, just study, please say what?  I would just really like to know specifics.  

**Summary:**
Basically, I really enjoy what I have learned so far.  But, I feel its time for me to focus on things outside my class and start setting myself up for a successful internship and career.  I have a year to do this.  What fields can I get into, what side projects should I be doing, and what fields would be best for the future?  

I really would appreciate some help here.  I'm someone who enjoys this stuff but feel I need a little more guidance.

**EDIT:**  Before anyone says, I have asked in the past in /r/cscareeradvice on this and didn't get much responses at all (I deleted it a while back).  I'm just trying here instead too see if I can get a bit more responses.  While I think cscareeradvice is a great sub, I feel like it could be a bit more active at times.

3a01mx,3,2015-06-16,"I made a mistake, and I'm not sure whether it's a good idea to act on it.",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3a01mx/i_made_a_mistake_and_im_not_sure_whether_its_a/,"Hello! 

I'm a recent graduate with a bachelor's in computer science. I walked in May and am just finishing up a hands on course this summer. 

Last year, I had an internship with a company. I liked it, they liked me, I took a full time position. 

In the fall, I had a classmate who was looking for internships. I knew him fairly well and had worked with him on several projects. As such, I told a representative at an event on campus from my company that he might be a reasonable candidate. 

They interviewed and hired him for a part time internship starting later this summer. 

Fast forward to now; I'm working with this individual for a hands on course required by the University to finish my degree. It's done this week, so I'm finished with school for real now. 

Working with him for this course, I'm realizing that perhaps recommending him was a poor choice. Lately he has shown terrible attention to detail, a desire to finish everything very quickly without any foresight for maintainable code in the future, as well as awful communication skills. In addition he has become very poor at handling frustration, refusing to work an entire afternoon because of a conflict in the office. 

I now think that he would be a bad choice for our company. The question is... Do I attempt to tell my company this? I think that it has the potential to tarnish my reputation. However, I'm afraid that might sound immature and as if I'm going back on my word, but on the other hand, the person I told to look at his resume is not a recruiter, and I'm not sure if he ever mentioned it to my boss. Perhaps he simply put his resume in the good pile. 

Additionally, the fact that they interviewed him and made the final call makes me feel comfortable with staying quiet. 

Any thoughts? Should I do nothing? Should I tell HR or my boss? Perhaps be honest with my boss, and just be careful to evaluate him in his internship, as an internship is fairly low risk for the company?

Thanks!"

Pay is about the same, roughly 50k NZD. My web experience is mostly backend with node.js, broad knowledge of frontend/backend technologies, best practices, previously solo AS3 AIR dev/designer for corporate internal e-learning software on PC/Android.


**Role 1 - Fullstack solo developer, Details:**
The first is for a small company which seems to mostly do small marketing websites(enter the draw with your code, guess a number/sequence, static info) and recently a mobile app via Cordova with Parse. The position offers 50k NZD and was one of the few roles that listed no experience necessary(it's difficult to find intern roles here unless you're a student or have good connections, junior roles usually want quite a bit and keep rejecting me for lack of experience). I'd be replacing a guy who's been there 2 years and is going on an OE, he doesn't know if he'll return to the company after. He did light graphic design work, mostly basic image manipulation/creation from the looks of it(they have a graphic designer), basic print work and he manages all the code for websites along with some tech support. The position is presently an 60-90 minutes commute(2-3 buses, a train and a bit of walking), I'd likely need to relocate, due to a condition I have driving is risky. 

**Interview:**
During the interview, I was sat down with the guy and just left to talk with him about the role and what I've done along with some questions. I asked quite a few, he used Ruby on Rails in the past, and has since moved to PHP for the backend work, he doesn't use any frameworks, no source control, or any tooling really. MySQL is the database along with phpMyAdmin for management. I glanced over the js,html,css code he's done and it's mostly pure bar jquery and some plugins, no frameworks or preprocessors used. He justifies it as preferring to keep things simple and that the lack of a VCS/tooling as not having much point as a solo dev working on small projects like he does. He wasn't aware of the term QA, though had practiced TDD with ruby once and found it tedious.

**After Interview:**
I felt the interview went well, I was told my previous experience/cv along with being completely self taught boded well compared to fresh graduates from small courses/university. I've been given a test to replicate the functionality of one of the recent marketing sites(3 sections of form inputs) that use php/mysql in the backend which I have no experience with and that concerned him. It doesn't sound difficult, I could setup a LAMP/WAMP stack, follow a tutorial or two online for the php/mysql and be done easily, I don't feel it was an appropriate test.

**Thoughts:**
My concerns with the role is, while the projects might be small/repetitive with low to no maintenance required, it's a solo role which requires much more responsibility and risk. Due to the varied nature of the role and perhaps short deadlines, I'm not sure how much growth I'll get, while I'd have plenty of choice on how to approach a project it might be too much. I'm very much into tooling(Vagrant, Gulp, Sass, etc) / VCS(git) / DevOps(ansible/security/automation) / workflow(gitflow, stash/jira, CI/CD) some of which I'm still picking up or expanding on. Short deadlines might impact on how much of that I can utilize, along with a negative to the company for onboarding someone new to replace me(far more expensive than a dev with skills for the current role). While the company experience/reference is useful, along with portfolio I'm not sure if it's a good investment of my time in regards to furthering my career with future job applications.

**Role 2 - Enterprise C# SaaS Graduate intake, Details:**
The 2nd role is for a global company which has an office in my area, they specialize in developing lawyer software with C#. I'm not a huge fan of C# atm, it's a solid looking language and probably useful to know, though the type of work/community is less appealing to me. The software doesn't sound like it'd be all that exciting and I'd likely be doing maintenance on legacy code as it's enterprise grade. The position is intended for graduates, despite not having a CompSci degree(requirement), HR is considering my application, I've completed some tests with an interview scheduled later(it's not an offer yet, though I'm confident I stand a good chance as I've proved as capable if not more with CompSci grads in past work experiences). 

**Thoughts:**
The position offers a proven 6 month development plan that includes lots of training, guidance and support, with benefits mentioned such as ""Life Insurance, Income Protection, certification and tuition reimbursement, Financial Advisor, and a Bonus Pool(whatever that is?)"" Supposedly the pay would go up after that 6 months, though I'm not too concerned about pay, more in a mutual investment. This role would provide me with a community of developers to work with, co-workers to discuss/learn with along with mentors, I find this quite valuable. C# is in heavy demand where I am, though I am more passionate about node.js and web technologies/dev. I'll obviously have less input/choice on projects and have a more focused role with less risk/stress. Work aside, I see this role providing more growth opportunity along with gaining Agile/workflow/collaboration experiences that are less likely in the first role. The references would be more valuable, career prospects better, at a later date I could likely transition towards a good web focused role with greater success.

**Personal Concern:**
Having previous experience with roles like the first one prior to the web industry, I've noticed I develop an unhealthy work ethic where I carry project work with me even in my spare time rather than working on my own personal projects. It becomes too representative of me I guess, despite doing the work unpaid I'd strive to ensure quality to the best of my ability and still conform to deadlines. With an enterprise/corporate environment along with plenty of coworkers, I think the likelihood of me doing 60-80 hours a week on a project are far less likely. So I'm kind of biased towards this role provided I get the offer, interested to hear other perspectives/experiences however."

I'm currently not in school at the moment and work in two retail jobs that I hate with a burning passion. I'd like to get out of retail and maybe get into an internship/intro. job like a pharm tech. (based on advice from a career counselor basically telling me that I have procrastinated for these past two years since my graduation) to get a feel for the actual career. I am currently applying to pharmacy technician jobs around my area but what if I get the job and discover that pharmacy isn't right for me?  Well, I have many choices for careers due to uncertainty on my end. I'm in a bit of a dilemma though since my mother (who is widowed and had a stroke about a week after my graduation..) has been persuading me to get into a program that won't take long  so I can get a stable job and help pay the bills, student loans, and an unfortunate amount of credit card debt that I have accrued (she has helped me pay off one of them herself). I feel that I owe her by finishing up a program as soon as possible and getting my life on a stable track but I do not want to jump into a program that I will not enjoy as a lifelong career. If I find a program I must be able to work part-time (20 hours at most) at the same time since I am paying for credit card debt and loans at the moment. My fields that I have narrowed down to that I think are suitable for an ISTJ (introvert) personality for me who likes to be kept alone for the most part, analyzing, classifying, looking at data and working in a not too stressful environment would be: Accounting, Pharmacy, Clinical Lab (Medical Technologist), Research Analyst (for maybe Finance and/or Health/Pharmacy), and Computer Programming. I would like to know which careers out of these are suitable for my conditions (must be able to work part time while going to school - preferably having an intro level job or internship for the career that I choose, must have availability of internships and intro level jobs in my area (Warren, MI), 4-5 year program at max, and fit my introverted personality needs). I would like to find internship/intro. jobs for each field and eventually try all of them out but if anyone can help me narrow down this list based on my personality, needs listed above (with working part time), and timeframe that would be greatly appreciated and would help me waste less time on this dilemma."

The growing of crowdfunding platforms in 2015 the industry is expect to raise at $34.4 billion valuation general and Social causes $3.06 billion. If we just look at the success of Kickstarter (&lt;1Billion valuation) and the projects that came out from it we can tend to trust that a nice future is coming.

Crowdfunding is easier and faster, find an interesting project and 5 min later your will be part of it. Rewards are also an interesting new way of engaging people, folks become contributors not only donators --&gt; Reciprocal factor

When you give money to social crowdfunding you are supporting a cause not a company or non profit organization.

The relation between social medias and crowdfunding matters,  almost 50% of people report their charity support thru social media and influence their friend/followers.

I'm actually 21 years old, and i'm completing my internship in a Japanese startup which created a platform for social projects to be crowdfunded. I did choose this work because I really trust a better future can be created thru social crowdfunding and being able to contribute to it is for me a pleasure.

3a15sg,14,2015-06-16,"Doing a double degree in Business Admin. and CS. I have a couple choices of specialization, which do I choose?",allmybeard,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3a15sg/doing_a_double_degree_in_business_admin_and_cs_i/,"Directly copied from the school website, these are the two CS specializations:

&gt;**Spec. in Computer Science** - This is the program that will give you the most concentrated background and deep knowledge of almost all areas of computer science

&gt;**Spec. in Information Systems** - This program provides a solid foundation in computing and information systems with a focus towards applications of computing in modern enterprises and organizations. This program was developed in consultation with the Business School, and is a perfect fit for the combined HBA program.

So, ultimately my goal is to work my way into a Project Management job as quickly as possible. 

While IS would be easier, it is less focused on coding, which could potentially hold me back at the start compared to the CS specialization. Also, with a more abstract knowledge of coding methods (from the CS spec.), I might be better able to manage a project by having that deeper theoretical knowledge of the project. Also, I'm quite good at math, so I'm not worried about the CS spec. in that regard.

On the other hand, IS is a more business-focused discipline, which might lend itself better to a PM kind of role. Perhaps it would accelerate my path to that job position. Since it is the easier option, it might open up free time for me to get involved in extracurricular activities for my résumé.

In the end, I'd like to fulfill these criteria:

* a) more marketable when searching for an internship while in school, which leads to,
* b) more marketable for a first job
* c) a better candidate for an early Project Management job

I know I probably can't go wrong with either, but based on these criteria, and knowing that the end goal is some sort of management role, which specialization would you pick?"

To begin, a quick description of me. I'm 23 years old and will graduate college next year, I have an internship which I really like and it challenges me. I love the idea of being able to know a lot about everything and learning new languages. At the moment the only language I'm fluent at, other than my mother language (portuguese), is English (working towards learning Chinese aswell).

That being said, I really struggle with anxiety and lack of motivation to do things. I always procrastinate when I have something important to do, like a paper for college and a big assignment at my internship. I really don't know how to fix it, I've been struggling with it ever since I was a teenager. I WANT to study more, to work more, to engage in healthy hobbies that will bring me some self-improvement, but everytime that I start something, I quit it. I'm tired of being labeled (by myself) as a quitter. I can't focus on whatever it is I have to do for more than 10 minutes, I get distracted and will go on to check facebook, imgur, reddit, sometimes twitch.tv, you get the point.

3a1hxd,10,2015-06-16,"I am a NYU Stern Graduate (’08), Ask Me Anything!",jimmythehand1,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/3a1hxd/i_am_a_nyu_stern_graduate_08_ask_me_anything/,"Hi /r/ApplyingToCollege!  I’m a personal friend of /u/steve_nyc and a graduate of NYU’s Leonard N. Stern’s School of Business.  I double majored in accounting and finance, and he asked me to drop in and answer whatever questions y’all might have.  I’ll check back to this thread for the rest of the week or more.

The main area’s I’ll discuss are:

**(1)** Overall admissions statistics and how I compared

**(2)** My thoughts on the “Stern” experience. 

=-=-=

**(1)**     Stern is the business arm of New York University, located in the middle of the ‘village’ in nyc.  Stern is a top tier undergraduate and graduate school, and is a primary pipeline for accounting, finance, and marketing careers centered in NYC. If you google “NYU Stern admissions statistics,” you will find:

* 15% admissions rate, 
* Class size of ~600 per year,
* 98% six-month job placement (not so much in ’08!) 
* Mean HS GPA &amp; SAT 3.9/4.0 &amp; 1432/1600, 
* Median HS GPA &amp; SAT   3.76/4.0 &amp; 1460/1600

I applied Early Decision and was accepted November of my senior year in HS (NYU was my “reach school”). My numbers were somewhat below these averages, but I was a solid performer in high school and had a lot of extras (AP classes, cross country &amp; track, debate, a very solid essay and good references).  I also had applied to the summer program for prospective students and took classes in economics and expository writing.  Each of these factors must have added to my application and tipped the scales in my favor.  

If you ask me, “hey if I do X or Y will I get in?,”  my advice will invariably be to do extra-curricular activities because you like them, research &amp; consider several different ranked programs, and don’t get hung up on a dream school.  Your goal should be to develop passions and direction for your studies, not because it looks good on college applications.  Try new things you normally wouldn't.  (I tried theater, and was tricked into cross dressing in a Shakespeare play... so maybe not that far??)

=-=-=

**(2)**     Stern is tough.  The program is intense, the classes are curved, and you are subject to stress and decision making beyond your average college student.  Stern sucks because the real world sucks, and they make it a point to prepare you thoroughly.  The goal is to give you all the tools that you need to lead a successful career in whatever you want, even (especially?) outside of the business world.  Stern is very supportive of its students and the alumni network is strong.  You’ll find out more about group projects than you ever wanted to know, and you will build friends and contacts that will last you a lifetime.  

Your first 2 years are filled with arts and science classes like everyone else.  You make up essays about Plato by day and worry about getting ID'ed by night.  Starting somewhere in your sophomore year, your education begins.  You complete a business core common to all ""Sternies,"" then pick a specific major.  Most students major in finance or accounting, sometimes marketing.  In your third year, you go on a “business case study” for spring break: you have to behave, but hey, free trip!  Junior year you will stress out to secure a banking internship regardless of if you want to do banking or not, then stress out more senior year while you interview and figure out how a 21/22 year old is supposed to decide what a career means.  (Hint: you are not!).  Then you graduate and learn to love excel and late nights and being shit on by angry senior analysts and even angrier senior managers.  Alcoholism as a coping mechanism is encouraged.  (Scaring people off much?  Living in nyc is awesome, don't worry!  So is having a job!)  A couple working years later, you kind of wake up and start making choices that actually steer you in a direction you want to eventually go.  Full disclosure, this is my current uh… ‘stage,’ although I did accounting, not banking.  

NYU itself is awesome!  You live in or around the Village your first year, then elsewhere in Manhattan in one of the many dorms.  The city becomes your playground. You are going to find your college experience to be very different than your friends from home!  By the numbers Stern is the opposite of the broader University. 60:40 Male to Female, 60:40 Asian(s) to everyone else and a sizeable international presence (which is sort of a plus and sort of a minus).  One key factor here is to make friends outside your specific program.  I myself went Greek, which has a small but active presence on campus, and I’ll be forever grateful for the overall experience (but not the drinking).  

=-=-=

My little cousin is actually attending NYU Poly for engineering / programming right now, and my advice to him would be to make sure to take better advantage of the city, date as much as possible, and drink less!  Take advantage of the networks offered to you and don't forget to be a human being!  Words to live by, and I think I’ll be taking my own advice.  Fire away guys!

I've applied to about fifteen jobs so far, but all I have for experience is my internship last year doing PHP (I don't want to keep doing PHP). I like back-end but there aren't many back-end jobs, at least here in Boston, and there are even fewer *junior* back end jobs.

So tell me what you think of this plan. I'm going to learn Python/Django (less competition and pays more, yes?) and try to pick up a little Javascript so I could conceivably apply to this smorgasbord of front-end jobs in the meantime. I also want to get into data visualization and/or interactive programming, but that's in the distant future. The point is that I don't necessarily want to do web dev my entire life.

I'm currently running OS X Yosemite, version 10.10.2, and can provide more specs if needed(don't think you'll need processor etc for this though).

It's been having a lot of problems lately, from running really slowly to this funky glitch where my mouse moves erratically that started a few months ago, but that only happens occasionally. Its started to take longer and longer to open an application, or save a document, and I'm really frustrated.

So, I've decided my best solution is to start fresh and reinstall Yosemite. I'm hoping to be able to replace it once I'm completely done with school and find a job, but I need this one to last until then, and reasonably work.

I only really use itunes, which is backed up in icloud, adobe programs and light gaming like emulators and Minecraft that I can just reinstall online, and then, Microsoft Office. Sigh.

I got MS Office shortly after I got my computer. Not willing to shill out a ton of money after spending a significant portion of my savings on the computer, my tech-savvy then-boyfriend found a shady torrent download for it, and it worked. So currently, I have Microsoft Office 2011 installed.

And I have no way to reinstall it. No disc, no code. I'd like to avoid having to try my luck with torrents, because I'm not so tech-savvy and have rarely had them work in the past.

I'm a journalism major finishing my undergrad and soon moving on to my Master's, so I use Office, especially Word, all the time. Right now I'm taking summer classes, working a job with an environmental paper, and doing an internship with a paper in my city, so I can't exactly do this reinstall without being sure I have a way to reinstall word. I'd really like to reinstall, because I'm tired of troubleshooting 10 different glitches every week that a system wipe would fix, and I have a ton of crap on here I never use.

I almost exclusively work in Google Drive, and just paste stuff into word docs to turn in/email to people, so I don't need to save any documents, just the program itself.

Is there any way to, I don't know, put it on a flash drive, or find a recovery key somehow? Or can someone recommend a reliable place to download it?

I'm broke after paying tuition and a deposit on an apartment, so buying it isn't really an option right now. And the Apple versions, like Pages, aren't something I can submit on D2L or email to someone without pages(right?).

So long story short, I don't have much coding experience. I'm working in the operations department of a large company this summer and they are lacking a database that seems almost essential to have for the work they do. Now, because they don't have this, I have the glorious task of copying and pasting this information into a spreadsheet (yay for interns!). This spreadsheet is where they can go in and Ctrl+F to search for any information needed. It's tedious and inefficient. 

What the application/program would do is receive a message and sort that into a searchable and sortable database. You could also enter some of the information manually and so forth. Is there a preferred language to do this on, what would you recommend? 

Is this even feasible to learn and implement in the summer? I'd plan to spend an hour a day working on learning the language (I work M-F). Or am I just way over my head and I should stick to doing it the long way? 

I appreciate any honest criticism or advice in advance. 

Thank you guys! "
3a37kg,5,2015-06-16,Career switch to management consulting from brand management,[deleted],consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/3a37kg/career_switch_to_management_consulting_from_brand/,"Hey guys, I want to know if my hopes for a career switch has any realistic chances, and if so, how I might make my case stronger for a switch into consulting.

About me:

I'm a fairly new grad, but I've been able to pretty quickly build up a strong background in marketing, specifically brand management. I graduated from a well-known business school in Canada with a BBA in 2013 and I started working for a major pharmaceutical company immediately. At this point I was a marketing intern, but in about a year's time, I moved up twice and became an Assistant Brand Manager, and put into partial responsibility for profit &amp; loss of the company's flagship brand.

After a few more months at this pharma company, I switched to a major consumer goods company, a top recognized name in households as well as among recruiters. Pay is great, and the work is rewarding, and now I am fully responsible for profit &amp; loss on my own for a very large product portfolio. My credentials in business/brand management speak for themselves and I am proud of what I've been able to accomplish.

However, marketing has never really been a passion, but more of an interest since it's a way of making the strategy come to life. I've always loved business strategy more than marketing. I formulate strategies every day at work, since business strategy is the bread &amp; butter of a brand manager's life, apart from commissioning TV ads and whatnot. I do enjoy the marketing aspect of my job, but I would like to focus entirely on business strategy by joining management consulting. My hope would be to join something along the lines of Deloitte Consulting, and to a lesser degree, ZS Associates.

I've recently started doing consulting work on my own, on top of my full time job, and I've been able to acquire a client. I would be advising the client on general business strategy as well as bringing the strategy to life via marketing.

I graduated with honours for placing in the top 15% of my class, but my GPA wasn't very spectacular (3.6~3.7). My pathway into brand management was through case competitions, and I am very good at those and have a few achievements in this regard that really add to my resume. I do have the option of doing an MBA open for me, but I don't want to pursue an MBA degree since I'd hate to take on student loan and forego a few years of salary.

Does my resume sound like a fit for consulting? What advice would you guys give me?"

How should I approach this in interviews, whether I get fired or if I need to explain why I'm looking for a job so quickly after accepting this one? I'm nervous to lie because my profession is very small and everyone knows everyone, word travels quickly.

Why I'm possibly getting fired: 

* My boss thinks I'm unhappy. I am happy with my job, but he is convinced that since I'm not that as cheerful as I was as an intern that I'm not happy and wanting to leave. Truth is I'm exhausted from training (I'm trying to focus and remember everything so I don't mess up) and I'm not licensed in my field yet and trying to study for my certification (I'm taking it next month). I've explained this to him 2 weeks ago but I heard today at work that he is still concerned and wanting to let me go because he is convinced I'm not happy. Also- I'm recently divorced (still married when I had my internship) and it has taken a toll on me, although I had not discussed that with my boss.

* I was given several projects by a coworker and told them that I was not going to take on anymore projects until I was licensed and/or the current project is completed. Coworker told my boss that I am unwilling to do the job I was hired to do and that I was acting unprofessional. However, it was my understanding from speaking with my boss 2 weeks ago that training and studying were my main priorities, and that my current project could take a back seat, and that I wouldn't be taking on anymore projects until the current one was completed or until I was done training/licensed. 


I'm meeting with my boss sometime this week to hopefully convince him that I am happy with my job and if he wants me to take on additional projects before being licensed and before I'm done training then I will gladly do it, but it sounds like he has made up his mind based on his conversation with the coworker that gave me the heads up today. 

I'd like advice on how to handle my meeting with my current boss, and how to approach job interviews whether I'm fired or if I'm simply looking for a new job so quickly after getting hired. "

However, right now I'm leaning toward the path of just getting a degree in CS, and aside from dabbling in a few extra courses here and there to not bother with getting a second major or minoring in anything. I would then use the extra time I had to work on solo projects, contribute to open source projects, participate in clubs, contests, events, get an internship, and so on.

This is due to advice I have read here in the past on this subject, about how working hard, doing solo projects, networking, etc will make you far more employable after graduation than picking up a second degree.

That being said, I also have a strong passion for mathematics, creative writing/literature, and philosophy. I would love to study all of these in-depth at college, but I just don't think I have the time, the money, or the energy to do so right now. Honestly, my top priority at this point in my life is to land my ass in a secure, challenging, rewarding, and high-paying job so that I can live life without having to worry so much about money. 

I'm thinking about the possibility of going back to college later, maybe 10-20 years down the road to major in math, philosophy, whatever I want to just for the sake of learning, if I succeed in saving up enough money so that I can do something like that. To be clear, I do love CS. I'm not sure if it's my absolute favorite field yet, but it's definitely the most employable out of my interests.

Is that a reasonable idea, or would it be better for me to try to squeeze in learning everything I want to learn right now? My main fear with that idea is becoming a ""jack of all trades and a master of none,"" as well as burning myself out. However, I also don't want to make the mistake of making myself look lazy or unmotivated to future employers."

***Explanation on why I forgot everything and have shitty grades:***


&gt;While I would consider myself intelligent, due to some issues I have I was a fairly terrible student. One of the main reasons is that I am much better at working on one project(or class) at a time than multiple that are vastly different, as I usually end up wasting all of my time with the latter scenario  I also don't learn in class at all and in many of my courses I ended up learning everything the day before the midterm/final exams. Even though I have gotten A's on many of my final exams I still ended up with many C's for the overall course grade.

&gt;As a result of this style of learning most of what I learned in college was quickly forgotten."

It just opened up in the fall so it's still a fairly new place. I've been there about 3 weeks now. 

Also this past week, I interviewed for and got an on campus job in my cs department. It will be about 15 hours a week and the pizza place is the same amount of hours. Then just the other day I got asked to interview for one of the internships I applied for months ago. That internship is full time so more like 30-40 hours a week. There's no way I could balance that with the job in my cs department, the pizza place, and classes. Would it be acceptable to leave the pizza place? The full time internship would obviously be better for my future jobs in the computer science field than the pizza place."

I am in need of some advice regarding my current summer internship. Right now, I am 1 week through a 10 week software engineering internship at a startup. Before the start of my internship, the company moved to a new office around 1.5 hours away from where they told me to live, so I have to commute every day. In addition, this is my first ever software engineering internship, and there are no other engineering employees in the office, only other engineering interns and business employees. I am doing mostly backend work in python, and am learning mainly from the internet and from working long hours.

Recently, I got offered a software engineering internship at another startup closer to where I live. At this startup there would be other more experienced engineers and a product manager onsite. Also, I would be building an iPhone application.

My questions are...

1) Does my experience at my current internship seem like a typical startup interning experience, or does it seem atypical?

2) What is the typical startup software engineering internship like as far as mentorship?

3) What do you think I should do (stay with the current internship or take a chance with the new one)?

Thanks for your help! :D"

My school has a program where I am already getting 40% of my tuition covered through a scholarship, but that still leaves a large amount of money on my end to make up (most likely pulling out a 20k+ loan). 

In my ideal world where everything goes to plan, I network and find an AI company willing to intern me for the summer after I graduate as an undergrad, then pay for the remaining portion of my Master's degree in AI, and then hire me after obtaining the Master's degree. To anyone who knows more than me on matters of this nature, 1)how likely could this scenario be? (I'm a very put together and dedicated individual, and I will not lot anything stop me from achieving what I want to do.) and 2) Will a company realistically pay for the remaining portion of my graduate studies or am I really only looking at a certain percentage covered?

3a6805,16,2015-06-17,The “inner game” of becoming a data scientist,will-stanton,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/3a6805/the_inner_game_of_becoming_a_data_scientist/,"I have seen a lot of posts lately where aspiring data scientists are asking questions like, ""OMG, data scientists know so *much*!"" or ""I don't know where to start!"" or ""What do I do!? I don't have a PhD!"" I know where you're coming from, but for many of you, just getting the factual answers to your questions will not help you become a data scientist. Why? Because your ""inner game"" is inhibiting you from reaching your goals.

What do I mean by ""inner game?"" As explained in the famous book *The Inner Game of Tennis*, the inner game is the game that goes on inside your head while you're playing a match. Most great players have a great inner game. When they lose a point, they don't dwell on it. When they are about to play a match against Roger Federer, they really *believe* that they can win. And even if they *do* win, they can still find things they could have improved in their play.

When I started my journey to become a data scientist, I was wracked with anxiety. I didn't really know anything about machine learning. Hell, I could barely program a computer. I tried to audit a Java programming class and left after a week. My inner game was weak, and I was stuck. I found some inspiration in the book [The Now Habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination/dp/1585425524). The book helped me realize that my anxiety wouldn’t go away through browsing the internet. So I stopped sitting at my computer and took action!

I had a huge breakthrough when I started going to data science meetups and actually talking to people. Contrary to the picture of data scientists I had gotten from the internet, I found out that most data scientists are not experts in everything. I found out that with some persistence, I *could* learn how to code and train machine learning algorithms. My anxiety fell away like magic, and my inner game got so much better. I no longer gave up when I had some trouble with my code. I felt much more confident reaching out to employers.  Soon after, I found my first data science  internship (at a Meetup!), which turned into a full-time job.

So what’s my advice for the aspiring data scientists out there? Make sure your inner game is just as strong as your technical skills and your resume. You’ll need confidence and persistence and resilience if you want to become a data scientist. And you will need all of those traits when you finally *get* your first data scientist job, too. Best of luck, and please feel free to PM me if you have any questions.

Edit: I got a lot more responses than I expected from this post! I plan to write more self-posts like this, as long as people are still interested. Meanwhile, I have a few more articles like this on my blog: http://will-stanton.com/"

What I want to know is how can you pull data from each tab of the workbook, and put it into a nice table. 

Specifics: 
1) On each of the sheets, the job number is in the same cell, so what kind of formula would allow me to pull all of the job numbers from each of the different sheets and place them in descending order.  I want to put all the C4 cell values from each sheet onto one page. Here is an example of what the data on each page looks like.

3a6f25,10,2015-06-17,Should I accept my first job offer?,Sunsweep,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3a6f25/should_i_accept_my_first_job_offer/,"I'm a fresh bachelors graduate looking for a job. I've recently received an offer from a company and they want to hear back by the end of the week.

The thing is, while I like the type of work the company does, I'm less sure of the company itself. Its glassdoor reviews seem kind of strange, with a bunch of recent reviews( as in starting from June) giving them 4 or 5 stars. If you remove those reviews, there are less enthusiastic reviews, many of which saying there is little opportunity to advance and that when deadlines come up work/life balance becomes bad.These reviews did mention it was a decent place to pick up experience as a fresh graduate though. Another strange thing is the interview process with the company went by very quickly, and they were the ones to seek me out.

Because of this and a slightly below expectations salary I'm on the fence about whether or not to accept. I don't have any other job offers right now, and none of the other interview processes I'm going through will be done by the time this company wants to hear my answer. Part of my hesitance may come from the fact that I once had a very unpleasant internship experience, and I'm afraid of going blind into this. I'm very unfamiliar with how difficult it is to switch jobs as a fresh graduate if things go badly.

EDIT: the industry is computer science. The pay is only a few thousand under what I'd expect, but I'm afraid of starting low and being unable to climb. Also, I was looking at apartments in the area and rent is somewhat expensive."

[What are the biggest problems facing journalists in the digital age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9kcrn?context=5)|That's a really great question. There a multitude of them and I could fill the page with thoughts on that. But I also think there's a lot to be optimistic about since we are in an age of innovation and because the hyper competitiveness of the market now means we as journalists are being forced to really up our game to stand out.
 |But I do encourage younger journalists to try to have a long view. Build a life, not a career (that's more just life advice I guess). But in view of that, I want more young journalists to fight against the urge to do stuff that's quick, cute or clever and to dig deeper and do work that might take a little longer, but is thoughtful, or makes a serious point, or helps readers understand things about the world that actually help them or enlighten them or raise their spirits in a meaningful way.
 |We do need to have more investigative journalism, and I'm encouraged by what Ben Smith at Buzzfeed is doing in that space, as well as places like ProPublica. But we need many more folks to get into that space, and there's no question that the business side is still a puzzle.
 |I also think the headline on this New Yorker piece sums up the challenge facing journalists. [Link to www.newyorker.com](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/a-new-theory-of-distraction?mbid=social_twitte) We are in an age of distraction and a huge challenge for journalists is to reach an audience and get our material in front of people with anything other than ephemera. People are busy, they're stressed, and they're distracted. It's a business problem but also a creator problem. We're all still figuring it out. 
[*we are in an age of innovation and because the hyper competitiveness of the market now means we as journalists are being forced to really up our game to stand out.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9nhmq?context=5)|Upping our game means doing quality work in a way that is also easy to read, interesting and relevant. there is inherent tension between the sort of purist attitude of 'this is important/really good/etc so people should read it' and 'make it palatable to the largest possible audience.'
[Do you have a sense of the long term goals of the Koch network? Some of the RNC officials you quote seem to think the Kochs want to ""supplant"" the GOP. Do you think that's the case? And I guess, if so, why? What can't they get out of current GOP that they'd need to supplant it? (and is that supplanting just in terms of data capabilities or a more wholesale supplanting?\) Thanks for doing this, Jon!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9kwa1?context=5)|Reporting on this topic has introduced me to a new level of smoke and mirrors. as one of the many people I spoke with said, 'you can't trust anyone' on this topic because everyone has an agenda. that's usually the case in political journalism, but here, there are other factors at play: a lot of money and a technical element to the story that gives those with expertise the ability to run circles around those who don't understand the mechanics, and which makes it hard to know who actually understands the process and who doesn't.
 |An example of the smoke and mirrors. more than one person on team RNC said they think the Koch's political arm actually wants to become, in some part, a shadow party. but you have to consider that some of this may be posturing, an attempt to alarm others so that they rally to the cause.
 |But the alarm did seem sincere, and I don't think the RNC would be going public with their confrontation with the Kochs unless they were concerned about losing control of data and relevance.
 |As to Koch world, I don't know how Charles and David Koch feel about this issue. it may be that the direction taken by Freedom Partners and i360 is not something they're aware of or in favor of, or it may be that they've blessed it. it's actually probably neither, ie not as black and white. I would guess that with the RNC's decision to take this fight public the brothers have started paying closer attention to the issue. 
[What are some things that annoy you most about the current journalism climate? Does it ever get frustrating to know that a large part of the American population don't seem to be actively interested in what you may deem important?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9mp2j?context=5)|I love this question. i'll admit, I love the movie ""Idiocracy."" I think it's absolute genius. I'm a huge Neil Postman fan, especially because of ""Amusing Ourselves to Death."" So if you've watched that movie or read that book or both, you know a lot about where my head's at on this question. I think TV has ruined us in many ways, not because of the people in it but because of the way the medium works. Add on top of that the schizophrenic distraction of the digital age and it's not the greatest recipe for an informed, thoughtful electorate.
 |But I try not to gripe about it. And I definitely don't want to think or act like what I'm doing every day is somehow more important than what people who don't follow politics are doing, because it's not. People running restaurants or doing maintenance on our infrastructure or teaching our kids or serving in our military or cleaning our hotels or whatever are all doing amazing things every day.
 |So yeah it's important that people be informed. But again, people are busy and they don't always have time to be up to date on stuff. My only real plea is that people read more than they watch TV.

[What are your thoughts on Rand Paul? Have you ever met him in person? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9n8ih?context=5)|I have a few times. I interviewed him in Iowa in February. [Link to news.yahoo.com](http://news.yahoo.com/in-iowa--a-tale-of-two-rand-pauls-182905616.html)
 |I think he is, as time put it, a very interesting political figure (they said he was most interesting man in politics), and I think he's had an amazing knack for drafting off hot button issues to raise his political profile. right now it's a little unclear whether he's had his best days as a presidential hopeful or whether he's got another surge in him. how he performs in iowa looks like it's gonna be pretty important, but then again, New Hampshire has a lot of libertarians, so maybe he can get a boost there. 
[If the Kochs and the RNC are at war, who do you expect to win? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9kioa?context=5)|Hello jstrong! :) the Kochs, ie i360, are much better funded obviously, and among Republican campaign folks, they just want to win. they don't care about stupid philosophical questions. but by going public with the philosophical, more big picture question about who is the more responsible guardian of the Republican party's master voter file, the RNC may be able to rally some folks in the GOP to their side. a big moment will be what the eventual GOP presidential nominee does and how they lead the party on this question of data 
[*among Republican campaign folks, they just want to win. they don't care about stupid philosophical questions.*  I'm in the ""everyone needs to take a breath camp"" in your article.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9n7hj?context=5)|Just to be clear, i don't think the philosophical question is stupid. i was channeling some operatives I've spoken too.
[Oh I don't think it is, I'd side with the RNC just on a ""the party is the party"" basis. But they aren't my boss, the candidate is, and he wants to win. All this can be distracting from the goal of winning in Novembers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9njt7?context=5)|Yup, that's where a lot of folks are. presidential nominee's decisions/actions will be big.

Job secutiry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9maw5?context=5)|Ha, good point. i think the debate format is ripe for some disruption. change it up, flip the script. try new things. i liked what Ben Domenech proposed ([Link to thefederalist.com](http://thefederalist.com/2015/05/18/fix-the-gop-presidential-debates-with-this-one-simple-trick/)) get rid of the moderator. maybe not for all debates, but why not do at least one that way?

[What made you want to become a journalist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9ke94?context=5)|It wasn't all that thought out. i was a lit major at the university of Maryland (go terps!), I taught high school lit for two years after college, and then decided I want to write for a living, somehow, some way. I got a bunch of advice, and people I talked to said that the best way to build a writing career of any kind was to go into newspapers (this was the summer of 2001). so i started looking for work and got an unpaid internship at the Washington Times on the city desk.
[Are you still using Meerkat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9kj8n?context=5)|That's funny, I was just in Miami on Monday at Jeb Bush's announcement speech, and I saw Mark Halperin, who was another early adapter on Meerkat. I asked him if he was still using it, and he said he wasn't. I'm not either. I think it was a fad that will probably have a moment or two more in the sun, but I think it's hard to exist as an app that you only use occasionally, bc those are the apps you delete when you're freeing up space on your phone!

Reagan united them and so did Bush for a while but they've struggled without a national leader, as any party does. Democrats were in the same position in the 80's before Clinton came along, and could be there after Obama, depending on how HRC does 
[I heard the Koch Brothers were more libertarian than republican anyway. Will this schism cause them to back more libertarian candidates? Or even libertarian leaning republicans, like Rand Paul?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9mee2?context=5)|Their roots are in Libertarianism but they've become much more involved in the Republican Party over the last decade or so. ""Sons of Kansas"" by Daniel Schulman is a book about the brothers that's actually been recommended to me by people inside the Koch empire as pretty accurate.
 |They haven't shown any affinity for Rand Paul. their most positive mentions have been of Scott Walker, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. They're pragmatists at the end of the day i think.
[With politicians who might have split allegiances to the RNC vs. the Koch network, like Sens. Ernst or Cotton, if they're forced to pick a side (so to speak\) how do you see that breaking down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a5ywn/im_journalist_jon_ward_who_wrote_the_inside_story/cs9kju2?context=5)|I think most politicians are trying to straddle the middle and not take sides, even if they're using i360 more than the RNC's voter contact tools. their defense is, we have to do what's best to win. and the RNC has acknowledged that they haven't done a good enough job, so while there are behind the scenes conversations where the RNC is not happy with folks who are using i360, it's hard for the RNC to publicly castigate anyone.

Now Patricia wasn't the brightest star in the sky, and she clearly showed it when she failed to distinguish a USB port from an HDMI port. The request came in that one of the ladies in the office had apparently been having trouble with plugging in her keyboard. 


So I grabbed a coffee and walked down to the only cubicle this problem would occur in. As I rounded the corner, there she was. In one hand was her keyboard, and in the other hand looked to be some other sort of cable. Ignoring these details I took her keyboard and went over to one of the numerous usb ports of this very sad dell midtower. 


The moment my hand grabbed the end of this keyboard's connection, my heart sank. I took one good look at the usb male end of the keyboard and sighed deeply. It was split down the middle from being forced...but forced into what? I took another look at the ports and saw the only  thing that could cause this. An obviously scratched up HDMI port. 

I don't know how this happened, but Patricia ended up mistaking the two and attempted to force the cheap USB male cable end into the HDMI female end. Her reasoning?: 'It didn't fit the first time I tried putting it in'"

During school, however - I never got an internship (I was, and still am, at a job that I somewhat enjoyed being at during college, but now looking for the next step now that I have my degree).

I've had a few interviews in the last few months which for various reasons I did not get (one I knew I probably wouldn't get but interview experience, the other I was likely just beat out but I thought it went great, and the last wasn't comfortable with a lack  of languages that I never said I knew, despite calling me in for the interview and me explaining that I knew I would transition well).

Anyway, hence the question: would it be worth it to look into and apply for internships?  I know -many- of the companies will have no interest in a post-graduate intern, but what's your guys' opinion of applying anyway?

I would still apply to jobs in the meantime of course, but every so often a job posting for an internship will pop up and I've been debating it."

I'm not taking away from the fact that it is a disability but i also see it as a severe lack of motivation. For years i would be lazy and hyper focus on the wrong things. For a lot of us we may be going down routes were not supposed to, hence a severe lack of motivation to get anything done in the field were in. Recently I've managed to light the fire in me and started getting things done. What I did along with taking my medication for it was change my mindset. I dropped a class because it was too difficult and instead of wasting the rest of my summer away playing video games which are my total weakness is i have taken up programming. I've got it drilled into my head that computer science is what i want to do and now being on the verge of failing out of school it's what i have to do. I've never wanted anything more than to succeed in this and with that said I've started busting my ass and it's helped significantly with my motivation. Some days lets face it, i really don't think there's much you can do to get motivated but other days when you are I encourage you to try your hardest at it. As for finding the right field for yourself. A little about me last year i had an municipal engineering internship. I was motivated to do well at first but it was the most boring thing in the world and it was easy to get distracted from. On top of that it wasn't paid so my motivation was next to nothing. After three months i was let go and i hardly regret anything from that experience. What i learned from it is i will never accomplish anything with out the proper motivation. Now I'm doing something completely different, I'm in commision based sales at a retail store. On average i'm probably making minimum wage but there's just something about having very relaxed managers who basically say, ""We don't care what you do. Just make us money and make yourself money."" For whatever reason I'm highly motivated and i work my ass off for minimum wage sales, loving every second of it. I'm not behind a desk, i get to be on my feet and talk to people, make friends and make money in the process. For me it's an extroverted adrenaline rush of get fired or make bank. Now what I've done is i'm taking that motivation and setting my goals on the far future. If i graduate with a computer science degree i could be making 60k a year!! And let me tell you thinking about that and actually wanting it has turned my lazy work ethic around. It's all about figuring out ways to lighting that fire underneath you. I really hope this helps some of you. I'll try to answer any questions in a timely manner. Sorry if this was super scatter brained :("

I am considering buying a preconstruction condo ready for 2018 summer, which by that time I would finish my masters. As a student right now, I only make 19/h for my summer internship, but I expect to make atleast 55k /year by 2018. Looking for approximately 300-350k 1bedroom, and if my 2018 I make 41k after deductions (55k/y)(3200/month), then I should be able to make monthly payments (tax, maint, hydro, mortgage) of 1500/month, while still saving and living comfortably .

That said, my father, who resides in a different country and does not have a Canadian citizenship is offering to help with the 20% downpayment. 

How would I go about getting pre-approved for a mortgage with a low interest rate? Can I have an international co-signer or guarantor, or is that based on if the lender bank has an international branch in the same country that my father lives in?

If that isn't an option, what would the best route or option be to go about this?

Thanks !

Edit: based on comments and feedback and advice, another possible route would be to buy an existing condo in the area, rent it out until 2018, then take over the mortgage. That way expenses can be calculated before hand  and positive cash flow can be more obtainable . Mortgage would still be guarantored  by my mom who is in a citizen too. Thoughts to this route instead? "

We were close friends from about 2010-2013, then there was a huge issue between him, his ex-girlfriend, and me, and we didn't start talking again until early this year. After we talked about how we really felt about each other, things were great, but for the past couple months, certain things have been popping up that I'm not entirely sure how to approach.

He's become a little paranoid. He wanted me to put some tracking app on my phone ""just in case"" and gets indignant when I have plans with friends and won't ditch them to be with him. I can name at least three other women who have cheated on him, and I understand why he'd be a little anxious about this-except he *knows* me and he knows that I don't talk to ANY of my exes. I put the app on my phone because I honestly don't have anything to hide and I like to pick my battles, but I feel kind of bad that he lies about the just in case thing, because I *know* what he's looking for.

Also, he's pushing me to get a joint bank account with him, join his phone plan, and live with him already. Constantly. I've explained straight out that this is all stuff I wouldn't even consider unless I was engaged or even married. I don't know whether this is another paranoia thing or him just trying to be nice, but he just doesn't seem to understand why I don't want to go there yet. I'm definitely not one of those women who expects or even wants the guy to pay for everything, and I'm perfectly capable of supporting myself. Another issue is that I make quite a bit more money than he does-I'm a law student who has a really awesome and surprisingly well-paid internship, and he's a manager at a pizza store-and I know this sounds awful, but I don't really want him anywhere near my money with that level of access. He gripes about not having money for this and that despite the fact that he still lives with his mother rent-free, and I don't really want to be the one fixing that issue by agreeing to a joint bank account.

I guess I'm looking for advice and opinions on this situation. I do care about him a lot, but there just seems to be so much tension about our styles in relationships."

3a85rp,1,2015-06-17,Internship help!,Flagauster,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3a85rp/internship_help/,"Hello.

I am a 17-year old high school student that has landed a paid internship with a freelance software developer. I told him I have pretty decent knowledge in Python, and then small experience with SQLite, JS, jQ/AJAX, and Flask. I also told him how I wrote/coded www.getdotbit.com with another partner, so he was all impressed and expecting an experienced web dev, i think. He's pretty intimidating to me, though, since he's very experienced and knows his shit, to say the least. That's where the problem comes in:

So I first arrived at his office and we got right to it. He told me I'd be working with PHP, Apache, MySQL, and Laravel. I have never actually used any of those things ever. Anyway, he had me install all the components of LAMP, and connect to his MySQL db with PHP. Pretty straightforward here, but still foreign to me. 

So from there I was sort of on my own, ish. He gave me an idea of what he wanted me to do: Build a website where I could query an inventory (from the db) and get details on each item (industrial items like screws, steel, etc). With Flask/Python, I would be comfortable, but hopping into a new language (php) and new framework (laravel), it was kind of daunting. He kinda just set me on it. I asked few questions because it seemed like he expected me to know this, like ""Hey just set up your config file and have a formatted MVC layout (never heard of it...), it should be no prob right?"" He wants the base of the project done by the end of the week, which should be enough time to buckle down and learn the basics, but I think he expects me to be on a higher level than I might be. 

This may not be as big of a problem as I see it, but I am worried to go back after the base project is done and have him hit me with another stressful load of stuff that he expects me to know already. Getdotbit was written pretty.... umm.. hacky. I doubt things were even close to professionally formatted/set up.

I know this is sort of a 'desperate rant', but is there any advice someone can give me to handle a situation where I might be in a bit over my head?"

I don't know where to start with this series of strange events, events that changed me forever. I don't wanna jump right into it, and besides, a little back story is necessary.

Last summer, my grandfather died. He was my last surviving grandparent, but I was never really close to him. You see, my mother, his daughter, emigrated to the US with her new husband, my dad, leaving him and my late grandmother on their land in Montenegro. We'd visit regularly when I was a kid, and he was always a jovial man who would bounce me on his lap and take me out to see the sheep and tell me to count them. However, visits back to the wilderness of Montenegro (my parents never saw it fit to take me to one of Montenegro's many beach towns or national parks, just my grandparents' land in a village near Berane), soon bored me, and I preferred to spend my summers in America, smoking weed with my American boyfriend, going on roadtrips to music festivals on the East and West Coasts, etc. My last trip was the winter of my 13th year, when my grandma died and we went to her funeral.

I learned of his death when I came back from my freshman year of college. My mom was crying in the living room, holding one of those striped air-mail envelopes and a typewritten letter. Apparently, one of my aunts had sent it to her, and not bothered to tell her in time of the funeral. However, she did write that grandpa had left my mother a rather large swath of his property, and someone from our family needed to come and confirm the transfer of land to my mother.

I felt pretty bad about the whole thing, even though I barely remembered Grandpa Ivan. Besides, I hadn't seen my ancestral land in 5 and a half years, and my mother was in no position to travel. She worked as a nurse in an urban hospital, and was unable to take time off for the summer. Dad was pre-diabetic and in no shape to fly 8 hours across the Atlantic. Since my internship application fell through, I had time to visit and pay my respects to my grandfather.

Two days later, I was packed and ready to go. I was flying out from O'Hare, stopping over in Frankfurt, and arriving to Montenegro's capital Podgorica's tiny airport, where I would be greeted by my two cousins, Luka and Teodora.

After twelve hours of travel, I arrived to my final destination. Lugging my heavy duffel bag, I stepped out into the packed waiting area. I didn't see anyone I recognized, but apparently my cousins did.

“Lena!” a tall, athletically built girl called from the other end of the room. I turned and half-jogged towards her, relieved that I found someone. I could barely remember the features I had seen those summers ago, now set in a thin, tanned face with a few hints of makeup. She used to be shorter than me, but was now a couple inches taller. She started talking in Serbian, but I had to cut her off and try to explain to speak a little slower. She grinned and switched effortlessly to English. “Lucky for you, I had the highest grade in my English class last year!”

Needless to say, I was relieved.

“Luka's waiting in the car. We're stopping by my mother's in Berane to spend the night, then we're off to the village,” she explained.

The hot sun bouncing off the asphalt made me catch my breath as we stepped outside. I could feel myself starting to sweat. “This Podgorica heat is pretty bad, isn't it?” Teodora remarked conversationally, leading me to a dilapidated red Yugo. A young man was sitting in the front seat, blasting the remarkably intact A/C. Seeing me approach, he leapt out and greeted me in Serbian and made a couple remarks that I didn't quite catch. I simply nodded and smiled, and tried to tell him that it was nice to see him again. Teodora rattled some stuff to him in Serbian, and he smiled and in broken English told me, “O.K, O.K, nice to see you again, sister.” Apparently his English was not on the same level as his sister's.

We caught up a lot during the 3 hour car ride. Teodora had moved to Podgorica to study law. She had a boyfriend in the electrical engineering college, Aleksandar from Kotor, a seaside resort town. Aunt Mara was not very pleased, because he was half Croat. “But love conquers all,” Teodora sang, a silly smile on her face. Luka was also studying electrical engineering, and was rooming with Teodora. He had no girlfriend; he was serious about his studies. They pestered me with questions about life in America (“Is it true Americans eat at McDonald's for every meal?”) and kept telling me about how they had the perfect boyfriend for me and if we had time they'd introduce us.

As we all chatted, I couldn't help but notice the sheer beauty of the land. As we passed Podgorica, which was filled with gray Brutalist architecture and open air markets and old men on bicycles, handlebars loaded with grocery bags, I began to notice the high, rocky foothills of the Dinaric Alps, covered in thick pines towards the bottom and dark karst exposed at the top, meeting the dark purplish-blue of the twilight sky. I wasn't aware of how much I'd missed it.

At about 9:30 pm, we pulled up to my aunt and uncle's apartment building in the center of town. They led me up the stairwell, which smelled strongly of cabbage, to the fifth and top floor. It was clear that the cabbage smell was emanating from this particular apartment.

Teodora unlocked the door and announced my arrival. Aunt Mara bustled out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on her stained apron. She took my face between her hands and kissed me on the cheek 3 times. Uncle Igor got up and switched the TV off, neglecting the water polo game to hug me and take my luggage. The table was set with sarma (ground pork and rice wrapped in cabbage leaves, which I abhorred), braised chicken (not so bad), and a goat cheese, tomato, and onion salad. She had probably spent all day making it, and I was hungry (the last thing I had to eat was an overpriced burger in Flughafen Frankfurt), so after awkward greetings, we all sat down to eat.

Teodora served as the translator. Aunt Mara wanted to know how her sister Olivera was doing, and her brother in law Goran (obviously, my parents), wanted to know how nursing school was going for me, if I had any plans to return to Europe. The rest of the evening went pretty uneventfully, and I was directed to a futon in the living room where I would sleep until the morning, when my cousins would take me up to Crni Vrh, the village.

I woke up in the morning, feeling jet lagged as fuck. Teodora was already awake and dressed, drinking soured milk (which sounds gross, but is basically like a cross between regular milk and plain yogurt in terms of taste and consistency) at the kitchen table. I could hear the water running in the bathroom, and the door was open a crack, leading me to assume Luka was shaving. Aunt Mara appeared out of the kitchen, brandishing two sandwiches wrapped in napkins, which she shoved into the front pocket of my duffel bag. After Luka exited the bathroom, I took a change of underwear, some capris (judge me, all right, I might look like a soccer mom wearing them but they're hella comfy), and some band t-shirt my ex had bought me when we went to Lollapalooza. Teodora explained to me that before I left the country, I'd have to stop by Podgorica once again to talk to the family lawyer (apparently, a second cousin of ours or something) to confirm the land transfer and hand over some documents my mother sent by me, but everyone assumed I'd like to see it first for myself and take pictures and stuff to email back to Mom.

After I said my goodbyes to my aunt and uncle, we all hopped back into Luka's Yugo and were off. Berane itself was a pretty depressing town; teenagers skipped school and smoked cheap, smelly cigarettes at the splintery cafe tables and there was no building over 6 stories. However, as with Podgorica, once we left the city proper, the landscape transformed into something beautiful. Small houses with white facades and red tiled roofs lay among flowering gardens, and once in a while you would pass a beautiful old church that had been there for centuries.

After a twenty minute drive on a shitty, partially unpaved, curvy road, a yellow road sign proclaimed that we had reached Crni Vrh. The village seemed pretty empty. The houses were few and far between, and all I saw were a couple old people walking up the dirt path and a couple mutts barking after our car. Occasionally, a person would walk by, herding a small group of goats or sheep. They would stare curiously at the unfamiliar car, but would look away as soon as you'd look at them. The sky threatened rain; dark storm clouds gathered overhead.

“The people who live here are mostly old-timers; I doubt there's even 150 people in this village. They're dying by the day,” Teodora remarked.

“No new people either,” Luka chimed in. “All go to cities, or to Serbia, or to Deutschland.” He pulled up in front of a house at the very end of the village, the familiar old stone house where Grandpa Ivan would be waiting in the doorway.

“Where's his grave?” I asked.

“Down by the monastery at the foot of the hill. There's really not much to see down there, there wasn't enough money for him and Grandma Raka to be buried together, unfortunately. There's just a plain wooden cross down there with his name and birth and death date,” Teodora replied.

“Ah, okay. Should we go in, then?” I asked, noting that a few drops of rain had fallen.

“Sure.”

Luka unlocked the door and held it open for us. The first thing that hit us was the smell of mold. It had apparently rained a lot during the last month, and the roof was leaky. Rivulets of water had pooled onto Grandma Raka's prized kilims, part of her dowry, and ruined them. Teodora warned me not to go into the attic – there were bats, and told me to be on the lookout for snakes. They were numerous here, and venomous.

“Why didn't anyone clear out his stuff?” I asked, examining the gilted icon of Jesus Christ ascending from the grave, the only ornament on the wall.

“A lot of it was cleared out by my mother, but a lot of stuff was left over. Only so much can be put into the car.”

I took the icon off the wall; with it came a few flecks of yellow-white paint. The lone lightbulb glowed a dull off white color. It popped as it turned black just as a clap of thunder hit our ears.

“Damn it,” Teodora whispered in Serbian, than turned to snap something to Luka. He came bounding back with one of those industrial flashlights. She turned to me and said, “There's still more in the sitting room and the bedrooms, if you want to look. We also have some raincoats and umbrellas in the car if you want to go around the property.”

I set the icon back on the wall and took the flashlight from Luka. I shined it on the dusty couch, covered by the same awful mint-green vinyl sheet with bright pink hibiscus flowers printed on it. “Remember when you tried to burn that thing?” I said to Luka, giggling a bit at the memory of 12-year-old him dragging it out to the bonfire one night and demanding to burn the atrocity.

He laughed and replied in the affirmative.

I walked down the hallway to my grandparents' room. It was small, filled almost completely by the sagging bed, covered by a light brown blanket. There was a floor length mirror and a pair of worn blue slippers on the side of the bed. On the nightstand lay a bible and a book of Montenegrin poetry. The wall was adorned by one of my grandmother's embroideries, this one of a field of poppies. Otherwise, it was bare.

We moved onto the bedroom that was my mother's and Aunt Mara's growing up. The ceiling had a noticeable water stain, and the two twin beds had splintery oak headboards and bare pink, faux satin mattresses. A bookshelf held their assigned reading from elementary and high school, as well as old textbooks. Waves of nostalgia came across me.

“I really missed this place,” I said, trying to justify the tears that had sprung to my eyes. Teodora gave me a little side hug in response. 

“You want to go see the creek that we used to go to when we were little?”

“Isn't it a bit of a long walk, though?”

Luka shrugged. Teodora replied, “It's nice to walk through the rain a little bit. It gives this whole place a, how do you say it? An air of mystery, I think.”

“All right,” I said, unconvinced. But she was right.

The field behind grandfather's house stretched out into the forest, and behind that were more fields and orchards. The edge of the property was marked by a small, clear creek filled to the brim with trout. It looked otherworldly in the rain, the silver mist coating the deep green. In the forest I could see the katun, the grouping of houses that shepherds would sleep in during the summer months to guard the animals if a wolf or bear came along.

“What happened to all the livestock?” I asked Teodora as we walked down the muddy path.

I noticed how she and Luka exchanged a look. “There was, uh, a disease. A lot of them died, but Grandfather sold the rest.”

I thought it was kinda odd, but didn't say anything. I took out my phone and started snapping pictures to send back to Mom, and the rest of the trip to the stream passed in silence, excepting the clicking noises from my iPhone camera.


The creek was swollen from the recent rains, and it flowed pretty fast. “Remember when we'd used to make little pools for the fish by stacking rocks?” I asked.

“I do,” Teodora replied, sticking her hands in her raincoat pockets. “It's pretty down here, isn't it? I miss it all the time when I'm down in Podgorica for school. So does Luka.” He nodded at the mention of his name. “You want to go back? It's raining harder than I expected it to. We need to get back to the car so we can get back to town before it gets really bad.”

However, the rain continued worsening as we made the forty minute trek back to the house. Luka went to start the car, and we all piled in. He started it no problem, but the car was mired in deep mud. He tried to get it to move, but the tires spun out. The nearest house was shuttered up, and it looked like the rest of the villagers had taken shelter from the storm.

“Fuck,” Luka whispered. (I had a good knowledge of Serbian curses from my parents, who used them very liberally in conversation.)

He turned and said something to Teodora, which she didn't seem to like. But he continued insisting, and she finally turned to me. “Lena, we're going to have to wait it out in the house,” she said with a tight smile on her face.

“Okay,” I shrugged. It would be kinda gross for me to stay in that musty, cold house, but whatever.

It was only 11am, but the darkness outside made it look like it was twilight. Bright lightning bolts illuminated the house as we all sat around. Luka produced a pack of cards from his raincoat pocket, and we played Skat for a couple hours, munching on the salami and cucumber sandwiches Aunt Mara sent along with us. The rain didn't seem to be letting down.

We all got bored of cards after a while and we kind of sat there for a while, having nothing really to say to each other. “When will we get to leave?” I ventured.

“When we can dig the car out of the mud, which may be tomorrow morning,” Teodora replied dully.

“Um, all right then. What should we do while we wait?” I asked. 

“Maybe another game of Skat?” she suggested.

I shrugged. “Okay. Can't you call Aunt or Uncle and have them get us?”

“Luka won't leave his car, and, besides, I don't have signal.”

The rain continued for the entire day. We played cards, mostly. I got tired at around 7:00pm due to jet lag, and chose to turn in on one of the smaller beds. I fell asleep almost instantly.

As I slept, I dreamt of earlier days, running through the fields, the grass up to my hips. Teodora was in front of me, Luka to the back. It was a sunny, warm day. I was wearing my favorite white dress, which was, in the dream, free of the grass and dirt stains I had inflicted upon it. But then it started raining. Luka passed me and caught up to Teodora, and they ran in front of me into the grass, so far that I couldn't see them anymore. I cried out; I was alone around the katun. The small huts had dark doorways, and I could hear whispering coming from them. I was drawn to it. As I came closer and closer, the whispering became more agitated. I called for my cousins, but I was being drawn into the opening. As I was about to cross the threshold, I was whimpering in fear. As I finally crossed it, the whispers turned into one long, ear-splitting scream, and a pair of red eyes swam into view.

I woke up.

But not in the bedroom.

I was lying in the katun on wet grass, a drizzle stinging my face."

Growing up I was top of my class, got great grades, worked my butt off in extracurriculars, got my eagle award through Boy Scouts. I then went to the university of Georgia, a pretty good school, and got a degree in advertising and a high GPA. On top of this I did internships and was actively involved in extracurriculars. I essentially did everything that I was told would lead to a successful life.

I'm now a year out of school. My girlfriend left me, I still don't have a job, I had to move in with my parents 300 miles away from friends, and I was just fired from a retail job which I was overqualified for. I feel entirely worthless. I went to 2 different therapists, got on Zoloft, tried harder and different tactics in my job hunt, tried different hobbies, and nothing is seeming to change things.

I don't have a good relationship with my family. My dad is perhaps the most idiotic person I've ever known and is completely callous. When I first tried to kill myself, years ago, he said it was for attention. In his own words ""I don't believe in depression."" He was also physically abusive to me and has slapped the shit out of me to the point that I fell down a flight of stairs about 6 years ago. He also never stops criticizing everyone in the family. The yelling is too much. If I was to commit suicide his main concern would be how it reflected upon himself. My brothers don't really connect with me very much. My sister rarely speaks to me. My mom seems to be the only person who would legitimately care if I did die.

I had friends in college, but most have drifted away and don't speak to me anymore. I have maybe 4 friends I talk to regularly. They've essentially told me that being suicidal is stupid and lazy and that I just need to man up. I don't think it would affect them very much.

90% of my thoughts nowadays are how I can kill myself. I've tried thinking out the different options I have besides suicide and I am unable to see myself as happy in any of them. Maybe if I was able to start entirely over and drop everyone. I just don't know what to do besides hanging myself.

3a8ihg,3,2015-06-17,TIFU by Wearing Mismatched Shoes to Work,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3a8ihg/tifu_by_wearing_mismatched_shoes_to_work/,"First of all, photographic evidence so you know what these shoes look like: http://i.imgur.com/xmbvdDn.png

Ok so, I'm a 23 year old guy who just started my first ""real"" job out of college last week.  I've interned at the place for about a year though, so I'm friends with everyone.  It's an engineering place, and I engineer things.

Now I still live at home.  I share a room with my brother, and my 2nd brother and sister sleep in the living room (it's a small-ish place.)  I have to tiptoe around in the morning with the lights off so as not to disturb anyone.  My dad and I leave to carpool to work while most of our family is still sleeping.  Well what it boils down to is that I put my shoes on in the dark, and usually while sitting at my desk checking my email/comics/whatever.  To make matters worse, I usually wear my tennis shoes everywhere, but I wear my brown shoes when I go to work.  99% of the time this turns out fine, but yesterday well... refer to the link.

That's not the important part.  So I sometimes fuck up with my shoes, so what reddit asks.  My reactions at work were what killed it for me though.  As soon as I get in, I walk through the break room to put my lunch in the fridge and the first person I see says ""What the hell Drillgorg?"" and laughs his ass off.  It's all downhill from there.

Now anyone I worked with who was a 20-something was totally chill.  A bunch didn't notice.  Those who did, the reactions ranged from ""lol"" to ""you do you!""  But I swear, anyone over 40 seemed to think it was the funniest thing they'd seen this year (that first guy included.)  

A few times I tried to explain that I put my shoes on in the dark, and that most of my shoes are comfortable so I didn't feel the difference.  One coworker replied ""So if there'd been a turd lying there next to your shoe, would you be wearing it now?"" and cracked himself up.

Two guys, who must both be over 50 I believe, when they saw my shoes they started ribbing me and like everyone else I try to laugh it off and maybe explain myself a bit.  I walk away, when one of them says hang on come back.  I figured they had some work thing they needed to talk about but both immediately pulled out smart phones and tried to take pics of my shoes.  I noped on out of there.

Near the end of my workday, after a harrowing time of everyone asking about my shoes and not believing that I could do this by accident, my boss needs to see me in his office.  I'm friendly enough with my boss, he's pretty nice and likable.  He asks me to close the door, and I'm thinking oh dang, he only does that to talk about salary or HR problems.  And I just started so its definitely not salary.  Basically he asks me whats up and I plead my case about it being an honest mistake.  No idea if he believes me, but he says I need to be more careful with my shoes in case I need to talk to a client.  Great.  My boss just told me to make sure my shoes match.  My self esteem is through the roof.  I tell him I'll do him one better and keep a spare pair in my desk.  Feel pretty shitty for the rest of the day.

Hold on, this is where things get complicated.  Fast forward to today, I'm wearing matching shoes AND I have a spare pair in my desk now (get a few sympathetic laughs about that.)  One of the 50-somethings with the phones takes out his phone, and I'm expecting it to be a blurry shot of me walking away yesterday.  Instead it turns out to be a photo of the OTHER 50-something, wearing mismatched shoes.  When was this taken?  Several weeks ago, when I was out doing field testing with these guys.  He said so-and-so put on mismatched shoes specifically to see if I'd notice, and I didn't.  Guardedly, I ask ""how did he know to do that... several weeks ago?""  He replies ""we remembered form the last time you wore mismatched shoes.""

DAMN IT.  I had almost blocked that out.  Yes I remembered that I made this same dumbass mistake with the shoes LAST summer at this company.   But I totally forgot that anyone noticed!  I was a pretty low profile intern then.  So last summer I fucked up with my shoes, and these guys remembered for maybe 8 months and then decided to ""prank"" me by wearing mismatched shoes to see if I'd notice.  Not only did I not notice, I fucked up my shoes again yesterday just several weeks after their ""prank""!  Damn it damn it damn it.

TLDR: I'm an adult with a real job who needs to be told by his boss to wear matching shoes; half the office laughed their asses off."
3a8lyb,3,2015-06-17,Information Technology job security,[deleted],utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/3a8lyb/information_technology_job_security/,"I am going to be a sophomore at UTD, majoring in Information Technology and Systems, and I have been looking at job postings on Indeed.com for business analyst, systems analyst, data analyst, and IT consulting. Mostly all of the entry level jobs require at least 2 to 4 years of relevant work experience with certifications/programming skills.

The reason I am worried about getting a job is because I don't understand how students are able to get enough experience by just doing an internship and the capstone course. 

Did the companies that offer internships give full-time job offers? 

Also I heard employers give more respect and value for someone who has a computer science degree than an IT degree since CS is more technical. Please give me some advice.

I can't join the UTD IPP program offered at the engineering school, because I am majoring in MIS in JSOM."
3a8pcg,1,2015-06-17,"Salary related question, should I negotiate? (Returning Intern)",RotaryRotation,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3a8pcg/salary_related_question_should_i_negotiate/,"Last summer, I was interning at a ~200 person ""startup"" as a Software Engineering intern and was getting paid 20/hour. The company is located in Seattle, and going to school in Seattle, I managed to commit ~20 hours of work per week with the company for rest of the year after the summer. My salary at this point became $25/hour. 

I just wrapped up finals and will be interning this summer at the company once again, but this time, they raised a massive seed round, and have jumped to over ~350 employees. As of this past Tuesday, I have been at this company for a full year, I was wondering if it would make sense to ask about some sort of raise or something along those lines? I have friends off to Google, Amazon, Microsoft who are making $6k a month, so I am not asking for that much, but I was thinking of $30/hour? 

Performance wise, I am confident I have done a great job (as to the reason why they asked me to join on for the summer). My main concern is, I don't want them to think I am hungry or anything, I am the first person in my family to even make over $15/hour so I don't really have anyone strong to ask for guidance. 

My reason for this question is simple, a lot of my friends are going back to their same companies they interned, and they got a higher pay because they returned, I am modeling the same idea based off of this.

I just turned 20 years old and am a rising Junior. 

Appreciate any response to this! "

3a8xyr,8,2015-06-18,Three credits required to graduate in the fall and no internship for the summer. What should I do?,crazeecpe,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3a8xyr/three_credits_required_to_graduate_in_the_fall/,"Hi, Computer Engineer here.

As the title states I'm currently in a situation that is driving me absolutely mad. Last semester I was balancing the final semester of my senior design project, my uni's upper level micro-controller class, upper level FPGA/ASIC class, upper level network security class(I'm most interested in defense and security and this was the closest elective course available), and attempted to take my programs required class on operating systems. Unfortunately, I realized I was extremely overbooked about halfway through the semester and withdrew from the operating systems class. This left me with only three credits necessary for graduation next fall.

Given that I barely had time to even sleep with my schedule last semester I didn't get around to applying to summer internships until very late in the process and wasn't able to attain one. One major obstacle I'm facing in the field of internships is my cumulative and major GPA of 2.85. I struggled for quite a while trying to find exactly why I wanted to be a computer engineer, but this last year I have found my drive. I did manage to score a 3.3 GPA last semester while taking some of the most difficult classes of my program while simultaneously completing my senior design project, which I am extremely proud of.

Sorry for the long intro, but I guess my question is what would be my best course of action now? I live in the Northern Virginia area which is just ripe with employers and I've been applying to every opportunity that has arisen, but like I've said nothing has bitten. In the mean time should I take the FE just to buff up my resume? What is the best course of action to take at this point to get the biggest resume? Certifications that a computer engineer should really have? Sorry If I'm rambling, I'm just lost and looking for a direction.

TL;DR
Have no summer internship and am looking for a way to best help out my resume in the time that I have. "

With all the UNIX-like fanboyism and Mac/Linux hype on CS boards I rarely see Windows mentioned, and it almost seems like people look down upon devs who use Windows as their OS and dev environment.

What's up with that? After using VS and some of the other Microsoft tools for a few weeks I'm certainly impressed by how nice their enterprise software suites are. The VS debugger has been phenomenal (way better than the Xcode debugger IMO), Azure has been a pleasure to work with, Virtualization is pretty damn snappy, and I've had a positive experience learning C#.

It was hard for me to come up with a title for this, but basically, this is what I want to ask (with a rather lengthy preface):

I am going to school at a 2 year college for Web/Computer Programming. So far I have taken courses in: C#, Visual Basic, COBOL (2 courses in it actually), Systems Analysis &amp; Design, and Database programming (SQL).

I only have 12 more credit hours of classes to take (although it will take me 2 semesters because of courses offered). These classes will be: ASP.NET, Microsot I, iOS mobile app development, and Special Studies in Information Technology.

I feel like I'm not even remotely close to ready for a programming job. I do well in all of my classes and my COBOL instructor told me while she was evaluating my final project that I am the most talented programming student she has (We don't have many instructors so she was also my instructor for SQL programming) so I don't think it's just that I'm a crappy programmer.

My real question is: Did any of you feel this way while still in school? Or did you feel like you were completely ready to go after learning the languages in class? If you did feel this way, did you find that once finding a job things just kind of ""fell into place"" and you were more ready than you thought?

I'm sorry if this is confusing. It's hard for me to put into words the way I feel about this lol. I went to the school to look for internships but they had no programming internships available so I took an internship at my local district library running the web page and basically being ""the IT guy"" for the main library and all 7 of it's branches. Before that I worked at the IT help desk at the school. I figured at least some IT experience would be useful instead of just a sales/construction background."

The company is fairly new, about 10 years and is growing pretty quickly. It has a feel similar to a start-up would (flexible hours, work from home, really young group), it is fast paced and very current in healthcare and constantly changing.

Starting the first job and being only there a few weeks would make me feel like a shitty person, but I need to do whats best for me.

I am close to graduating, and they know this. I would like to tell you about my predicament.

So far this position has involved learning on my own about web development (full-stack), working with 3rd party hardware, learning about how radio frequency works, learning how a start-up operates, and learning the business side of products (something I never really considered, but quite fascinating how important understanding the client is). The pay is good enough, but not great. Also no overtime pay, which is disappointing but understandable considering the current business. 

I have been present for a lot of the founders meetings because we share an office together. Hence they trust me hearing in on all their discussions. These founders actually have a network of people who each have their own companies at different stages. 

Now, there are 2 main things I am disappointed about. The fact that I am not getting guidance in software related techniques from peers, and am literally learning everything from internet sources. I feel like compared to my peers this will really hinder me.

The second is that once the project is done and demoed, until further notice there is no more work. Now, I was told of the risk, but also told the founders would try and get me another place to work in the worst case where no investment comes. But this insecurity kind of worries me.  

Now, I admit that I was sold on the founders vision because it seemed really great at the time. Even now I really believe this idea is great and that investment is most likely going to happen. However, I don't know if they see permanent value in me, or are just saying these positive things. A founder was constantly telling me how I am a key part of their future because i have all the knowledge of their system and the future of the company.

I would really appreciate any feedback from everyone here about how much trust I should put in this. Are these guys trying to groom me for the future? "

My FPGA classes in school have been by far the most interesting to me, a large part because they are so flexible in solving many situations.  From what I've seen browsing around various companies that do FPGA work, jobs for them are almost exclusively looking for people who have been working with them for 5+ years.  

Is there a path to breaking into this field via something else?  For example, do most people get hired on doing entry level embedded work and then moving into FPGA design from there?  There's also almost no internships I could find related to exclusively FPGAs to get me some baseline experience.

I'll be a junior next year and am very interesting in this part of CpE and wondering how best to get into it."

Although the intention of this thread is not to review my resume, but I am sharing it as a reference: http://imgur.com/a/JYKq9

I have a friend (who is way worse than me in computer science) who went from an internship in HP last summer to one in Schneider this summer. Although the first one because he had some contacts inside HP and second one at Schneider was likely due to the same reason, I am worried that I am getting left behind even though I am a stronger computer science student.

Me being in a community college, being in the summer of my second year and having a not very high GPA (out of a couple that actually responded positively to me regarding internships, only one asked for the GPA) is already going against me. I fear I am falling behind despite all my efforts. The only company to ever interview me was Microsoft, who conducted 2 interviews with me and then never contacted me again.

At my internship I've I've worked with unix/linux to deploy software to radio towers, some basic IT stuff like cloning hard drives/setting up computers in a lab, I used CIS-CAT Benchmark Assessment Tool for group policy stuff, I know a bit of coding: C++, javascript. I'm currently being trained to troubleshoot radio routers+ talk to field techs at radio sites (my company is currently working on a contract with the FAA), as well as help work on projects with OSSEC and Splunk.

The user submitted a ticket. 

Now you might be asking yourself: Isn't this standard procedure? What makes this so special? Well in this case our user submitted the ticket in the correct category. Before she would submit tickets under: URGENT, IMPORTANT, THE WORLD IS ENDING, however, this time she submitted a ticket under the happy term of REQUEST ASSISTANCE. 


Our happiness was short lived. It seems she did not need assistance from us, but from a literal God of IT. When my leader and I approached her cubical we looked down at the ground in shame. 

There, on the table, lay an open HDD, and a slightly upset user. 

We asked her what caused her to open up her computer and rip out the storage of her PC. She took a good long look at us, shook her head, and looked back at the HDD and said: 'It was rattling'.

She didn't understand why we couldn't fix it."

I'm thinking of going abroad (mostly USA or England) and I would like to find a company where I'd be working as an Intern. The reason for this idea is that if you have experience abroad, you're much more desirable when you apply for a job in certain company, plus I love to travel. I was thinking of being an intern after I graduate (Faculty of computer science), though this is gonna take some time (currently a freshman). 
Some have suggested me to go on Erasmus which is an European (i think) exchange program, but i'm not very interested in that because that is more or less the time to party. If I would go abroad, I want to benefit from it. 
So here come the questions:
1. Does anyone know where could I find myself some roommates and share the flat with them? Any forums of that kind or anything?
2. Are abroad internships a good way? 
3. Are there many internships for foreign students?
4. Do you suggest that I go after I graduate or sooner?

P.S.: I started working (part time) as an Android developer, so by the time i graduate, i'll have some experience, thus being more desirable for internships (i assume)."

Web development seems to be in high demand, and it also seems like your ability to hack and learn is a little more interesting to employers than formal education. Am I looking in the wrong places? Or is my measely knowlege of HTML, CSS, Wordpress and Drupal not enough to be in the game yet? I kind of doubt it, but who knows. 

I'm not trying to make a lot, but would love to work with/for people who are better skilled than me. I've been hired for freelance jobs but its mostly CMS/template work, would love more guidance in getting better at making, rather than modifying that stuff.

A.A.S Comp. Science with Database Concentration
MYSQL, PHP, AJAX, HTML5/CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript. Java. Microsoft office tools (Access, Excel)
Worked on three different website projects, two of which were in a classroom. Created a basic web form from scratch.

I've recently finished all of my classes. Many of which were database related. I'm hoping to land a junior/entry level position doing database or web development work but after looking for about the past month in my area it's been difficult.  

I had an internship last fall doing web development work converting a paper system into an online form. I had interviewed starting last summer with about ten different companies over about five months. A couple of which told me I was rejected just because a better candidate was identified. I now have internship experience, albeit it was unpaid and unfortunately I don't think I can use them as a reference as they wanted me to continue doing work. I did not leave them in any kind of a bind either and saved them money.

I technically graduate this summer only because I missed an ungraded exit exam, but all of my classes are finished and I walked stage. Most of my peers passed the interviews I failed and they have jobs. I suspect it was from lack of experience or low 2.8 GPA at the time.

I'm just trying to figure out what my options are – kind of a “what now?” moment after going five days a week. Obviously I have a little bit of experience and a degree whereas I did not before while going to interviews. The problem is PHP isn't being used in my area much for web development and people are using .NET. I'm not seeing many positions for PHP. I could learn ASP.NET or C# but that would take a specific project idea and time. (I had a class with C#, but it was all basic and mostly involved the visual studio GUI.)

I could wait for a job as I'm living with family and have no immediate financial need but if I do that I want to stay active. I suppose I could also relocate but I have very little funds and it would have to be paid relocation. I have a minimum experience making flash/HTML5 games but that's somewhat unpredictable as far as income goes. I've considered remote jobs but that seems to be for really seasoned developers.

What are my options?

**bold** TL;DR Recent graduate going on about a month and a half unemployed. Hoping for a jr. position doing web/database development but .NET is taking over and I'm experienced with PHP. What are my options? I'm willing to work hard but needing advice.

I live in the Knoxville / Oak Ridge Tennessee area."

So I finished my first year of EE in April (with a less than stellar GPA (3.12/4.33) but that's not the focus of this post). I completely failed at getting an internship this summer (Only managed to get 1 interview, 2 looked at my resume but ""have chosen to pursue other candidates"", and the rest did not respond).

So my hope/dream was to have an internship and/or research experience every summer giving me 3 work experiences before I graduate.(Ideally want to get hired full time right out of school if I choose to go straight into the workforce #BayAreaismydream). (If I choose to attend grad school which I most likely will then that gives me another summer to work).

But here I am one summer gone with no internship (Definitely not from a lack of trying).

So my question is did I miss the boat on trying to setup an ideal career path/future? Maybe my ambitions are greater than what I'm capable of and I need to accept that.

(it's long but please, (if you have time) take a read)",rosiexox,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3ad54y/im_so_stressed_everythings_changing_and_im/,"there's a lot of things keeping me up at night and preventing me from accomplishing my goals/tasks. for example, i was supposed to start reading my accounting textbook, send some emails, do yoga but i got a call from my mom at around 6pm when i got home asking me roughly what what day i'll be able to find a place for myself after my mom and dad move to a different province.  that brings me back to issues that i keep thinking about.

#1) my parents moving to another province.

i'm 20 years old and i accept that they want to move to another province where my older brother recently moved to. but then on the other hand, something creeps up and gets me really emotional realizing that i've lived with my parents all my life and that living without them-not even near my proximity gets me into a crying mess usually when i'm trying to go to sleep at night. i'm such a baby aren't i? 

#2) where will i move? (anxiousness, nostalgia, depression)
i know that i have to stay in my current area because i'm in my last year of university and am looking for a place preferably downtown. i'm excited for that new experience but am sad that my parents want to sell our house of 12 years. not to mention that it's in a great location in Toronto and personally, i wouldn't want to give it up. but when they leave, i don't think even i could handle being in the house all by myself. they're not selling it until i find a place but they're leaving in less than a month. i just get so anxious and nostalgic about my house, the whole city in general and not having my parents around because i've practically lived there all my life with them(ugh i'm crying just typing this out)..

#3) balancing school + work life
i currently started a paid internship and previous to starting the job, i took 3 online courses and dropped them all because i couldn't handle doing both. but i am starting an in class course in 5 days because it's a mandatory course that i need to take in order to graduate which hopefully goes well. but it's hard working 9-5 and having time for anything else. 

#4) i'm not happy with myself
i'm not at my goal weight and gained back the weight that i recently lost due to stress eating and whatnot like going out to eat with coworkers. i'm constantly stuck between wanting to get to know/meet more people and then just wanting to hide away on some days and just having feelings of inferiority. i want to start biking to work but after one incident last year after my tire getting stuck in the streetcar tracks, i've been hesitant. i'm on day 4 of this yoga challenge I've already ate badly today. overall in the future, i want my bike to be my main method of transportation so that i can save money.

#5) feeling so detached/different from my long-time bff
she's 20 years old like me but the thing is, she's never had a job and can't wrap her head around growing up or even dressing somewhat appropriately. (i know i'm horrible for judging but the last time we hung out, i was dressed professionally and when i was with her, i felt like i was with my younger cousin or something). for my birthday last year, the dress code was a dress and she didn't follow it. i just felt like she didn't care at all and it made me sad that she and my other friends from uni didn't get on well.  she's not ambitious, always reading fan fiction but we always seem to find common ground when we catch up. i can always count on her to hang out and watch movies. although she did accomplish growing some magic shrooms.

#6) i want to start living a minimalistic life + fashion lifestyle (only owning 33 items of clothing)
i have so much items in my room and when the time comes for me to move out, i don't want to have too many baggage. 

how i'm coping thus far: avoiding what i need to do, eating, and using asmr (relaxation) videos everyday to keep me calm and put me to bed. i can't go on like this.

3adllf,5,2015-06-19,Thinking of Taking my Fourth Year Off To Work,Desperate_undergrade,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3adllf/thinking_of_taking_my_fourth_year_off_to_work/,"I just finished my third year of chemical engineering and after applying to around 100 internships, I've gotten no callbacks or offers or interviews from anyone. I've also dealt with depression and anxiety my third year and I feel like no matter what I do or did I couldn't get the grades I wanted (3.0 and above GPA) during the school year. I've also heard that it's 10 times easier to get an internship during the school year than during the summer because there are more vacancies. Right now, I feel absolutely burned out from school and I hate my classmates and many of my professors.

Is it recommended I take next year off to work at an internship/co-op? How much easier is it to get an internship somewhere? I'm trying to get something related to my major but the job market is skewed towards EE/CE/CS/ME jobs. 

Edit: I'm just extremely angry that because I spent so much time and effort applying to internships, I didn't spend as much time in my schoolwork as I should have and so my grades dropped. But then I still didn't manage to get an internship and because of my lowered grades, it's going to be harder for me to find work in the future. It's the worst catch-22. 

It's kind of like the other day when I was at a bus stop and my bus was 15 minutes late. I decided to walk to another bus stop just when the previous bus I was waiting for arrived. I then ran frantically back, trying to get the driver's attention, but he left without me. But then the second bus I was walking to arrived and left without me, so I was stuck there waiting for an hour for another bus to come."

I am an intern for the community development division of a medium sized city.  A project they have assigned to me is taking a list of affordable housing projects in the city (about 500) and making an online map that displays all the housing projects with dots or icons. They want information bubbles to pop up when the dots are scrolled over with a cursor. It would also be great if these bubbles gave the option to edit the information right there, but editing through a database would be just as good. Being able to display dots based on certain criteria (two family and under only, handicapped accessible, etc) would also be a great feature

Some GIS professionals and professors I have consulted with suggested looking into getting access to an organizational template for the the city. Some think it can be simply done with ArcMap online. Others have said that I should look into learning how to use leaflet. What do you all think?  If this was your project how would you approach it? I have an excel spreadsheet of the affordable projects with some details on each.  I'd like to make a good product but not spend more than a couple weeks putting it together because they would like me to move on to other things. 

Thank you all so much. "
3af0rs,1,2015-06-19,"Getting micromanaged by my supervisor, complete freedom and respect from my boss.",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3af0rs/getting_micromanaged_by_my_supervisor_complete/,"So I got my first internship this summer, and I couldn't be more thankful for the opportunity. Really, it's a lesson in learning to be a better software engineer...and dealing with bureaucracy. 

The structure of my internship is that I have a supervisor, a young graduate student that has worked at the company before, and a boss. We work on 8 different teams on projects each designed by one of 8 bosses. Our supervisor checks our work before it is sent to the boss (to avoid any embarrassing, poor-quality submissions), and our boss tells us if our projects are meeting his needs. 

And man, our boss is great. He gave us complete freedom on our project, and he said our proposal ""exceeded his expectations."" It's going to involve machine learning and data mining. Our proposal intelligent, experienced, and really interested in teaching us. 

I was voted project manager, and my team is fantastic. The administration is also great. 

And then there's our supervisor. The graduate student. The relentlessly condescending man who's ruining what would otherwise be a 10/10 experience.

He told us to reply to all emails within two hours. All of his emails are several pages. We once asked for some resources on how to use one of the computational tools in our company and he told us that our email was unprofessional because we should have googled it first. We were asked to submit a “GENERAL” proposal of our project to our boss by the end of this week. It was done last week on Tuesday. It's now Friday night and our proposal has not been approved by our supervisor (which means we can't email our boss yet) because we forgot to capitalize the c in C++. Yes it’s an error, but this our tenth revision. It got sent back at one point because we said we were going to use a piece of software to rip data from the internet, run an algorithm on it, and get our results. Instead, he insisted that we instead rip the data, store it on dropbox, then run the algorithm. Also, every time we write in our schedule that we’re coding something, it must be followed with “error check and comment the code.” We know this, obviously, but he wants it written. I don’t even necessarily disagree with his suggestions. But to put it in perspective, our proposal was supposed to be 2-4 pages. At first, it was 3. It’s now 8. After 6 revisions, he finally approved the content. Since then, we’ve been correcting grammar to his liking. And that means if I write an equation, I have to put it on a new line with a colon on the previous line. I feel like my eyes are going to bleed again if I read it again, and every time he tells us that we need to read “every letter, every word” before we send it to him again. But he won’t correct it himself, he’ll say “look through it again. there are errors in sections x, y, and z.

And we just got an email at 11 PM today (Friday here), that he can check our revisions tomorrow. This is driving me insane. Our group members are freaking out and asking me if they need to cancel their weekend plans. I told them no, but I have no idea how that will turn out.

He said in a recent email. “If I can’t trust you to have an error-free document, how can I trust you to code without supervision.” My blood ran cold when I read that. He’s already slicing our productivity in half, and already I see him standing over my shoulder to read every comment.

Part of me thought it was just me, but I asked other groups. They all said that their boss has given them more stringent demands, but their proposals were done after one week and their supervisors only corrected grammar and sent it back once. Besides that, they only intervened when asked for help. Now I’m worrying he will hinder our performance. We’re already ahead of schedule programming, but this stupid bureaucratic BS is taking excessively long because of him, and our boss said he’s just planning to scan it. Now our supervisor is threatening our code too. 

Part of me wants to ask HR. Part of me wants to talk to my boss. Part of me thinks I would just look bad by complaining. 

tl;dr Awesome internship and boss. Micromanaging, condescending supervisor. What do?"

3afhox,0,2015-06-19,Is getting a Master's degree a good idea for me?,livesareatstake,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/3afhox/is_getting_a_masters_degree_a_good_idea_for_me/,"I've been dwelling on this topic a lot lately, as I'm starting my last semester of Computer Engineering in September. Eventually, I want to work in IT security, with the main goal of becoming a pentester. And one thing I'm sure of is that I don't want to get into academics.

People I've talked to about it have differing opinions. I have a couple of professors who always state that your formal education in IT doesn't matter, the only thing that matters is what you can do. There are also some who recommend pursuing a Master's degree as you can dive into the topics more, and get a more detailed perspective on them.

From what I've seen in previous posts about this topic, the consensus seems to be that real word experience&gt;certifications&gt;Master's degree.

However, I still want to ask you for your advice because my case is a little different. For one, I live in Europe and I don't have to worry about tuition, which seems to be the biggest reason why people don't recommend doing it: it wouldn't be worth paying that much for. On the other hand, some of the certs I see recommended around here are either unavailable here or too expensive for me. 

The IT security Master's degree I'm looking at seems to have a pretty interesting curriculum, it's not one of those management oriented degrees. It would also be at one of my country's most respected universities, which has great connections with big tech companies and has pretty good internship programmes. The university I'm attending right now isn't that well regarded. I mean, it's not horrible, but graduates form the other university generally are much better sought after on the job market. Also, from what I know, having a Master's degree makes it easier to get a job abroad, which I eventually want to do. 

On the other hand, there are a couple of up and coming tech firms in my area that are growing rapidly right now, and there aren't enough graduates for them to hire. I'm pretty sure I'd be able to find a junior level job at one of them pretty soon after I graduate. I already had an opportunity to go work for one of them but it would have been a full time job, so I had to turn it down. They also send their employees on day release courses to get certs regularly, which would be a good way to obtain some necessary certs for free. I'm also worried that their expansion will slow down by the time I would be done with my Master's and it would be harder to get a job.

I really can't make up my mind. As far as I know, after finishing a Master's degree with close to zero professional experience, I'd be eligible for the same junior level positions I'm gonna be eligible for after finishing my Bachelor's, and the 2 year work experience would look better on my resumé than a Master's with no experience. Also, not sure if this is a thing anywhere else, but here you have to be paid a certain wage for a certain level of education and you can become overqualified for jobs as companies look for the people who they can get away with paying the least to. I've heard of people taking their degrees off of their resumés for this reason, although not in the tech industry.

Also, do you think it would be a good idea to cross-post this to /r/netsec? I was reluctant to post there because they have ""Use /r/AskNetsec for questions."" in their sidebar, but I would like as many arguments as I can get, to make a more informed decision and that sub has a lot more users."

So I have some questions for you experienced folk. On Tuesday, I have an interview at one of the big 4 music labels/conglomerates, and I need to nail this interview. This is the first and only interview I've received, and only got it through a connection. 

So I just graduated college last May, and I'm currently interning in the field I want to go into (marketing), but not the industry. My interview is with the director or talent acquisition, so it isn't an interview for a specific job. 

So I guess it comes down to a couple of things... 

* How do I communicate properly that I know what I want to do and the path I want to follow, but I'm willing to work anywhere to get my foot in the door? 

* I don't have all that much on my resume right now... I mean I spent years working at a summer camp and getting promoted there, and I have 2 internships on my resume (one in music that fell apart, one I'm doing now). So how do I make myself stand out and show my passion?

* When asked do I have any questions, I usually ask ""what have people who have been in my position moved on to do?"" but I am not interviewing for a specific position. So what should I ask?

* What are the chances I am asked about an expected salary in this first interview, and how do I answer that?

* Most importantly, how do I not bomb this thing? I've had jobs and internships, but none of them required interviews. The few things I have interviewed for never went beyond that interview. So how can I make sure that I am offered some kind of job at this company or one of their subsidiaries? How do I blow away my interviewer?

* Hand written or email thank you note after the fact?

Please, give me all the advice you can. This is the first interview I've landed after applying for countless jobs all over the music industry. I'm desperate to get a second interview or an offer or something.

Thanks!"

I really want to get a job at microsoft.
I graduated this last december and have been working as a software engineer since then at a defense contractor. 

The job I have now is ok, but I feel that I could do better in a job where I am challenged more. The work 70% java desktop apps and 30% C/C++ (usually as components of the java apps).

I had one internship and a part time dev job during school.

Basically, what should I be doing to meet my goal of getting a job there?

Here is what I am doing Right to improve myself

- I have been working on building on an android app for the last few months.

- I like solving problems on hackerrank.

2 things I'm wondering are:

- Should my side projects be done using microsoft technologies? I have a little bit of .NET (C# and VB) experience, but I would say 90% of my expertise is in Java.

- When should I apply? Since I have only been at this job for 6 months.


Thanks

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Play current games (mostly DOTA2) at 144fps (1080p), fast PC for software development / some video editing.


**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I wanted to do 4k with a high frame rate, but I don't think that the technology is there yet. I'm content with 1080p for now, as long as I can get &gt;120fps consistently for DOTA2 on all high settings. I'd also like to casually play new games at higher FPS, maybe on a 4k TV.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**


Was budgeting about $2000...but went way over to about $2500. OK to spend a bit more though at this point.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

United States

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I'm in computer science and I'll be starting a PhD this fall, and I'll likely be doing information retrieval. I've wanted to build a monster gaming rig for the past 15 years now, but never had the money to do so. I got my first internship this summer, and since I'm getting paid quite well and have no debt, I figured I could afford it. I did a lot of research, and though I didn't want to spend so much, I tried to get really good components and I ended up spending a lot more than I anticipated.

I'm planning on upgrading the ram to 64GB or 128GB (if 16GB sticks become cheaper) sometime in the next year so I can use a RAMDisk to work with large amounts of text/database data quickly. I'm not really sure how feasible that is. This was one of the reasons why I didn't just go for the 4790k (only 32GB allowed on Mobo). I was also able to get the processor half off by buying it through my work.

I think everything should work well together, and all the parts should fit. This is my second time building a computer, but the last one I built several years ago only to learn, and only spent around $280 so I didn't have a whole lot to think about. 

I'm planning on attaching the CPU cooler to the top of the case, and I'd like to overclock my CPU and GPU as long as the power consumption and noise doesn't get too high. 

I've ordered everything, but I can still return things if it means a significant improvement. Since I already spent so much, should I have gotten a better motherboard? Do I have enough cooling? Are there any parts I'm missing / anything to keep in mind?

I'm really excited to build this and give it a go, and I'd appreciate any input beforehand."
3ajtau,12,2015-06-20,"Astrophysics major, +1 year in a failed startup, looking for a stable programming job, where to start?",Hi_Im_bob___,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3ajtau/astrophysics_major_1_year_in_a_failed_startup/,"Greetings,

I was an astrophysics major ('14) and in my first year, I took the risk of participating in a business startup that failed over a year. I was the manager and headed the company for HR, but due to unforeseen circumstances with my partners and the nature of the business, it folded in few months time. I learned many things, including how to build a website, mechanical engineering skills, finite element analysis, sales generation, and marketing, but it was really too much for one person to handle for such a short time that I was extremely frustrated by their lack of output to put ourselves out there for a good product while they just moved onto to do something else.

Anyways, I am currently learning programming to see if I can break in, and I don't know how I'd do. I barely know C++ and Javascript through CodeAcademy, with some basics down flat in Python, but I'm concerned about how I'll look infront of future employers. 

I'd like to get into a stable, long-term programming job with possibility of growth and so far I like what I'm learning, but I need a job by the time August rolls around. What kind of projects can I commit to look better for presentation? Should I design an app I have in mind, should i get a certificate, and how should my astrophysics major part play up? I did well in my advanced courses in the later years, but the few years prior to that I struggled with many low grades and emotional problems. 

I thought about going through internship if I had to, but I'm hoping to find some companies out there that can ""guide"" me up. If geographical location helps narrow down the search, I live in Minneapolis. 

Thanks in advance, looking forward to the responses soon."

3alcdr,9,2015-06-21,NYPD Homicide report #S0015678,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3alcdr/nypd_homicide_report_s0015678/,"	
God I’m tired. I am so tired. All I want to do is crawl into a ball and sob on the floor. My head buzzes and my nose is blocked beyond belief. Breathing through my mouth for the last 10 hours has made my breath smell awful, and my mouth taste even worse. I’ve drunk about 6 half-litre energy drinks in the last 8 hours, and I flip between feeling energised and crashing so hard my vision goes blurry. The quite untraceable hum of god-knows-what in every office has become the sound of millions of swarming locusts. I hate this office so much. All I want to do is leave. 

I’m not allowed to though. I still have at least 5 hours of work to do, if I want a full time position at this company, I have to be the best of the interns. I have to want it. The last intern left 3 hours ago, didn’t want it bad enough I suppose. I do. The work they wanted me to do was finished 2 hours ago, what I’m doing now is far and beyond what I was meant to, but I want it. My family needs me to get this job, the image of me going back to our dingy apartment, seeing the five disappointed faces of my mum, grandma and three brothers when  I tell them I didn’t get the job would kill me. 

I have to pee, I’ve had to pee every 20 minutes for the last….the last? I’m not sure, I lost track of time a few hours ago, and my eyes are to unfocused to make out the numbers in the bottom left corner of my computer that will tell me. On the walk to the bathroom I try and take in my surroundings to stay focused. The harsh neon lighting, blinding in the dark of the deep night. The city outside may be beautiful, but I can’t focus, all it seems is a bunch of lights.  This office is so boring, on the floor, ordinary carpet, the type that burned you as a kid when you slid on it. I look at people’s desks, computers, papers, the odd collectible here and there, this is meant to be a “fun” workplace. Big windows, a good view across New York, that’s what you get when you’re a fortune 500 company. The fact no one else is working this late surprises me, surely there’s some other poor soul grinding his guts out here. I know I’m alone, the janitor handed me the keys when he left for the night. 

Shaking my wet hands as I exit the bathrooms, I feel a little better. The water I splashed on my face helped me wake up a bit. It was really cold though, and I feel a little shivery as I leave, nervous almost. Really nervous actually, my hands are shaking. This office is making me bug out a little bit, a lot to be honest. I take a few deep breaths and remind myself not to be ridiculous. My chair makes a pleasant squeaking noise as I sit in it, and it distracts me. After a few minutes of editing a spreadsheet about god knows what I look up. There’s a man in the corner. My pulse skyrockets and I want to be sick. There is a man in the corner, in an office that is locked, and occupied by only me. He’s about six foot tall, clad in mostly black, and a pair of weirdly elegant brown gloves. I have to be imagining it, rub your eyes Jason, sleep deprivation causes hallucinations you know that. I close my eyes, rub them and open them again. He’s gone. Of course he is, a powerful current of relief surges through me, there is no one hear of course, but it’s hardly surprising I would think there was. This building creaks and groans and makes all kind of noises that sound like people. 

The printer whirrs as it spits out performance reports, it’s been roughly an hour since I saw the man. Although I’m sure it was a hallucination, I can’t shake it totally. I remember the time some kids at camp showed me the exorcist when I was seven. My mother couldn’t get me to sleep for an entire week. Chuckling at the memory, I turn back to the main office. He’s there again. Oh Jesus he’s there again. I spasm with fear and begin trembling. He’s making a hissing noise that sets my hairs standing up. A gloved finger creeps up his body, and come to rest at his lips, making a shhhh gesture. I thought it was a man, but I’m less sure now, it seems to have gotten taller since the last time I saw it, and less human. Its body is disturbingly arranged, elbows at odd angles, physical geometry all wrong. I rub my eyes again, trying to convince myself it’s a hallucination. I open them again and it’s still there, back turned to me and walking away. 

In a state of uncontrollable panic, I wheel on my foot and run to the door, it’s locked, the keys are in my desk. I sprint back there. The drawer is empty. My phone makes a dull beep as the out of battery symbol flashes. My last lifeline gone. There is nothing left to do, I’m trapped in here with whatever it is. I’m crying, I realise as my breathing becomes rhythmic hyperventilation. I lay down on the floor and sob, howling as utter animalistic fear overcomes me.
 In the artificial glare of neon lighting, Jason Alexander Peterson realises he is going to die. Or does he? An idea has occurred to Jason, and an expression of determination has become lodged on his face.

 I stand up and rifle through my desk, and grasp what it is I need. I pull myself up and draw a breath. “Come and get it boy” I scream into the eyrie silence of the office. “Come on then, I’m ready” my voice breaks halfway through the ready. I don’t care all I need is for it to come over. It delivers, hissing still. As it rounds the corner, I collapse to the ground, trying to make it look natural. This aggravates it, I crosses the rest of the room with terrifying speed, coming to a stop. I let out a whimper, intriguing it. The awful scarred face leans in closer to mine, right next to my ear. It gently drifts over till its right above my mouth, and extends it translucent, pulsating lounge. I fight the urge to scream as it forces its tongue into my mouth, the taste of decay and rot making me sick, the hissing noise is a thousand times louder now, like a kettle being tortured. The time is now, its body is right above me. The scissors slide out my pocket, and fly through the air into the creature’s chest. I drive them deep, ignoring the hideous crackling noise, it’s like stabbing a pile of leaf litter. The creature howls, an awful, ugly sound. Taking the advantage, I stab again and again, each time more aggressively. The creature has rallied however, and is pushing me off it. It wrenches the scissors out of my hands and plunged them into me stomach. The pain is blinding, and I roll of. The burst seems to have exhausted it however, as it collapses next to me. My shirt is slick with blood and I feel cold.  

As he dies, Jason Alexander Peterson thinks of three things. His family, in their dingy apartment, being turned out by the landlord because he couldn’t support them. Those stupid kids that showed him the Exorcist on camp. He also thinks of the fact that very few people will care that he’s dead. He could think of 20 at most, but he can’t because he’s dying. He is found by a colleague at 6:37 AM on Wednesday the 27th of June 2016. 

****************************************************
 NYPD Incident report
Pertaining to the events of: the evening of Tuesday the 26th June 2016 and the morning of Wednesday the 27th of June 2016

Event/occurrence: Homicide

Victim(s): Garcia, Fernando Joseph

Perpetrator(s): Peterson, Jason Alexander

Incident location: 227 24th street New York, offices of Gordon and Robinson stock trading 

Incident description: *NOTE* account based upon security camera footage viewed by Officer Lopez attached to the homicide department *NOTE* 

Peterson had been exhibiting unusual behaviour leading up until 11:38 in the evening, mostly twitching, and talking to himself, he was however, functioning fairly normally in terms of working and regular trips to the bathroom. However, at 11:38 he became very alarmed at the sight of his colleague Fernando Joseph Garcia using the printer in the office. At this point his behaviour became extremely unusual. He stood on the spot for five minutes, convulsing, believed to be the first obvious signs of a major psychotic episode by the coroner. After this, he used the keys the janitor of the floor had given him to lock himself and Garcia inside the building. He then proceeded to sit at his desk another two hours, absolutely still. As Garcia was working around the corner from Peterson, and the two barely knew each other according to colleagues, this unusual behaviour was not noticed. When Garcia went to exit the building, at 1:42 AM Peterson began screaming at his desk. Severely frightened at the prospect of being locked in with Peterson, who’s behaviour was extremely unnerving, Garcia attempted to smash down the door. After a few unsuccessful attempts Garcia confronted his colleague. Asking him where the keys where, and demanding and explanation for his behaviour. After this, Peterson lay down on the floor, and began to scratch his arms until they bled. Terrified by now, Garcia ran over to his colleague and attempted to talk to him. At this point, Peterson attacked Garcia with a pair of scissors he had in his pockets, stabbing him 3 times in the chest. After a struggle, Garcia stabbed Peterson in the stomach, then fainted due to blood loss, dying shortly after. Peterson also died of blood loss. 

Conclusion: According to the coroner, Peterson suffered a psychotic episode brought on by stress and sleep deprivation. When interviewed, his mother told Officer Lopez, he had a fear of monsters, and used to suffer occasional night terrors in which he became convinced members of his family were trying to attack him. Even once injuring his brother, Tom, with a stapler when he was 12. She never reported it however, as she couldn’t afford for him to see a doctor. These episodes began after he was shown the film, the exorcist, on a camp when he was seven. His behaviour on 26th and 27th of June was attributed as an extreme continuation of these episodes. He most likely saw Garcia as some sort of monster, and attacked him with the scissors in self-defence. An inquiry into the workloads of the interns of Gordon and Robinson trading, as well as several other companies has been launched in order to ensure their employee’s wellbeing is being protected.

3alvid,2,2015-06-21,Good friend passed away and a mutual friend seems to just not get it...,Lord_dokodo,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/3alvid/good_friend_passed_away_and_a_mutual_friend_seems/,"I'm sitting here just thinking about all this.  It happened last night, a freak jetski accident.  Another mutual friend is actually looking to lose a lot as well but it also resulted in the death of one of my good friends.  

I'm in a fraternity and my roommates are all brothers.  One of them, historically a stupid motherfucker, comes in last night drunk as shit and bellows out, ""DUDE DO YOU KNOW [blank] IS DEAD"" in this almost yelling voice.  He knows we are all in a facebook group/group text but he comes in and says this because I've come to realize at this point that he will bring up past conversation topics or a hot topic just so he can be a part of a conversation with the rest of the group.  He also does it because he wants to be noticed and is a total fucking attention whore who would die without being in the spotlight.

So after I respond, ""Yes, [dumbass] I am well aware of this happening, it wasn't just posted all over our facebook wall or anything."" I said it pretty coldly so I'm sure he got the message.

Fast forward this morning and I just got off the phone with [blank's] best friend that have known each other since childhood.  I texted him last night when they announced it, but I gave him a call this morning.  He is under the impression that this is a huge and cruel joke and that we are all messing with him and it was not fun to have to tell him that I wish I was kidding but I'm really not.

Then [dumbass] walks in and LITERALLY SAYS THE EXACT SAME THING IN THE EXACT SAME TONE.  At this point, I've about had it with his mundane and pretentious shit so I told him that ""YES [DUMBASS] I AM IN THIS GROUPME AND I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.  STOP BRINGING IT UP LIKE ITS A FUCKING JOKE."" 

Then he proceeds to call me an asshole for not wanting to talk to him.  This guy is literally like a 5 year old child in a 300 lb body and has not a single clue about how social interactions work.  He doesn't even walk in and say ""morning"" or anything.  Almost with a grin on his face, he walks in and says ""DUDE DO YOU KNOW [BLANK] IS DEAD"" almost peeing himself with excitement at my response.  This guy gets off from leading conversations but when you really look how he starts his conversations, it's really just recycled bullshit from conversations 2 weeks prior.  He'll bring up an old conversation topic during quiet moments just so people will be talking again.  I can't really put to words how annoying this can be, but after being around it and noticing what he's doing for the past 6 months, it's made me quite sour.  Now, to top it off, one of my good friends died and this dumb hulking motherfucker prances around asking me if I fucking knew when he definitely knew that I knew just so he could have an excuse to say something to me. 


tl;dr if you don't have something smart or productive to say, just keep your god damn mouth shut because when you say things for the sake of saying things, then 90% of the time, people will see your bullshit and cringe and think you are a dumb socially inept moron.


____________________________________

Re-reading this and it kind of sounds ambiguous.  Let me expand:  

This is the guy at every party who says they just killed a handle of alcohol and threw in 5-6 beers while they were at it (I am half his weight and have gone shot for shot with him and barely lost--there is not a chance in hell that he can finish an entire 1.5L of alcohol.  he got drunk as piss after 8 shots but when no one can verify, he will walk around with an empty handle just so he can tell people that he drank it all)

He is also the guy who says he gets only with 7-8s but never sees him with a girl and his past ex girlfriends are usually around 4-5s.

He is also the guy who gets a summer internship and makes a little money and pretends like he is a CEO of goldman sachs and just cashed in a $5 million check.  

He is also the guy who brags about all of his connections but when you really dig deep into those ""connections"" they are really just him knowing ABOUT someone else, not actually knowing them, and really aren't a connection afterall.

These are not analogies, they are ANECDOTES.  He has done all of this shit in the past and continues to do so I don't know why he is in my life but I am about done with him and, in retrospect, having him in my life has only put on more stress than relief.

This guy is the epitome of try hard and I am quite an observant person, especially when I choose to, and I have noticed that this guy is truly deep down just a piece of shit that wants acceptance from others but never will because of his stupid attitude and his tryhard personality.  A blind person could see how hard he tries (and fails).  A fucking dead person could see it.



Nothing will top off this.  Everytime he approaches me and starts this conversation, I know I'm going to be mad as hell by the end of it.  He recently started to invest using RobinHood, which allows beginners to get started with as little/much cash as they want.  He knows like 5 technical analysis methods but he acts like hes the fucking stock broker of 2015 and will come up to me EVERYDAY telling me to invest in some shit 50m market cap stock.  I humor him and ask him why he thinks i should buy in and he proceeds to give me some elementary 10 year old version of why I should buy that stock ( I think a 10-year old could convince me better than him).  He tells me its because of so and so and just hearing him talk automatically makes it clear that he has no idea what he is talking about.  

So I tell him, well I'm not sure I'm very convinced and I usually lie about not having any freed money.  Basically his investment strategy is to randomly choose some company that he heard about on CNBC and then buy it everyday and sell it everyday.  He has picked up GEVO on about 8-10 different occasions and ALWAYS brags about his earnings but I can tell when hes had a bad day cause he won't come in and say anything to me.  But if I prod him about it, I'll learn that he just lost $25 on GEVO.  But then he turns around and says to other people ""that he's made some decent money off investing so far"".  He also uses his $1000 balance on his portfolio as a bragging chip, which isnt really that impressive.  The average person makes that money in like a week."
3amedz,33,2015-06-21,"29 year old 2nd bachelors CS student, some questions about finding an internship",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3amedz/29_year_old_2nd_bachelors_cs_student_some/,"I'm 29 years old and currently just about halfway through the Oregon State post-bacc program. I'm eager to start applying for internships and have been working my way through Cracking the Coding Interview. 

I live in a small city in a southern state that isn't exactly known for its tech sector. I'm most likely going to have to relocate to find anything and, to be honest, I'm pretty eager to get out of here. I'm not necessarily looking to move to one of the coasts (though I'm certainly open to that), so I'm fine with major cities closer to my current region, and I don't really care about working at a big name company at all.

How likely am I to be able to find an internship out of state? Obviously I'd like to have my relocation paid for but if that's not very realistic I can move myself out of pocket. 

I know I've completely missed the boat for 2015 summer internships but how common are internships that don't start during the summer? Ideally I'd like to be starting something any time from August to January but I can wait until next summer (when I'll be finishing up my degree) if I don't find anything.

Is the fact that I'm a former English major pushing 30 going to hold me back? I've done really well so far and I think I could handle most of the interview questions/tasks that I've read about but it kind of scares me that I'm going to be competing with people nearly a decade younger.

I've had one phone interview that didn't go so well, mostly because I wasn't really prepared for it. The biggest issue the interviewer seemed to have was that I was doing a second bachelors instead of a masters. He kept asking me why I didn't just skip straight to the masters and didn't seem to like my explanations. Is this going to be a common occurrence?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm mostly worried about finding a way to get myself an internship out of state so if anyone has any experience with that I'd love to hear about it."
3amoqk,27,2015-06-21,Two Steps Past Tomorrow - Interlude #1,[deleted],HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3amoqk/two_steps_past_tomorrow_interlude_1/,"Excerpted from *Full Speed Ahead*, Science NOW! magazine:

Light, as everyone who has ever watched an episode of *Cosmos* knows, is the fastest thing in the universe. But given the enormous size of the universe, even something zippy as light is agonizingly slow. For example, a single photon traveling at 186,000 miles a *second* takes just over 8 minutes to cross the distance between the Sun and the Earth. Photons and their brethren can only do this because they exist in the realm of subatomic particles with zero mass. Trying to accelerate anything larger - say, a space ship weighing several kilotons - to that speed would take more energy than several Suns could ever produce in their lifetime.

But assume for a moment you could accelerate your ship to light speed to cruise the interstellar medium. Stopping would be a problem. As the saying goes, it’s not the fall that kills you, it’s the sudden stop at the end. And in this case, also killing everything else that happened to be in the general vicinity as the shockwave from your travels kept going, crashing into whatever planet you were planning on visiting. Sort of like your cousin Benny who stayed for that one weekend and set fire to the couch, blaming it on the cat who never liked Benny in the first place.

While physics says that *matter* cannot exceed the universal speed limit, it doesn’t say anything about *information* - which is how quantum dot technology works. These amazing things can now be found in a variety of products, sidestepping the rules by existing in a kind of ghostly ‘twin’ phase, two identical particles maintaining the same energy states at all time, no matter how far apart they might be. Einstein rightfully called quantum mechanics “spooky action at a distance,” and his words have never been more true. Combine these ‘q-dots’ in the right way, and you have an effective wireless power transmission to and from anywhere on or off the globe - the holy grail Nikola Tesla had been searching for just before his death.

If you pack enough of them in the right configuration, apply the right amount of energy at exactly the right time (among other things), you can not just sidestep the rules, you can duck out for a quick smoke before anyone notices. As long as you take the proper precautions, of course.

Otherwise you’re going to need a towel or two to clean up the mess.

Much of our modern world owes its very lifeblood to Nikola Tesla and his intuitive understanding of electricity. Many say that he was a man out of time, his genius so far beyond his peers that he had difficulty interacting with the mundane world, resulting in much of his work being lost. We should consider ourselves lucky that this time around when another Serbian genius ushers in a new era, that he is far removed from the reclusive tendencies of his predecessor.

Zoran Nikolajević looks like he should be playing violin while conducting a full orchestra. Instead, we are standing in front of a chalkboard as he explains his theory and how it makes space travel not just possible, but practical. It takes some effort - Zoran is a demonstrative Serbian, prone to slipping into his native language and shouting, excited about his work.

And he has good reason to be excited. The Z-Drive (don’t call it a warp drive to his face unless you like to be cursed at in multiple languages) promises to open up the universe, bringing untold wonders to our doorstep. Or untold dangers, depending on who you listen to. Indeed, the former superpowers - America, China, Russia, along with their allies - are each planning space navies just in case the next alien race we meet are not nearly as friendly as the Dulutewae.

A century of speculative fiction has reinforced the concept of aliens being the aggressors, coming to steal our resources (or women, or brains, depending on the story), or just wiping us out and moving right in. Most of these movies are reflections of our own history as conquerors, subjugating the natives to take their land or resources (brains we leave to daytime TV). More recently, fiction has taken the opposite approach, portraying Humans as the invading army in search of rare minerals that let us maintain our way of life. Given what we know of other alien life forms and cultures from our Dulutewae guests, the latter seems the more likely scenario. If so, then it will be aliens who tremble in fear as the armored boot of the Human race stomps across the face of the galaxy.

The truth, however, may lay somewhere in between. The universe, as we have found by peering deep into the inky blackness with generations of telescopes, is mind-boggling huge filled with infinite wonder. It is almost a given that there are lots of resources and planets to go around, some of them with life forms that may bring something new to the table.

As long as we don’t run into something worse than ourselves.

---

The inventor of the Z-Drive (or Z-Gate, depending on who you talk to) cheerfully admits that he got part of his theory from a children’s television show that debuted in 1963. The iconic blue box of BBC’s *Doctor Who* has groaned its way through more than a dozen lead actors and a thousand adventures. Along the way, it has acquired its own fan base separate from the show, legions of fans postulating elaborate theories on how it works.

Zoran is not one of those fans.

“Oh good lord no,” he chuckles. “I never watch TV. An intern mentioned it and the name struck a chord. It occurred to me that certain dimensional theories could hold the key to rapid travel. We already know that faster than light travel is possible,” he adds, referring to the *Jewel of Paxs’wan’l* that brought the Dulutewae here. “The trick was figuring out how to keep things from falling apart.”

Falling apart, indeed. It turns out that ignoring the laws of physics is not without cost. Moving from point A to point B in an instant requires the use of alternate dimensions where concepts like distance are meaningless. The downside is that these other dimensions also have completely different rules defining what things should be composed of, turning normal matter into a soup of subatomic and quantum particles. Based on the limited observations of the *Jewel*’s star drive when it was in operation, it is now believed the transition display was this effect in action.

And this is Zoran’s second stroke of brilliance: leveraging the same q-dots that power the system to anchor a tiny bit of our reality within a protective barrier long enough to make the transition. A shell that then pops through a dimensional gap, only to reappear elsewhere - much like a web bar of soap that you have squeezed a bit too hard.

Controlling where it lands is the next great trick, and one that the Mars laboratory should be answering for us very soon.

I have just finished a CS-focused high school in Romania. We have the prestige of the first Computer Science high school in Eastern Europe and one with very good results in competitive computing.

That said, I've gone through probably the equivalent of university first year of curriculum in 7 years, sometimes even further. As a computer geek, I played with almost anything that I came across with and sounded interesting. x86 assembler programming, ZX BASIC, Turbo Pascal, C#, Java, Scala, the Plan9 operating system, rule-based machine translation, turtle graphics, esoteric programming languages. I have been and still am a Linux user for 6 years.

I have practical experience with C++ for problem solving, PHP, Python (mostly for scripting, but I've used Django and Flask), Javascript (Node.js, Meteor.js, Socket.io), MySQL, NoSQL (MongoDB, limited experience with RethinkDB), CSS (basic bootstrapping, media queries etc.) and HTML5.

As a soon-to-be international student, I need cash to pay the rent and common living expenses (some ~ $1-1.5k/month). For the past months, I have tried doing freelancing over Elance, with roughly $ 4k made from January until now.

But it is not the pay that I despise, but the kind of projects I get to work on and ridiculously long hours that are by no means sustainable. I took part of two internships during high school, and I enjoyed a lot working with technical people, as opposed to computing-illiterate clients. It's not that the latter are by any means bad in a way or another, but I feel like I'm more productive in a coders environment. Also, working by your own is a somewhat isolating experience.

It would be really nice to find a stable entry-level job, even for a smaller salary, but where I can find stability and work that leads to meaningful stuff. Now, without a degree yet, a CV doesn't tell much about me. I don't have much of a portfolio either, and haven't focused on any stack in particular.

The acquaintances in the same situation as I am that have found a job have done it through clients over Elance. While most of the work I do now is through recurrent clients, I haven't come across any circumstance in which one of the clients could land me a job.

I'd be much grateful if you guys would give me some advice? Would contacting individual start ups that I like over the phone / mail be a solution? Submit a CV for regular jobs and hope for an interview? Start an SaaS and hope for the best?

TL;DR: stable income as a remote entry-level programmer with no degree?"

I started off doing intern type low priority projects for the company, but as we got closer to release, and everyone else became more and more busy I gradually took over responsibility of all the company's infrastructure.

I have no college degree. I have no certs, but through my intership I have experience with with dozens of server systems including: FreePBX, ESXi, vSphere, KVM, pfSense, OpenVPN, Active Directory, Ldap, CIFS, NFS, FreeNAS, Webservers, python scripting, shell scripting and most importantly Linux. 

I've done tons of stuff, and I'm interested in becoming a full time sysadmin, but I don't know the industry well enough to know if I'm ready. I'm only 18 though I look much older. Should I just go out and start applying for junior positions? Should I get some certs first? What should I expect?"

After graduation I searched relentlessly for 4 months with no job then I delivered pizzas for a good 7 months before I found a temp job in a outbound call center scheduling boiler inspections in the insurance industry. Even then that was a something I didn't want to do but I sucked it up because I needed experience and I couldn't find anything else. Also I couldn't take that pizza delivery job anymore in Pottstown PA. It's been a year and I've been full time doing this call center position as a dispatcher for 4 months now and I just don't see myself doing this as a career and I'm worried that since this experience dictates my career in general. I don't want to be making phone calls all day anymore and I didn't want to in the first place.

Right now I'm thinking about a major career change. During the past year on and off I've been teaching myself web development and general software programming. I know a little but I completed Javascript, PHP, HTML and CSS tutorials on codecademy and code school websites. I liked it and I've been strongly thinking about going to school for it with doing one of those coding bootcamps like App Academy and Gschool or Galvanize as they're now called. I've been in touch with a buddy out in Colorado who I'll be visiting next month to see the Galvanize Full Stuck Web Developer program and find out to see if that is for me. He'll complete the program as well next month when I see him when he'll be looking for a job. One of the main problems though is that the program costs $20,000 and I'll have to take out a loan to do it let alone move out of state and find a way live there for the duration of the program (which is 6 months long). However, if I do take that route I want to see if my buddy gets a great career out of it making at least $60,000 like most graduates do before I make that bold decision. 

I also have been speaking to a cousin out in Austin, TX (heard great things about that city). He's an inside sales rep for Office Depot and said he could put a good word in for and I looked at the job description for it and it seems like it's something I could do from my experience with my current job. From what my cousin told it's less phone work, more money($45K plus bonuses) and more time off (28 days paid time off) than what I have now. I need to follow up with him to see if everything he told me holds up true.

I've been also looking around to see what I can do with my degree as a BA in Telecommunications. Market Research Analyst and Economic Development Coordinator caught my eye since I do enjoy researching figures and I feel as though I'm pretty good at since I aced every History research paper I wrote and group projects where I researched demographics of the Washington metro area for a media programming class and my group and I aced that too.

I've been trying to get out of the area I'm in for the past two years now and I need a change. What job titles should I be looking for as a BA in Telecommunications (communications major)? Could I make it as a market research analyst/consultant or economic development coordinator? In essence what can I do with BA in telecommunications? I also don't want to be in a career that will be automated in at least 20 years form now.

Any advice would be helpful and I thank you for all of those that reply back to this post.

Anyway, two weeks ago I saw an entry-level position posted for the company that I used to work for. It was a different department, but I couldn't figure out the exact department it was for, so I sent my old supervisor an e-mail asking if she happened to know anything about the position or if she knew of anyone who might. Whelp, she never responded and now I feel really awkward. I sent an e-mail to another higher up in the company and they responded and said they would put in a good word for me, so I am not worried that I won't get a good shot at the job but I feel uncomfortable that my supervisor never responded, especially because I thought we had a good relationship. I know that she is super busy, so I was anticipating a week for a response (even when I was an intern it would take her several hours to a day to respond to certain e-mails I sent her) but even if she would take a while to respond in the past, she would always respond. I feel like maybe I phrased the last e-mail poorly? Do I send a follow up e-mail or just let it be? If the former, what do I say?? Also am I worried for no reason? Help, I'm awkward."

I feel like if I have a solid interview there's a high chance for me to land the position. As I said, I would rather work for Company B than Company A.

Should I delay the meeting with the manager at Company A? Should I tell him straight up that I have an interview with another company and that I would like to wait a little longer to weigh my options? 

I honestly don't know what to do...should I just go ahead and meet with the manager and see what happens from there? The thing I don't want to do is accept an offer from Company A, interview with Company B, accept their offer, and then quit Company A after such a short amount of time. I have good relationships with people from Company A that I don't want to tarnish.

3aqv7q,1,2015-06-22,Upgrading processor causes computer not to boot,Omnipotentgrape,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3aqv7q/upgrading_processor_causes_computer_not_to_boot/,"Hi /r/techsupport, I'm currently working as an intern, and they're currently having me upgrade the processor and RAM on their lab machines. The upgrades are the processors and RAM. I am going from 4gb to 8gb (we're going to upgrade to Windows 7 later, so the RAM will be useful), and the processor from a **Pentium Dual-Core CPU E5300 @ 2.60GHz** to a **Intel Core 2 Quad Q9400 @2.66GHz**

&amp;nbsp;

This is the rest of the machine:
* OS: Microsoft Windows XP Professional Version 2002 SP3
* Motherboard: Supermicro C2SBC-Q ATX Motherboard
* 400 Watt PSU

&amp;nbsp;

I've gotten most of the machines to work just by unplugging the machine, grounding myself on bare metal of the case, removing the old processor and RAM, and installing the new processor and RAM. The computer would then boot just fine. However, for one machine, I put in the new processor and new RAM, and the computer will not boot. The fans will go on, but either nothing will show up on the monitor, or it will freeze on the bios information screen. Once it even made it to the login screen before freezing.

&amp;nbsp;

I put the old Pentium back in, and the computer worked perfectly. I then swapped in two more (different) Quad cores in, and both of those would also do the same thing as the first Quad core. I would think the chances of three faulty processors is low, and that this computer just does not like the Core 2 Quads.

&amp;nbsp;

Why is this so? It's the exact same computer as all the other ones that worked, but it won't work with the upgrade processor.

&amp;nbsp;

Any ideas? Thanks."

3ar6iz,2,2015-06-22,Traditional financial analyst role or a MEAN stack (web app) developer at a startup?,opus666,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3ar6iz/traditional_financial_analyst_role_or_a_mean/,"Hi. I just got a job offer from a place that I actually wanted to work at. It is an investment firm, and I'll be working as a junior analyst, where I'll just be an Excel monkey. However, I've talked to the two senior associates who had started in my position, and they say that the job does get better as I gain more experience and earn my CFA certification, which is expected of me as a junior analyst.

However, the problem is that I've taken a job at a start up doing some Excel work and hopefully being a MEAN stack developer for the same company in the future. I've been at this position for two weeks, and the start up culture is not bad. It's very flexible and laid back, but I'm not sure if I'll be up to scratch. I have zero experience programming. I've done R and MATLAB as a math major, but nothing like web development and database architecture, which is what my position will be in this start-up. As a young 22 year old, there is no better time for me to learn all these programming skills, but at the same time so much of my undergraduate career has been towards a financial career.

To be honest, I don't have a burning desire to work in the financial industry. I'm just a guy who liked math, and now that it's time for me to start looking for a job it didn't hurt me to take a few classes in investing and apply to those positions. I've never had an internship in the area nor do I know many people in this industry. The only thing that is more attractive for me for the analyst position is that it's the devil that I know. This whole programming position I have now presents a lot of opportunities for growth in the future, but I am starting from square zero.

**TL;DR**: here are the main questions
   

   1.  Should I select a more traditional junior analyst role in a rather rigid, traditional office setting, or attempt to be a database developer without any experience whatsoever?

   2. If i do select the junior analyst role, any advice on quitting a job after only 2 weeks?

Thank you"

I always feel so on top of it, then a couple weeks in I hit some roadblock. 

The boss needs X done, but the way he wants it done doesn't make sense. Every time I think it's done, I ask him and he says he wants it done differently. His explanations don't make sense. I'm looking at a week of time wasted over this stupid task. 

This has happened to me every time I've had an internship. Last summer I had an issue like this and wound up riding it all summer doing nothing and getting away with it. But I don't want that.

How do I say ""Hey, I think I'm not getting this, and I don't want to waste my time trying to learn it because it's not getting me anywhere."" And no, you can't just say that to your boss black and white. 


EDIT: just to be clear, it's work in R&amp;D. It's technical stuff. So far I have got all the technical stuff, but this is really technical. I already tried it, I already asked, I already googled it. It's a menial task that is gonna require a lot more brain power than it is worth. I am not trying to be lazy, I'm burning out trying to do this one thing."

I'm currently working an internship on the Android team of a pretty big company. I find it reasonably fun and satisfying as I enjoy the visual aspect of building something, and I feel like I'm starting to actually develop some professional skills as well. 

I was considering pursuing a career in Android/mobile development, but my mom (who works in the EE industry) is telling me Android developers won't enjoy the same pay, demand, and lucrative career path as other jobs would offer.

I understand that we all like to say ""follow your dreams, if you like it stick with it"" but I'm still young and haven't really tried out any other options, so I'm kind of curious as to what to do after this internship (I'm going to be a junior next year). Deciding whether I want to focus on Android and become really experienced in it or whether I should swap is hard for me.

So I'm wondering the answers to these three questions...
- Do prestigious big companies/hot startups seek out Android developers the same as more backend oriented ones?
- How does an Android career path differ others? Does it make working for certain types of companies easier/harder? (e.g does it make getting a job for Microsoft harder, but getting a job for some mobile-based startup easier)
- What do you think the future looks like for Android devs? Will we always be in demand, and will a career in Android still allow us to switch to other SDE positions?

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, every day is very hard for me, as I struggle with addiction, anxiety, and depression, even before he died, I was still messed up. I really think the best way to die would be for a shotgun or something to get you when you are fast asleep. Seems quick, and painless.

My life is huge mess and I truly don't know what to do with myself.

I started wanting to become an engineer, but having performed horribly in my first semester, I transferred to my university's college of arts and sciences instead. At my school, we had to declare a major by the end of sophomore year. Having no passion in anything whatsoever, I struggled to decide. There was that one class that I got a B+ in that I enjoyed; it was a political science class on Shakespeare and politics. Thus, I declared political science. I should probably mention that I was struggling with anorexia and bulimia during all of this. I broke down during the spring of my sophomore year and decided to spend 6 months studying abroad to give myself a break from school. 

After returning to school at the second half of my junior year, I scrambled to pick up what I had left off before I went to abroad. I had 3 semesters left not only to finish a degree but to finish the core requirements for graduation. So I spent the rest of my time trying to graduate.
My academics were a huge mess, but what I did enjoy on the side was my work study jobs where I was able to acquire some experience in IT and web development. I was also an Administrative Assistant for 2 semesters. I wasn't able to land an internship at all after my junior year and spent my summer volunteering at random non-profits and offering private tutoring. I enjoyed worked at these random places even though they don't really make sense or fit together in a cohesive image. 

For months now, I've been applying to work as various types of analysts and project manager and have only been called for 2 interviews - neither of which resulted in an offer. I told my parents that I was gonna go back to school to get a MA but my research tells me that my GPA and coursework do not match any of the requirements for Stats or Computer Science programs. My mom wants me to get a useful degree this time. I really just want to get employed and stop being such a mess. But what can I do? My work history is so random and my GPA sucks. I can't get a job. I can't go back to school. What do I do with my life? Sorry for rant/blog style but god, I'm feeling like total shit these days.

I graduated just over a year ago with a BA in economics and government (double major), my focuses were in energy economics and national security. 

After graduating I briefly held a paid internship working with a lobby focused on a niche sector of renewable energy before leaving prematurely to accept a full-time job offer at a Fortune 150 company working in economics, though in the real estate sector. 

I've been working at the company for eight months now, and they've invested a lot of time and money in me, including a very high compensation and benefits package. 

Last week I received unsolicited contact from a smaller company offering an equally competitive compensation and benefits package working in the energy economics and renewable energy policy sector--fields of study I am more interested in. The recruiter does work for that company, so my hunch is that they're trying to poach me. (note this not an official job offer, but could potentially be one, and I have no experience dealing with a situation like this, so, of course, everything below is hypothetical)

Is eight months too soon to leave a company to risk being labeled a ""job-hopper?"" Moreover, my working group just hired a mid-level analyst and this would mean leaving would require my working group to hire and train an entry-level analyst at the same time as workflow increases--I don't want to screw anyone over and burn a bridge.

My current plan is to return to school to get an advanced degree within a year-and-a-half, and I'm worried switching jobs now would force me to delay that by at least another eight months to avoid being labeled. (unless being poached to a new job isn't a risk I need to worry about or explain)

Assuming I complete my due diligence and I determine the work culture and people at this second company are a great fit for me, they want to move within the next two weeks have me make a decision. I don't know what to do. 

Also, general advice on what to do and how to approach this situation would be much appreciated. Thanks everyone!

My company has struggled financially since I came on-board, and after hearing ""we might close"" a few times over, I'm exhausted and ready to do something else. While I enjoy HR, it's not viable for the area I'm in. In fact, not much is beyond truck driving and minimum wage fast food jobs. 

Enter learning to code. I don't want to treat this as a magic key to career success, *but* there are some serious appeals given that it can open the door to more flexible employment-- remote/telework, contract, etc. I like to collect as much information about any given decision before I do anything, so here I am.

One question I haven't been able to answer based on my search of this subreddit is whether to teach myself: full-time (as in, quit my job), part-time (as in, work a PT job), or during my free time (no quitting, 2-3 hrs/night + weekends)? My fiance's salary can support us both, gratefully, and we have very low monthly bills. He thinks I should learn full-time and that a PT job would basically break even because it'd be minimum wage with a long commute. As the person potentially quitting her salaried job, I am definitely feeling the risk of leaping toward this challenge, despite being excited by it. Of course, my company may go under and decide for me anyway...

Possibly relevant facts: 26, female, bachelors and masters in religion/ethics, minor experience with HTML (LiveJournal &amp; AngelFire, lol) and playing with Ruby on a code academy type site.

**TL;DR Do I learn to code while unemployed or employed?**

EDIT: I should mention that I am *not* interested in pursuing another degree. I feel pretty topped off at two, not because of the financial aspect, but because I understand from others that it's possible to teach myself and find a job (or an internship, then a job, etc.)."

3av0cp,5,2015-06-23,Trouble with linked cells,halfsock552,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/3av0cp/trouble_with_linked_cells/,"Hey r/excel, I'm totally new to this subreddit (which seems awesome by the way) and to posting in general so here goes:

TL;DR: VLOOKUP isn't automatically updating cell links that are altered by another user across multiple workbooks, makes training programs out-of-date.

First I’d like to mention that all of these documents reside on a server, not any single computer. Not sure if that may have anything to do with it.

I have a master workbook that is updated about once a month with new training plans at the company I am interning for. It consists of a column “Training” and several columns of “Training Plans” for each of those trainings (2014 training plan, 2015 training plan, 2016..., etc.). In another column, I use a MAX formula to choose the most recent training issue date in that training's row.

There are approximately 20 separate department workbooks that all have different combinations of these trainings along with the names of the employees in each department. I won’t go into detail as to the other formulas I am using to calculate which employees are overdue for training unless it is deemed necessary, however all of these formulas use “Training Issue Date” cells for their calculations. These cells use VLOOKUP to find the name of the column’s training in the master workbook, then MATCH to find the most recent training issue date. This is the current formula I’m using:

=VLOOKUP(F$1,'masterworkbook.xlsx'!Table3[#Data],MATCH(""Most Recent Training Date"",'masterworkbook.xlsx'!Table3[#Headers],0),0)

The issue I keep coming across is that the department workbooks will only update the VLOOKUP values when the master workbook is open. Unfortunately that can’t happen because 20 different department managers are not supposed to access the master workbook. Every time I or another user opens up a department workbook there is a popup message asking if you'd like to update links or not (links need to be updated for our purposes), then it will say that it cannot update the links. Additionally, if I manipulate those VLOOKUP cells in any way they return a #REF! error.

I have tried editing the data link startup prompt to “automatically update” to no avail.

If this is hard to understand or confusing in any way please let me know and I’ll try to re-word it. As I am an intern I’m unsure of company policy/security for sharing files to aid in explaining my issue. If anyone knows a formulaic or possible VBA workaround to this issue it would be much appreciated!"

3aw2rz,1,2015-06-23,"Beyond Money, How Much Support Should VCs Give Startups?",winstonl,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/3aw2rz/beyond_money_how_much_support_should_vcs_give/,"In the New Yorker’s cover story profile, Marc Andreeseen talked about how he and Ben Horowitz are building a different kind of venture capital business.

One of the key elements is offering services to startups within A16z’s portfolio beyond money. This approach involves 65 in-house specialists focused on executive talent, tech talent, market development, corporate development, and marketing.

“We give our founders the networking superpower, hyper-accelerating someone into a fully functional C.E.O. in five years,” Andreessen said.

It got me thinking about whether VCs should be providing services to startups, rather than simply giving them money, advice and, theoretically, networking opportunities. Should VCs serve as “service agencies” that can proactively meet the needs of portfolio companies directly or indirectly?

Many startup entrepreneurs, particularly first-timers, are smart, but they don’t know what they don’t know. They may be excellent developers or engineers, but they have limited knowledge or expertise about areas such as sales, marketing, finance or hiring.

To be successful, startups need to make the right decisions about multiple things and hire the right people. Some of their hires will be external – consultants, contractors, part-timers, interns, etc.

The question is how do startups make sure they attract the best talent to drive growth? They could spend time searching for good fits through research, asking their networks for advice, or simply hiring their friends (a common HR tactic).

But perhaps a better approach is having their VC become a one-stop HR destination for whatever a startup needs. Some of these services could be delivered by in-house specialists, while other services could come from a roster of strategic partners.

This could be a more efficient and effective way for startups to operate while VCs would achieve two goals: ensure their startups are making the right decisions to achieve their goals, and delivering value.

For better-financed VCs, it may be financially viable to have in-house expertise. For other VCs, it could involve building a roster of partners with a variety of skills. These partners would not only be hired guns but could be tapped for their expertise in other, non-formal ways – e.g. coffee, phone calls, etc. This would create a success-driven ecosystem that would eliminate some of the operational challenges facing startups.

What do you think? What role should VCs play to ensure the success of their startup investments? Are VCs about capital and advice, or should they be more pro-active?

More: Here are some other thoughts on whether VCs should provide additional services:
– Openview Venture Partners’ Kyle Lacy on why it makes sense for VCs to provide value-added services
– Vidyard’s Michael Litt on the importance of selecting the right VC.

3aw78c,16,2015-06-23,How I got hired right after college,adoucett,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/3aw78c/how_i_got_hired_right_after_college/,"Greetings /r/GIS - 

I write this to you not as a brag, but hopefully as encouragement to anyone who is interested in GIS down the road, or any recent graduates who are still job-searching.

&amp;nbsp;

First, a little about my undergraduate career: 
I started off in atmospheric sciences, at a school with a strong program in this area, with the hope of being a meteorologist. While I was fascinated with the subject, a few of the classes (particularly in mathematics) were proving difficult enough for me that It was holding back my progression in the major. While this was going on however, I started taking classes in GIS and really loved it. I also was slowly learning that maybe meteorology, while a passion, wasn't what I wanted to do for work per say.

&amp;nbsp;

I ended up transferring from that school after Sophomore year, to another, for various reasons, and in doing so also switched majors. During the summers, just having the basic GIS knowledge from those first couple classes got me an internship with the city helping with various GIS projects. It wasn't great pay, or extremely inventive work, but it did get me some real work experience which helped build my resume.


My new program was in Earth Systems, which thankfully had the same physical science prerequisites as meteorology (year of Physics...chem...calc...etc) and with the majority of my ""Gen ed"" requirements filled from transfer credits, I was mostly taking courses in my major. At my school, the Earth Systems major was pretty much balanced between courses from the geography faculty and the geology faculty, so I ended up getting a pretty broad overview. 

&amp;nbsp;


While I never took another GIS Lab during this time (They really only offered basic GIS courses and I already had that coming in), I did whatever I could to improve my grasp of GIS and integrate it into everything I could. I took remote sensing which exposed me to a whole new suite of software and tools, a masters level GIS literature review seminar with an ecology focus, and took on an independent study where I was able to design my own project over the course of a semester. While I wasn't necessarily taking ""GIS"" classes, I incorporated the skills I already had (and was learning) into every other class I could -- for class presentations in urban geography, Hydrocarbon (fracking) Issues, economics, Environmental policy, senior year writing, and others that weren't *requiring* GIS but had the potential to use it independently to produce something for the class or an assignment. 

&amp;nbsp;

When I graduated I was able to say that not only did I learn the basics, but was able to already apply those skills to a variety of fields. Having a strong resume is going to help you get noticed. Even if you didn't have a paid position, just taking on some sort of project, even if completely independent, is going to set you apart. Come up with a research question and try to answer it for yourself, putting together some solid maps in the process. 

&amp;nbsp;

I applied to a few different positions, and ended up having several interviews for one in particular (didn't lead to an offer), but for the most part, I just wasn't hearing back from most of them. I was extremely excited when one of my prospective employers called me in for an interview. I came to the interview well rehearsed on the company, *their needs*, with printed materials including resume, references, and a portfolio of 4-5 example maps I had created, from a variety of applications. In addition to this, I had an online portfolio set up with a bunch of my work on display, including research papers. 

&amp;nbsp;

I still consider myself extremely lucky, but I found out last week that I got the job! I just wanted to share what I did to help others who are still trying to figure everything out...because being there, even for only a few months, was really scary.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR&gt;** 

* Build experience, especially interesting projects you can talk about on your resume and in an interview.
* While still in school, apply your GIS to every class you can, even if it seems unrelated at first.
* Create a portfolio (both print and online) of your maps. You could even create some just for this purpose.
* Think about what skills you can bring, in addition to being a map monkey, to your prospective company and emphasize them. 
* If you weren't taught a GIS/related skill in a particular class, learn it on your own. Then emphasize how you self-taught that skill during a job interview.
* **APPLY EARLY!** Scan the job boards and try to apply as soon as possible when a new position opens. The pile of applicants begins to grow rapidly and if you are one of the first few to apply, your chances of getting noticed are exponentially increased. Even if you are the most experienced and qualified applicant for the job, if you are the 200th person to apply, there's a good chance you won't get noticed at all.


I'm happy to answer any questions although I'm by no means an expert yet. "
3awq3t,3,2015-06-23,How do my wife and I escape this poor situation?,HowDoWeProceed,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3awq3t/how_do_my_wife_and_i_escape_this_poor_situation/,"**tl;dr**: Wife and I changed life paths, returned to school in our late 20s, and are focusing 100% on academics. My parents offered to ""rent"" us the basement in exchange for household work, and are now treating me like a teenager and trying to control our lives and we do not have the time to properly exit the situation.

**Longer version**: My wife and I are in our late 20s. We both graduated with Bachelors degrees in different fields about 5 years ago. After working in those respective fields for a few years, we both concluded that we are not happy doing those jobs for the rest of our lives, and decided to return to school. One year ago, we moved back to our hometown to go back to college. Considering our very different outlook on life, we both understand that academics is our top priority, and we have both been doing exceptionally well in our classes considering we also have to work enough to maintain our present ""savings"" of around 6 months or so of living. If we lived solely off of savings, we would be out of money completely in 6 months (may be able to stretch that to 8-10 if we started eating purely ramen and never driving anywhere).

My parents kindly offered to allow us to live in their finished basement (which was not being used) for a year, stating that it would mean we would not have to work so much so that we could focus more on school. This means more time for side projects, which means better internship positions and ultimately higher paying jobs upon graduation. Of course, we took them up on their offer as soon as our apartment lease was up.

This was a little over a week ago. This last week has been the most stressful period I have ever dealt with. In short, my parents both have their own issues, are fighting for a divorce, and both seem to think that I am still a 12 year old child, incapable of managing my own time and space. Today, excluding about 15 minutes of driving and 20 minutes for lunch, I spent over 12 hours straight between class, extra academic work with a professor, and a lengthy homework assignment. I decided to play a video game at around 9:30pm, figuring that after 12 hours I had earned an hour of gaming before going to sleep (my wife is at work). My mother walks right into the room, and asks sarcastically ""are you studying?"". When I said that I needed a bit of a mental break and that my time is not hers to manage, she said ""it is while you are living in my house"".

This is absurd. My wife and I are a married adult couple, we have 401k's, own stocks, and have managed teams of people in our respective fields. We have made the hard decision to return to school to have better and happier futures, and have applied the necessary self discipline (that many people lack) to come as far as we have. My parents simply don't speak to my wife, and they treat me like I am still their little kid. The hardest part is that because they see me as a child, they refuse to engage in a mature conversation with me, no matter how much I try.

Obviously we cannot live here anymore...

But we have no idea how to get out. We spent so much time packing our things away in storage (like dishes!) and lost so much by giving away the things that we were sure we wouldn't need (our couch, our dining room table) that we just aren't sure of how to proceed. If we focus solely on finding a new place to live, our academic performance will suffer. We both already only have maybe half a day free each, spread throughout the week. We fell behind a lot in school to get packed up and moved here, and my wife had to trade a lot of shifts that she is now covering. Fortunately, I do freelance work, so my work did not fall behind, but the lack of a steady income makes being sure of what we can commit to affording for a year (rental contract) difficult.

We aren't even sure of where to start. All we want/need is a place to feel safe and secure where we can focus on our schoolwork to make a better future for ourselves. If it weren't so expensive (and they allowed our cat), we could live out of a hotel room for the next few years and be content. All feelings of privacy, safety, and security are gone, and the stress of this situation is already negatively affecting our academic work, our jobs, and our relationship.

Where do we even start?"

I've never done any big side projects in my spare time and it isn't because I don't enjoy coding, I just have always spent free time with friends and other such things.

My problem isn't that I don't understand Java or a specific language or any programming basics like reading from a text file or loops or anything simple like that. My problem is more like I don't understand how to apply that knowledge. Using things like Maven/Gradle and designing and developing large multi-class integrated projects from scratch is all brand new to me and honestly its really intimidating. I look at example additions to open source projects or any packaged software and I can't even fathom creating anything remotely close to them. How do I make that leap? I can read all the Java code in their projects for example, but identifying why they did the things they did from a design standpoint is really difficult for me.

For my school projects there were basic instructions like: create a class that does x and can handles b, has methods for x, y, z, and outputs o. So I guess I'm struggling with knowing how to direct and instruct myself. Are there any resources I can look into to improve?

My motivation for doing so: What brought idea of career change to my mind originally, is that science is a dead-end career choice for me.

I cannot support a family on these wages, and my wife and I really want to start reproducing soon. If I want to make more money, I need to become a people-manager (gag), and in order to do that, I need to get higher education (read: debt). Basically, pay increases have nothing to do with experience, and only your degree determines your wages. Despite what you learn in school, science in the business world is about results, not discovery, and it is pretty soulless and routine, with tons of internal politics. What made me decide on IT as a target career, is that computers are my real passion, and my main hobby. I don't come home from work and look up science journals and interesting discoveries, I come home and learn about Linux or VMWare etc. The problem-solving and troubleshooting aspect of fixing a PC, setting up a new server or service, and finally getting it working is like an adrenaline rush to me. I love solving puzzles and learning new things in the process. Plus, I hear the pay scales much better with experience. My current long-term goal is Linux Sysadmin.

My IT experience: I have been the family IT guy since I got my first laptop in college. I have built and maintained a gaming PC through those years, and learned alot about hardware and Windows. Towards the end of college, I got very interested in Linux, so I ran Ubuntu and learned a bit about Linux. I started running Arch Linux on my desktop. After finding work, I became interested in servers. I now run a homelab, and have experience setting up and troubleshooting VMWare, KVM, CentOS 6, Bind9 DNS, ISC DHCPd, SAMBA, rsyslog, pfSense, SophosUTM, some networking, etc. I also run a small side-business of PC repair in my local area. I am also taking Linux classes at my local community college (I already know 90%+ of the material we are covering, but the courses are proof that I have some level of proficiency).

My dilemma: I have been applying to help-desk role jobs,  listing all of my computer experience. I also attempt to portray my current role in science in a way that I think would be relevant to IT. By this, I mean that I do a lot of data review, finding trends in data, and finding ways that we can improve and make our processes more efficient. In addition, science necessitates high critical thinking skills and attention to detail. None of these employers have called me back. I know that I have no ""real"" professional experience working in IT, and that works against me, but I should be able to sell myself as someone who loves to learn, has critical thinking skills, and has a decent knowledge of Linux and virtualization technologies, if I could just get an interview. 

I know that entry level certs are a big one, A+ being the main. A couple things I have thought of are hooking up with some staffing agencies, or maybe applying mostly to small companies that don't have the stringent requirements and HR filters that a larger company might.

What other things might I do that could help give me an edge?

3az7ff,0,2015-06-24,Brother came back for a week before leaving for a year. My parents spoiled him and treated me like Cinderella. [rant],[deleted],AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/3az7ff/brother_came_back_for_a_week_before_leaving_for_a/,"Backstory, short version: Older sister, younger brother. I'm the leftover child. I get second-hand everything, including love, respect, and treatment. I even had to drop out of college because my parents stopped paying for me so they could pay for my brother.

This year, my brother's doing an internship hundreds of miles away, so he only had a week back in town before leaving for a year. The whole week, my parents have been making his favorite food, taking him to places he wants to go, etc. Basically spoiling the everloving crap out of him. I'm left with the chores and the work needed to pick up the slack because they're too busy focusing on their golden child.

Despite all this, I'm actually on good terms with my brother. Growing up together, we were good friends and even though age and distance has caused us to drift apart, we still get along pretty well. So I tolerate this special treatment most times he's back in town.

This time, though... This time, it's been really rough on me. My anxiety got even worse than usual and I went from daily panic attacks to panic attacks once every ~6 hours. The day that everyone left for a daytrip without telling me, my depression took over. I sat around wondering what I was doing with my life and what went so wrong to lead to this point in my life. Was it my fault that I'm stuck in this shitty place in life? It was a rough day to get through.

Finally, the end of the week approached. I got up this morning, planning to talk with him before he left for a year, then let him get back to packing. I walk over and his room was empty. He had already left, hours earlier than he had told me.

My parents saw me and said, ""Oh, you just missed him. He left 10 minutes ago. We didn't think you were awake.""

What the fuck. They didn't even bother checking. Didn't think to come wake me up so I could join in on sending him off. Didn't think that I fucking mattered enough to be allowed to talk to him before they sent off their precious golden baby. Didn't consider I had any goddamn feelings or opinions or anything worth anything to contribute. And he didn't think so, either.

I'm upset. I'm furious. I feel betrayed.

But mostly I'm just depressed that I'm still trapped in this fucking household where I'm an afterthought for everything."
3azd0e,0,2015-06-24,"When it comes to big companies, do different offices have different levels of competition?",CS_noob_student,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3azd0e/when_it_comes_to_big_companies_do_different/,"So for example, would the San Francisco office of Google be more competitive (i.e. more difficult to get into) than the London or the Zurich office?

I am studying in the UK and I would really want to get an internship in the US, but increasing the likelihood of getting accepted is more important for me. Obviously they will say that they have the same standards for everything, but I feel that there should usually be more applicants for the main office in US which in turn means more competition. Also when it comes to hiring interns that aren't US nationals the companies have to go through the hassle of setting up a visa for you, which means that your competitiveness should (although they probably won't admit it openly) decrease if you're European.

What are your thoughts on the matter? And what would you advise me - apply to US office or the UK (or some other European) office? I'm a European citizen, but not from the UK if that matters."

I am working as an IT intern for the summer at a hedge fund, and they are having me redesign their Outlook Calendar functionality. Right now, we use a private website for our calendar events, but it's functionality is limited so we want to move to Outlook permanently. There are a few things that I need to set up for everyone in the office:

* When planning a meeting, be able to select which conference room you want to have it in.
* Be able to see which times are available for a specific room (e.g. I need to have my meeting in Conference Room A, which times work?)
* Be able to see which rooms are available for a specific time (e.g. I need to have a meeting at 1pm, which rooms are available?)
* Be unable to schedule a meeting if the room and time selected are already booked (right now I have it where you get an alert that your time conflicts but you are still allowed to book the meeting. I need it to reject the meeting so people don't get confused and think their meeting time will work)
* Be able to add different needs for each specific meeting (e.g. ""Expecting a guest?"" w/check box, or ""Does guest need key fob?"" w/check box)
* Be able to specify a dial-in number if it's a conference call.
* Be able to show which location the meeting room is at (we have two office locations, and want to show the meeting on only one of the office's calendar, not both).

The office runs Windows 7 professional, and most of the employees use IE9 because it's the only browser that works with our website. I am relatively new to IT and brand new to Outlook so if you guys could help me out, I would really appreciate it! As of now, all I have done is made a Room Mailbox in Active Directory for each conference room in one of the offices. Thanks!"

3azkz4,2,2015-06-24,Good Student. Bad Results.,BadAthMOFO,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/3azkz4/good_student_bad_results/,"Hey guys!

I am rising senior that's ranked 1st or 2nd in a class of 562 students, with a W GPA of 5.08 and a UW GPA of 3.96. I attend as many voluntary/extracurricular activities as possible with a part-time job during school and a full-time job in the summer. My class history is made up with 1 AP course, 7 IB courses, and 11 Honors courses. This senior year will consist of 1 more AP course plus another 7 more IB courses. And, this summer I will be working as an intern at the RTP Cisco for the month of July in the Data Lab Center. 

But, here is the catch, my SAT and ACT test scores are *waa-aay* below expectations. And, they are so disappointing to look at because I know these are not the standards of the admissions of the schools  that I really want to go to, most notably Duke. 

SAT: 1600 (R 500; M 640; W 460)

ACT: 25 (E 22; M 26; R 27; S 25; Writing 8/12)

I know my biggest problem with both tests was preparation because I took both tests without looking at a single practice test and with a total of ~4 hours of ""studying"".

Since I earned a higher score on the ACT, I decided my sole focus would be to only study for it with hopes that I can go beyond a 30 on the ACT before I apply for ED at Duke. 

I got the second edition official prep book and read through the chapters to the best of my ability. Yesterday, I decided to take my first ACT practice test and split the four parts of the multiple choice between two days. And, I earned a 23 on the English and a 27 on the Math with a whopping +1 improvement on both. This of course made me realize that I was still stuck after doing the most studying I have ever done in my short life. 

Today, I have decided to study the ACT subject by subject, starting with English. So far, I have watched and re-watched some of the ACT English tips on YouTube and completed sample questions on the ACT website. And, I plan to take only the English portion of a PT tomorrow. 

But truly, my biggest problem of all right now is constant anxiousness about my future with school. So, I call onto the elders! Do you have any words of wisdom for a teenager with such temporary worries?    

Thank you for taking your time to read this, and hopefully the answers that some of you will give will be helpful to many others. 

**TL; DR :** Good student does not reach standardized test goals during the previous school year and wishes for motivation and encouragement. "

3azw2p,2,2015-06-24,"Going on 13 months of unemployment. I could use some uplift, some tips (that I haven't already done yet).",thefinestsomething,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3azw2p/going_on_13_months_of_unemployment_i_could_use/,"I read some old posts here by people who seemed to have been unemployed for ages and have had some troubles similar to mine. I've been unemployed for 13 months now after graduating college last year. A few of those months I was casually applying because I had a sibling diagnosed with an illness who I had to care for. Right now, however, I am rigorously applying and worn out and tired from this process. 

I graduated from a health professional program-one of those accelerated, straight-after-high-school things where you skip ahead to the professional degree. This wasn't quite my preference upon entering university because while my field is considered good and reputable, there's a very narrow scope of what you can do with my major and I wasn't ready to commit to something so specific as a freshman. But seeing where the job market was going when I started and realizing that some of my ""dreams"" to study what I loved could be misguided, I decided to go along with my major.

Problems started for me as soon as my first year in my program. We were highly recommended to work or get an internship as a student intern or ancillary personnel in the setting of my field. I did exactly what my classmates did and applied, went in person to these settings, asked people who were in somewhat related fields, etc. I contacted my professor and supervisors I worked with in regards to getting a job. Many told me that there was an increasing amount of students having trouble (I would later learn this was because as I was in the middle of school, the balance of supply of students was starting to exceeded the demand for jobs in my field) so my best bet would be to go to job fairs and meet the managers in person. I did that as well, e-mailed managers, called people up. I did this constantly for 3 years. During my second to last year in the program, the places I called said ""we're hiring younger students at this point"", yet there were still students in my year getting jobs at these places. And I cannot emphasize, I wasn't doing anything ""less"" than they were as far as grades, resume or interviews went. I practiced my interview with a speech professional. 

In the meantime I wasn't getting jobs, I was very involved. I joined many organizations on campus, volunteered over 400 hours of experience for a campus facility, had a work-study job at an on-campus center, was partaking in at least 3-4 organizations, one which I had a very active role as a VP. Some of these did not have direct association with my major, but they were within the broad scope of my field. I also have a short-term research experience and practical experience required as a part of my major (1500 hours in six different locations).

After I graduated, I have applied to maybe 80-90 jobs all over the country, majority somewhat near locations I am familiar with however. I know this may not be a lot, but with the circumstances I was in, I didn't have time to apply to a tons more. I can only average 4-6 apps a day-all of my applications ask me to put a resume, cover letter, then input individual work experience/contact information. I've done job apps for my mom who works in accounting and they took much less time than mine. I live close to an ivy league university and about 1 hour 15 mins away from a major city, and sometimes (more so during the semester) they have talks/lectures of interest to me, so I go check it out and make it a point to network. Some of the events I end up go to has undergrads more so than professionals, so it turns out to be kind of pointless.

I updated my LinkedIn (possibly need a better, more professional picture) but add a lot of people, including random people, have gotten in touch with a few people by phone just to get an idea of what their field is like. I contacted old supervisors to let them know I'm on the lookout for a job. I've had my resume/cover letter reviewed and update/clean it up at least monthly. I created an online website/portfolio of my presentations, skills and even put my hobbies up on there.  I am applying to jobs in my field but also some places outside of it, justifying in my cover letter why I could qualify for such position. I'm doing some extra online skill building courses, although (not going to lie) it's tough to motivate myself some days without knowing what direction I am really going in.

The only other thing is that, after contacting maybe 50 people to ask them to assist with research or some kind of role like that, I finally got a voluntary position at a clinic. This is my first time getting experience after 13 months and I may be averaging about 20-25 hours monthly.

This is definitely becoming demoralizing, depressing and making me lose a sense of confidence. I've had issues sleeping at night, difficulty motivating myself to exercise (while averaging 1-1.5 hours of daily exercise before), losing my organizational skills and my ability to think clearly. I have little to no friends, never get texts or calls from old classmates who always used to otherwise ask me for notes all the time. Some days I can convince myself it's all a part of the learning process but other days I regret and kind of keep wishing I went along with what I wanted to study instead of the major I picked. I really am ready to do anything and that means even outside of my major and considering the possibility of going back to grad school. I sometimes read in my free time or keep a blog, but it's not easy to do so many things at once, especially with this depression weighing on me. I think moreover, I really need some uplift or advice from people who've been here before."

3b081y,25,2015-06-24,How risky is it to take a one-way flight to San Francisco?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3b081y/how_risky_is_it_to_take_a_oneway_flight_to_san/,"I am a senior in computer science at a big state school in the east. I am graduating in 3 weeks and have no jobs lined up. I have a decent amount of experience: 2 internships and a couple projects on my GitHub. I have been getting lots of interviews, but lots of denials as well. 

I am thinking about booking a one way flight to San Francisco in hopes of finding a development job. If I do this, I could live 3-4 months without a job. Maybe longer. 

It seems like I could go to developer meetups and possibly meet and ask around to try to get into a development job. I have been blindly applying online to a bunch of companies and it has not been working for me.

My questions: How risky is this? Would this be worth it to try and land a job in SF? I have been applying to Dice,Indeed, Hacker News, et cetera. and none of it has worked so far. If I do this, what would be the best way to land a job? Development meetups?"

3b0iq8,3,2015-06-24,[Non-traditional Engineering Student] Why am I not getting calls for interviews?,-Tom-,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/3b0iq8/nontraditional_engineering_student_why_am_i_not/,"Ok, so I'm a non-traditional mechanical engineering student (30 years old) who has had trouble even getting interviews with companies for internships. 

After my 2nd year I arranged my own internship outside of the schools career fair with a small business I knew the owner of (motorsport suspension stuff) but it ended up not being the learning opportunity I hoped for as the owner didnt want to teach me anything or give up design controls. 

After my 3rd year I helped a fellow student (PhD student) and former masters student in town get a brewery up and going for the summer, working with them as they needed me, learning about that business and how engineering applies to brewing. (mechanical systems, fluid flow, thermodynamics, heat transfer, biological engineering, etc) It was a pretty neat summer and I learned a lot. 

My 4th year I became the VP of the campus Fermentation Club and we did a few activities as a group through out the year as well as individual things, like brewing my own beer. At the fall career fair I decided I would finally go see what the companies that came to the school had to offer. I brought my professional resume from before college and added a few more things like what school I go to. Well the 3M guy laughed out loud at my resume and demanded an academic resume with some other information on there, I still went around to some other companies and tried though. No calls for interviews.

A couple days after the fall career fair I went to the professional development center at my school and sat down with the head guy and we went over my resume, pruned some stuff, reorganized, and added some other things. He was confident I now had a great resume for showing to potential employers for internships and full time jobs for a recent graduate. He also really liked my attitude, said I was a confident speaker, and I had great experience that employers should love.

Fast forward to the spring career fair, I get two interviews, one of which was to a company my friends father in law owns/is the CEO of. With in a minute of talking to the HR manager for that company she offers me an interview and sounds really excited. 

I get to the interview and it all seems to go really well except one part. The position is a field engineer which would involve a lot of being on the road and on remote job sites for a majority of the summer, which isnt a problem for me. What I mentioned was that as a mechanically inclined person, it is not above me to get in there, get my hands dirty, and do something if it needs to be done. The guy in the interview (not the head of HR who offered me the interview and was also there) seemed to take offense to this, to the point where he border line lectured me saying ""Its not your job to do that. You make sure your guys know what to do and you let them do it, no matter what."" Ok, fine. I used to work as a service adviser at a car dealership, I know I cant just go back in the shop and fix a customers car. I get it, thanks for letting me know. 

The interview with the other company I feel went well, both people interviewing me seemed to really like my answers and said that my experience was pretty impressive for the positions they were looking to fill.  

Both companies sent me a rejection letter/email saying they were considering other candidates. 

Now I've applied to 50+ other internships across the country, primarily focusing on MN (where I'm from), SD (where I'm at), CO (where I WANT to be), and AZ (where I would also like to be but have family).  I'm just not getting ANY calls for an interview. Its pretty frustrating as unfortunately you dont really get feedback from these companies when you just dont hear from them. The only kind of feedback I've gotten is a LOT of companies say they want a 3.0 minimum GPA (I have a 2.92) but it isnt required yet I get an email back hours later saying ""Sorry, unfortunately you dont meet the minimum requirements."" Even if it was a minimum requirement I still apply because what if nobody else does? 

At this point in the summer I have given up on finding an internship and I'm about ready to go work fast food as I want to save up some money for a big camping trip I have planned for CO at the end of the summer just before school starts. 

The only exception to that is that on Friday afternoon the career development head emailed me and said there was a company looking for someone URGENTLY. Apparently they had an intern bail out for a better offer after a couple weeks. I applied Friday evening by about 5:30PM and havent heard anything, 5 days later. 

This is just very frustrating as I was told by a lot of people that non-trad students are usually very desirable because they have real world experience, are more mature than ""kids"", and they know how to actually work, yet here I am with no calls and no job. 

After none of the engineering internships panned out I even went around town to all the machine shops and metal fabrication shops hoping to get even a part time job where I could learn something practical that would help me be a better engineer, not even any of them were interested, not even one that I offered to work for free for because they seemed like the best place to learn! 

I'm well groomed, I dress well for any professional interactions I have, I believe I'm well spoken, and I have a well of experience to draw from and nobody is interested. 

I guess why I'm here, more than to vent, is to ask for help. Would you HR professionals be willing to look over my resume? Would you be willing to do a mock interview for me and maybe let me know what my shortcomings are? I feel like with out help from people who make these decisions on a daily basis I'm not going to get anywhere or improve my odds. 

Thank you very much for your time reading this and I'm sorry about the wall of text!

:--|:--
[What has been your favorite part of book writing process. Before it's release and now after?  I've seen you mentioned a publisher telling you this book wouldn't sell, was there ever a moment where you questioned yourself and what the success of it would be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshowix?context=5)|My process was unique because most of the writing wasn't written with ""a book"" in mind. i wrote for 10 years and then some of that was collected and turned into a book (along with some brand new writing). My favorite part was once i connected with an agent because suddenly it became real and there was a goal, a finish line, to get a deal, and finally have a book out. It was a lot of work but it all feels worth it now. The book tour was my favorite part, and just being able to read so many comments and tweets from people sharing what the book means to them. 
[Hey, Jamie! I met you a few years ago when you came to my university; you gave an incredible talk, and you were so nice. Thanks for that. :\)  My question is, TWLOHA has obviously grown enormously well-known and successful over the years, so how do you balance the business side with the heart side?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshooep?context=5)|Good question. The events are a big part of that balance. Because i get to meet so many people and those people remind me of the heart of the matter. There's a business (element) that comes with keeping TWLOHA going - today we were looking at office space for example - that's just a reality of being part of an organization. But i'm thankful for the moments that remind me why we do what we do. i just finished two weeks on the road for a book tour. i met so many people and heard so many stories, every single night. 
[Hi Jamie, I have always considered working for a non profit and seeing as yours is one I feel so strongly about, my question is: can being an intern for TWLOHA have the possibility of a future job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshr79v?context=5)|Our team (staff) definitely includes some former interns, so it's a possibility. We always encourage people not to assume or bank on that, because a bunch of factors go into that. Our team is smaller than people think so it's rare we have an opening to hire someone. But we love our interns and we are super grateful for what they give and add, and we love catching up with them after their time with us in Florida. 
[Jamie, how do you keep your head up when faced with stories of pain every single day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshp022?context=5)|I get asked this a lot. My own pain tends to weigh heavier on me than the collective stories i encounter. i've learned boundaries and limitations, that it's not about me (it's impossible) being the hero in every story. After an event or time on the road, i've learned to rest and unplug, and to share what i'm feeling or dealing with a few people around me. 
[Dear Jamie,  I came along your foundation quite by accident and has helped me get past self harm depression and suicidal thoughts. My question is, what would you advise me to say to people whose harmful words about my scars (which come from my very religious family members and my ex-husband\) and past struggles, cause me to want to hide in shame?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshpmdt?context=5)|Boundaries are important. People's words can certainly hurt and i'm sorry you've felt it from people who meant a lot to you. A few things come to mind: Boundaries, meaning you don't have to be close to the people you were once close to, and they can't say whatever they want whenever they want... And the good news is: Other people exist! So find some good ones who do get it and don't cause you to want to hide. And talk to a counselor, because that can definitely help : ) 
[Thank you for all that you have done and are doing Jamie. I know that it's not easy to be raw and open, but these conversations are where healing begins and people can really start to help each other. Can I ask: 1\) what has been the hardest step in this process of helping others? 2\) how does your faith play out in what you do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshq3ue?context=5)|The hardest step is that sometimes people want more than i can give. So learning how to let people down has been, and is at times, hard. We all have a worldview, we all place our faith in places, and for a lot of us it's a journey and it changes over time... And for all of us, how we live, what we do and what we run after, that indicates what we truly believe. i believe in a God who loves me and made me to be loved and known : ) 
[Hi there, I was wondering what I can do to help my less sensitive, less emotional family members to understand me when I'm having a rough patch? They look down on me for being sad. Help! I don't want to shut them out but they hurt my feelings when they mock me for feeling to much.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshp1xo?context=5)|You can only be honest. If they don't understand, it sucks but you can't make them, you can't force it. But the good news is there's a lot of people on this planet and so i would encourage you to fight to find some folks who do get it, people who do want to listen and to know you. And the biggest thing: Know that it's okay to go to counseling. They will listen. They will get it. They can help lead you to change. Peace to you. 
[Hello Jamie! How has your life changed since your book If You Feel Too Much came out? Also, do you have a mailing address or email address where I could send you a letter? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshot5a?context=5)|My life hasn't really changed much, except i got to go on a book tour for two weeks after the book came out, which was amazing. 12 cities all across America. And i got some nice texts and tweets when the book ended up on the NY Times Bestseller list. But now i'm home and things look pretty much the same as they did before : ) 
[Was there a single biggest turning point in your life that made you realize you wanted to devote yourself to the issues of self-harm, depression, and addiction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshodri?context=5)|I suppose it would have to be when i wrote the TWLOHA story in 2006. When that ""went viral,"" that was the turning point. That story basically took on a life of its own and i got to decide if i was willing to take a risk and leave the job i was doing in order to pursue TWLOHA full-time. i'm certainly glad i took that risk. 
[What advice to you have for someone making the first step to finding help? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshop2k?context=5)|Be honest with someone. Tell someone the truth. So that you're not alone with your pain. Beyond that, i absolutely believe in professional help, and that it's perfectly okay and normal to ask for help. This is a great place to start: [Link to twloha.com](http://twloha.com/find-help/local-resources/)
[What advice would you give to other writers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshpq9l?context=5)|Write. Start there. Be honest. We don't have much control over who reads it or if it ends up in a book or if someone wants to turn it into a movie. But we are made to tell stories and to be known. So start there. And read too. They go together : ) 
[Hey Jamie! I love the book and TWLOHA. I've never felt so close to an organization before and what you have done has impacted a lot of people.  My question is where do you see TWLOHA headed in the next 5 to 10 years? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshpdv0?context=5)|Not sure!!! My year has been all about the movie and then the book. i need to take some time to think about the future. i know i want us to keep being creative in bringing a message of hope and help to folks all over. i want us to keep doing different things, and i want that personally. Today we talked about me going to Iraq!
[What are some of the highlights of how your faith or religious sentiment changed over the years? Where are you on that journey now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshpn3l?context=5)|I have more questions these days. i say ""i don't know"" more. i don't want to tell people how to live or think or vote. i want people to feel like their questions matter and that life is worth living, and that they deserve to be loved. 
[Are there any places you would like to visit that you have not yet had the chance to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshqdtt?context=5)|Ireland and Italy come to mind. My Mom's side of the family has irish roots. Italy looks beautiful. Today we talked about me maybe going to Iraq to learn about the work a friend of mine is doing. [Link to www.preemptivelove.org](http://www.preemptivelove.org)
[Which essay in If You Feel Too Much do you feel the most connected to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshptpw?context=5)|Depends on the day. On the book tour, it felt good just to decide each day what i wanted to read. i would say ""There Is Still Some Time"" feels the most important. If i had to pick one, that's my message to the world. 
[You talk a lot about the various forms of love in your book. You also talk about finding love and a family one day. What do you look for in a potential girlfriend/wife?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshp8ex?context=5)|Oh man. That's a tough one. i've figured out they have to be able to make me laugh. And challenge me. i tend to ""feel too much"" so i need someone who understands that and can help encourage me... Someone who believes in the work i do. That would be cool : ) 
[Even in the light of recovery and community, it can be so difficult to share past pains and current hopes and dreams. Has vulnerability and authenticity ever been a struggle for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshpvjw?context=5)|Sure. It still is, and there's always the question of how much is appropriate to share, and where/when it's best shared. i think the most important piece is being known, not in a book or a blog, but in relationships... by a few friends and also by a counselor. 
[What has been your proudest moment in your years with TWLOHA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshotzk?context=5)|This one for sure: [Link to youtu.be](https://youtu.be/33Fo0A3co_)  And then the whole process of IF YOU FEEL TOO MUCH coming out, and being able to share it in the form of a book tour. Both of those times stand out. 
[Knowing that you want to get married one day, do you ever have any doubt that you won't? I know that is one of my biggest fears is that i will never get married. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshror7?context=5)|Sure!!! i definitely struggle with that thought. But my life can't be reduced to that. i can't live or die by just that. Sure, i dream of it and i hope it happens. But there's a lot of beautiful stuff along the way, and we shouldn't miss it. 
[Hey Jamie, I struggle with PTSD and Psychosis. I also struggle with depression and severe anxiety. I am in therapy and working towards recovery but I find it difficult to reach out for help when I need to for fear of being a nusiance. What advice would you give on challenging this fear and not being afraid to reach out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b0hf8/ama_jamie_tworkowski_if_you_feel_too_much/cshoboj?context=5)|I think it's great that you're getting professional help. That's huge and that's the biggest piece. i would say to start by finding a few people you can be honest with, beyond the therapy. And hopefully you can build on it so that you feel like you have a solid support group, and a solid group of friends, over time.

3b1ot5,348,2015-06-25,How to be the most hated intern of all time,antonhansel,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3b1ot5/how_to_be_the_most_hated_intern_of_all_time/,"Gather around fellow IT guys,

This is the tale of my first internship, after only a few months of school.

I was working in a 4500+ employees company operating all around Europe. Their IT service was really understaffed, located in a small city in the countryside. I was employed in a big city where my supervisor, Mr.P was the only IT guy and had to deal with about 300~ employees. 
The IT service was treated so bad that EVERYONE quit at the same time a few months later. But this is a story for next time.

On the friday morning of my first week of internship everything was going fine, Mr.P brought me a NAS in raid1 and told me to erase it, switch it in raid0 and to put it into the server room. He told me that server was named ""NAS-City"".

I looked for the IP using WireShark and found a NAS called ""NASCity"" under some IP. ""NAS-City"" was nowhere to be found, Mr.P was gone until the next monday, I didn't want to appear lazy, I just thought he misspelled the name. I connected to the NAS, the credentials are accepted, I click on ""switch to raid0"".

I shit you not, less than 5 seconds after I clicked someone called the IT office complaining his files were gone. The phone was blinking, mails started to flood the IT service mailbox, shit hit the fan really hard.

Turns out I erased a year worth of work of the service in charge of making the 600 pages catalog for the company products. These guys were all working on files on the NAS, they had no local copy.


The credentials worked because this company is using the exact same credentials for every NAS (400~) they have. ಠ_ಠ

There were about 50 people involved in the making of the catalog and they take their vacation in August, when the catalog goes to printing to be distributed in September.

Well, this year, they all had to cancel their vacations and worked from 7:30AM to 11PM during June, July and August to build back what was deleted. They even had to re-hire models and photographs to take pictures of the products.



The best part? About a month before I arrived in the company, my supervisor sent a mail to this particular service informing them that they should NOT consider this storage safe, that hard drive failure was possible, that there were absolutely no backups.


Needless to say these guys hated me, good times, good times.

I can fall back asleep while im sitting straight up in bed trying to wake up a bit, i often cant even rember being waked up by people earlier that morning (someone saying they woke me up for the 3e time, but i cant recall the first two times)

i life in a house where you must clean everything up after yourself and i do tend to forget quite some things 
Incuding chores in house, getting some grocerys, cooking dinner ect., this afcourse resluting in pissed parents, eventhough i dont forget it intentionally(they also need to get used to that i have ADD)

i eat very unhealthy (not sure if related though) i eat 1 slice of bread at breakfast with a glass of milk, at lunch i eat nothing or 1-2 slices of bread
and dinner, and some water during the day

i also get hungery at weird times (again, not sure if related) normally i eat about 1/5th of a plate at dinner, but eat 2-3 more plates around 8-9 in the evening

on school i'm always strugelling to pay attention.
if i find the subject intresting i start to go off topic with it and start thinking about other possibilitys, and when im not intrested i normally fall asleep
Also during my internship i forgot i had test at school i had to take cuasing me to have half a year delay now

when i start gaming i lose my sense of time, and if im alone i can play easily 12-15 hours without realising i have been playing for that long
(p.s. does anyone else start sweating quite a bit when they game and get into a hyperfocus?)

i often go somewhere and forgetting something that i need at that place (Example:go to the gym and forget my bag, clothes)

being distracted while talking to people, your trying your best to focus on them talking but somehow your thoughts are louder and you simply cant understand him, this happens to me; face to face, telephone, and skype

when i'm in groups and more then one person talk at the same time, then i slowly get a headace developing into a panic attack if i do nothing about it ofcourse the bigger the group the faster the development (this is almost reduced to zero when im high or quite drunk)

Becuase of a lot of these things i also dont really hang out with people, since i sleep till late in the weekends, and when i start gaming that day is basically over, also i dont hear what they say 75% of the time forget i would meet them ect.
so i keep it with friends just to talking over chat

and if i find something intresting to do, i can completely obsess about it and waste way too much time on it to perfect it and add things that arent that neccery

Also i wanted to learn to learn to programm, however i have massive trouble to start with this

When i talk (or type) my brain thinks faster then i talk(type) sometimes cuasing me to leave one to a few words or even complete sentences 

If anyone got some tricks or ways you could deal with these kinda things then i would highly appriciate it

TL;DR
Got problems with :falling asleep, wakeing up, Forgetting to cleanup/do chores in house, bad eating habits, cant stay on subject on school, lose sence of time during gameing, forgetting important things, have trouble in groups, fun things obsess me, have problems starting with bigger things

and if anyone has any trick/solution/method to deal with one of these things then id highly appriciate it if you would be willing to share it.


Side notes:
im new to reddit, please tell if i didnt reddit right

and for the people wondering, yes i have been diagnosed with ADD

3b2jko,3,2015-06-25,The Interest Inflation,cnokha,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/3b2jko/the_interest_inflation/,"I'll begin by stating that will probably be in the wrong sub-reddit but also relate to social anxiety or mild cases of depression.

So I've got this pattern I've started to notice ever more strongly after starting my therapy sessions, and I've always kind of noticed this feeling being with me wherever I go or whatever I do. The feeling of impulses, stronger at the beginning but after the initial pulse it fades very quickly.

Let me elaborate. Ever since from my childhood I've never had a 'thing of my own', I'd follow the booming trends in hopes of finding something special, something for me, something I would love to do. I've had my part of searching through hobbies, only to find nothing to fully satisfy my hunger, nothing to keep me interested long enough, no real drive for things.

And it hasn't been limited to just hobbies. I've never really had a life goal to pursue, more like aimlessly drifting through life and now here I am, 25 years old and at complete lack of drive. There is however, one thing that I've managed to kept close to my interests and that is video gaming. Nearly 20 years now but it's still the only thing constant in my life and the only thing I fall back to. But even that is beginning to change and I've recently started feeling this void building up inside of me, slowly eating me from inside out. And now I'm afraid I'll never find anything to fill the void again. Video gaming has been in my life so long I don't think I could live entirely without it, but there isn't anything to really replace or support my interests.

The way I feel this fits in social anxiety is in reality I think this feeling, the void inside, is what keeps me from fully getting into new experiences as a part of me feels the initial feeling will not last for too long and I'll just eventually grow numb or bored of it. Same thing applies to supported internships I've been attending to recently. After the initial feeling of being part of something, doing something useful, it quickly fades into nothingness.

While all this sounds more like depression than social anxiety, I don't relate myself to the descriptions. I do, however, recognize some characteristics of hypomania or the milder form hypermania in myself.

If nothing else, I'd like to know if anyone else has these kind of feelings, and how they deal with them?

P.S. Sorry for a rambly train-of-thoughts post, can't quite think straight right now"

I'm look at going back to college soonish, and I'm thinking it might be more in my interest to get an associates first, get a job in CS, and go for a bachelor's part time, but I'd like to know what kind of jobs I could get with an associates and what the work environment would be like, especially compared to if I had a bachelor's.

The reason for this is that from previous coursework, I should be able to get enrolled at the local community college and get an associate's in CS in a year. Getting a bachelor's would take *at least* 3 years for the courses, and probably another year to get enrolled. Difference of 3 years stuck at a job I hate.

Also, if it wouldn't be too much to ask, could I get some input on which of these two associates are better for me? 

* [Programming for Database/Web](http://mccneb.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2015-2016/Course-Catalog/Programs-of-Study/Information-Technology-and-E-Learning/Information-Technology/Information-Technology-Degree-Options/Information-Technology-Programming-for-DatabaseWeb-ITDWO) which includes coursework in C++, but seems to have less web-specific courses and has no internship requirement. That makes it seem like it would be more difficult for me to find a job, but C++ is what the bachelor's program is built around

* [Web Development](http://mccneb.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2015-2016/Course-Catalog/Programs-of-Study/Information-Technology-and-E-Learning/Information-Technology/Information-Technology-Degree-Options/Information-Technology-Web-Development-ITWDO), which has a lot of front-end and design coursework and an internship requirement, but less of the classes will transfer to the four year college and it's built more around web design then web development.

My mentor and supervisors have been very helpful with as much as they can, but unfortunately I chose to build this in WPF, and they are all familiar with Windows Forms, so I have been on my own for many problems I have run into. I feel like my progress is getting slower and slower, nothing is working properly, my code feels messy, and I am getting further and further behind schedule. 

I desperately want to perform up to their expectations and deliver a working product, but I am starting to feel a bit hopeless. The schedule has us beginning testing in a week and I feel like i'm nowhere near ready due to how slow everything is going.

Feels like I keep hitting wall after wall and i'm not really sure what to do at this point."

3b3wtz,2,2015-06-25,[VA] Landlord lying about cost of repairs and demanding I pay difference.,ThanklessPanda,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3b3wtz/va_landlord_lying_about_cost_of_repairs_and/,"Hi.

M/21 college student moved from my parents house April 15th of this year to a place I found on Craigslist. Guy (let's call him Andy) who lived here seemed really nice, 22 years old, his parents owned the place but lived overseas. We hit it off pretty well, for the first week we have nice conversations over dinner and go through 3-4 bottles of (my) wine. He left ten days after I moved in, as he had to go work an internship in LA, and I've since been here on my own. He mentioned in conversation that the AC doesn't work very well on the hotter days and some days he sleeps in the basement. Something else to consider, to make myself seem a good candidate as a roommate, I informed him of my finances. I'm not affluent by any means, but while attending community college, I've waited tables full-time since I was 18 and saved (and invested) the majority of the money I've made, so I do have more of a cushion than most people my age.

June 9th the AC broke, so I ask Andy what he wants to do about it- He says he's having a stressful week, but will look into it when he has time. June 18th (after the hottest week so far this year, RIP) he arranges to have a family friend (heretofore referred to as Michael) come over and look at it. Michael is great, and by the 19th he's replaced the motor and the AC is working fine. 

Throughout all of this, the subject of payment comes up, and Andy and I have been texting back and forth trying to determine who is responsible for paying for the repair of the AC. The relevant part of the contract states 

&gt; &gt;  RESIDENT acknowledges that he has examined the premises and that said premises, all furnishings, fixtures, furniture, plumbing, heating, electrical facilities, all items listed on the attached property condition checklist, if any, and/or all other items provided by OWNER all are clean, and in good satisfactory condition except as may be indicated elsewhere in this Agreement. RESIDENT agrees to keep premises and all items in good order and good condition and to immediately pay for costs t o repair and/or replace any portion of the above damaged by RESIDENT, his guests and/or invitees, except as provided by law. At the termination of this Agreement, all of above items in this provision shall be returned to OWNER in clean and good condition except for reasonable wear and tear and the premises shall be free of all personal property and trash not belonging to OWNER. It is agreed that all dirt, holes, tears, burns, and stains of any size or amount in the carpets, drapes, walls, fixtures, and/or any other part of the premises, do not constitute reasonable wear and tear.

Reasonable wear and tear being key here.

Speaking with Michael, he's told me that the filter in the fan has likely never been replaced since the house was built in 1982. He also said that the AC was the original unit that came with the house, and that he'd have replaced the entire unit instead of just the motor had Andy not told him to try and keep the fix as cheap as possible. Upon inquiring, Michael told me that the motor for a unit such as this typically costs about $300.

Over text, my landlord asks me if I'll take the bill so long as the cost is under $900. $900?! For a $300 motor and a few hours of labor. No. After more conflict, he finally agrees to paying 50% of the cost of repair. I offer to take 60% of the burden so long as he takes it 'as a gesture of gratitude, not one of guilt.' Then the next day he finally hits saying that 'theoretical roof' of $900 is the actual bill. I knew something was up, so the next day I spoke with Michael, and he told me he charged Andy $380 TOTAL. Upon hearing this, I wanted to make it very clear that I was no longer grateful, and the next day I deposited a check of $190 into Andy's bank account. 50% of $380. I don't hear anything from him for the next two days, until I receive via email an invoice demanding I pay $540 (60% of $900), or he will remove it from the safety deposit I paid him upon moving in. 

Please send help.

I'm trying to upload all of the texts between both myself and my landlord / myself and Michael. Imgur doesn't like my jpg's for some reason though. Have a Doctor's appointment to go to, but I'll try and upload pictures when I get back.

tl;dr I feel like I shouldn't be paying anything, I offered to pay 60% of what I expected to be a reasonable bill, I'm demanded to pay 60% of what is ~2.5x the actual bill. "
3b40or,5,2015-06-25,Can junior developers and startups mix well?,ccricers,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3b40or/can_junior_developers_and_startups_mix_well/,"I've been thinking about this more and more as I've read stories on here about very new startups hiring people right out of college, and inadequately preparing them for the professional world. Or offering them laughably low wages. Or even stories like being a sophomore intern having the most technical experience out of anyone in the company. Yikes! I too have been burned out by startups in the past, namely that they didn't want to take a big risk on me by deciding to hire me (and a few other people) as a 1099 instead of a W2 but I still have to show up at the office and work certain hours.

To this I ask, are many startups doing more harm than good by hiring inexperienced developers? Working for one is almost like gambling and I believe that's better suited for people who can afford to lose what they put in. Most junior employees aren't ready for that. A lot of them are still paying off college debt. And they would need all the financial stability they could get. 

Sometimes I wish managers and business owners in more startups would hire only senior-level employees first. When a business is financially uncertain and looking for a direction, it doesn't make sense to hire developers that are in a similar state of mind."

I am one year out of my undergraduate studies and 3 semesters into my Masters of Library and Information Science program, where I am specializing in archives management. I am completing my program online. I have archives, museum, and library experience, but they are all entry level or internship type experiences. I have a total of about 2 years professional experience in my field from these jobs. 

I recently moved for my fiance's career advancement, leaving a job that was great experience but paid very little (21,000.) I have had two in person interviews at libraries, and have another 2 interviews pending in the next two weeks. I just applied for a job as a Museum Educator that is perfect for me, and I have already heard back from the institution they will begin interviewing in a few weeks. It is a small museum, and a position that was not well-advertised, so I think I have a decent chance. 

I am asking for advice because yesterday I had a phone interview for a job that isn't technically in my field, but could lead to advancement. I was given the impression that the manager wanted to hire me on the spot, but needed to go through the standard process. It is a temporary clerical position in the registrar’s office of a university, but the work is all remote and I already go to school online. It pays much more than I’ve ever made (30,000) but I have my doubts about coping with so much computer screen time and so little human interaction. It also isn’t in my field, but the manager said it was typical for temps to be hired in other departments when their terms were up. It could be a way to get into the library department, but nothing is certain. 


I have been burned in the job search before because my expectations often surpass reality. I don’t think I’m crazy for thinking this temporary clerical position is within my grasp, but I don’t want to accept a job offer if there’s potential to work in my field immediately, instead of potentially, maybe, a year from now. My fiancé is temporarily supporting me, and feels no qualms about me finding the “right” position, but I feel a lot of pride in being financially independent and want to avoid not working for much longer. I’m a relatively marketable candidate because I am competent, educated, and willing to accept not a whole lot of money, because I’m entry level. What would you do in my situation?

TL;DR: Should I wait for the right opportunity, or take an opportunity that isn’t perfect but could make good connections?

I just finished my freshman year. I'm interning at a rather small company. It's pretty boring. There's only 2 full time software engineers and they often leave for several days and otherwise are very busy because there's a lot of things to do for just two engineers. I'm one of four interns. It's excruciating because I often need guidance even to get things going and the full-timers can't provide it because they're busy. Often I end up with quite literally nothing to do for hours on end. On top of that the work is often just busy-work and grunt-work and intellectually uninteresting. This internship has essentially made me despise programming and software engineering for the time being. I'm not even sure if I want to major in computer science anymore. I'm more unhappy now than I have ever been in my entire life. I really hate going to bed every night because it means I have to wake up and go to work. I'm making a reasonable amount of money, and money is meaningful to me, but not essential. I could leave now and be financially ok.. as long as they don't take away the money I've already made (it's in my bank account: could they ask for it back?), because then I would have lost a lot of money for housing. I'm paid weekly so it wouldn't be that immoral... or would it? What should I do? I feel like I'm wasting a few of the best months of my life for absolutely no benefit... I have plenty of productive things that I would like to do instead; I certainly wouldn't be playing video games or something."
3b4xxs,2,2015-06-25,How to Build Wealth While You're Young,AmberModernAdvisor,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/3b4xxs/how_to_build_wealth_while_youre_young/,"I see a lot of people asking how to build wealth while they're young, so I wanted to share my thoughts on some basic principles.

First of all, the secret to building wealth depends on your ability to: 

1. Build good habits.
2. Maintain a frugal lifestyle for a number of years.
3. Make your money work for you.

The younger you are, the better chance you have of building up a large sum of money for retirement, since you have one huge advantage over the older generation: time.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are some ways to implement the principles: 

&amp;nbsp;

***If you're still in school:*** 

&amp;nbsp;

**Got student loans? You can still build assets!**
Don’t put 100% of your funds into paying off debt, stash some of it away – even a small portion, every single month and put it in a tax-free savings account such as a TFSA.

**Secure internships during summer**
Typically, internships pay quite well and will allow you to put away several thousand if you are able to keep your living expenses low – perhaps living with Mom and Dad isn’t so bad after all?

**Work part-time during term time**
This will allow you greater networking opportunities for when you do graduate and prepare you in advance for paying off your student loans. As a consequence you could end up increasing your earning potential and reducing your debt!

**Look for student grants**
Grants are a huge opportunity to get some free money that you don’t have to pay back. Only in school part-time? There are grants for you, too! Find out more about how you can apply on the canlearn website.  

&amp;nbsp;


***If you're employed full time, not in school:*** 

&amp;nbsp;

**Maintain a frugal lifestyle**
If it saves you money, perhaps consider sharing with roommates to split the utility bills and monthly payments.

Despite popular opinion by Generation X, renting is not throwing away money if it allows you to put the money you would otherwise spent on substantial purchase and maintenance costs into well-planned investments.

**Learn to love minimalism**
Find something that you love to do. Try and take up something which produces more than it consumes – like a competing in a sport, playing an instrument or learning to code.

Find an inner-strength that allows you to create – we naturally become better at things we practice and we tend to practice things that we love. Once we are able to produce something better than someone can do for themselves, we are able make money from it.

This may very well end up being a source of income for you in the future and it provides you (and possibly others) with entertainment at the same time.

**Take advantage of RRSP contribution matching.**
Does your employer match your savings in an RRSP? If so – there aren’t many other places you’ll get free money. Max this out at your first opportunity!

&amp;nbsp;

3b54ux,4,2015-06-25,Looking for possible internships on west coast,michael1026,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3b54ux/looking_for_possible_internships_on_west_coast/,"I want to do an internship next summer, after completing my sophomore year doing software engineering and cyber security, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be applying for internships. I know one that I want to apply for is NASA JPL. I'd absolutely love to work there, even if it's only for a few months. I know I probably won't actually get it, but I want to at least apply. I'm wondering what other internships are worth applying to. Oregon is preferred, but not needed."

I just finished up my third year of a Computer Science degree. I've never had an internship before, and I am nervous. I do not have much coding experience besides class projects, and I'm unfamiliar with the field the internship is in (DevOps). 

My boss, as far as I can tell, is incredibly understanding and impressed with me so far. I am nervous that he'll see I'm not the best coder, possibly slower to learn/catch on than he anticipated, and overall not meeting expectations.

I want to be a great intern, and hopefully get a job offer after I graduate next year. I've started to learn the basics of the language I'll be using this summer as well as review some of the tools that have been mentioned to me, but I feel a little overwhelmed.

Any tips of how to be a great intern, exceed my bosses expectations, and be programming daily at a job for the first time would be greatly appreciated."
3b5d8g,1,2015-06-25,Should I go back to school?,ProtoJazz,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/3b5d8g/should_i_go_back_to_school/,"I'm not sure if this is the right place, but I'm feeling kind of lost today and not sure what to do. 

I was in university for about 2 years working on a bachlor of applied computer science. Over one summer I got an internship at a company I really liked, and at the end they offered me a full time job. (It was a small mobile games company) I worked there for 2 years, and then unfortunately had to be laid off due to a big downsize at the company. 

Since then I've been doing freelance work,  at much better pay, and overall I'm pretty happy at the moment. 

One of the freelance gigs I picked up was teaching a class on game development through a local university continuing education program. One important distinction I was not the person who created the course, or was listed as an instructor by the school. I was contracted by the instructor, paid by him, and was also the instructor listed on the end of class reviews. I did however come up with the content of each class, and Mark it all, with approval of the instructor, and did all instruction on my own. 

Since these classes were wrapping up for the summer, I inquired with the school about doing my own classes through the same continuing education program. And they have said they wouldn't allow it since I did not have a degree. Apparently 3 months of teaching a course in the same field, and excellent student reviews don't count. They told me I should go back to school, and contact them when I graduate. 

I'm currently making about $20/$30 (Canadian) an hour doing part time and freelance work, wich still leaves some time for my personal projects, and I like that. 

I've had a few prospective employers tell me I should go back to school, most just based on the fact I have no degree. Should I listen to them? One of the reasons I chose not to go back is I was having difficulty passing 1 of the 2 math requirement. 

Would I be making more money? Would it be worth the time and money to go back? Or should I just seek out other employment, or other schools to teach through? 

Edit : replace companies I applied to, with interviewed with. I have no idea what the people that never contacted my thought. "

As the title says, this is my first time building a PC.  I've been using a crappy laptop for the past several years and I'm finally getting enough money (paid internship) to be able to afford this.  Primary usage will be gaming, probably with video settings turned up high, as I'm quite tired of setting everything to rock bottom just to make games run.  I've done what I think is a decent amount of research, and I am a CS major, so I'm not totally clueless when it comes to computers.  Thought it would be good to check this build with people who actually know what they're doing, though.

3b5s19,17,2015-06-26,Arc Flash Freddy (NSFW),PowerSystemsGuy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3b5s19/arc_flash_freddy_nsfw/,"""We've had some Arc Flash incidents happen where tech's weren't wearing suits. You know what an arc flash is, right? It's basically an explosion, a big fireball that engulfs everything in front of it. One mistake and you're left with 3rd or even 4th degree burns"" 

And that would wind up our safety meeting, and conclude my orientation at Power Systems Inc. I walked into the sales office and sat down in my cubicle. I worked a full day and went home, as I went throught the shop to clock out, I noticed a door in an unusual place. The shop was over 2 stories tall, on the 2nd level there was a door that had no platform or ladder or anything to access it, and as far as I knew it didn't lead to any place I could access it. One of the techs walked up to me, ""Hey buddy, name's Freddy. How was your first day?"" I told him it went well. He smiled. ""Glad to hear it. I love this company. I never want to leave. I hope you stay too"".

The next day I came in, and didn't see Freddy. I asked another tech if he had seen him. The tech said he didn't know who I was referring to, but admitted he was new and told me he'd let me know if he met anyone like that. 

While I was eating lunch in the break room, I saw Freddy walk in. ""Hey boss, Alex said you were looking for me."" I answered back casually, ""Yeah, you've been here a while, right. So I'm curious, what's up with that door, the one that's just kind of floating there I guess? I can't find where it connects to, so yeah, just curious.""

""Oh I wouldn't worry about that, Brian. It's probably nothing, but don't try to go in, it's dangerous."" 

Freddy left, and Alex came over, he'd been sitting at the other table. ""I didn't say shit to that guy, this is the first I've seen him. There's no Freddy working in the shop either"" 

Alex went to go tell security. I was standing at the door of the break room looking at the floating door, wondering what could be in there, and who Freddy was, and why he didn't want me to look in that room. I had to find out. I found a ladder, and moved it over to the door. ""Hey, don't do that"" - It was Freddy. ""There's nothing important up there. We don't need anything in there. It's a waste of time okay?"" Footsteps and voices drew closer, and I ran over to them.

""Did you see this Freddy guy?"" Said security. I told him I had, I then described him. I was interrupted by a man named Jake from sales. ""That sounds like Freddy James. He used to work here."" The security guard said, ""Did he have a grudge against the company?"" The salesman replied, ""Well the kid I'm referring to is actually dead unfortunately, he died 3 years ago in an arc flash."" 

I told them that the guy didn't want me to go into the room behind the floating door, and maybe he was up to something in there. We took a scissorlift up there and walked in. The room was full of Arc Flash Suits and other protective gear. But there was something else, a burning smell. We heard footsteps ahead and turned on the lights. In front of us stood a horribly mangled man, his skin was charred black and red. Clear and yellow fluid ozzed down his face and arms. His left eye was missing, his right eye was  glazed over. Patches of flesh were missing and the blackened bone was visible underneath. He wore a badly burned jumpsuit. I couldn't make out the name on it but I knew who it was. 

""Guys, we don't need these suits! They're hot, and uncomfortable and you can't see shit in them. Nothing bad is going to happen! Nothing bad is going to happen""

He began to walk towards us. We ran out and closed the door. 

The next day, we had the suits moved. The entrance was sealed to the door on the second floor. There were also rumors that a priest came in on the weekend. Everyone had heard about our encounter with Arc Flash Freddy, but no one ever saw him again, until yesterday. An intern walked into my cubicle and told me Freddy wanted to see me......"
3b5z0i,1,2015-06-26,Trouble trying to learn any language. Seeking advice,OfficerPickles,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3b5z0i/trouble_trying_to_learn_any_language_seeking/,"tldr; What can I do to focus more and not get distracted and/or stay interested? 

I've been trying to learn to code, for the better part of a decade, and I'm not having much luck. I'm easily distracted when I try to code. I took a few programming classes at a community college and a concepts class when I worked on my BS. My ASS is science - web dev and the BS is CIS with a focus on systems and network administration. I didnt have a problem with them. My work experience is primarily application and system support. I did intern for a few years as a developer primarily working on BEA aqualogic and sharepoint, which is when I found out that I'm driven more by the system/network field. 

I feel I'm limiting myself by not learning to properly code. My current job doesnt require much, just a simple script here and there. I do not want to keep going and be in the same spot that I'm in now a few years down the road.

I started trying to learn programming with books, because thats what I did in school. I start off strong but it seems each day I become less and less interested. I then tried creating projects for myself and diving in, looking up everything needed to complete the project. By the time I'd get done with it, I no longer had interest in it. The solution the project was supposed to remedy was no longer necessary or something else caught my eye and I worked on that instead. From there, I tried things like codecademy. It seemed to monotonous and I'd lose interest, sometimes within 10-15 minutes. So, I'm back to projects at the moment. 

Its like I come across a small hurdle and go off to tackle it then get side tracked by something new and shiny and lose interest in what I was doing. For example, this current project I'm working on I figured I'd get an IDE or simple text editor with highlighting. Took me two days (went with atom btw). Then I selected the OS... linux. Installed that. Then I thought, well if I'm going to do this right and make it functional, I probably need a test environment that covers everything. So now I'm sitting here with a apache on ubuntu, msyql on freebsd, a windows 2008 as a dc/dns , a freebsd fileserver, a squid box, and 1 windows / 1 nix desktop to confirm... with everything behind a freebsd firewall. So now I'm ready to dive in, but the problem is that I KNOW that I'm going about this all wrong. 

I just cant push myself to concentrate on just one thing and its like a small form of torture when I can see that the reason I'm failing is because of these faults. 

I even went out and bought a chromebook, because I thought I'd just sit there in an environment with nothing else to do but code in an online IDE. Then I came across something that I couldnt do in chrome so now I'm running Crouton and I'm back to square one. Today I was on craigslit looking for a rack server so I can move all those vms onto it esxi and manage it through that. This is the same shit that happens every time I try to learn. 

I dont know, I guess I'm just frustrated and ranting. Anyone have any suggestions? Anyone go through something similar and find a solution? What can I do to stay focused and not lose interest?

I'll be starting my final year at University in 3 months. Until then I have an offer as a Machine Learning Assistant at my University. At this point, I am unsure as to what I want my future career plans to be. I am, however, interested in being a software developer / product manager in the big 4 or preferably in the game development industry over the next years to come. Its not set in stone, but I find the prospect exciting. But I've been trying to get internships and the like with little luck. This offer is the only thing that I have for now.

As much as I'd like to work at the big 4, or in the game development industry, I know that I will have to complete a Masters in CS at the very least and I'd want to stand a good chance at being accepted at a Top 25. I have the grades for it, but that's all I have. (I'm at a top 75 right now)

All things considered, would it be a good choice to go forward with this position? I have strong skills in Python and have taken Coursera's Machine Learning course prior to it?

Would machine learning be a good field to go into? At the moment I find it interesting, but I don't know if I'd be a good fit given that I prefer creative things like games.

All in all. My concern is, should I accept this position and will it help me in my goals for the future (University, Job) or should I work on my development portfolio in the free time that I have and pick up other skills?

This build has been a long time in the making. I helped my friend build his PC 3 or 4 years ago, and have wanted to do so myself for a long time. I started researching parts and planning my build in February, which in hindsight was probably not the best idea--I knew I wouldn't be able to do this build until June, which gave me ~4 months to squirm with anxiety waiting for it to happen. Finally in late May I received an advance on my housing allowance for my summer internship, and the part-purchasing could commence. I should have waited a bit longer--I bought the 980 HOF (probably a terrible decision anyways, but that white cooler/PCB would've looked pretty sweet) a week before the 980 Ti was released, but I managed to return the HOF so it worked out.

Getting the SSD bracket onto the PSU cover was a bit tricky. The metal wasn't thick enough to thread if I just drilled a plain old hole, so I had to drill smaller holes, then use a punch to make them wider and 'deeper,' and then thread them. Then I just took the SSD mounting bits from the back side of the case and threw 'em on.

I'll go into a little bit more detail about the selection process and reaction for some of the parts:

**Monitor:** I'm loving the 1440p IPS Dell monitor--25"" is the perfect size, too. Has plenty of real estate and looks incredible. I might add a second 1080p (maybe 1440p) 144hz monitor in the future, but not for a while at least. 

**Case:** I was thinking about getting the Corsair 600T case originally, but when I saw the Enthoo Luxe, I knew I had found what I wanted. Cable management was a breeze (see photos) and the build couldn't have gone more smoothly. Currently set up for positive pressure with 5 intake fans and 1 exhaust, in combination with the dust filters it should be a while before I have to clean out the insides. 

**GPU:** This thing is a monster. Overclocked to ~1450 MHz, it gets 60-100 fps on Crysis 3 on very high at 1440p, and more importantly over 600 on League of Legends. I'm installing some more games and will test the waters on Witcher 3 soon. *Note: I read that I should be able to get over 1500 Mhz on the card but can't seem to push it any higher than it is already. Any advice would be appreciated.* 

Most other part selection choices were fairly straightforward for me after deciding to go with X99 for workstation/CAD/rendering etc. 

Hope you guys enjoyed checking out my build! I learned a ton from browsing this subreddit for the last few months, and couldn't have done it without you guys. I'm hoping it'll stay strong for a long time, and I can't wait to build another PC!

*P.S. Anyone know how to make those GPU cables straight and nice and tidy?? I have cable combs but they still kind of look like crap :/*

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all the positive responses and feedback! As I said above, this build wouldn't have been possible without /r/buildapc. Thanks again!"
3b7v3v,1,2015-06-26,"Hi, I need career advice from fellow programmers.",rougeLeafNinja,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3b7v3v/hi_i_need_career_advice_from_fellow_programmers/,"Hi, reddit. I am self taught Web developer. I know html,css,js/jquery really well and bit of nodejs.

No angular or bootstrap however.

My dilemma is this:

I've been searching for job for like forever now. I have been doing small annoying wordpress work. But Now finally i have gotten a job  offer with company which i am very sure is going to hire me, since we had multiple interviews and programming related test. They have over 50 employees. And are not just a startup.

They told me they will train me a bit for a month or so.

Now I had already applied to Bootcamp called falrtrion school fellowship is being sponsored by nyc govt. They will teach me for 6 months. This is so amazing free coding teaching. I applied last year didnt' get accepted, i applied this year and got accepted. I studied hard for it, and did well on their interview tests too. I was excited to finally start.

However NOW I stand at crossroads where i need to make decision. Possible scenarios:

1. I start going to bootcamp, graduate and start making 65k.

2. I start a job and start making 55k and let go bootcamp.

3. i start a job and tell bootcamp that even though i was accepted i want to start from next semester. (im sure they will say no).

4. i start bootcamp gets graduated dont get hired. Back to square 2 if not 1 after six months of no money.

5. i start a job leave bootcamp, job fires me in a month. (can they fire you so fast? IMPORTANT!!). No money, no bootcamp, and unlikely to get hired again anytime soon. 

6. i start bootcamp since it starts early, wait for job offer and then leave bootcamp if i get accepted. 

at job ill be doing front end stuff..at bootcamp i'll learn backend and mix of frontend. Ill get internships with good companies too.

However point of bootcamp is to get a job. A year of experience in job is better than year in bootcamp?

I'm so lost and confused help me please..

Personally i want to start a job, i can learn the few things that bootcamp teaches and i dont know myself. But i'd have loved to get mentors and good internships. 

Right now my mind is set to go for the job, seems logical choice. Half year of unpaid, vs paid actual experince.

But one thing is stomping me...if they fire me say after 2 months. It'd be lose lose situation and the bootcamp would never talk to me again, probably.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[In counter-intelligience, how often does someone actually experience a car chase, spy vs spy duel, or other such movie antics? Is it mostly just gathering enough evidence until you can book someone no problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjh77v?context=5)|So counter-intelligence ops against diplomats are not law enforcement activities, you are not really building a case against somebody to bring to trial. This means that sometimes what you can and can't do is a little different :)
 |I did get to drive super fast a few times (I had a Corvette at the time), but I didn't want to have to explain to the police why I was going 100mph with military manuals in the car (and I'm pretty sure the FBI didn't want to explain that either)!
 |There is definitely aggressive maneuvering to shake surveillance and to employ counter-surveillance. But generally it is first and foremost mental combat -- think of it as chess on steroids (i'm not sure if that makes it lame or not)!
[Have spy movies like the 007 series been ruined?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjiesy?context=5)|I love spy movies!! As has been mentioned my story is in the process of becoming a movie over at 20th Century Fox. It will be directed by Marc Webb (Spiderman series) and the screen writer is Mark Heyman (the Wrestler and Black Swan). I am so excited to see what they do with this! I hope my story can be added to the spy movie genre as well!
[I hope you know that I will brag to all my friends that I talked you when the movie comes out.  And I will check out the book soon. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjisqu?context=5)|TY!
[How did you relay information to the FBI during your time as double agent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjh62a?context=5)|Everything was done in-person, both with the Russians and FBI. As has been reported by the press was the Russian penchant for meeting at Hooters: [Link to www.washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/06/11/how-an-american-slacker-caught-a-russian-spy-at-a-new-jersey-hooters/)
[Were you monitored often by Russian intelligence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjh62a?context=5)|I'm sure the Russians monitored me and used surveillance and counter-surveillance, but I never knew definitively. A man coming into the bathroom right after me when I was meeting with my Russian case agent, could've just had to pee -- or he could've been making sure I wasn't calling the FBI! You never really know!
[What did your handler offer you in exchange for your service? Money, sanctuary, drugs, prostitutes, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjiute?context=5)|Because a human being can offer context on the information she/he is delivering. Case in point, every job I ever started the orientation included where the bathroom was, how to use the shared drive, etc, etc. Without the orientation, it would be pretty hard working there.  If somebody in China is sifting through raw data, good luck trying to understand the context and nuances of what they are looking for. It's always easier to have somebody explaining what things means. Plus it's cheaper and harder to detect.
[How does the Russian government recruit spies in the US?  How successful have they been with infiltrating the US?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjggr0?context=5)|Recruiting assets is an art more then it is a science. It should be noted that the most damaging spies that worked for the USSR and Russia were not recruited, rather, they were volunteers. They made contact with the Russians and offered to help them of their own free will! Sadly, that will continue to happen.
[What's the deal with numbers stations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjhdok?context=5)|People think that the Russian use of low tech tools is because they are incompetent or lack sophistication. That is not true. They know our cyber capabilities and know that using technology can be easily monitored. As such, in person meetings and one way communications (even low-tech methods) are the most secure.
[What are your thoughts on Dmitri Polyakov, aka TopHat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjhdok?context=5)|As I said before, spies who have worked against us not only damage our national security but they result in the death of people. Polyakov is a sad example of that.
[How would you compare the Russian agency vs an American agency? What is the biggest difference? Strength weakness etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjgir5?context=5)|The Russians are very professional and capable. For an Intelligence Officer (IO) to be posted in somewhere like NYC, they have to be very good at what they do. Coming to the states is not an IOs first posting, it's where seasoned officers come. My time in this op was spent in NYC, so the lead agency in my case was the FBI. My FBI handlers were professional and extremely competent. They also had a healthy professional respect for the Russians. 
[Have Russian agents ever illegally crossing the border or do they  arrive legally as diplomats, tourists, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjgsu4?context=5)|There are generally two kinds of spies: diplomats and those who assume non-official cover (noc). It should be noted that ""spies"" don't actually spy, rather, they recruit indigenous people to spy for them. So the more appropriate title would be case agent or spy handler.
[What was motivation for the recruited assets who worked for Russia/USSR? Were they cash-strapped or ideologically communist, Marxist, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjgsu4?context=5)|There are many reasons that people spy, but primarily it is a combination of ego and money. This is something I talk a lot about in my book -- [Link to www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/How-Catch-Russian-Spy-American/dp/1476788820)
[Spy Game is a pretty good movie too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjrerj?context=5)|My favorite spy movie is without a doubt Spy Game. Robert Redford is fantastic in this movie (as is Brad Pitt). The scenes with Redford meeting with other Agency types as looking at papers in mirrors, is very much how we conducted business!
 |I'm going to have watch that movie again tonight! So good!
[Do you worry about your safety at all, after having been a double agent? And have you made any changes in your day-to-day life to ensure your continued safety?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjg1x6?context=5)|No. Russian military intelligence is a professional organization. They follow the unwritten rules -- plus they would have nothing to gain by harming me. I'm more worried about sharks and bears (not the Russian kind).
 |I would add that I do get semi-trolled online, and my book has not received favorable reviews from pro-Putin outlets. But then again I got a great blurb from the creator of Archer -- so it's all good!
[Apparently you don't need to be afraid of the gay kind anymore either.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjo4ey?context=5)|I just got the bear joke! I was thinking along the lines of Colbert's joke of bears!
 |Another reason this is the best country in the world! Russia has a long way to go, so sad that they can't treat their own people with decency and respect, regardless of their beliefs or who they want to marry.
[I know many people are wondering, how close is your job to that of 007's? Do you use any cool gadgets and cars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjio0m?context=5)|I had a watch that was a recording device, and a 550hp blacked out C6 Z06 that I drove (it was mine). The cool parts of meeting with the Russians was outnumbered by long meetings to plan and game out things. Not to mention the powerpoint presentations I did (yuck!). So it was 25/75 cool vs not cool. But the cool stuff was waaay cool! Which is I why kept doing it for all those years!
[What do you think of Edward Snowden ? From your perspective what kind of impact he has created on espionage communities ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csklpu4?context=5)|I'm not a fan of his. I think at this point he is a propaganda tool used by the Russians as part of a very successful information warfare campaign. I think most people who understand who he is and what he did have a real strong dislike for him. He started off as self-serving person who will end his days as a puppet of the Russian state. I bet he regrets his decision to do what he did.
[I'm slightly late but I'm a little curious. How was the process of transitioning from a double agent to writing a book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjxvfd?context=5)|They were actually pretty similar insofar as the actual writing went. I sat down with my co-author Ellis Henican and for more then 6 months I'd head down to his apt where we talked, wrote, re-wrote and then we argued, and the next day we did all over again. It's a good thing we liked each other :)
 |This was  what it was like to work with the FBI -- it was more like being in a start-up then anything else!
[Why do you do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjga8m?context=5)|In my case I started because I wanted to get ""work experience"" so that I could apply to become an officer in the US Navy. So it started off almost as an internship for me -- something to pump up my resume. After doing it, the challenge of going head-to-head with a senior Russian became a challenge in itself -- and heck of a motivation!
[Did you approach the Russians or did they approach you?  Also, what do you think about cyber warfare and how can we prevent it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjijei?context=5)|They came to my place of work and I tried to develop a relationship with them. How did I do it? I started with a really bad joke! Yes, I think of cyber, but I'm less concerned about it. I am more concerned with detecting and stopping insider threats (aka spies). Human intelligence (HUMINT) is way more effective and useful to intelligence services. 
[*Human intelligence (HUMINT\) is way more effective and useful to intelligence services.*  Can you explain why? It seems to me that the with signals intelligence, organizations will have to spend less money and take fewer risks with guys like you.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csk0l2k?context=5)|All that info still requires serious analysis, and it's always harder to figure out what data means without context. Having a human on the inside they can add that context - they can tell you what people are thinking, what moral is etc. Otherwise it's like trying to detect sarcasm in an email...
[What are your thoughts on the Russian Illegals program that resulted in numerous arrests in 2010?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjhnok?context=5)|Oh you mean the SVR's that were also operating around the same time I was and were also in NY which is were my operation was conducted :) I might have a thing or two to say 'bout Ms. Chapman in my book (can I plug it again: [Link to www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/How-Catch-Russian-Spy-American/dp/1476788820).)
[Do you know if Russian intelligence agents have been successful in gathering intelligence in China or is it more difficult for them to conduct it there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3b75u8/i_am_naveed_jamali_a_former_double_agent_who/csjhnok?context=5)|Hmm...I don't really know anything about operating in China, but imagine it must be very difficult.

3b81cj,3,2015-06-26,Degree and Five Years Experience - Where to now?,WilliamMelvinHicks,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3b81cj/degree_and_five_years_experience_where_to_now/,"I graduated in Info Systems Tech in 2009 and was offered a job where I was an intern at the time; the offer was $30k, which I felt was low, but being in a rural southern small town coupled with the fact that the economy had just collapsed and no one was hiring, I reluctantly accepted the position (IT Specialist). They told me I would be at about 40k after five years, which again is low but in this area it's enough to live comfortably.

It is a healthcare nonprofit with about 400 employees and I was the second IT person they had ever hired aside from my boss. We had a fairly complex network setup consisting of fiber connections between 13 sites, Cisco VPN/firewall/web filters/VOIP, however all of that was setup and configured and to a large extent managed by consultants. 

For the first couple years most of my time was spent responding to help desk tickets, but I did get to lead the project of migrating about 250 workstations onto the domain. My boss had very little knowledge or experience with AD, so I setup their file shares and group policies. 

During years 3-5 we hired a part time intern so I could focus more on higher level projects rather than help desk, and we received a large grant to virtualize our servers and VDI. We still relied heavily on consultants and they designed and setup all of our VMWare infrastructure, once it was ready to go I was in charge of doing P2V server conversions, cloning our server template when we needed a new server, and setting up desktop VMs for our VDI users.

Unfortunately due to financial struggles, the company either freeze salaries or only gave 2% each year so after 5 years I was still only making $33k. I had been doing affiliate marketing on the side and reached a point where I was actually making more from that, so I quit to pursue that full time a year ago. Now I'm at a point where I miss working in IT and the affiliate income has been very unsteady, so I'm looking for an IT position.

I'm not really sure what type of position I should be pursuing at this point; I feel overqualified for help desk but I'm not sure if I'm ready for Sys Admin because of how reliant we were upon consultants at my old job. I worked with Active Directory for several years, but our environment was not very complex to say the least, so I'm afraid if I'm really pressed on technical questions in an interview I won't be able to answer them.

I'm thinking that my best bet at this point is to go for MCSA or MCSE (suggestions welcome!) and possibly VMware after that to refresh and update my knowledge and look for Sys Admin positions. Any insights or suggestions are appreciated.

Mine went like so over the span of 22 years so far:

* Computer Science student at a community college
* Good grades helped me land an open job in the computer science lab at the college
* Moved on to a 4 year university.  Prior experience got me a job doing printer jockey work in the central IT department provided computer lab.
* Same 4 year university, moved up to being basically a paid unofficial intern assigned to the unix team.  They ran things like the website, e-mail, etc.
* Same 4 year university, job opened up running various applications based on VMS, Unix (SunOS, Irix), and Windows NT 3.5/4.0.
* Same 4 year university, became one of the unix admins after some re-organization.
* Same 4 year university, became the storage and backup administrator.
* Moved on to a large cable company, unix operations team.  Basically keep the existing and new unix systems up and running (there was a separate ""build and engineering team"")
* Same company, became the unix ""team lead"".
* Same cable company, moved to a ""systems support"" team lead that supported the windows and unix operations/engineering teams.  Basically running the back-end for monitoring systems, CMDB, log aggregation, identity management.
* Moved onto a government entity supporting monitoring software."

So far I've clicked a few data points in Auto-CAD and entered some numbers in a database, not counting shoveling dirt in the heat most of the time. 

Anyway, I'm really considering the BA because they offer GIS programming/automation classes with python, and a wealth of database and workshop classes. I am currently finishing the Python course at CodeAcademy and will be taking some SQL/web development classes at a community college in the meantime. I will have to apply to the BA as post-bacc given that I already have a degree.

Basically I'm itching to go back to school. I want to switch from Geology completely and pursue GIS/programming exclusively to work near my home city (Seattle). Is it worth going for another Bachelors and minor in computer science on top of my B.S.?

My job is 2 AM to 6 AM everysingle day or I'm fired. I've been doing that for the last 3 years and when I get home I just spend my days playing videogames, etc. I have 4 close friends (all guys) whom I hang out with a couple times a month in my house. I have no new friends since graduating highschool. I go to community college part time.   
  
   
1 month ago, I started an internship with a reference from one of my close friend. Even with a salad interviewing skill, I was hired (non paid internship). The place is all right, there are many other interns my age, mostly girls (they are on different floor though). Now, I sure do want to try dating one of them but at my social skill level, I can't even strike a conversation that can make them interested in being my friend, so dating is another league. I am just that one IT intern guy.   
  
I am just mad at myself for wasting my youth away playing games for the last 3 years. Conversations are different league than when I was in high school as they talk about many places they've visited and when they ask me about them, I know nothing. I turned down a lot of invites from my friend going clubbing, atlantic city, etc because I have to work everyday.  
  
I remember one time I haven't gone out of the house for a couple of months and going to grocery store, I felt like I had a panic attack and wanting to just die for feeling like that.  
  
I guess tl:dr would be.. how do I make new friends? I have nothing in common with most of people my age as I became vegetable for 3 years.  "

I try to be as precise and as vague about the situation as possible as I know a coworker is on reddit. If knew how to make this more incognito...

Alright, I graduated last year (2014) in July, had a promissing job in sight till I got turned down in November, friend set me up with a great opportunity instead, got the job, things went a little to smooth maybe. Had to wait for months to get a visa, company probably sunk quite some money into it. 
I started in April.
Now the probation period of three months will be over next week, I will get a huge cashback, which I would also need to leave the country.

About the job. It isn't what I studied for but it was supposed to be a managing position paired with concept design, I do understand that I need to learn first about managing, which is why I came here.
But more important, there should be a creative part in this job, I am a designer and the lack of complex problems is not only mindnumbing but also hurting my selfesteem. To make it worse the solutions my company offers are nothing I can stand for with a clean consciousness. The people are super nice, but it also feels incredibly fake at times. I started, as an experiment, to spend my days not even studying on the job and still they hardly care. 
Also we are only about ten people with 2 bosses. So far I saw 3 coworkers leave in 3 months and I don't know if the first 2 were laid of.
Plus, I am aware the market doesn't look so well for my company and it seem to do fine because of the niche we are in (no competition).

It felt like a great jumpstart for my career before I came here, my gut feeling was a bit of, sure, but I didn't want to regret not going my whole life. The good points are though:
-so far i learned quite a lot about a different trade in only three months and it sparked a lot of ideas for more projects in my life
- i became aware of what kind of environment i need for life

The salary is good, in comparison to my coworkers, which makes me feel terrible.
I am here for two years on the paper, that is the deal with my girlfriend, this isn't /r/relationships though. I need to take her in cosideration as she might get an internship in a neighboring country later this year.

To make things worse, this job made me realise I want to learn and do something else, which I might have never realized otherwise, professionwise and in private . Also I can't have either the way I want, if I stay here.
I am cosidering an internship in my field of design, still abroad, but back in Europe, as I have bought health insurrance for two years.

My idea is to talk this over with my girlfriend when we are on holidays and then start looking for an internship and quit after 6 months here.
I know this might leave a big ugly spot on my resume, but that is not my purpose in life. Besides it could still look good depending on how I phrase it.

It is terrible to admit it that I am unhappy with this, as I wanted it (the country mostly) so bad and told many people that this would be the thing for me. Turns out it isn't.

Any advice, do you think I missed something in my plans?
If you want to fix the job situation consider this:
I talked about my boredom and concerns with my boss but he didn't take it seriously.

tl;dr: want to quit first job (great position in foreign country) after only a few months, spent my own time and money as well as companies for ""almost nothing"" but can't go on with this.

Thanks!"

Nor do I have any sort of certifications. What I am doing is getting fly by overview of 3-4 certifications instead of just digging into one certification as I am short of time and money(working at some survival jobs at present )
I found the data center field as the best of both worlds, some electrical stuff form my engineering background and IT stuff which I am currently interested in.
So I've decided to get some entry level experience. Can you guys recommend as to what kind of and what roles shall i go for or what should I learn prior to working. Shall I go for some internship or tier 1 job. Where would I learn more. I'm in canada and will be living in India for 1-2 years and I want to utilize my time there.

Unfortunately, I feel like it's better if the company hired a person who was genuinely interested in these things and I feel a bit of a survivor's guilt in which another job applicant who was really interested in these things got killed while I survived, when what I am more interested in is more system-level programming. 

As such, I am that much more thankful I got this internship, but I am concerned about my upcoming junior year, where I'll have to perform well in technical interviews to get into firms I want to work for (As an intern) then work it into graduation. As many of you know, web design doesn't require great algorithmic knowledge while technical interviews do, so I've been reviewing and studying my data structures and algorithms course I took last spring, hoping to not bomb those interviews that I had before I took that course. Problem is that I don't have the same accountability that I had last semester with grades, so I inevitably as a human being am not working as much as I should.

I worked 80 hour work weeks during university, yet with only 40 hours per week in an internship I can't even get myself to study more than 10 hours a week on algorithms and practice problems. How do you guys make yourselves accountable for studying? Thanks."

3bdgfn,2,2015-06-28,How can I communicate that I feel as though a coworker is not the best fit for the job?,jobnewby,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3bdgfn/how_can_i_communicate_that_i_feel_as_though_a/,"At my office, we are hiring a person for a high-level management role that would supervise &amp; work with myself + a few other team members of mine.

My boss has narrowed down the candidate pool to 5 people, and at this point I'm being included in the job interviews.

After the interviews, I am supposed to fill out a form rating &amp; commenting on each candidate- on things like how well I'd feel they'd fit in with the team, how experienced they are, etc.

We've got some really strong candidates, but one of them is a coworker of mine, who I strongly feel is not the best fit for this role.

His biggest ""pro"" would be that he has worked closely with our company for the last 2 years, and we fill a very specific niche within our industry. Most people that start here spend a good bit of time learning everything about us, our industry, our competitors, clients, etc. So I can see why my superiors are considering him. Plus, he is a good fit ""culturally"", and on very good terms with the majority of our employees (which is important to a young startup).

However, he is extremely unprofessional. I'm trying to leave my personal dislike for him out of this, but over the last 2 years I've worked with him, he's done and said some pretty shitty things, such as:

1. Come to work high, and then act super out of it and giggly and weird. He has done this more than once.
2. He once hired a female intern who was extremely pretty, and wore very revealing clothes to work (shorts, and tops that showed off a good bit of cleavage). A month after she had left, her name briefly came up in conversation, and he overheard, and said ""YEAH! I HIRED HER. YOU'RE WELCOME."" .....He was talking about her looks, not her skills or anything she had done for the company. He has made a few other sexist comments like this before. Nothing too horrendous, but sometimes it didn't sit right with me. (ie; calling women in general 'catty' and being 100% seroius about not wanting to have more women on our team :( )
3. He is disorganized and has piss-poor time management skills. In the past, there have been so many times that he waited until the last minute on projects, and then put things on my plate and expected me to stay til 6/7/8pm to get things done...
4. He's kind of a dick when he has to work under pressure. Especially as my superior, there have been times where he has been unjustifiably douchey. Combine this with his poor time management skills and lack of planning, and it's just super shitty to have to work on projects with him.

So, knowing all this, I feel like he's not really the best fit for this position that would include managing and supervising the majority of my team.

My question is: How can I (diplomatically) state this on the form when I fill it out? I'm going to leave out the parts where he's come to work high and said sexist things multiple times in the past. But is it okay to just be honest?

I don't like throwing my team mates under the bus, even if they are sexist douchebags. In situations where he's fucked up because of his piss poor management skills, I'd step up and take the blame. I've even gone to my boss to ask how to make things better and also to ask how I can better keep track of our timelines on these projects that he puts on my plate at the last minute. Thankfully, my boss is smart and awesome and realized pretty quickly that this guy was putting me in a lot of tough positions. *But I shouldn't have even had to do that, if this guy actually was management material.*

Sorry that this was so long and rant-y. I just feel like I've gotten to know this guy really well over the last 2 years (unfortunately) and, putting my personal dislike aside, I really do feel as though he is not the best fit for the job, especially compared to the other candidates.

It's frustrating though because I feel like this guy gets away with murder sometimes, just because he's charismatic and also very funny.

I want to be honest, because my input on each candidate will factor into their final decision. At the same time, I want to stay professional and diplomatic, and try to leave my emotion and personal bias out of it.

Any thoughts, ideas, or stories would be much appreciated."

However browsing through the site daily and talking to others using the site who have discussed their experiences I think I've noticed a lot of opportunities to grow these newer startups and potentially build a business out of growing these newer startups.

I want to get a discussion going to see if others agree there is a real opportunity here. This is a serious wall of text so hopefully some folks are bored enough on a Sunday to read through it. I'm just putting down some basic thoughts/observations I've had on this topic as I've been browsing AL and speaking to founders on there recently. I know /r/startups always has great feedback and discussions on stuff like this. I'm kind of rambling/thinking out loud on this stuff hoping for a good discussion. 

I'm aware that there are already lots of ""marketing agencies for startups"" and lots of ""startup accelerators"" popping up every month, so I'm trying to discuss different unique approaches and solutions that might work well for new startups.

Thoughts:

* A marketing agency that targets new startups with little money but they have **SOME** money that they want use to grow NOW.

* Eventually may accept equity only with certain projects - we build organic and/or paid traffic ""exposure engines/leadgen platforms"" for equity or even CPL rather than payment upfront/leadgen), 

* Target startups looking to hire contract/fulltime marketing position on angellist. proposition is solid because they are going to have to pay fulltime/contract around ~20k at least right? 

* Some startups advertising what seem to be paid salary positions and paid contract positions, but if/when actually speaking to founders they don't currently have any money to spend on marketing. i'm aware you can sort by ""funding options"" but that seems to eliminate 90% of startups, so is that 90% of startups really have zero money to spend on marketing? yet they're all over AL advertising for positions? some founders i've spoken to wanted to setup commission/affiliate platforms/lead generation because of the lack of funds.

* Seems like some startups advertising writing/content marketing-related positions with good salaries, but then I read further into details and looks like a lot of startups are just looking to pay freelance writers on a per project/per article basis. I don't see how paying a writer on a per article basis would equate to the salary numbers being advertised? 

* Seems like so many startups are trying to get months of free work by going the internship route too. College Interns accepting this kind of arrangement probably pretty inexperienced = wasted time on communicating marketing tasks that drive targeted traffic/revenue = wasted money. when what these startups need is traction/traffic/new active users/sales/app store downloads/revenue NOW. just posting on social media and doing some data entry is not going to initiate the kind of growth some founders seem to expect?

* Startups are likely going to be WAY easier to get in touch with and stay in touch with consistently versus Joe from Joe Doe's Auto Repair. 

* questions - thousands of startups, how many can spend 5,000-15,000 right now? 5,000 on a launchpad package? 5,000-10,000 launchpad package? If you're a founder with a marketing budget, initial funding, what amount can you spend on marketing/growth?

* What if a marketing package covers 3 months/90days. This avoids a lot of ""contract anxiety"" and allows us to see if we are a good fit/how much we can actually help this startup. win win for startup, costs WAY less than trying to hire someone when launching, we are results-based and don't need handholding like interns. at the very least i feel there is no way a startup would not get value out of that kind of pricepoint, account setups and targeted traffic. we can't make sale for them or make their startup idea work necessarily. 

* make services = product packages. also offer custom solutions.

* need to figure out if something like this would work? i know startup accelerators a lot have in-house marketing/biz dev guys that assist their portfolios of startups. i feel like these accelerators are growing in number but still can only service a certain percentage of startups. 

* would the much larger volume of clients we can potentially attract/handle at initial lower price-point ""launch"" package (5,000-10,000) be more profitable than going after only a few bigger deals from the marketing agency perspective? 

* I feel like there is a lot of opportunity when these startups receive some initial traction, investments, funding and need to grow, but can't afford to get someone talented fulltime, or they don't really know what to do, try doing things themselves with mixed results and a lot of time dedicated?

* I've noticed a lot of products services are coming out to kind of bridge the gap between agency and cheaper DIY marketing for startups, pressfriendly comes to mind. Would a ""lean"" marketing agency potentially deliver more exposure/targeted traffic/sales over a few months than using some of these various ""cheaper than using an agency"" PR services targeted at startups?

* There are 2673 startups on AL looking for marketing positions right now. Of these, how many have $5,000+ marketing budget and need to grow today?

If you're a new founder I would love to hear your thoughts on how you're handling your digital marketing or how you plan on handling it.

A little background: I'm a 24 year old stay at home daddy (ex wife gets child support, IRS takes some money, and my student loan takes some money as well so we decided it best if I deal with the poopmeister, which I don't mind, he's my everything), my wife is 23 and our son is 3. Ever since I was 11 I was enchanted by the world of Internet Marketing. I saw a web page called the Rich Jerk and the video was so enticing I even let it load over dinner just so I could watch it, over and over again. Of course being so young I couldn't even dream of dropping money on things like that, but it never stopped me from searching and searching for the rest of my entire life. Went through my teens obsessing over things like Global Resorts Network, GDI, Big Ticket to Wealth, program after program, success story after success story. It became my dream, to make a living from this beautiful internet. 


Once an adult, I really started to research, and found that basically the things that I was looking at were short lived and only really made money for the first few people to participate, but no problem, I found a forum of REAL people making REAL money from REAL internet businesses (or so I thought).


This particular forum had a section FILLED with guides, mentors, coaches, videos, YOU NAME IT for anywhere from $1 to $47 to $497, to $4997+ (Internet marketers fucking LOVE their 4s 9s and 7s) so I just ate it up. I had a job at the time and 3/4 of my paycheck went to buying course after course, disappointment after disappointment. Coaches with promises like ""your business will succeed with my help or ILL PAY YOU!"".


Time and time again I was burned, and yet it only fuelled the addiction. Spent more and more and more. No, I didn't just collect courses, I TOOK ACTION. I did everything I was told, maybe a couple bucks would trickle in here and there, but it would all dry up eventually.


Fast forward to last year, my wife gets an AMAZING JOB!!! ($55k a year!!!) and suddenly we are LOADED. We rent a nice house, get a BRAND new 2015 car, we've got extra money up the asshole, put 20% away every paycheck and spend the rest on bills/entertainment/my stupid business attempts. At first it wasn't so bad. $200-300 a month maybe at first, but the next month, daddy needed backlinks, daddy needed SEO, daddy needed some content, daddy wanted an authority site. $800 $900 $1000 dollars every month, wasted. Nothing working.


But then I see it, this can't fail I tell myself, ""$5,000 SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY, DO NOT PAY FOR THIS COACHING IF YOU AREN'T SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS! I will hold your hand to success"". Yes sir I am! That is all my savings but this is a sure thing I convinced myself. So I paid...out of our DISNEY fund! Why not, we weren't going to Disney for at least 5 months, I'll have made my investment back by then. Was I ever wrong...


I put another $1,200 from the credit cards into that ""business"". After awhile the ""coach"" suddenly stopped logging into skype, the websites were garbage, no traffic, nothing.


I was defeated, heartbroken, guess what happens next? I SAW IT!! ""AMAZON BLAH BLAH"" the HOLY GRAIL! Success stories PLASTERED everywhere, not a single negative review ANYWHERE on the internet. Let's check the blackhat website for a [GET] no? That's right it's 1 on 1 actual coaching, and a GUARANTEE! A written guarantee that I'll be PAID by the coach if it fails! This is what I've always been waiting for. My wife works so hard, I'm picturing the moment when I tell her she doesn't have to work anymore, when our son can go to a nice private school when he's older, and everything will be alright! Such a happy day!


$5,000 right on the credit cards, but it's ok we have about $6,000 of CC balance left, no more savings but that doesn't matter we've got THIS now! I pay another few hundred for a couple wholesale memberships. I apply for a permit to sell goods (this guy is really making this seem legit, I gotta do OFFICIAL SHIT)


Seems like every day I made progress, and I felt it too, felt like I was working my ass off. Putting this here, putting that there, sending this email, outsourcing this, hiring for that, backlinks here, content there, copy here, page design there. Eating up this guy's bullshit with a spoon. 


Every day he looks at my progress and says YES we are gonna make some money! ""Your business will be great"" he says, encouragingly.


Few months ago, wife gets laid off from her job, game over for us right? Wrong, I've got profit right around the corner according to Coach Coacherson. We've got credit cards to fuel it too!


Well, last week he stopped contacting me, and shut off every hope of ever seeing him again. Still no money. Not a dime of ROI.


And today, our last $800 of credit, for 1 month at an extended stay for us because we needed the place to live. We ""move in"" next week, and in a few hours, I have to tell her what is happening, and why it's happening to us. Because I bought into a life that doesn't exist. Because I failed as a father.


TL;DR: Open a fucking sports bar, the internet is for Zuckerbergs and Swartzs


**UPDATE:** Going to talk to her now over breakfast to see what our plans are going to be. Parents aren't an option for either one of us, a lot of great suggestions coming from reddit. I have a Bachelor of Business Administration with a concentration on Marketing so it might help me in the job market but it never has before, hell even the company I did an internship with isn't willing to hire, but now is the time to try anything. I'm also going to call the credit cards today to see if there's anything to be done about getting straight up scammed."

Reasons for changing to freelancing:

* Higher salary (current salary is low)
* Working from home
* I could choose which projects I accept or reject
* High demand in my area (europe)

How do I start freelancing? I can pretty much make any website with HTML/CSS/JS. But I guess people want to have a back-end too. Should I start learning PHP and then Wordpress so I can also make the back-end part? Or can I also land jobs just by doing the front-end?

At the time I was only 16, and was/am currently planning on studying computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity at $University, so this seemed like a godsend at the perfect place. 

Nope. 

Imagine Godzilla trying to breed with a 3 legged mouse, and try to convert that circus into physical wires and cables and you'll get an idea of what the ""offices"" looked like. There were only three offices, and each office held 4 elongated tables, 5 people, and usually 2 monitors for each person, so about 10 monitors and 5 towers. The rooms were horrendous, Ethernet cables everywhere, power bricks in the middle of the room, monitor cables and everything everywhere, you get the jist. 

Anyways, the lady who hired me, wanted me to learn 2012 r2 from scratch, then learn 2008r2 (their current setup was the later) and how they're different and how to set them up because she didn't have the time, nor interest, in learning it and didn't want to pay someone to do it when she had a 16 yr old intern. 

Note: Prior to this internship, I had only very limited knowledge of computers in terms of networking, but a huge passion for learning, anyways. 

So that's how my summer went, reading upon reading and testing in a virtual environment on a less-than-legal ESXi that I somehow managed to load onto one of their raid drives since they never thought to have even one normal drive; until I felt like I learned what I could and my testing had gone well. 

I successfully implemented Group Policy for users, computers, mapped the drives, had network shares, basics of the server down pat. So Boss comes in one day before I start working and asks how I'm doing and I begin to show what I've done. 

I don't remember the exact conversation because I have had many senseless ones with the brainless ant I called my boss. But by the end she wanted me to not only show her what worked but the how and why of it to. She wanted me to do a full out tutorial and teach her everything. *facepalm* The only reason I was hired was because she didn't want to learn and she just wanted to have!

So she walks out of the room leaving me burning with the rage of Sparta as they had just lost their King; so, I begin to make a PowerPoint on what everything does, and why, and take notes, basically recreating the month and a half spent there learning with regurgitation. 

I go in not even an hour later asking a question on what's important to learn and what's not and she says that only things she thinks she'll understand easily are vital because she just got off the phone with a seller and she had just bought two windows server 2012r2's because she saw how cool they looked. 

TL;DR- Crazy boss decides to hire 16 year old uneducated intern to manage entire network of engineers, and then trusts him before even understanding his work.

This is probably my most ""bland"" story, but I'll be linking this from my future posts in this shitshow place and it would help to understand why and what's happening, right?

I am currently going to school for neuroscience, and am incredibly close to graduating, and have realized that it just isn't for me. I went in to it at first planning to do premed before I really thought about how I don't wanna spend my life like that. I never chose comp sci as my major in freshman year because I felt like I would be so behind the curve since I had no programming experience, but now I'm seeing some of my friends who were less tech literate than me getting pretty good internships and I'm just now realizing that I would have been fine. Now if I want to switch it will take me probably a bit over a year past my expected grad next may just because a few of the classes have 2 semesters of prereqs that I would have to take, and I would no longer be on full ride scholarship after I finish this coming school year so I will have to take out a loan or something. I am just beating myself up for not doing this earlier, I could have done it debt free and be done quicker. Does anybody have any advice, especially from anyone who has done something similar even if not switching to computer science. Thank you for any help! 

Edit: And in regards to doing a minor, I would still have to do the 2 semesters of pre-reqs (comp sci 1 then comp sci 2) before taking a few of the classes, so it wouldn't really save me any time over just doing the major, or maybe double majoring since I am so close with this neuroscience stuff anyway.

Edit2: Thanks for all the great replies, sorry I haven't contributed much the the discussion I got crazy busy after submitting the post yesterday. I really appreciate it, trying to figure all this stuff out is really scary and confusing, especially as the clock counts down."

So, through a family friend I landed an internship at an SBDC as an intern. The family friend knows that I'll be majoring in CS in the fall, so he wanted this internship to act as an intro into programming in a business environment. Once I started, he pitched me an idea for a project: create an API that would connect two databases we use - Smartsheet and CenterIC (customer relationship system) - and do something with the information (still a little hazy on what).

He said something about JavaScript, so in my first week I started and finished Codecademy's JavaScript course and began learning Node.js from nodeschool.io. Now it's the Monday of my second week here and I want to make sure I know what I'm getting myself into.


So, /r/learnprogramming, my questions:

1. Am I learning the right language and technology for this project? Is there something else I should look into?

2. I've found a few guides on constructing RESTful APIs with Node.js, but are there any really good ones you guys know about?

3. Am I in over my head? Should I try a different project? (For reference, my background: Took and excelled in CS electives -- including AP CS w/ a 5 on the exam -- for first three years of high school but not senior year b/c there weren't any left to take. Other than JS, I have experience in Java and a little Python, and I created and published an Android app with a partner in my junior year.)"

Thought I would unleash the power of our community. Any Chicagoans out there who could offer some help would be appreciated. I am also sorry if I shouldn't post here and if this isn't kosher I can delete this post and post it back up to /r/Chicago or the like.  


Here goes... 
My girlfriend is a wonderful human being. She's been through a lot over the past year, including her mom suffering from a potentially dangerous health concern (fine now), two different internships, the death of her first dog, death of her grandma, and personally battling through depression all leading up to her being let go from her job (laid off with five others) that she had for three months.  


I can't say how much this girl means to me. She's a beautiful human being, often caring for others, like two-weeks ago where we stumbled on a girl on the street who herself was in very dark place. My girlfriend listened to her for hours helping this total stranger get back on her feet for the night. She's a strong listener and great communicator.
It just sucks, she's had some bad luck. Of course, these situations are great learning experiences and they help a person grow stronger. However, if any of you know of a great company to work for that's hiring, it would be much appreciated if you could send me your advice.  


I know she will be fine, I just thought it couldn't hurt if I asked around this wonderful community. As far as her job goes, she has a journalism degree, can do social media (though she wants to branch away), but overall has excellent communication skills and above all is a wonderful wonderful human being. She's smart with science, has confidence presenting to people, and a careful and hard worker. She's gone through the headhunter and temp job/contractor positions and is not interested in those again (those are rough with no medical benefits or career advancement).  


Thanks a lot, I appreciate your time.

**TL;DR:** journalism degree, social media experience, personable, excellent communication skills, don't want temp. (thanks a lot for TL;DR idea, /u/professorpan )"

Some details have been changed but I've tried to keep the story accurate. The oil and gas community is small, the cross-section between O&amp;G and MSPs is smaller, and I want to be able to be frank without damaging my career.*

I work for an O&amp;G company. I'm a one man band, with an intern from 3 to 5 during school and from 12 to 5 during the summer. We manage roughly 7 offices and 250 users. The company has grown more in the past 3 years than it has in it's 35 years of operation and I'm starting to be barely able to keep up with the workload. I talked to my boss about it. He wanted to find an MSP to cover help desk and leave me time to work on automation and process improvements.I have a good relationship with him so I knew that my job was secure. I sent out 15 RFQs to see what was out there. Of that, five MSPs responded. Here's how that went:

**MSP 1: We just learned with Kaseya is**

The first MSP was the local incumbent for the region. Their president came in strong: Sharply dressed, nice binders full of colorful brochures and a good attitude. Pricing was great: $60 per managed computer. That was about as good as it got. Any time we brought up something that didn't fit within Kaseya natively, his ability to manage it fell apart.

""We can implement two factor authentication with AuthAnvil"", he said. 

""We already have RSA implemented"", I replied. 

""Well, we don't support that, we can implement enterprise-class mobility management!"", he tried.

""We already have Air Watch, what does this do that Air Watch doesn't?"". 

The silence was tangible, and then, ""Well, it doesn't integrate with our management tools"". 

They, in a serious tone, proposed that we drop all 20 of our Linux VMs for Windows because they couldn't manage them the same way. They wanted to replace our Juniper SRXs and EX switches with Meraki because ""it was better"". This included our newly bought EX6200.

The conversation ended shortly after.

**MSP 2: Someone let the accountants out**

The second MSP was from the next city over. They were small but growing and had the staff compliment to handle us. We would be their biggest client by a large margin, but I met the techs and felt confident in them.

Their rate was pretty much spot on for what we were looking for: $120 per managed user. Then they started tacking fees on for shit that didn't make sense. There were fees for everything: per call, per user, per device, per printer, per firewall, per on-site visit, per switch, per hour expected of response time, just short of giving me a fee for use of our facilities if one of their techs took a dump while on my site.

When we added everything up and costed it per user, it came into roughly $240 per user when we were done. No, thanks.

**MSP 3: Let's poke the bear**

A fairly large, national MSP was next. They were big enough to handle us, as they frequently reminded us. This was the topic of conversation every 5 minutes. We wanted to look at network automation? They had done that with *namedrop*! Improving our puppet and chef configs? Why, they had done that with *namedrop*. It was reassuring to start.

However, their downfall was hubris. The day 1 on boarding plan was nothing short of a take-over of the network. You don't rip out a CRM that's been developed over a decade and replace it overnight. They wanted to do upgrades of servers that had been running on older versions of Linux without asking *why* that server was on an older version to begin with. When we tried them, we gave them a demo environment of a single Windows DC. Without consulting anyone they installed two-factor auth and didn't give any local staff fobs or the app, and then proceeded to change information on service accounts that would have impacted backups.

I revoked their access and told them to take a hike.

This is where it got ugly.

Their CEO called our CEO, said that my intern and I were incompetent, we had exposed the network to serious flaws, and we were going to drive the business into the ground. He said that myself and the intern should be tossed out and they should get ""*real IT people*"" in.

You need to understand my CEO to understand why this got so ugly. When the company was formed in the late 70's, our CEO formed it because a consultant had come to his old company and advocated that they ditch all staff in the regional offices and consolidate it under a third party. That resulted in him getting kicked to the curb and it put his family under a lot of stress. He carries a deep, burning hatred for any consultant who advocates replacing local staff for third parties.

I've never heard someone called a cockgobbler in anger, but I think it was catharsis for bossman.

**MSP 4: We're not really an MSP**

Fourth on our list was confusing. They listed themselves on their website as an MSP. They listed everything we wanted: automation, management, help desk support, etc. However, they really only wanted copier and copier related accessories. Network automation? How about some nice toner! Datacenter? We've got datacenter grade multi-functions! I exaggerate a bit, but only a little. Now that being said - we've since contracted our two copiers from them and they're great at it.

**MSP 5: Cool neckbeards**

The last one was hard to turn down. Two guys showed up for the meeting. One had a beard that would make Gandalf jealous in a mustard stained Breaking Bad t-shirt. The other guy was a sharply dressed Finnish dude who spoke barely comprehsible broken English. Despite all of this, they were pretty cool: they only really wanted to handle the break/fix stuff and routine operations, and they were willing to let me work on the new development. This was exactly what I wanted. They were the most expensive per user, but they were reasonable about it.

The only problem they had was that they couldn't commit to holding up their end. If they had been a bit bigger, it probably would have worked out fairly well.

The short of the long of it: The biggest criticism I have of all of the MSPs, besides #5 was that they were inflexible. The tactics they pulled probably work for smaller companies, but it won't work at the scale I deal in. Keep in mind that at least $30,000 a month was on the line for most of them. Had they been willing to play ball just a little bit more, we would have tried to meet them halfway. But because they were so rigidly stuck in their platforms, they lost out. Except for the copier dudes - they got their copiers and they're happy as pigs in dung.

My intern is going to be getting an offer for full-time employment as a Junior Sysadmin next Monday, with the possibility for another intern or full-timer later in the year. I think this is the best possible outcome.

**Edit:** Just as an FYI, I am responding to your commentary. However, this account is under a day old and therefore is falling victim of the wrath of /u/automoderator. 

**Edit 2:** To answer a few common questions to get us through the night, since I want to keep this going and I appreciate both the feedback and grilling.

*Question: Why didn't you hire an employee?* That's what we're in the process of doing. The intern is being brought on full-time, and if that works out, we're looking at getting another intern/FTE later on. However, because of the real possibility that an MSP was a better solution, we needed to do due diligence and interview 
MSPs to fill that role.

*Statement: You're probably a non-ideal customer for an MSP.* This is probably a true statement. However, I didn't know that until I went out an got MSPs to provide proposals. If I wanted to be an asshole to myself, I'd say I just wrote a 10,000 word essay on ""look how these MSPs didn't fit my exact requirements""! I look at this more as, ""I went through this process, and this is what happened"".

*Statement: Your environment is to esoteric for an MSP to handle.* This is to address /u/brochacho6000. This is also probably a true statement. However, as I noted in one of my hopefully-to-appear-soon comments, I never faulted an MSP for not wanting to support something that wasn't their standard. I faulted them for wanting to implement their standards without consideration for what the speed, haphazardness or the actual implementation would do to the business. I take greater issue with the rip-and-replace methodology to implement the solution rather than the solution itself, except where the solution is obviously bonkers. I mean, come on, replacing an 8-blade chassis switch on a 4Tb backplane with a stack of 8 switches on 10Gb connections? Really?

In better terms, I wouldn't mind switching everything to Kaseya if the MSP is willing to take responsibility for getting us through that process. That was a hard pill for a lot of them to swallow.

*Statement: We're an MSP! Hire us!* The decision has been made for the foreseeable future. I'm not in the US either.

**Edit 3:** More comments are coming. Again, I'm just chilling with /u/automoderator.

**Edit 4:** I'm free of the tyranny of the /u/automoderator!"

During school, I went to the career center six times for events and advice. I had my resume looked at, 3 times. I also went there to ask for help finding experience. They never helped me. Then I went to my professors and asked them for help finding an internship, research, or anything. They never replied (I emailed at least 4). I was also kind of active, with me being an ACM officer, and attending many networking events and presentations.

Boom. I graduated now. I've been applying everywhere, and it's been a hellhole. I've been applying starting the year before graduation.

Now it's been really depressing. My body hurts. My mind hurts. I've been practicing my skills, every day. I volunteered to help someone with programming for an organization. 

Yesterday, I decided to email my CS department for advice. I got the reply today. Basically, they looked at my grades, and said paraphrased, ""you did really well in all these courses, so you should have no problem getting a job. You just lack confidence. We understand that everyone who graduated so far has had no problems finding a job."" 

Holy. Apparently I'm the only person without a job. Imagine someone telling you're the only one who can't get a job."

I'm finishing my CCNA R&amp;S course next month and doing my certification exam in August. I'm starting a summer internship for two months working with Microsoft TFS on a low-mid level enterprise with quite a reputation in my country. I intend to do the CCNA Security cert on October by self study and with help from colleagues who done the course and are doing the cert at the same time. I want to do ITIL foundations by self-study as well by this year. My main objective is to work in the networking and security field.

I lost 2 years by being on another course for 1 year before moving to Computer Engineering (was on Electrical Engineering (manly learned C, MAtLab, LaTeX and Electrical fundamentals)) and lost another one because I had one discipline left to do (Physics) and decided to do another curricular internship to improve my course average (which I'm finishing at this very moment).

Am I still late in life and too old, especially in the professional side of it, to work in IT, or am I still in time?

Due to some scheduling circumstances, only my name is on the lease. We moved in a little over a month ago, but she's accepted an internship position out of state so she hasn't been here at all, except to drop off her belongings. 

A little over a week ago she texted me saying that she would be moving out. Her name isn't on the lease so there's nothing I can do to stop her. Over the past couple of years, I've loaned her about $1,200, which she has neglected to pay me back. Now I am going to have to move again and pay a lease termination fee equal to one month's rent.

I asked her to split the termination fee with me, as well as pay me back in full by means of cashier's check before I let her into my apartment to collect her things. Since sending her this text she has ceased all communication with me and has ignored all of my attempts at communication.

I've given notice to my apartment that I'll be moving out, and I have a little under a month to have all of my belongings out of the apartment. If she doesn't contact me, what can I legally do with her things? I'm tempted to try to sell them to make up for what she owes me, but I don't want to get myself into any legal trouble over this.

Thanks in advance for any advice!

* Country of purchase: US

* Budget range: $800-$1,100 (may stretch $100 or so for a great laptop. I'd like this to last a few years)

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Gaming/desktop replacement

* Screen size preference: I enjoy larger screens

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows 7. I'm willing to upgrade to 10 but I am NOT a fan of 8.1. I've used 8.1 in an internship and I didn't enjoy it. Not a fan of the interface on Macs and not sure a laptop in this range will run WINE well enough.

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings):
Sims 4, TF2, Civ IV, Rayman, GTA V, many other ones that may not make full use.
* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.):
Needs to be able to run 30-40 tabs at a time in Firefox. I also often have 3-4 Word and Excel documents open as well as Skype and e-mail. I want this to have a beautiful screen as I will not be taking my desktop and tv with me to Germany

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility):

None that I can think of. I really wish I could have just built this myself.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great):

It doesn't need to be ultra slim. If I can do moderate gaming on it, that's fine. It should be somewhat durable.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, two, or balanced)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance:

High Performance and long battery life

* Build quality -vs- Low price -vs- High performance:
Build quality/high performance

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:

As long as it isn't burning my thighs, high performance takes preference

**Which features would you pay a premium for?**

* High resolution screen: Possibly

* A great keyboard: Sure?

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: I've got a gaming mouse so nah.

* Great audio: This is a plus, or I can just grab a set of nice headphones

**List any features that are critical:**

I want this laptop to be secure. Perhaps one that comes with encryption of some sort. I'm very paranoid about my own safety. I like running Tor. I want this laptop's security to be tight. I'd prefer it not come with loads of bloatware (although I can uninstall). I've also been advised to not to go with Intel U processors. Avoiding these would be nice. A dedicated card and a decently sized SSD are essential. This should be able to run Skype and games like TF2/Gmod at max settings at the same time. Fast boot times and loading are great. I'd like a larger screen."

Will be like a human resources interview? Has nothing to do with it?

As they are super, super competitive I applied for 3 different companies. 

I received a call back for a really great employer (#1), and attended the interview. However, before I heard back from them, I also got an interview with firm #2. A few days after the interview, I received an offer from employer #1. Over the phone I was really excited, however I held on to the formal letter of offer waiting to hear from firm #2. About a week and a half later, I was also offered a position with firm #2. This was a fortnight ago.

I agonised and finally decided on firm #2. This is because the position with firm #2 is a year long part-time position with much better hireback. Firm #1 is an amazing firm too, but it is only for a month and is small with less chance of further employment. I was supposed to do this in March 2016.

I planned to call Firm #1 as soon as I received the formal offer for Firm #2 but I am yet to receive it. This is really awkward because Firm #1 is having a 'Christmas in July' welcome party next Wednesday and I am supposed to attend. Obviously I can't go, but I also fear turning them down and then the other one falling through.

So I guess I am looking for advice in 2 parts:

1. Should I wait until I receive the formal offer from Firm #2, or trust the phone call? I sort of doubt they would renege but still worried.

2. How can I approach the phone call? I know it is going to be awkward but I want to minimise future damage, both for my employment prospects and also because they are really nice people and I am genuinely very sorry to be turning down what is a great offer.

I have very bad anxiety and I am really working myself into a lather about this! Any advice would be appreciated :)"

We're a fairly small business but we have some slightly complex IT, and we're struggling to find a place that we think can handle it all.

Best case scenario, we find a place that will do everything from helpdesk (mostly keyboard actuator issues) to troubleshooting Exchange, Server 2012 R2 Failover Clusters, and the vCenter setup.  At this point though I'd be fine with having an MSP just handle the servers and find an intern to do the day-to-day helpdesk stuff.

Here's a quick overview of what we've got going on:

* Multi-homed IPv4/IPv6 internet with BGP
* 3 host vCenter 5.5 cluster with iSCSI storage
* SQL Server 2012 Failover Cluster (2 nodes)
* Domain-based DFS shares on a 2012 R2 Failover Cluster
* Pervasive use of Folder Redirection and Offline Files on workstations
* DirectAccess VPN with native IPv6 on the whole network
* On-premise Exchange 2013 (single server)
* On-premise Sharepoint 2013 (single server)
* Cluster of IIS backend web server behind a cluster of IIS reverse proxies running ARR
* Site-to-site VPN on Cisco ASAs to our DR site

 So I go into the office to find the boss' sister having a massive frowny face and crossed arms like she's already annoyed with me and she starts telling me that the computer is frozen and she can't open up her bookmarks. 


She's using Internet Explorer


She's using IE 7 because ""some sites don't support IE 10..""


WELL THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM


So I close the IE out completely and open firefox
&gt;"" I suggest using firefox next time...blah blah""


She tells me that certain client's websites can only be viewed in IE and that she HAS to use IE because it has all of her saved bookmarks and she doesn't want to 'copy and paste' all of the bookmarks into firefox.


Okay, whatever


Open up IE


Go immediately to 'favorites' 


Open up her bookmarks with no trouble and bring up the websites that she wanted.


&gt;""HOW DID YOU DO THAT??""


&gt;'Uh... I clicked on favorites and then the website. If it freezes again, just close the browser out and then open it back up again""


&gt;""Well I KNOW how to click on the favorites; but how did you get it to not freeze for you?""


Try to joke around and lighten the mood 
&gt;""Because it can sense fear. Just give me a call if you need anything else""


So I leave and go back to attempting to create a CRM from scratch in Access

 
15 min later get call from the boss again


His sister's computer is still freezing up.


&gt;""Pyro, I thought you said you fixed it!""


&gt;""I did fix it sir, it worked perfectly fine when I used it and the several other times that I repeated the same process""


&gt;""Well we don't have tech-savy people here! I'm paying them to blah blah! Your job is to fix it the first time!""


Force smile and agree and go back to fix the computer


&gt;""It's frozen again Pyro! What did you do to make it work?!""


I literally do the exact same thing I did last time. Close completely and open it back up and go to the favorites.


&gt;""It's fine, I can get to your favorites without any problems""


&gt;""Yes but what steps did you take to get it to do that?!""


Go step by step in how to do the thing


&gt;""Don't patronize me; I'm not an idiot. I know how to click buttons""


&gt;""Yes ma'am, is there anything else you needed help with?""


&gt;""No, I can do it""


Leave and continue pulling hair out trying to make the stupid project in Access work


Hear angry bellow from down the hall 


&gt;""PYRO! I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO FIX THIS!""


wtf I've fixed the damn thing 


&gt;""I have fixed it sir, and shown her the steps on how to do exactly what I did to fix it""


Get yelled at for about 5 min on how I'm supposed to fix these issues the first time without him having to look over my shoulder and make sure it's done correctly.


Have to do a walk of shame WITH MY BOSS over to the 'problem computer'


Turns out his sister was using a coworker's computer.


The coworker has returned and has turned off the machine and is turning it back on


Oh thank fuck someone who might actually have critical thinking


Get yelled at in front of entire office for wasting everyone's time in having to be looked over and for 'not doing job right the first time; wasting precious time they could have been doing their job.. etc""


Coworker turns on computer


It fucking works FINE


No problems, even shitty IE is working and not freezing


Proceed to get yelled at AGAIN in in front of coworker and the entire office (everyone has pretty much stopped to listen in and gawk around to be able to hear me get blessed out. Bitch face boss' sister is looking smug in the back) about how ""the other workers don't have time to keep resetting and turning off the computer."" and that ""They HAVE to have IE because some client's sites ONLY work in IE""


I have to spend my lunch break 'fixing' this computer to make sure that there are no more 'problems'

I spend my lunch break importing all the bookmarks into firefox and then spend the rest of the time seething; but get over it after venting to another IT friend

I see the boss' sister in the hallway every day and every time I see her she just narrows her eyes and gives me this shit eating 'ha ha I got you in trouble' smirk.

Welp, I guess I should just go ahead and get used to this I guess?






**UPDATE:** Apparently bitchy boss' sister hates me because she wanted her 15 and 14 year old sons to be the 'IT' people at this tiny ass firm; and apparently everyone in my building hates her too. We work in two different buildings right across the parking lot form each other, but she's ALWAYS over in my building wasting time and not doing her work. One building is the 'tax/accounting firm' the other is the 'insurance' building. I tend to just not say much to people here, but when I do I always try to be somewhat friendly and helpful. It seems this has come to be VERY good for me. 


Office politics may suck, but I learned YEARS ago to ""listen, but never contribute"" to gossip/news/dramaz and such..From the stuff that the older office workers have told me, they think that Sister is a mooching pro, and that she's a grade 'A' bitch. Fun receptionist lady is my best friend in the office. She's from Guam and is like 50 and takes me out for pizza during our lunch break sometimes; and then we talk about our dogs and what we are going to to this weekend.  She told me this while I was putting my lunch in the kitchen this morning:


 She also told me that Sister went bankrupt and the only reason she even has a job here is becuase my boss (her brother) felt sorry for her because she couldn't keep down any other jobs becuase she was ""unreasonable to work with"" or something along those lines; and that she's trying to weasle her entire family ,the two sons and and her husband who has no degree, into working at this tiny firm. She moved three states down becuase she couldn't hold down a job. I may store this away for later ammo....For now I can hold this knowledge close to me and laugh internally every time I see her now.

Need help on where to go from here,smoogrish,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3bnq4a/is_my_dream_job_salvageable_need_help_on_where_to/,"So I am a recent graduate from a top university and I majored in Classics and German. These majors clearly don't translate very well in the job market, however I did work REALLY hard to pull out a 3.7 GPA and honors. I worked in our IT Department at my University doing tech support for 2 years and I have internship experience in investment real estate in Germany.

Basically, what I was trying to do was make up for the fact I chose the wrong major (Classics, at least) and carve out my professional interests separate from my academic ones.

I just feel like I made a huge mistake staying with Classics, but I never gave it up because I worked so hard to even get through the whole major. We have one of the best undergrad Classics department in the country, but no one knows that when they see my resume or even know what Classics is (it's Latin and Greek language). I realize I can make this clearer but how do I make this relevant?

I keep applying for business analyst, project manager, and other graduate positions and seem to have pretty good luck at least getting through the first round, but so many companies (large banking ones) just drop off the face of the earth when I try and continue in the hiring process. I've applied to tech support jobs as a backup and those are going pretty well because I'm 100% qualified, but I don't want to keep doing tech support.  I have a few tech supports jobs on the line, but I just really want something more and am debating between taking them and settling.  I really want something with more responsibility than tech support and I KNOW I'm smart and capable. I work my ass off too and I can't say that I regret doing two difficult majors and working at the same time, but I am definitely having trouble being able to translate this onto paper so that I can get in the door of a company as a business analyst.  

I know that not all business analysts are created equally, but how can I move past the feeling I chose the wrong major completely but still keep applying for those positions? I came so close to analyst positions in other companies, and I know I can make a good impact when I get through the door. I don't have the business major experience, but I am an extremely hard worker, have a positive attitude (except maybe a little down right now after a few rejections), am very self motivated and I am smart.

This was really more of a venting post, but I just feel lost right now. I'm stuck between my dreams (being a business analyst) and reality (I'm having a lot of luck with tech support jobs and no one wants to hire humanities majors). I just want to work harder than I know tech support will make me work. I'm also planning on applying to a top 15 MBA program in the next 2 years, but I also want to get some experience under my belt before I do that.

I just went on a trip and saw a lot of successful young professionals who were a year out of college (where I went to school) and thought ""what am I doing with my life right now""?  I also got rejected from a job I wanted pretty badly. I feel like I'm in crisis mode and have been stuck there for 2 days or so.  Everything just feels wrong.  

Any advice would help!"

I'm a 22-year old programmer girl. 

I've been working retail since I was 16 and just got my first big girl job in industry. I'm working for a small company (10-20) people that does translations for STEM industries. They hired me on to help the other solitary programmer maintain and contribute to their proprietary database system that manages their quotes. 

When I started, they were pretty vague about job duties. The first project they gave me was designing their site, which took 2.5 months after waiting on content, bosses changing their minds etc. I also set it up as an ASP.NET framework that accesses their custom database. 

Next they want me to do error logging for another in-place system, for the VPs side company. This is all in c# and sql.

My experience is in network administration and Web design, but mostly student positions. I'm still currently in college, graduating next year with my Computer Information Systems degree.

Office is small but nice, I have my own desk in an office shared with 3 other employees. People are friendly, we have company outings every so often, so that's nice. 

I'm being paid ten an hour, 40 hours a week. They moved me from summer intern to permanent  employee a couple weeks ago, but when I inquired about a pay raise (that they discussed in my interview) I was told there wouldn't be one right now but ""Keep up the good work, I'm sure you'll see benefits from a job well done :) ""

During my interview I mentioned I was coming out of retail, as my resume says, so I'm worried they're undercutting me cus think I'll take whatever they're giving. 

Am I getting fucked over or is this a decent job? 


Tl;dr: ten an hour, 40 hr work week crap pay for entry level web developer?

* should I apply anyway (mentioning in the cover letter that I am applying in case they would be still interested in having other interns for the same position after the advertised date)?

My career goal is to become a Quantitative Analyst on the east coast, but I've heard from many sources that the name of the school you graduate from is a major factor for breaking into the finance industry.




I'll be coming out of this state school with a GPA in the 3.6-3.75 range. Last summer I volunteered with the cs department for an hour of code project, I have summer internships with startups / small companies, and last semester I made a computer game for the psychology department. I'll have another 2 summers before graduation to get more internship experience, and I'm trying to get into freelancing to get more experience.

With all of this in mind, I am worried that despite all the hard work I put in, my application to Quantitative Analyst jobs will be discarded immediately just from them looking at the school I went to. The two strategies I have thought of to counteract this are

1. Hustle my way through jobs on the east coast to establish more career experience in key technologies and fields.

2. Apply for top graduate schools to further my knowledge and expertise (my thought would be to apply for a masters in statistics, since that would be the area I have least experience in after my current undergraduate track), and build contacts in the area.

In both situations, I know that networking is going to have to be a large focus.

Does either one of these strategies stand out as ""smarter"" than the other for the end goal? Are there other potential strategies that I haven't given enough attention to?"

The question I've been struggling with after writing this post is, what is the optimal balance between team and individual productivity. Would love any input :)"
3bobpc,1,2015-06-30,Don't Want to Use my Degree After Graduating,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3bobpc/dont_want_to_use_my_degree_after_graduating/,"I'm in an odd situation. I have a year left of schooling and I have little intention to use my degree once Im gone.

I started college as a physics major. I knew I was vaguely interested in the sciences, and even though my passions were in music and writing, I had the idea shoved down my throat that artistic majors were a waste of time. In retrospect, I should have waited before starting college to decide what I wanted to do, but cest la vie. 

I ended up getting interested in computer programming, so I decided to be a computer science major. I liked how it applied mathematics and logic to accomplish tasks, and that was very rewarding for me in the beginning. I had one internship that wasn't bad, then a second one that was awful. After taking some electives in animation, I had begun to realize that, not only was I not particularly interested in computer programming, but also it was too late for me to turn back. In addition to the money my wonderful parents saved for my education, I received some hefty financial aid. I can graduate debt free, which really deters me from going back for more schooling because I don't want the burden of college loans to force me into a computer science job I don't want.

Right now I plan to graduate, live simply, and work a few part time jobs to decompress and figure out what I want out of life. I have recently been developing my hobbies of writing music and scripts. I would enjoy recording some music on my own and maybe making a web series or two with my friends. I have enough skills to do some freelance web development to earn some money, and I have always liked the idea of working as a barista in a small coffee shop, meeting all kinds of new customers and hearing their different stories. I have also considered tutoring, I have taught piano lessons in the past, and I could offer some introductory sessions in mainstream computer languages.

Does any of this sound sustainable? Does it make any sense? I see my friends around me graduating and moving on, a few of them are excited, most of them are incredibly nervous and uncomfortable, and a few are downright devastated about what theyre about to do. I regretfully ended up in a major I didnt love, but I dont want that to shackle me to a life I dont want. I just want to graduate, make enough money to keep a roof over my head, food on my plate, and have the time and mindset to explore my options. I dont plan on this being the rest of my life, I just want some time to let my mind wander and figure out what my next path will be. Am I being childish and ridiculous? I have heard all kinds of different responses from my friends. I feel pressure to get an impressive job since I have the ""impressive"" degree to match, but in a weird way I envy my friends with less marketable degrees who are still bouncing around and figuring themselves out.

I am just very confused and would like some advice on how to move forward."
3boer7,9,2015-06-30,Someone's Sending Letters To My Sister's Friends...It Might Be Me,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3boer7/someones_sending_letters_to_my_sisters_friendsit/,"**Tuesday - 3:12PM**

&amp;nbsp;

I stood outside of my little sister, Farah's, classroom waiting for her to be dismissed. Her elementary/middle school holds a summer camp where they learn certain things to prepare them for their next grade level. It's supposed to be a 5-week program and we're on week 3 now. Man, I miss my days as a 6-year-old, not having to worry about exams, financial aid and internships. She doesn't even realize how lucky she is in this moment.

&amp;nbsp;

The 3:15 bell rang and I patiently waited for her to come out with a loud, *""HI SIS,""* as she always did. Instead, one of my sister's friends, Leila, approached me.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hi Leila! How was school today?""*

&amp;nbsp;

She looked down to the floor with an uneasy facial expression. She then pulled a folded piece of paper out of her Tweety Bird backpack.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Umm...hi. Why did you leave this is in my cubby?""*

&amp;nbsp;

Confused, I retrieved the paper with Leila's name on it and began to unfold it when I saw her run down the hallway to her mom.

&amp;nbsp;

*""HI SIS!""*

&amp;nbsp;

Startled, I looked down at my little sister. Putting the note in my purse, I took her hand and we went home.

&amp;nbsp;

**Tuesday - 6:30PM**

&amp;nbsp;

I was lying on my bed in my room, doing some online shopping for an upcoming trip. I grabbed my purse to get my Chase debit card when I saw that folded piece of paper and remembered I hadn't read it. When I opened it I was highly disturbed.

&amp;nbsp;

[The Note](http://imgur.com/AtH3eWq)

&amp;nbsp;

I obviously know for a fact that I didn't write this and I'm even more sure that I didn't sneak into a school building and put it in a 6-year-old's cubby. I knew I was being framed or SOMETHING. I didn't know how to decipher this code, so I did what any person my age would do. I Googled it.

&amp;nbsp;

After trying different codes I was finally able to break it. Not so happy that I did:

&amp;nbsp;

**At night, when you sleep**
&amp;nbsp;

**I wake up and start to creep**
&amp;nbsp;

**And when you dream, I stand and stare**
&amp;nbsp;

**Over your bed with an evil glare**
&amp;nbsp;

**Nightmares come and nightmares go**
&amp;nbsp;

**But not before I steal your soul**
&amp;nbsp;

**And when you wake up in sweat and tears**
&amp;nbsp;

**Into your closet I disappear**

&amp;nbsp;

What in the actual motherfuckin' fuck. Who would even think of writing this in code, let alone give it to a little girl? I put it back into my purse and forgot about it. Thinking it was somehow a prank or a misunderstanding.

&amp;nbsp;


Later that night I decided to watch some television with my dad.

&amp;nbsp;

The 10 o'clock news told us that a boy named Robert Yenick was missing from his bed this morning.

&amp;nbsp;

**Wednesday - 3:30PM**

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a little late picking my sister up due to some heavy traffic. I see her waiting by her locker when I approach her classroom.

&amp;nbsp;

She looks up with a, *""HI, SIS""* and gives me a hug.

&amp;nbsp;

*""How was school today?""*

&amp;nbsp;

I'm getting used to saying this. I'm on my mom shit for some reason.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Good! Leila didn't show up today and Robert is still missing...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""You mean the boy from the news? I didn't know he was in your class""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Yup! We share erasers sometimes. He has batman on a few of them. Pretty cool, huh?""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Totally!""*

&amp;nbsp;

On our way to the car, a little boy came up to me.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hi Tyler,""* said my sister.

&amp;nbsp;

He ignored her and handed me a piece of paper.

&amp;nbsp;

*""I don't know how to read this, Briana.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""C'mon Tyler, say goodbye to your friend, we have to go!""* His father called.

&amp;nbsp;

He looked at me, smiled, and walked away.

&amp;nbsp;

I looked at the piece of paper only to see the exact same code from the one Leila gave me yesterday.

&amp;nbsp;

Shit. Just...shit.

&amp;nbsp;

**Wednesday - 10:30PM**

&amp;nbsp;

My dad tells me that another child has gone missing. Leila Woodsen. She was last seen leaving class with her mom Tuesday afternoon. When her dad went in her room to get her up this morning for school, she wasn't there. My dad told me that he spoke with my sister about it and she just cried. How do you tell a 6-year-old that another friend is missing?

&amp;nbsp;

Freaking out, I figured I'd try to end this madness. I don't recall becoming a mailman (or woman) overnight. I plugged my charger into my laptop and turned my webcam on. If it were true that I was making late night deliveries to the school and not getting tipped, I was going to find out!

&amp;nbsp;

**Thursday - 7:00AM**

&amp;nbsp;

My alarm clock is the worst thing in the world to me right now. I get out of bed to get my little sister, but she's already up. Great. One less thing I have to do, so I get dressed and ready to take her to school.

&amp;nbsp;

*""SIS! I'm ready!""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Coming!"" I call.*

&amp;nbsp;

We're on our way out of the door when I remember my webcam must still be recording.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Go get in the car, I'll be out in a minute!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I run in my room to press the ""STOP"" button, but see that it hasn't been recording. I look at my saved files, and the most recent one is 53 minutes long. I can see by the thumbnail of me in my bed that it's the right video...just a shorter version. Hours shorter. I took it with me and decided I'd check it out in the car after dropping my sister off. I didn't have anything better to do. I walk her to her classroom and her teacher greets me with a smile.

&amp;nbsp;

Back in the car I open up my laptop to view the footage. The first 51 minutes is me tossing and turning. Then, I see a figure walk past the laptop and up to my bed. It's a child.

&amp;nbsp;

It's my sister.

&amp;nbsp;

She turns around and faces the laptop, then walks up to it and sticks her tiny hand out. And that's the end of the video. Now I'm thinking why the hell was she in my room. She used to come in there last year when she would have nightmares and get in my bed. I thought maybe she was thinking about doing that and the webcam freaked her out. I wondered if she slept with me last night and went to her room when she woke up. I'd ask her later. I was about to pull off and head for home when I noticed that her ID card to get her lunch was on the floor of the passenger seat. She likes to sit up front, and yes I know it's illegal. I grabbed it and went to the classroom to return it to her. Her teacher opened the door.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hi, Briana! Back so soon?""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Yeah, my sister left her ID in my car.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Oh! I'll return it to her for you!""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Thank you, Mrs. Martin!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I handed her the card and looked around the classroom. My sister was in a group with some friends doing an activity. I began to walk out of the classroom when a damn telephone frightened me.

&amp;nbsp;

*Rinnnnng* *Rinnnnng*

&amp;nbsp;

I stopped by the door and decided to be nosy for no reason at all.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hello, Mrs. Martin's classroom.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Uh huh...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Oh my goodness.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""I'm so sorry, please call me back with an update! I'll ask the children if they know anything.""*

&amp;nbsp;

I looked around the classroom again. My sister was in a group with some friends doing an activity. And Tyler.

&amp;nbsp;

Tyler was missing.

&amp;nbsp;

I felt sick to my stomach and drove home feeling responsible for all of this. I don't know why. It's not like I had gone around kidnapping children. I was sure of it. I didn't want to go back to the school to pick up my sister. I didn't want one of her friends to hand me another note ""I"" had written. I didn't want Tyler to make it on the 10 o'clock news. Or any news for that matter.

&amp;nbsp;

**Thursday - 3:15PM**

&amp;nbsp;

I was at my sister's school. I went to her classroom and grabbed her hand, ignored her, *""HI SIS!""* and went straight for the car. I avoided every child from the classroom to the parking lot. When we were finally safe at home, I went into my bedroom and shut the door. A few minutes later, my sister was knocking.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Briana! Here, I don't know what to do with this.""*

&amp;nbsp;

I looked at the folded up piece of paper she was holding.

&amp;nbsp;

*""It's okay, I don't want it, throw it away.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""But-""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""THROW IT AWAY!""*

&amp;nbsp;

She stuck the note in my trash can and that gave me the urge to light the entire thing on fire. She left.

&amp;nbsp;

*""FARAH!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I forgot to ask her about turning my webcam off.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Did you sleep in my bed last night?""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""No...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""It's okay if you had a bad dream, you can tell me.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""I promise I didn't!""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Then, why did you come in my room and turn my webcam off?""*

&amp;nbsp;

She looked confused.

&amp;nbsp;

*""What's a webcam?""*

&amp;nbsp;

I told her never mind and that she could leave my room. I didn't care. I knew she was lying.

&amp;nbsp;

Instead of watching the news, I locked myself in my room for the rest of the night. I didn't want to see a picture of Tyler staring back at me.

&amp;nbsp;

**Friday - 1:03AM**

&amp;nbsp;

I woke up with the urge to piss in my bed. I hadn't left my room all night, and let my bladder get the best of me! I went to the bathroom, came out and peeked into my sister's room. She wasn't in the bed. I went into the kitchen to see if she was sneaking some food at this time of hour when I heard footsteps coming up the basement stairs. They reached the top and my sister looked at me eyes wide opened.

&amp;nbsp;

*""What the hell were you doing down there?*

&amp;nbsp;

*""I thought I head something...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""You're supposed to be in bed! You have school in the morning!""*

&amp;nbsp;

Yup. I was still on my mom shit.

&amp;nbsp;

She rolled her eyes at me and walked back to her bedroom. I never thought a 6-year-old would be brave enough to go into a basement at night because they heard a noise. What type of shit is that?

&amp;nbsp;

After hearing her door shut, I decided to take over her mission and see what she was REALLY doing down there.

&amp;nbsp;

**Friday - 1:10 AM**

&amp;nbsp;

I tried to turn on the light switch by the stairs, but the damn light didn't come on. On top of all of my other problems, I needed to find a light bulb.

&amp;nbsp;

I searched around for the supply cabinet. It was pitch black and clammy and I wanted nothing more than to be back upstairs in my room, but I had to find out what she was doing down here. I was only a few steps away from where we kept the light bulbs so I wasn't in too much of a frenzy. I made my way to the back and fiddled around until I found the handle to the cabinet.

&amp;nbsp;

YES!

&amp;nbsp;

There was an unopened box of light bulbs on the shelf. For some reason I was afraid that it'd be like one of those scary movies where there's one light bulb left and the idiot character drops it. Or when the batteries to a flashlight just so happen to stop working.

&amp;nbsp;

I took one out only to sadly realize that I had to make my way back to the middle of the room to actually CHANGE the bulb. It took me about five minutes of mazing around before I became highly irritated, and threw my hands in the air. I felt something cold and thin travel along the back of my arm. I jumped before realizing it was the chain to the light. I happily unscrewed the bulb above it and replaced it with a new one. And just with the yank of a chain, pitch black became pitch perfect. Yes, I regret saying that, but I won't backspace now. With my newly lit basement, I looked around until I came across a cardboard box taped securely. I had never seen it before so I picked it up (it was pretty light) and I carried it up to my room.

&amp;nbsp;

What I found inside, I cannot explain.

&amp;nbsp;

School supplies. Fucking school supplies.

&amp;nbsp;

A Ninja Turtle notebook.
&amp;nbsp;

A Spider-man pencil case.
&amp;nbsp;

A Batman eraser.
&amp;nbsp;

And a Tweety Bird fucking backpack.

&amp;nbsp;

I fell asleep leaning against my wall trying to figure shit out. And let me tell you, shit was not figured out. I woke up at 7AM again to the sound of my alarm clock. I needed to talk to my sister, find out if she knew about this box. She's only 6 so I know it's highly impossible for someone her age to kidnap children. Maybe she was stealing their school supplies and the disappearances were a coincidence.

&amp;nbsp;

Yeah, right.

&amp;nbsp;

I got up and went to my sister's room, but she wasn't in her bed.

&amp;nbsp;

*""FARAH!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I yelled her name a bunch of times before my dad came in asking me why I was screaming.

&amp;nbsp;

*""I can't find Farah. I looked around the entire house!""*

&amp;nbsp;

My dad went outside and I heard him start the car. I went back in my room to hide the box just in case we had to call the police. It was then that I noticed her new Hello Kitty lunch bag was now in the box. Panicking, I decided I would just throw it all away. I took the garbage bag out of my can and began to put items from the box in it, when I noticed the piece of paper my sister threw in there. It had her name on the front of it. I already knew what it said, so I didn't open it. I went outside and threw the trash in the dumpster.

&amp;nbsp;

**Friday - 10:01PM**

&amp;nbsp;

*""A 6-year-old girl by the name of Farah P****** went missing from her bed this morning...""*

3bomot,1,2015-06-30,I have a very hands-off manager. How do I improve the internship program?,Datusbit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3bomot/i_have_a_very_handsoff_manager_how_do_i_improve/,"I am 1 of 8 interns for a small tech company. Managers are very hands off and so interns have a lot of freedom but at the same time no real focused mentorship.

The internship program currently, has no formal documentation or structure. No manuals, or how-to documents. No regular meetings or check ups. Simply a work wish list and some really smart guys you can ask if you have questions.

At this point, i'm open to any suggestions that help build an effective internship program. Maybe you have a system in place or are using a particular tool that aids workflow, please do share.

Below is just me spitballing my own idea and would like your 2 cents about it, if you’re willing to read:

My first stab at trying to improve the internship program was to expedite the learning process.

For the most part, all the interns here work autonomously on different projects. Naturally, they all go through their own learning process for their respective projects.

I love learning, and I want to learn about what the other interns are working on, but learning is a time consuming and at times frustrating activity.

I toyed with the idea of making the interns document what they learn, because I naturally do this on my own (Evernote). But I know this wouldn't be viable because most of the time, the document only makes complete sense to the author.

Also, writing these documents could prove to be difficult, not everyone can teach or explain the best, especially in writing. As an example, I just learned unit testing and the idea of writing a how to unit test document is opaque right now even though I just learned how to do it."

Back in the car I open up my laptop to view the footage. The first 51 minutes is me tossing and turning. Then, I see a figure walk past the laptop and up to my bed. It's a child.

&amp;nbsp;

It's my sister.

&amp;nbsp;

She turns around and faces the laptop, then walks up to it and sticks her tiny hand out. And that's the end of the video. Now I'm thinking why the hell was she in my room. She used to come in there last year when she would have nightmares and get in my bed. I thought maybe she was thinking about doing that and the webcam freaked her out. I wondered if she slept with me last night and went to her room when she woke up. I'd ask her later. I was about to pull off and head for home when I noticed that her ID card to get her lunch was on the floor of the passenger seat. She likes to sit up front, and yes I know it's illegal. I grabbed it and went to the classroom to return it to her. Her teacher opened the door.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hi, Briana! Back so soon?""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Yeah, my sister left her ID in my car.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Oh! I'll return it to her for you!""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Thank you, Mrs. Martin!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I handed her the card and looked around the classroom. My sister was in a group with some friends doing an activity. I began to walk out of the classroom when a damn telephone frightened me.

&amp;nbsp;

*Rinnnnng* *Rinnnnng*

&amp;nbsp;

I stopped by the door and decided to be nosy for no reason at all.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Hello, Mrs. Martin's classroom.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Uh huh...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Oh my goodness.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""I'm so sorry, please call me back with an update! I'll ask the children if they know anything.""*

&amp;nbsp;

I looked around the classroom again. My sister was in a group with some friends doing an activity. And Tyler.

&amp;nbsp;

Tyler was missing.

&amp;nbsp;

I felt sick to my stomach and drove home feeling responsible for all of this. I don't know why. It's not like I had gone around kidnapping children. I was sure of it. I didn't want to go back to the school to pick up my sister. I didn't want one of her friends to hand me another note ""I"" had written. I didn't want Tyler to make it on the 10 o'clock news. Or any news for that matter.

&amp;nbsp;

**Thursday - 3:15PM**

&amp;nbsp;

I was at my sister's school. I went to her classroom and grabbed her hand, ignored her, *""HI SIS!""* and went straight for the car. I avoided every child from the classroom to the parking lot. When we were finally safe at home, I went into my bedroom and shut the door. A few minutes later, my sister was knocking.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Briana! Here, I don't know what to do with this.""*

&amp;nbsp;

I looked at the folded up piece of paper she was holding.

&amp;nbsp;

*""It's okay, I don't want it, throw it away.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""But-""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""THROW IT AWAY!""*

&amp;nbsp;

She stuck the note in my trash can and that gave me the urge to light the entire thing on fire. She left.

&amp;nbsp;

*""FARAH!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I forgot to ask her about turning my webcam off.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Did you sleep in my bed last night?""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""No...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""It's okay if you had a bad dream, you can tell me.""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""I promise I didn't!""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""Then, why did you come in my room and turn my webcam off?""*

&amp;nbsp;

She looked confused.

&amp;nbsp;

*""What's a webcam?""*

&amp;nbsp;

I told her never mind and that she could leave my room. I didn't care. I knew she was lying.

&amp;nbsp;

Instead of watching the news, I locked myself in my room for the rest of the night. I didn't want to see a picture of Tyler staring back at me.

&amp;nbsp;

**Friday - 1:03AM**

&amp;nbsp;

I woke up with the urge to piss in my bed. I hadn't left my room all night, and let my bladder get the best of me! I went to the bathroom, came out and peeked into my sister's room. She wasn't in the bed. I went into the kitchen to see if she was sneaking some food at this time of hour when I heard footsteps coming up the basement stairs. They reached the top and my sister looked at me eyes wide opened.

&amp;nbsp;

*""What the hell were you doing down there?*

&amp;nbsp;

*""I thought I head something...""*

&amp;nbsp;

*""You're supposed to be in bed! You have school in the morning!""*

&amp;nbsp;

Yup. I was still on my mom shit.

&amp;nbsp;

She rolled her eyes at me and walked back to her bedroom. I never thought a 6-year-old would be brave enough to go into a basement at night because they heard a noise. What type of shit is that?

&amp;nbsp;

After hearing her door shut, I decided to take over her mission and see what she was REALLY doing down there.

&amp;nbsp;

**Friday - 1:10 AM**

&amp;nbsp;

I tried to turn on the light switch by the stairs, but the damn light didn't come on. On top of all of my other problems, I needed to find a light bulb.

&amp;nbsp;

I searched around for the supply cabinet. It was pitch black and clammy and I wanted nothing more than to be back upstairs in my room, but I had to find out what she was doing down here. I was only a few steps away from where we kept the light bulbs so I wasn't in too much of a frenzy. I made my way to the back and fiddled around until I found the handle to the cabinet.

&amp;nbsp;

YES!

&amp;nbsp;

There was an unopened box of light bulbs on the shelf. For some reason I was afraid that it'd be like one of those scary movies where there's one light bulb left and the idiot character drops it. Or when the batteries to a flashlight just so happen to stop working.

&amp;nbsp;

I took one out only to sadly realize that I had to make my way back to the middle of the room to actually CHANGE the bulb. It took me about five minutes of mazing around before I became highly irritated, and threw my hands in the air. I felt something cold and thin travel along the back of my arm. I jumped before realizing it was the chain to the light. I happily unscrewed the bulb above it and replaced it with a new one. And just with the yank of a chain, pitch black became pitch perfect. Yes, I regret saying that, but I won't backspace now. With my newly lit basement, I looked around until I came across a cardboard box taped securely. I had never seen it before so I picked it up (it was pretty light) and I carried it up to my room.

&amp;nbsp;

What I found inside, I cannot explain.

&amp;nbsp;

School supplies. Fucking school supplies.

&amp;nbsp;

A Ninja Turtle notebook.
&amp;nbsp;

A Spider-man pencil case.
&amp;nbsp;

A Batman eraser.
&amp;nbsp;

And a Tweety Bird fucking backpack.

&amp;nbsp;

I fell asleep leaning against my wall trying to figure shit out. And let me tell you, shit was not figured out. I woke up at 7AM again to the sound of my alarm clock. I needed to talk to my sister, find out if she knew about this box. She's only 6 so I know it's highly impossible for someone her age to kidnap children. Maybe she was stealing their school supplies and the disappearances were a coincidence.

&amp;nbsp;

Yeah, right.

&amp;nbsp;

I got up and went to my sister's room, but she wasn't in her bed.

&amp;nbsp;

*""FARAH!""*

&amp;nbsp;

I yelled her name a bunch of times before my dad came in asking me why I was screaming.

&amp;nbsp;

*""I can't find Farah. I looked around the entire house!""*

&amp;nbsp;

My dad went outside and I heard him start the car. I went back in my room to hide the box just in case we had to call the police. It was then that I noticed her new Hello Kitty lunch bag was now in the box. Panicking, I decided I would just throw it all away. I took the garbage bag out of my can and began to put items from the box in it, when I noticed the piece of paper my sister threw in there. It had her name on the front of it. I already knew what it said, so I didn't open it. I went outside and threw the trash in the dumpster.

&amp;nbsp;

**Friday - 10:01PM**

&amp;nbsp;

*""A 6-year-old girl by the name of Farah P****** went missing from her bed this morning...""*

Since it was the last week of school, the teacher left ""busy work"" for the morning and a movie for the afternoon. I found the class EXTREMELY challenging, which was later confirmed by other teachers at the school as being the reputation of that class.
  
I had a lot of difficulty keeping the class under control. It was all normal student misbehaviors - they would not stay in their seats, they would not do their work, they would get into arguments with one another, etc. To get their attention, I tried shushing them, clapping, turning on and off the lights but they didn't really respond to any of it. There was also a student with autism, but no student assistant, who kept trying to run out of the classroom when things weren't going his way.

  I felt pretty crappy about it all and have really doubted whether or not I'm cut out to teach, although I did love my internship. I definitely don't want to spend every sub day just trying to survive, so what can I do differently? How can I better manage the behavior of the next (K-6) class I sub? "
