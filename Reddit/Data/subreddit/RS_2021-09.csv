pfjves,2,2021-08-31,Having doubts about my Masters in Psychology program. Could use some advice,gentnscholar,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/pfjves/having_doubts_about_my_masters_in_psychology/,"I'm 29M, I've been enrolled in an online Masters in Psychology program since May. I have a B.S. in Information Technology &amp; a graduate certificate in project management. 

I have 6 years of experience in the IT industry. I was laid off from my company last year due to COVID. I chose the IT field outta desperation for acquiring a living wage job &amp; I thought I'd like IT due to always being on the computer growing up. I continued with my education because I didn't know what else to do (lacked direction).  I've realized that I despise the corporate world &amp; the office politics bullshit that one endures in those types of environments (had to deal with some shitty/bully-type of people). 

I've been seeing a therapist for two years &amp; have learned that I have a genuine interest &amp; passion for psychology/mental health. I want to assist people with understanding who they are &amp; what their potential is. I want to help people overcome their mental ailments &amp; traumas to become the best versions of themselves. I ultimately wanna have a career that's meaningful that has a good salary as well. 

The Masters degree is terminal &amp; supposed to prepare you for a doctorate. I constantly hear that PhD programs are ridiculously competitive &amp; PsyD programs are extremely expensive. I chose the terminal Masters instead of an MA in Mental Health Counseling because 1. the salary for licensed mental health counselors aren't great &amp; 2. I want to be able to relocate to a dense/walkable city &amp; don't wanna have to be stuck in my city for another 4+ years or so. 

 I finished the foundations in statistics course &amp; am currently in the foundations in research methods course (the second course of the program).

I'm 100% primarily interested in the clinical/psychotherapeutic side of psychology. I chose this program since it's entirely online, however the university does have an online MA in Mental Health Counseling available. The problem is, I'd have to fly out of state to their location to perform the internship(s) &amp; practicum(s). (There is another university that has an online MA MHC program &amp; the practicum &amp; internship can be completed wherever the student is located). 

I acknowledge that pursuing a doctorate in psychology is a long road &amp; I do genuinely want to pursue a career in this field but I'm not sure if I'm going about it wisely. 

I would hate to have a Masters in Psych &amp; have an incredibly tough time getting accepted into any doctorate programs (PhD or PsyD). I acknowledge that  Masters in Psych degrees aren't licensable. My goal when starting this program was to get this degree to enable me to apply for &amp; pursue a doctorate. 

I would hate to abandon this journey but I've been thinking that worst case scenario if this isn't a good idea I could just postpone or abandon this degree &amp; return to university at a later date or instead pursue a physical therapist assistant degree (less time &amp; cheaper &amp; it's meaningful too). Neither of those scenarios are ideal for me as I definitely wanna do Psych but I like to prepare in advance &amp; weigh out my options. 

Any advice or guidance is much appreciated."

pfr4hu,2743,2021-09-01,The secret vaults of the Padmanabhaswamy temple hold a treasure worth $1 Trillion. Vault B should never have been opened.,Mandahrk,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pfr4hu/the_secret_vaults_of_the_padmanabhaswamy_temple/,"The Padmanabhaswamy temple might just be India's greatest mystery. Located in Thiruvananthapuram, the bustling capital city of the southern state of Kerala, it's been flitting in and out of the news for over a decade. 

Because of its treasure, of course. Arguably the greatest one ever found.

It is a beautiful temple, an exquisite amalgamation of two distinct styles of architecture. By far its most recognisable feature is the *gopuram*, the multi-storied trapezoidal gateway that turns gold when bathed with sunlight. The tall gateway has open passageways at its centre, one on each floor, so perfectly aligned that when the sun sets on an equinox, you can see it winking through each of these holes at five minute intervals. The most intricate stucco sculptures have been carved into every inch of its walls. 

But the beauty and the architectural marvels of its superstructure are not what make the temple special. No, the true source of its infamy lies *beneath* it, in its eight underground vaults.

The temple is over a thousand years old. Through those long years, devotees, rich and poor, peasants and kings have offered tributes to its deity, Lord Vishnu. Tributes that trickled into these vaults and eventually ballooned into a jaw dropping treasure.

Strenuous efforts have been made to make a record of this wealth, and we've had a fair measure of success at that. The ballpark figure of $1 Trillion was reached after such extensive accounting. In fact, almost all vaults have been quite thoroughly researched by now. All except one. 

Vault B.

Located near the Ayappa shrine and beneath the sanctum sanctorum, Vault B has long been shrouded in mystery. It is said to hold an incredible treasure and a terrible curse within its walls. The internet is abound with pictures of its door. Adorned with sinister carvings of twining snakes and topped by a demon's head with its tongue hanging out of its snarling mouth, the thick iron door has no obvious way of opening it. No locks, no latches, no handles, nothing. It is believed that only an accomplished *Sadhu* can open this vault, using magical chants and spells.

Not to say that it *cannot* be opened at all. There have been rumors in the past of the vault being opened and a terrible curse befalling those who entered it. They all supposedly fell to violent deaths, tragedies too terrible to be accurately retold.

But I can state, authoritatively, that as long as the temple has stood, it has only been opened once. In 2020.

I know. Because I was there.

*

It was Covid-19 that accorded us the opportunity. A nationwide lockdown began on 25th March, and lasted months. The temple that would usually be teeming with devotees turned desolate. One couldn't get a better chance to carry out clandestine research. Away from the prying eyes of reporters and those who hold a bit too much with superstition. 

The conspirators needed a historian, and who else could be better than an Associate Professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University's Centre For Historical Studies? One who would do anything to be involved in a project like this. 

So that's how that muggy mid-June afternoon found me at the forlorn Padmanabhaswamy temple, face slick with sweat, a white mask plastered to my mouth and a Nike bag slung over my shoulders. Flanked by two policemen wearing Khaki uniforms and brown cotton masks, Arun Nambiar, from the Archeological Survey of India, met me near the colossal gateway to the temple. He was thin and short, with wiry grey hair and soft skin under a sharp chin partially hidden by a blue scrap of a mask. 

""Mr Khanna!"" He said, the flesh around his eyebrows stretching with a smile. He offered me a handshake before suddenly remembering we were in the middle of a pandemic. ""We've been waiting for you. I hope you had a pleasant journey.""

""As pleasant as can be expected these days."" I said, then my eyes drifted over to the two cops. ""Will it just be the two of us?""

""Besides these gentlemen, you mean? I have two interns with me. They're waiting for us at the Vault.""

My cheeks burned, and not just from the humid heat. ""I hope you didn't have to wait for too long.""

He laughed. It was boisterous, though a bit muffled by the mask. ""Please, it's fine. We couldn't have started without the man who authored the legendary paper on Kushan Numismatics.""

I grinned. ""Co-authored."" 

As we made our way over to Vault B, Mr. Nambiar told me about how hard it had been to get the project approved, what with the pandemic and bureaucratic red-tapism and the superstitions surrounding the vault slowing everything down to a crawl. Not to mention the descendants of the Travancore royal family, the one who had restored the temple a couple hundred years ago, breathing down hard on his neck. He was telling me about the Supreme court appointed committee that had overseen the opening of the other vaults when we slipped around the Ayappa shrine and began our descent down the stone steps to Vault B. His interns had joined us on the way, Arpita and Jayesh, two PhD students in their late twenties.

Soon we found ourselves in front of the door to Vault B.

It was a metal-grille door.

Rusted, but still sturdy.

""Not quite like the internet, is it?"" Arpita mused.

""Of course it isn't. This one is just the door to the antechamber."" Mr. Nambiar said, then gestured at us to make way for the cops. One of them produced a thick iron key and slid it into the lock. And turned it with a loud clang. The door squealed on its hinges, revealing a thick wooden door, which in turn led to another iron door.

""This one was jammed shut."" Mr. Nambiar said. ""We had to get a professional locksmith to get it opened.""

My heart beat against my ribcage. It was really happening. One of the greatest mysteries was going to resolve itself in front of my eyes. 

As the second iron door opened with a metallic groan, a cold, musty and decidedly unwelcoming draft washed over us. Dust motes shivered in the weak daylight that spilled onto the stone floor. It was dark inside the low-roofed chamber. We couldn't really see much, not until Jayesh brought out the halogen lamp. The cramped room lit up with the harsh yellow glow. I saw shadows fleeing under the wrath of the lamp as I ducked into the room. 

Everything glittered.

It truly looked like a treasure room. Albeit a small one. Rotted jute sacks spilled silver coins onto the floor, wooden chests lined the walls, some with their lids open, revealing gold jewellery studded with rubies and emeralds and other sparkling gemstones. Glazed and polished pottery, gold pots and bars, ivory toys and idols, inlaid with silver, were piled into the corners. A quick look revealed the history in this treasure. I could see gold coins from the 15th century Vijaynagar empire as well as from the 9th century Cheras. Hell, Arpita even spotted a dented Satavahana coin made from lead.

I would have loved to stay there and sort through the various trinkets and ornaments in the antechamber. But that's not what we were there for. No, something far more compelling beckoned us.

The terrifying door to the inner rooms of Vault B, with its monstrous guardian snakes and the snarling demon's head. It loomed over the room, eating up half the space in the wall it was attached to. The sight of it left me breathless. I'm sure it had a similar effect on the others, for we were all staring at it in awe.

""Well, does anyone know any *mantra-tantra?*"" I asked, my voice softer than I had intended. ""Any magic spells?"" It broke the tension, eliciting some good natured, almost relieved laughter.

""No."" Mr. Nambiar said. ""But we have something just as good.""

He said something to the two cops in Malayalam, who then exited the vault and came back with crowbars. The sounds of scuffing boots and huffing men and iron dragging and slipping on iron followed. Then another, a more satisfying one, metal squealing and scraping on stone, as the door was forced open. Immediately my nose was attacked by a most loathsome stench. Reminded me of the smell of rainwater rotting in abandoned air conditioners, of moldy, unheated storerooms untouched by sunlight. And something else too. Just a hint of burnt wood. What? How? 

The light from the halogen lamp didn't penetrate the darkness in the space beyond the door. Like it was slamming, uselessly, into a thick wall of shadows.

I pulled my flashlight out of my bag, switched it on and pointed it at the darkness. It was a powerful flashlight, bright enough to man the ramparts of a high security prison. Here though, it seemed ineffectual, weakly splashing on the wet stone of the passage ahead. Seemed like the dark had sapped it of all life. Maybe the battery was dying, I thought as I slapped at its metal frame. Jayesh cursed as his eyes took the full force of the flashlight. 

*There it is,* I thought as I took another stab at the darkness beyond the inner door to Vault B. The light wilted, again. 

""Interesting."" Mr. Nambiar muttered. ""Very interesting.""

""An architectural trick?"" I said. ""Maybe the walls are lined with some strange mineral that absorbs light.""

""Maybe."" He said. ""Now I'm very intrigued. Wonder what lies at the end of this passage.""

""Only one way to find out.""

We entered the passage, one after the other. One of the cops took the lead, then Mr. Nambiar, followed by me and then the two interns. The other cop brought up the rear. There was more than enough space in the passage to walk with comfort, yet it felt suffocating. The darkness seemed to press up against us, pushing back the light like it was an alive, sentient thing. The air was thick, and even a cautious walk left me breathless.

""It's really weird."" Arpita whispered into my ear. 

""What is?"" I asked. 

""The walls,"" She said, ""they're made of wood."" 

I opened my mouth to tell her maybe wood had been used to reinforce the passage, but stopped. There was just something about the way she'd said it. I stretched my arm out, let my fingers brush against the wall.

The hair on the back of my neck stood up. She was right. It *was* wood. And not smooth wood, like human hands had worked on it, but rough. Uneven, like the sopping wet bark of a tree. Some *colossal* tree. I shivered at the thought.

We continued walking. The passage meandered, turning left, then right, but always sloping downwards. Gently, yes, but unquestionably downwards.

I heard Jayesh's voice behind me. ""How long is this thing? Is it even possible for the temple to have something this vast beneath it?""

""It *is* possible."" Mr. Nambiar answered, loudly. Made me wince. ""Just incredibly strange.""

Jayesh mumbled something incomprehensible in response.

We continued walking. For what seemed like hours, each second grinding against the previous one on its way over to the next. The darkness funneled around the cones of weak light spilling out of our flashlights, cut through our clothes, whittled down our spirits. There was a noticeable slump in our shoulders, yet we continued walking. The sounds of boots shuffling on stone and our laboured breathing were the only thing keeping the repressive silence at bay.

Then, after half an eternity, a voice shattered the quiet like a truck hurtling through a sheet of glass. ""I see something ahead.""

It was the policeman in the lead.

""What is it?"" I called out. 

""Light."" Mr Nambiar answered. ""Maybe an opening in the passageway.""

I heaved a sigh of relief. A strange fear had begun to set in, that the tunnel would never end, that the way behind us had been devoured by the shadows, and that we had been cursed to stumble through this cold and dark passage for all eternity. The muscles in my thighs and calves pulsed as I covered the final stretch, blinking rapidly when I saw the light. 

A stone awning above the opening of the passage was preventing most of the light from reaching us. But enough breached the darkness for us to become aware of its unnaturalness. 

It was pale, like moonlight. Shining, in all its alien glory, many metres beneath the surface. 

As I switched my emaciated flashlight off and stepped out of the passage and into the clearing, my jaw dropped at the sight in front of me. The clearing was small, about half the size of a basketball court, but round with a high, rocky ceiling. A ceiling that was studded with strange luminescent stones arrayed in dizzying patterns. They bathed the clearing in a wash of ethereal white glow. It made me feel like I was in a dream. 

But those stones weren't even close to being the most bizzare thing in the clearing. No, that honor went to the tree standing in the centre. It was tall enough to brush against the ceiling. Had a sturdy brown trunk, slender branches engulfed by healthy green leaves and bearing clusters of green flowers that resembled ripe little fruits.

""It's an *Iluppai* tree."" Mr. Nambiar said, awe turning his voice soft.

""What's that?"" Jayesh asked as he walked close to the tree and studied it. 

""A *mahua* tree."" I said, moving to join him in his inspection. ""That's what we call it up north. Its flowers are used to make alcoholic drinks by tribals across the country.""

""And it has some significance for our temple as well."" Arpita said, pulling a DSLR out of her bag. ""Question is, how the hell is it growing this deep underground?""

""True. There's no sunlight here."" I said. ""It *shouldn't* grow.""  

""Yet it is… Those stones."" Mr. Nambiar said. ""They must be responsible for this."" 

""What even are they?"" I asked. ""Have you ever seen anything like them?"" 

He shook his head. ""No. Can't say that I have."" 

""Well, Mr. Nambiar,"" I said, ""maybe you needed geologists and botanists more for this treasure hunt than a historian.""

Shadows danced across his gaunt face as he turned to reply to my little quip, but he was cut off by the tree. Which, well, shivered. Its branches trembled. Green leaves rained dust down upon us. The trunk groaned, like a ship rocking on a wave. 

We jumped away from the tree.

""What the hell just happened?"" Arpita asked, shaken.

""Maybe the ground shook. An earthquake."" Jayesh offered, not quite believing himself.

Before I could tell him just how ridiculous that explanation was, another sound issued from the tree. A sharp crack, like wood splintering. Sweat trickled down my brow as I noticed a long gash in the middle of the trunk. It was splitting open. I could see shadows writhing in the crack, shadows that reminded me of the passage. Rustling of dry leaves followed and then a hand shot out of the wound in the tree.

""What the fuck!"" I swore. Almost as one, we all jumped back, pressed ourselves up against the walls of the clearing.

The hand was small, frail, and black as coal. It was covered in grime and looked like it belonged to a little boy.

Then the rest of the boy followed. Another arm, a leg and then a small bald head, before the boy fully hauled himself out of his broken wooden cage, stumbling onto his knees in front of us. Naked. He moved on all four limbs, like a beast, turning his head sharply and glaring at each of us in turn, white teeth bared, tar-like eyes full of malevolence. Before we could even begin to wrap our heads around what we had just witnessed, the boy let out a terrible throaty scream, one that made us fall down to our knees, wincing in pain and clapping our hands on our ears.

Then the boy ran, out of the clearing and up the passage we had just come from.

The shadows swallowed his screams, leaving us all in shocked silence.

So I was working last Friday. I'm a translator, well, mostly intern for now, and my job requires a laptop or a computer for translating. And I also like coffee like most people. I get a cup of coffee every morning, put it on my desk. Kinda far away but still next to my laptop. 

I can never finish a cup of coffee in an hour or so, it has to get cold before I remember I made coffee. That day was the same, completely forgot about it and at one point I got up to clean my mirror. Then got a paper towel to dry it which was on my desk right next to my coffee. It was a disaster waiting to happen, you see. 

When I was putting the paper towel roll back on my desk, I accidentally hit the coffee cup, which was slimmer on the bottom and it made it way easier to fall right onto my keyboard. Not the sides, no, it landed directly on my laptop and spilled everything inside. Well, I guess I was lucky I had paper towels around tho right? 

It brings me much joy to inform you all that the laptop is fine and working. I turned it off, turned it upside down, cleaned it and took out the battery. I was so stressed because I had an online internship and the laptop was my only way of working, I can't afford a new one either so I was really scared. When it was completely dried out it was finally time to check the damage, and it was working fine, it had a little coffee smell, and the keys are were a little sticky but it is perfectly fine and still working! 

So I guess this is a reminder to y'all, don't leave your beverages next to your laptop guys. You WILL forget about it, and you might not be as lucky as me. Now I put my coffee by the window so even if it spills it will be on me, not my precious and expensive laptop! 

TL;DR: My ADHD ass forgot the coffee on my desk and eventually I hit the cup directly to my laptop, covering everything in bean juice. It still works tho."

pfsmzu,2,2021-09-01,I lost all my work...,HJSDGCE,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/pfsmzu/i_lost_all_my_work/,"For context, I'm talking about a Raspberry Pi, a type of small Linux-based computer with an SD card acting as its hard memory.

I am not a frequent user of the stuff. In fact, I've never even touched anything Linux-based before this because like most people, I use Windows for most of my life. I don't know any of its practices, its software or anything. But I had a job to do so I did it. I wrote a script in Python (again, I've never used it!), did a bunch of patching and checking for bugs, testing and more testing, etc. And I was almost done after 2 months.

But then, it all got ruined. Right in the middle of an upgrading session and had a hardware failure. So now, the whole SD card (you know, the dang harddrive) is soft-broken. I didn't make a backup because, like I said, *I DON'T KNOW ANY COMMON PRACTICES!*

I'm so angry at myself. I'm so angry at making a huge mistake that's gonna cost me a lot because I don't know anything. It's so frustrating and I just want to cry. I'm trying to fix it somehow but not a single tip online is helpful outside of ""Use Linux lol"". 

So right now, I'm making a backup of whatever I can and formatting the SD card of my Raspberry Pi. I'm going to reinstall EVERYTHING which btw, will take me HOURS and ON-SITE OUT IN THE SUN ***BECAUSE THE RASPBERRY PI IS TIGHTLY SCREWED IN SOME HARDWARE 30 MILES AWAY*** and hopefully, I'll never upgrade/update it ever again.

I'm not cut out to be an engineer. I'm just an intern and I fucked up so badly..."
pft1wj,20,2021-09-01,How much importance internships hold (Placement POV) and what are the alternatives to it?,throwawayShadeAtDHH,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/pft1wj/how_much_importance_internships_hold_placement/,"Hi, had to use throwaway because I am ashamed of the fact that I could not get internship.

I am from a tier 1 college and we had our internship drive in which all big companies came (DREAM Companies except Amazon and Adobe). As the title says, I could not clear any of them because most asked Graph which I could not prepare (this time companies came fast. Till mid august all major companies came and went from the college). The few in which I was able to clear all the coding questions, I was sorted out by CGPA (7.25, used to be okish till last year but thanks to covid 8 is the new norm). Now many people around me are having internship but I am still not having anything and internship drive looks like it is about to end.

Now, I in theory should cry and let my body produce some feel good chemicals so that after feeling miserable for sometimes I could revert back to working harder than ever but one questions is lingering in my head i.e. is internship like the make or break moment?

Ya I know internships are important as they give you a real life insight into workings of a software company but is it that important placement wise (point of comparison, DSA practice and Project making). Also internship gives you work experience to write in your resume, so is there any workaround to those things too? Like what should I do to add experience in my resume? I've been thinking of making an e-commerce website (like amazon) and sell some tribal products there as it would be a cool real life project with scalability factor but I am not sure about it. 

Also ik off campus is always an option but I am kinda skeptic about it given my current resume is not that strong (also my DSA skills are not that strong either. However I will try to apply after my current sem again as ig many companies open forms in 6th sem ig).

If someone is interested what I have done till now (as if some junior has to take notes on what **NOT** to do):  
1.) CGPA : 7.25  
2.) Project : Trivia quiz (Android), To-Do List (Android), To-Do List (Js), World Clock (Js), Amazon clone using React Js (Started this week)  
3.) DSA : \~200 on LC most of them were medium, almost completed strivers SDE sheet.

**TLDR :** Did not got internship, tier 1 college, is it that imp? Can I survive without it? what should I do if I dont get it? what projects should I include to impress people at placements next year (pref related to web dev), what should be my plan if I dont have an internship.

Thank you and sorry for the rant/RR/insecure, overthinking part."

pfwdh4,1,2021-09-01,Suicidal thoughts,[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/pfwdh4/suicidal_thoughts/,"I used to be a confident guy and I was not in the top of my class but you could say I was among the top 5. When I was younger I lacked seriousness about my career and used to play around a lot so my score in my competitive exams was not the greatest, but it wasn't the worst exactly. I got a seat in the college ranked 4th in my city. I now am much more serious about my career and am scoring pretty well. I'll be really truthful about the details. I have been in college for 2 years now and I'm persuing my undergraduate in Electronics and communication. I scored an average 9.15 cgpa in the two years and I have two years left in college. Most of the students graduating in engineering get their first internships in their third year. So even I tried to apply for one as I have my break going on before my fifth semester. I wasn't able to find one yet. 
So now let me get to the point. I have really the most strict kind of parents anybody can imagine. The ones who keep you extremely far away from the word called freedom. So my father isn't the brightest bulb in the room but he is very hard working and cares about his family. So recently he has been lashing out frustration on me. He comes home everyday and just starts ranting about how disappointed he is and how I could've gotten into a better college mostly I try to take it as an inspiration to study harder, but now he's been doing it too much and it has began to affect me in a decremental manner. I feel sad about my life for no reason at all. I do realise the fact that he cares about me that's why he pushes me so hard to become better. Believe me I do realise the fact that when someone loves you really they can be harsh with you at times to make you a better person. But, sometimes I just can't take it anymore. I really wish to have a normal conversation with my father sometimes, something other than studies, but that's all he ever cares about. He doesn't hate me , but he hates the fact that I couldn't be the kid who could get into the most prestigious university in the country and the kid who couldn't be at the top of his class always. Most of the times I'm just sad now, it seems to affect my studies negatively too. I can't ever concentrate in front of the booka nd randomly start to sigh and frown. I've started getting dreams in which I kill myself and have woken up to many nightmares. I've never had any nightmares since I was a kid, but now they start appearing randomly when I'm 19. I set right the dishes in my house and the other day when I was about to set away the knife, I zoned out and just kept staring at it. All this is happening subconsciously and I don't know what to do about it. My dad isn't the best person to talk to as he is one of those people who doesn't believe in mental health and would think anyone with these kinds of problems should deal with it themselves. I don't know why he's like this, but I think it's related with him losing his dad when he was 17. So, I think he never learnt how to be a good parent. I don't hate him but I don't love him at the same time. I just feel that I'm useless right now and will never find any meaning in life. I try to work towards my goals,but I just can't stay motivated if I get no appreciation and just get criticized all the time for one thing I did wrong in the past."

I know both I would say pretty well although I picked up PHP not that long ago. The issue is they wanted someone with knowledge in Laravel/Lumen and Docker, two things I have never used.

The hiring manager told me to come in on the 7th of September for sprint planning, something I've also never done although I've studied it.

I don't want to mess up because unlike a lot of people I do not go to some fancy pansy school for engineering so I feel like this opportunity is my best shot to solidify my position in the industry and get better jobs in the future.

I just feel like I am going to make a fool of myself to be honest, the hiring manager said during the interview ""You have said all the right things and I like you"" but not really sure why they hired me since I don't even know their main things.

Any advice?"

Every couple of years after I graduated, they call to check up on previous students and see how they're doing, what job they have, how much they make, all to boost themselves and say ""look how great a job WE did!"". I'd usually try to ignore them but they're pretty persistent in getting a hold of you anyway they can. I don't feel like I owe them anything and don't want them to take credit for my achievements. So I thought, maybe the only thing to stop them is to say I'm dead. They don't seem to report their findings to the state or any authority so would it be okay if I told just them I was dead so they'd stop trying to reach me?"

I have honestly only just begun job searching at a hard pace and assume it may take 2 to 3 months to find work. At what stage though should I give in and work for some WITCH company to gain experience?

For example, in this last job, a junior java developer position, I did not get picked to continue due to a technical assessment where I did great on the logic, good on the object-orientated section, but only answered 1 of the 2 programming challenges. The first being a medium difficulty leet code question I answered in 22 minutes, the second was a hard difficulty ""perfect squares"" question I only had 8 minutes left to try and assess and begin.

And in order to get an internship you need to be notable in some way (project experience, academic clubs, outstanding GPA, or relevant work experience, etc.).

First off have barriers to entry to the workforce increased? Anecdotally it seems like an undergrad in engineering and 3.0 GPA was a guarantee to a good paying job 20ish years ago.

If so why???

It seems like there has been a steady increase in student expectations. Are students in more stressful situation now vs. before?"
pfz6ql,7,2021-09-01,Information Science career help,Kaisylol,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/pfz6ql/information_science_career_help/,"Hello everyone,

I transferred in as a junior from a community college, and I now major in Information Science.

As background, I have no internship experience and only coded in C++ and Python from classes I've taken before. My knowledge in coding is really little to this day. I only have projects from those classes that aren't really substantial. 

I'm confused on the career paths for the major as I feel like there are so many things you can do - but how exactly do I prepare for those? How do I get those internships if I have no experience? I know we can do data science, UX design, etc. But will my classes be enough to prepare me for that? I feel like I have to do a lot on the side, and I don't know what. Right now, I'm taking INST 311, 314, and 327.

I know for CS you're supposed to study DS&amp;A and do a bunch of leet code, are we supposed to do that as well? In the INST classes I don't think we learn any of that material at all. 

I feel like things look really bleak. The career fair is later this month and I feel like I have nothing to offer aside from some irrelevant class coding projects and this biology program I was in this past summer (had no coding at all)

What do you suggest my next steps are? My goal is to land a job before graduation and I'm frightened that I won't be able to, I feel so behind.

Thanks everyone."
pfzmna,6,2021-09-01,Should I take a gap year?,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/pfzmna/should_i_take_a_gap_year/,"Hi everyone, I'm a senior undergraduate undecided about whether I should apply this year or not. I'm ok with any program (MS or PhD or Integrated MS/PhD) as long as it's funded, but I'm primarily targeting top unis in US or Canada or Switzerland.

Profile Stats:

* Field of Interest: Computer Arch, so will be applying to CS/EE programs
* Top tier uni in India, GPA: 9.71/10, Dep Rank 2
* Research Experience:  5 months in 1 lab (ongoing, relevant to field of choice), 1.5 yrs at another lab (but in a different field inside CS), around 2 years in a student run robotics research group
* Internship Exp: 2 months corporate internship in a top semiconductor company, 2.5 months in a robotics startup
* LoRs: 3 excellent LoRs, but 2 of them will be from the lab in the different field
* Publications: Currently 0. Work in progress, but very slim chance of getting accepted before deadlines.
* GRE/TOEFL: Not given yet

I'm worried that my experiences are scattered and not focused enough to get admitted into top tier universities. I have also not yet started preparing for GRE/TOEFL. That's why I was thinking of wrapping up all my ongoing projects and get some publications before applying next cycle. I don't know if having 0 pubs in spite of so many hours put in looks bad or not. I have a job offer from the semiconductor company I interned at, so I wont be wasting the extra year either.

But my prof at the lab I'm working at has encouraged me to apply, and even offered to supervise me if  I get in. I would like to give a fair shot to other top unis as well apart from that lab. Hence, I'm not sure if I should go ahead and try my luck this year. I welcome your honest opinions on my situation."

&amp;#x200B;

I did 2 coding internships at that LTC, getting the return offer both times. I figured that due to my good performance, they would remember me the next time I applied. Thus, I was dismayed that they treated me like an outsider in the hiring process, waiting 3 months to get back to my application even though a senior engineer referred me, and then asking me basic coding questions as if I didn't intern there for 6 months already (it was in this time I applied to the startup), and also did not give me the return intern bonus after I got the offer because I declined the last intern return offer. I renenged before I was matched to a team too; I'm pretty sure I was nothing more than a number in the system.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed both internships, but this treatment really made me believe the statement that companies will use and forget you.

&amp;#x200B;

I read that despite the moral talk on the internet about not reneging, companies, especially LTCs, will quickly forget that someone reneged, and be eager to give qualified candidates offers. Thus, I wanted to ask you wise people out there, do you know any instances where someone politely reneged and was blacklisted? Or was then hired again many years down the line?"

I completed my undergraduate studies this past semester from a target school.

Shortly after my acceptance into said target school my family lost our home. Quick disclaimer: I'm not making this post to say woe is me and certainly not for anyone to criticize my family or anything like that. After this event I spent a lot of my time as a gig economy worker at the same time I was completing my studies to be able to afford a cheap hotel for my family to stay in since I could not have them stay in my school apartment where I had roommates and did not share this situation with anyone.

Originally I had not even planned on pursuing a career in finance so I was not seeking out internships or opportunities in the field, but I did have summer plans that ultimately I could not do because of the covid pandemic. While this was going on I was unable to get the same grades I was getting that got me into this target business school in the first place. My gpa which had been 3.55 dropped hard before getting a bit better again and is now 3.2. In this time I failed a significant and notoriously difficult course relevant for my original career goals that is completely irrelevant to finance but I also struggled in classes across the board and the stress of the situation beyond the time commitment was difficult to handle. My major gpa is about the same as my cumulative but my concentration gpa is a bit higher at 3.4 but this considers a much smaller number of courses. I also have no relevant work experience but I do have some business related student club experiences.

I have solved the homelessness problem by getting an apartment after my last lease expired that my family can live in, but I need to find work. I am concerned that if I get the wrong job now, though, my career will be over before it even starts or I won't be able to make my way back up. Ideally I would like to find work in banking as so many of my former classmates have but I am afraid my chance to get in is gone. Worried about messing up a chance if I do get it, I have been studying my textbooks again and mastering the material and getting better at excel and financial modeling. I also don't know how to explain this whole situation to potential employers, or if I can get through the screening process. and I don't want this to be public information for the sake of my family's reputation.

I know this is a lot but what is the best way to go about this? Thank you."

I am a engineering student from india, looking for remote internships or any working opportunity to learn how does working in a company go.

I have familiarity with Python, HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript, git and linux. I have made some stupid projects as well. (A python bot, a dumb javascript extension, a speech to text cl app etc)

The thing is I have no idea how to apply for internships (I don't even know if I am ready to apply for one ) nor do I know how to reach out people on linked in. I suck at social networking. 

I feel stuck,  I have no idea where should I be going in from here. I don't know if this will help but my interest are as follows:
- Coding
- Learning about finance, stock markets, Cryptos
- Music
- Sports - soccer, Boxing
- World Politics
- Philosophy/conspiracy 
- Suspense/drama movies, I like (al Pacino)

What should I be learning or exploring based on my interest in the field of CS?

I know this might sound desperate, but If anyone out there who could mentor me, share their experience or suggestions it would mean a lot, a lot, alot. I am open for any learning opportunity, literally anything coding or comp sci related. I want to start somewhere, make some connections or friends or whoever out there who is struggling the same way as I am. 

If you have read this it means alot, seriously it does. Thank you, have a great day

And small amount of actual internship for someone who lost his contract due to COVID. Recently, I have come close to passing real coding interviews, but no luck yet. What can I do to stand out? how Long usually to hear back. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks."

I thought I was doing better, but I guess this was because I had a goal and hope. Both I lost. I was never actually doing better I think, I was just pushing it aside and trying to ignore it...

So I'm trans and in an unaccepting environment. I can't leave right now, have to wait until I'm 18 in a few months. But I don't think I can survive these months, or even whatever happens after that actually, I can't survive at all. I have to find a job, which sucks. But I also think I have heavy undiagnosed anxiety, my job office (or intern or what do you call it?) called me and I couldn't pick up because I got a panick attack and couldn't move from the floor, crying and hyperventilating. I'm also not fit for work, because I am barely concious most of the day and function on autopilot, forgetting everything and very poor concentration. And of course on top of that I deal with sever suicidal thoughts and I am trying to stay clean from sh and recover from an ed so not really the best space to be in mentally. All my energy goes into that, and that's not much, so I can't DO ANYTHING.

And I didn't really function at all for the past few months because I simply couldn't and just panicked over fucking everything I did. I did go for walks everyday and I had headphones on for most of the day because music is the closest thing I have to staying calm. I graduated 2 months ago and today school started again, and I didn't have to go... My biggest fear in school was leaving, having to try and function in a world that is not made for someone like me. And my biggest fear came true. I've been searchibg for work for quite a while now and still get panic attacks whenever I get called or have to call or actually anything. I broke down today because I realised I am stuck in this world for the rest of my life, school is over, I have to find a job and pretend I can function now 5 days a week.

I can't live in this world. I'm not made for this world. My parents keep calling me lazy and saying I should stop overthinking and being so dramatic and just get over it, but I can't. Why am I like this? My friends have gone through a lot of mental shit as well. They are healing and doing okay, they still have rough days as well. But why am I the only one that just cannot function AT ALL?? I just can't, I can' live. I'm not made to live and I am so sick of tired of pretending that I can and want to, when in fact I don't. I made a deal with my friend about staying alive, and as much as I want to, idk if I actually can stay alive. I don't want to break this promise but I just cannot live like this, there is no way out. I am trapped in a small box and no way to breathe. Though Idk how much longer until I either break my cleanstreak or end it, but I know if I break this cleanstreak now, I will fall back into sh very far.

Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up again and stare outside, thinking about how I should function right then but how I can't, loathing myself even more. Counting every day and hoping my end is near. 

I am pretty sleep deprived at the moment, sorry for any typo's I make or if I miss a word somewhere. I'm gonna try and see if I can get some sleep."

The mass of shitbirds dove as one. It was eerie how quiet they were. Like the night sky was falling in on us without a singular whimper to mark it's fall. A perfect deadly silence. They moved like owls swooping in on mice.



""Alright you, Cocksuckers.""  I said under my breath, not feeling an ounce of bravado in my chest. I silently made peace with the fact that I was about to die. ""Lets get this shit over with""



Gruk was taking a different approach from my resignation to death. She roared full fanged defiance up at the horde. She brought up her AR Pistol and started to put rounds up range. Valkrye shuddered everytime she hit a target.



.458 SOCCOM, the round her custom AR-Pistol was chambered in, was designed to fix a problem with 5.56's ability to drop targets quickly.  It's a common thing to hit a person multiple times with 5.56, before they figure out that they don't want to be in a gunfight with you no more.



Where as 5.56 is a suggestion, .458 is more like a one word 'come to Jesus' talk. Fucking bulle t would take the can-do attitude out of a Kodiak Bear. 
Main draw back is that the Magazines tend to be of a rather limited capacity. 



The Shitbirds looked sleek when they dove. Their massive wings folded back behind them, some had their arms outstretched, claws flexed. Looked like a pack of damn fever dream demons reaching down for our souls.


However when one of them took one of the massive rounds, they would flare out in an explosion of feathers and black blood. The ones who still possessed the ability to scream, let out an ear piercing caterwaul as they fell out of the sky like wrecked Messerschmits over the English channel.



Me and Daliwal took our que from the boss, and opened fire as well. 10MM and .45ACP aren't exactly calibers known for being soft on a body, but our pistols just weren't making quite the same impact on the Shitbirds. It took more rounds to knock divers out of sky. 


Hell, if anything, more seemed to be shifting their way towards us and away from the makeshift Anti-Aircraft gun that was Gruk's pistol. 



Daliwal held his ground, roaring like the proud Rakshashan He was. Firing into the Shitbirds as quick as he could. He was a good shot, but not the best, not that it made a difference as tightly packed as our aggressors were. 



Hell a Punt Gun would have come in handy right about than. I mean if someone had made one in the last hundred years or so, of course.



The Shitbirds had speed but they weren't exactly falcons, so we had a few brief moments to drop some of them out of the sky before they were on us. 
We did what we could with our pistols, but it wasn't ever going to be enough. That just wasn't in the cards for us.


LeVonda's AR Pistol want dry just as the skyborne buttholes reached us. She didn't bother reaching for a fresh magazine. She hauled back and threw the ten pound pistol as hard as she could. Tagging one of the Shitbirds square in the beak. 


That was probably about the last thing the Shitbird was expecting, and it went wild as the flying pistol smashed it's beak back through it's face. It lost all of it's bird of prey ferocity.
It's out of control body smashed into a few of his pal's. His wings tangled with that of his fellow shitbirds, throwing a few of them off course and creating a spot of chaos in the sky above us.



Gruk dropped down into a fighting stance, her Stun Baton at the ready, and waited for the wave of Shitbirds to land on her.
It didn't take long before they obliged her. A pile of feathery bodies rolling over her. Blue flashes of light lit the fray as she let off with her Stun Baton. Giving off a strobe effect. Each Zap hopefully meant a country fried Shitbird, but you couldn't really tell in all the chaos. 



It was all screeches of anger, grunts of pain, and Orcish battle cries. It was hard to tell who was making the noise, it was just an ear splitting mélange of sound. 


Now, let me tell you, I would have loved nothing more than to stroll over and give her a hand. However I was busy at that moment, I was balls deep in my own set of problems at that particular point.


The sons of bitches were on Me and Daliwal too. 


A rolling black mass of anger, blazing white eyes, and slashing talons fell out of the sky on us.  One of the feathery fucks was diving for me like he knew my name, and apparently I just happend to look a lot like the guy who had just fucked his girlfriend.



I didn't give him a chance to work out his issues on me though. I put my front sight post between his eyes and yanked the Glock's  bang lever.



A 10MM 'fuck off' smashed it's way into the spot beneath it's left eye. Not where I was aiming, but good enough for government work. The Shitbird's head snapped back, and his body followed it, sending him into a sort of backwards airborne somersault. The creatures momentum carried it forward towards me. 


I managed to get out of it's way, before i was set upon by another one the Bird monster's pals.
I got the air knocked out of me as the fucking thing trucked me. Knocked me for a loop, but I had enough adrenaline in my veins to keep me in the fight. Felt like I took a sledge hammer square in the body armor though. I didn't  have the time to pay it any mind. The Knife's magic was working overtime and that let me ignore the pain for a moment. I could still feel it of course. Like I could feel the jagged bits of my broken rib rubbing against each other. A bizarre feeling and an unwelcome one to be sure.

Me and the Shitbird who had used me as a landing pad, rolled across the ground slashing and tearing at each other. I had him on weight, but Something mystical backed up those scrawny little muscles and he managed to get the mount on me.
Fucker was stronger than he looked, but I managed to get my arms up between us in the guard. I felt the welts and bruises raise in my flesh as he sent wild swings at my forearms. I would learn later that he had given me a whole new set of stress fractures.


I still had a hold of my pistol and my knife, lord knows how I hadn't managed to stick myself with it in all that rolling around. But I still had a hold on them and that’s what mattered.


The Valkrye seemed to have a flare for the dramatic. He demonstrated this by raising his arms and flaring his wings out to their fullest span. His head fell back and he did his best to roar into the night sky. It came out as more of an overly aggressive angry screech, but he got his point across.



""Enough with the fuckin' theatrics"" I said leveling the Glock at his face. I tensed up on the trigger and with a whimperless bang I sent him to the land of wind and ghosts. He fell back leaving a trail of pink mist in his wake. His corpse twitched where it lay across my legs.
I kicked the feathery carcass off of me. I didn't spare much of a thought to it afterwards. Had bigger issues at hand. His fight was over, but mine was still a going concern.


I pushed  myself to my feet, with as much grace as I could muster. Which wasn't much, considering the ringing my bell had taken in the last three minutes or so. The knife might had my pain levels dulled. But I was still feeling the after effects of the getting a corpse dropped on me, not to mention the fight I had almost instantly gotten myself into.


I caught site of The Miller's cattle gate, the one I had crossed less than hour ago in much more peaceful conditions. It struck me that I had to be the closest to the cars. The cars on the other side of the gate. The cars with the Radios. The Radios we could use to get some back up out here. The back up that would probably keep us alive.


And yes, that very Kronk like thought pattern was exactly how it went through my mind. 

I put my head down and started hoofing it. But I didn't make it too far, as I got hit from the side again. I felt something dig into my body armor and scrape. It didn't penetrate, but it still felt like somebody had hit me in the ribs with a baton and was making repeated follow on strikes. Not a great feeling.


I tumbled again. The cement truck that had just bowled me over followed me, flapping it's hands at me like a chimpanzee going through heroin withdrawals. It was making solid hits too, but a mix of my body armor and the magic out of my knife let me ignore that for the time being.



I lost my pistol somewhere in the tumble but held onto my knife.  I managed to grab a limb, not sure if it was an arm or a leg. I cranked it as hard as I could into a direction that didn't feel natural for it, and rolled my body weight to the side, I brought a confused shit bird with me. I felt something in the limb give way, cause it went from rigid to floppy in a heart beat. There was a surprised squawk of pain from somewhere in my near vicinity. 


I realized that I wasn't seeing so great all of a sudden and my eyes were burning. No time to worry about it now.  I dove at where the shriek sounded like it had came from. I realized I had something under me all of a sudden. I had a Shitbird in an awkward, but serviceable mount. It was struggling under me, trying to get lose. So I did what you do in these situations. I struck out with my knife. I heard another pained noise, so I kept hitting it with the business end of the knife, until it stopped squirming. Until it felt like a dead thing. I gave it a few more stabs for good measure. They were probably unnecessary. Maybe even a little excessive, I admit, but hey…. They felt good at the time.


I leaned back, struggling to catch my breath. I remember hoping that didn’t mean that my broken rib had put too many holes in my lung. I ran a hand over my eyes. My hand felt wet. However I was able to see a little bit better. So I rubbed some more. I got more vision back in return. I blinked a few times and looked at my hand. It was blood.
I would like to say I was covered in a dead Shitbird’s blood, but it wasn't anything nearly that cool.



Something had laid my forehead open pretty good. It was my blood. I would like to say it was from a lucky slash thrown by a powerful enemy. But fact of the matter was, I had probably done it with the knife when I was rolling around with the bird. I have no idea when I had done it to myself. My body was pretty battered at this point. Picking out when one bit started hurting in particular would have been a tall order.


Open wounds were a lot of things to worry about in their own right. But there was no telling what sort of Supernatural blood borne pathogens lived in Shit bird blood. No telling if I had already gotten some in the forehead wound. There was also no telling if I would be around long enough for it to matter.

Nothing to it, but to get on with my original goal. 

I pushed myself to my feet again. The world was chaos around me. I had been lucky to deal with only two Shitbirds.
Daliwal was fighting an Irish Catholic Families worth of them, and I couldn't make hide nor tail of Gruk under the wriggling pile of feathery bodies she was fighting. But I knew she was still up and swinging, because occasionally a broken body would come flying out of the fray. 


They seemed to be going after the heavier of hitters. Which was probably for the best. They could hold their own a lot better than I could. Never the less I felt a pang of guilt run through me as I had to turn my back on them.


The best way to help them was to get to my patroller and call for help.

It was the right move to make. It was the smart move to make. I told myself all sorts of things like that.


Didn't feel any less like I was abandoning them though.


I was almost to the gate when three more shitbirds touched down in front of me. They flared their wings as they landed. I would have given them more cool points if they had done a super hero landing. 
These things looked fresh for a fight. They didn't scream and squawk like their flock mates. They just looked at me, with furiously cold white eyes. They looked switched the fuck on.


""Well, Shiiiiittt"" I muttered. I got a feeling like I was staring at my own death come to claim me. I briefly wondered if these guys had been detailed to make sure nobody got to the cars. But quickly realized that it didn’t immediately matter.

Now I know I just told you a story of holding my own against two other Shit Birds, and succeeding. But those were one on one dust ups.  And I cannot convey to you, how much both of those fights had kicked my ass. I mean I did have a lot more blood inside of my body at the beginning of those fights, than I did now. 


This might just be a three way execution looking for a participant. Not that I in any way wanted that particular participation trophy. I wasn’t really looking to find out how I would do in this fight either.

To quote the Great Texan Poet: Ron White


""I didn't know how many of them it would take to kick my ass, but I knew how many they had.""


I was broken, battered, and one hard fart from beaten down.
I had lost my Glock and most of my go. My tank was on Empty.


But I was not about to just curl up and die. No sir. I was going to die like an idiot, swinging out of my weight class with stained boxer briefs. Not that I had a choice mind you.


I screwed up everything I had left in me and ran straight at the one in the middle.



I bum rushed straight into the Shit Bird. His buddies jumped back a step or two, squawking as they went. I guess in thier minds this was supposed to be easy. Just mop up the wounded stragglers squirting for the gate.  I wasn't supposed to fight back I guess.

That’s pretty normal for creatures that are used to inducing fear. Hell most of them aren’t even actually that powerful. Just hard to look at. I ran in a Ghoul for trespassing one time. He was hanging around out back of the local morgue. Looking for scraps I suspect. 
Now see, Ghoul's get a bad rap. Most of them are normal people, just terrifying to look at. But they're like any other group of people, some are assholes, most aren’t.

Now when I pulled on scene and saw this particular Ghoul rooting through Doc Garoo's medical waste cans, I knew it was just a hard up creature who was looking for a meal. I'm not soulless. I would have been fully willing to go run down a Striper for this guy. 

But he was new in town and tried to intimidate me into fucking off. He didn’t know me, so he didn’t know how much that wasn’t going to work. He huffed and puffed and blustered. I ignored that. Walked right up to him and put him in zip ties. He offered almost no resistance and was generally confused as to why I wasn’t running in terror.

I stopped at Earl's and got him a box of Steak Fingers on the way to book him in. He cried and thanked me as he ate his meal in the back seat. Life's hard all over, it's even harder when you're terrifying to the untrained eye. 

Oh, in case you're curious. I reached out to our chief mortician, Doc Garoo. I ended up getting the Ghoul a job sweeping floors at the morgue. Turned out he had a real knack for working with dead people. I don’t mean that as a joke either. He just got a Bachelors degree in The Mortuary Sciences from Lamar's online college. 

I’m really proud of that kid. His name is Brian.
But anyway, back to the fight at hand.

I wrapped my arms around the shit bird, getting a good bear hug on him. I pressed my face into his chest and was rewarded with one of the most ungodly smells I had ever olefactricated in my life.
The Bird Monster Smelled like old death and an older bird cage.



I ignored the smell and started jamming my knife into it's side and back. I felt rib bones break as the small cross guard of the enchanted KaBar hit flesh, signifying that the blade was buried in the monster about as far as it would go. I drew back and stabbed again and again. Everytime I tore the knife out of the bird, there was a small guiser of blood and shredded flesh.
Warm blood hit my face. I ignored it. I pulled the knife out of the bird for a final time. Wrenching it down as I pulled it out. 



As if finally realizing that he had just been granted a bunch of new speed holes. The Bird let out a sound that I could only describe as unnatural, Even for a bird monster that was born in some soulless pit of misery somewhere. Like Oklahoma or something.


I felt something hit me across the back like a baseball bat on a trash can at a Houston Astro's game (Go 'Stros!)
The bird on the right was making an attempt to save his buddy, by throwing his arm in wild flailing slashes and haymakers. I was probably too close to catch his Talons. But trust me, my spine and rib cage let me know he was putting some effort into it. I had to make it stop, or it would end up beating me to death.


So I squeezed the bird I was fighting as hard as I could. I jerked up with all the power my battered body could muster. 
I shifted my weight and threw the bird monster in my arms towards the bird on the right. Not a sexy hip toss or anything. Just throwing one object at another. They went down in a tangle of wings and limbs.



Almost on reflex, I turned and sent a wild haymaker at the bird on the left. I caught him square between the eyes.



My knuckles told me that I was going to regret it later. But the monster's reaction was worth it.


The bird bounced back out of reach.
It let out a confused squawk of pain.
It stood there for a split second. It's bright white eyes, somehow seemed to cross in pain. 
It's beak fell open and it let out a noise of confused pain. Sounded like the damn thing said 'Owwww.'



Even though I was closer to dead at this point, than I had been an hour prior at least, I still had to pause and let out a laugh at that.
It's one of those things that you would have had to have been there for, but trust me when I tell you, it was fucking hilarious.

But I guess that Shit Bird didn't appreciate my laughing at his pain.

The thing shook the cobwebs out of it's head. It rose into the air a couple of feet, it's wings spread out at it's sides. I suppose this particular Valkrye was a Cobra Kai fan. Cause it kicked me square in the fucking chest, and yes it was a goddamn Crane kick.


Fucker must have ate his Wheaties that morning too. Because there was some serious ass behind that kick. I felt things go broken in my chest. Pain flared white in my eyes. Which was a surprise to me. The knife was reaching it's limits of what it could handle. What it could keep me from feeling. What it could keep from killing me. I dwelled on that thought for a split second.

But the sound my head made as it bounced off the Cattle Gate when I landed, distracted me from all of that. Sort of a 'Clanging Thump' sort of sound. Really fucking sucked.


I took quick stock of myself and realized I was in pretty bad shape. Chest felt like it was caved in. I was covered in blood. Head wasn't feeling so great either. Everything hurt. I still had my knife, but I was losing the strength to keep it in a solid grip.

I realized this was probably going to about do it for your favorite Deputy.

Another Axiom of my Father's came to mind. 

'Boy if you go down..... Go down Swinging.'


""Okay, Dad"" I said out loud to a man I was expecting to see soon, assuming we would be in the same place of course.


Infer from that what you will.

I looked down at the knife in my hand. It was so covered in gore and biological detritus that I couldn't even see the glow of the golden runes inlaid in the blade. But than again my knife hand and forearm were covered in blood too. But like I said, there was a blood all over everything.. There was a lot of the stuff flying around at that point. My uniform was a total write off as well.


I noticed that the tip of my knife had been snapped clean off in the kerfuffle. The remaining length of blade looked pretty rough too. I wondered if that had an effect on the knife. Maybe it was mad at me for letting it get that tore up.
It didn't matter though. No one would have seen it in such poor shape anyway. That is after they buried it with me, of course.


My head lulled a little as I looked up at two shit birds looming over me. The one I had stabbed must not have made it.


'Good' I remember thinking 'fuck that guy'


One of them stepped closer. The thing squatted at my feet. It extended one of it's talons. It was moving slowly, as if it was trying to make the moment as dramatic as possible, like it was trying to drag as much fear out of me as it could. The tip of it's talon came to roost on the steel toed tip of my black bates combat boot. 


The creatures eyes bore into mine as it began tapping on the tip of my boot. 
It's beak fell open. 
It was fucking with me.
It looked for all the world like it was trying to laugh at me. Mock me. Make me feel weak in my last moments. It briefly turned it's head towards it's buddy.
Almost like it was saying


""Terry, are you seeing this shit?""


It never noticed when my hand went to my belt. So it was pretty surprised when it turned back around towards me, and a stream of Bull's Heart Sheriff's Department special blend pepper spray (Momma Gruk's secret recipe) hit it right between the eyes. I emptied the little canister square into the Shitbird's stupid Shitbird face.


The effect was pretty instantaneous. The bird monster's hands went scrabbling to it's eyes. Something that could be described as an avian scream of pain ripped out of it's beak, as it tried to get the pain out of it's eyes. I remember hoping that it accidentally poke itself in the eye.



""Don't fucks ......with me, Buddy"" I said around a raspy chuckle. Half giddy from head trauma and blood loss ""I..... been known... to fucks back""


The bird probably not understanding why it's face felt like it was melting, took wing into the sky. Still rubbing it's face
Trying to get spicy air out of it's pores.
He may not have been dead, but for now he was out of the picture. I'd count that as a W.


I reached out to the Cattle Gate. I grabbed a bar in the middle, and used it to pull myself to my feet. It took a minute as my vision was all wibbly wobbly and it would have been easier to point to parts of my body that didn't hurt, vice the opposite.


The third Valkrye must have been an intern or something.  Because he stood there looking very confused. All of sudden being alone must not have been a comforting feeling.


I leaned on the gate. I stared at the intern for a minute. 


""That go Iike you thought it would, champ?” I asked the bird ""Did it?""


I was breathing hard and I could taste my own blood in my mouth. 
The Bird must have gotten over the disappearance of his friends and screwed up some courage.
Because it raised a handful of black talons to the sky.  
It was a beautiful Texas night sky I realized. 
The stars were in fact Big and Bright.
As good a sky as any to die under, I suppose.
The Talon's twitched open. 
May as well have been a Headmen's axe.
Time slowed for me. I watched the Valkrye take that first step in my direction. 
I knew it was coming for me. 
The way it moved towards me told me everything I needed to know.


I tried to push myself off the gate, and assume a defensive posture. But I was so damn tired and my body was so damn wrecked. 


'Here it comes' I remember thinking in that moment.


And in that moment, I was ready to die. Not eager mind you, but ready.  I wouldn't go happily, and I damn sure didn't plan to go peacefully. But I had nothing left. I knew that I had done everything I could, and the effort I had given was one worthy of a warrior. I had given far more than I had taken, and that's all one can ask for when it comes to the end 


LaVonda Gruk, However, wasn't ready for me to go off shift just yet though."

I am currently a senior student in a a no-name college, and I am very confused as to what I can do to advance my CS career even further. My goal is to be involved in both data science and software development. I have plenty of experience in a good variety of languages, though Python and JavaScript are my favorites.

I have a pretty good GPA (At least a 3.5), I have done a year or 2 of research, during which I made both a Desktop app and a website during my research. Currently, I hold a internship at a government position that focuses on data science/analysis. In my free time, I've focusing on the learning the full MERN stack and occasional leetcode. Additionally, I have some other projects in my resume, but I am hoping to add one more (hopefully some sort of MERN stack app)

I sometimes feel like there are other things I could be doing to really push my career forward. What did y'all do during your senior year to advance your CS career and is there anything else I can do to better prepare myself for the job market?

Any advice would be appreciated."

pg9rom,1,2021-09-01,Began an online AAS in Data Analysis and everything seems... comical?,FeathersPryx,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/pg9rom/began_an_online_aas_in_data_analysis_and/,"I want to know if this is an uncommon experience... (This is at a legitimate technical college)

If this is too much to read, I would at least like an answer to the very last question, which I will mark.\*

Almost half of the words of the syllabus and course outlines were misspelled, many of the quiz questions are terribly worded (""Jonathan likes to watch TV because he thinks it is a safe and wholesome activity. True or False"") WHAT? I can't read Jonathan's mind, how do I know what he considers to be safe and wholesome? Obviously it is asking if TV is safe and wholesome, but even then, I would expect them to be more specific, and also, what does that even mean? Safe and wholesome according to what? TV can be safe, and it can be wholesome too. The answer was false somehow. Another question was ""When you buy a device, which one of these can be customized?"" 2 of the answers were ""Resolution"" and ""Keyboard Width"". Now, all computers but only some phones and tablets allow the changing of resolution without being rooted or jailbroken. ALL computers and mobile devices allow the width of the keyboard (digital or physical) to be changed. They are both seemingly correct, but one is more correct than the other, so I answered with ""keyboard width"" and it was wrong. Many questions are worded very vaguely like this and I wish they would just specify. Explain just a little more so that I know exactly what I am answering. I don't want to have to play this riddle psychology game for each question like I am speaking to the fucking Sphinx. I had an issue with the website's pattern matching that was not my fault, and I even proved it in the email I sent to my instructor. They responded with a sentence that was (I counted) 90% incorrect. They fucked up 90% of their sentence, sounded like a toddler, and didn't even address my issue. Just basically went ""lol no just figure what you're doing wrong."" despite being sent screenshot evidence that it was not my fault. One class even feels like a shitpost. All of the diagrams are wikihow or wojak levels of meme, and much of the class feels sponsored. Yes, I know how odd it sounds, but I literally had to watch a damn ADVERTISEMENT in this class that I PAID MONEY TO BE IN.  It was in the section of the class about being a good digital citizen and using technology to be as productive as possible. As it so happens, using these amazing deals (install now!) is how I can be a good digital citizen. I watched a video telling me about all the cool services I can use to get coupons and good deals and ""This is why you should install honey! This is why you should use this other service! Earn cash back rebates and special points!""

&amp;#x200B;

\*My final and most important question: Do colleges always assign cosmically unrealistic workloads? There is not a single way anyone with a family or full-time job could do all of this. The first week, I had 180 assignments to do. All of which take at least 30 minutes and at most 4 hours. I'm sorry but I do not have 400 hours each week to spend... literally no one does. I tried getting them all done, including the non-graded assignments, and I spent 9 hours a day for 6 days straight and barely even SCRATCHED the surface of the assignments. Now, I set a record for the math score of the PSEO placement program, so I am pretty sure its not just me being braindead. I have started just skipping every single non-graded assignment to rush straight to the quizzes, and now it is a very reasonable amount of work. I attended one of the optional online meetings and the instructor was moaning about ""why do so many students skip all of the practice assignments :..("". Wow, I can only wonder...

&amp;#x200B;

I have only ever heard good things about this school, and it is well known in my city for being an excellent place to study, so I certainly never expected any of this. At least I am having a blast in the web dev class! It still is just as unprofessional and is seemingly written by a foreign underpaid intern, but at least the content is fun!"

So for example, A1 color is green, and A2 is red. So I want B1 and B2 to be ""new"" and ""old"", respectively.

My approach is to first create a function to get the color using the below function:

`Function ColorIndex(CellColor As Range)`       
`ColorIndex = CellColor.Interior.ColorIndex`   
`End Function`

Using \`=ColorIndex(A1)', this works great because for it prints a 4 and for red it prints a 3. I can intern use IF to print ""old"" and ""new"".

I run into an issue when I try to auto fill the rest of the column with the same formula. Basically I want to use =ColorIndex() for all 76000 rows in column B. I tried double clicking the drag handle and manually selecting Fill, but nothing happened. Any one know why this is happening and is there a way to get around it?

pgard6,30,2021-09-02,Has anyone ever completely choked a job interview?,codecerrer,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/pgard6/has_anyone_ever_completely_choked_a_job_interview/,"So I have to vent a little because I'm completely embarrassed and trying to not beat myself up too much but I completely botched a recent job interview. This was for a desktop support position for which I have previous experience and felt I was solid candidate for the position. I'll give a little backstory, I took a desktop support internship my 2nd year of college which lasted for around 6 months and looked like it was going to turn in to a full time position until covid hit. They could only bring me back part time but I couldn't complain I was now a considered a desktop tech, had my own coverage zones, and worked pretty much full time but that didn't work out because they went on a full blown hiring freeze 8 months later and actually had to let me go. Tough break but I walked away with a lot of confidence and overall it was a great experience.

Leaving that role I took a contract job working help desk for a really large environment with the goal of getting hired on permanently as desktop support as soon as a position opened up. I was able to jump right in to the help desk role because of the experience of my last position and after 6 months I have definitely hit the ceiling of this current role and I'm ready to move on. Sure enough a desktop support position opened up at my current company I work at and I was able to secure an interview. I felt pretty confident going in to the interview and things started off good until the questions started. There was a manager and 2 leads interviewing me, the manager started off asking me a few questions of which I was clueless on  on and the questions didn't really sound related to the position but I answered honestly stating I wasn't too familiar with the technology. He then says ""Oh disregard those first few questions those were for the interview I had scheduled tomorrow"". I thought whew ok maybe this isn't starting off too bad, he then proceeded to ask me 2 more questions I didn't know the answer to and that is about the time the train fell off the tracks. He then asked how well I was at scripting in which for some reason I answered I don't know how to script but I'm not sure why I answered that way because I have wrote a few small PowerShell scripts at my last job to help me find Windows 7 computers in certain OUs. He asked me about AD and Group Policy and I answered by saying I work with AD but don't have any experience with Group Policy even though I have my own tech blog/website in which I have a few guides on creating GPO's. I was having a hard time putting coherent sentences together at this point and this is where the other 2 Leads started asking me the standard interview and tech questions but I was such a mumbling mess I had a hard time answering them. They asked me questions regarding MFA, end user network troubleshooting, and troubleshooting Outlook connection issues all of which I deal with multiple times a day in my current role but yet I couldn't give them a straight answer without second guessing myself and just sounding like a hot mess. I kind of pulled my self together right at the end of the interview but at that point it was too late.

Has anyone else ever gone through an experience like this before? If so how did you build your confidence back up? I'm going to stay on the grind and hopefully I don't let this affect me too much."

pgg31m,2,2021-09-02,Feeling trapped...,businessgains,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/pgg31m/feeling_trapped/,"Hi all - sorry for the long post. 

I'm 27 years male and have had a pretty long journey of studying various degrees but graduated last year with a degree in international business. After, graduation I've landed my first job as a digital marketer abroad in September with my graduation internship company, things were looking up.

I've been hired because I did a really good job using email marketing and Facebook/Google ads which was the reason I got hired by two companies under the same roof from which the owners are kinda friends. So my time ended up being split 50/50 between those two companies.

However, in March I got offered another job with a different company for a way higher compensation. My salary at the current company was not super good and as my other colleague left I took the chance to negotiate a better salary with my current employer and the ability to work remotely from wherever I want in 1-2 months from March on which they agreed. They, told me we don't want you to leave as we are super happy with you blablaba. 

Not long after that they suddenly hired two new managers which were set to manage me, one guy is one year younger than me and a women which is a bit older. Since, that things changed drastically, I suddenly had to document many of the procedures I've invented and teach these to others in the business. And additionally they also hired one extra digital marketer and some interns.

In July I told my new managers that I was going to leave and work remotely, they were not very keen on me leaving. But I told them I agreed to do so in March with my bosses. So they agreed to let me leave. Not long after that I suddenly, got a message from my boss telling me: ''We didn't agree with you to leave on such a short notice blablaba - also, the performance isn't there....''

I had a talk with them after that email and they told me all digital marketing activities were being outsourced to a digital marketing agency and that they were not very happy about the way I pitched my announcement about leaving on such a shot notice. I can understand that I should have kept them better in the loop about this but in March I told them 1-2 monts. Anyways, they continued and told me they might need to cut ties with certain employees in the business as I was responsible for all those PPC activities. 

After that talk I left to my home country to start working remotely with a very bad feeling... I felt like I was being used to create all procedures etc. And that they wanted to get rid of me. Also, besides that I'm now getting lots of orders from my new managers that don't know shit about digital marketing and which I have to explain the most simple metrics. I feel honestly, very betraid that they place a guy above me who is younger which is only there because he can talk really good.

A couple of weeks ago, I threated to resign my position as I was not feeling happy about all of it - I've explained my points and my boss told me that they had come up with a new activity for me which is getting a organic plan for social media and that they didn't mean to threat me blablaba. I told them I would let them know my decission by the end of that week which I haven't done so far 3+ weeks further. And also told them I'm applying for new jobs.

At this moment I'm doing my job and do what they ask me but I kinda lost my trust and feel super sad about all of it as I really gave this bussiness my all. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point, I guess it is time to leave."

Hi everyone, any quick advice would be appreciated. Just a bit of background on me -  completed a tech internship last year, then applied for several degree apprenticeship schemes (a UK initiative - funded training whilst working for a 4 year contract). I did not expect to get more than one offer - I applied like crazy to all available because I believed I would get nothing.  
Long story short, I got more than one offer and that's what's causing my problem. I feel very conflicted and unable to make a decision on where to go. These are tech roles, but with strong differences between them.   
With one option, I like the company and industry, but I feel that the software development work would potentially not be varied enough - all backend. With another, I also like the company/industry and the chance to do iOS/Android app development, but I'm worried that again there would not be enough variety. With the third, I may get a chance to do all areas - backend/frontend/app development, but in this case I'm worried that I would spend too much time university training (8 week block), and not enough in the workplace.  
I'm so afraid of making the wrong decision and disappointing people. Just for some detail, I'm currently going through extreme grief due to the passing of a close family member a few weeks ago. I'm not sure if anyone else has gone through this recently and can relate - it literally feels as if the whole world has changed, everything feels alien and unreal and as if I'm completely lost in the wilderness.

I'm not the same person I was before their passing, I've almost forgotten that I actually have a future and decisions to make, I'm so paralysed with grief. The grief/stress has taken a massive toll on me physically - I was up all night/morning vomiting, and I've been unable to get proper sleep for weeks. People say things like 'follow your gut', 'just make a decision', but I'm so out of touch with myself right now that I feel as if I've lost all instinct. Would really appreciate any advice."

I'm not sure if anyone else has gone through this recently and can relate - it literally feels as if the whole world has changed, everything feels alien and unreal and as if I'm completely lost in the wilderness.

I'm not the same person I was before their passing, I've almost forgotten that I actually have a future and decisions to make, I'm so paralysed with grief. The grief/stress has taken a massive toll on me physically - I was up all night vomiting, and I've been unable to get proper sleep for weeks. People say things like 'follow your gut', 'just make a decision', but I'm so out of touch with myself right now that I feel as if I've lost all instinct. Would really appreciate any advice."

Two years ago I took a summer internship at a steel company that really was quite helpful in putting my study’s into scope.  During the internship I saw a area where they were potentially losing money/time to redundant testing. I brought this to my boss and his boss and they agreed and told me to bring them a proposal. I was given a large amount of data points from the previous months melts to analyze that I’m not sure I even had the credentials to look at. So I stated my case and everyone agreed that we could cut some fat off. This next bit is where I might have pushed it a bit far.

I had all this data at my fingertips and wanted to justify my salary so I went a bit overachiever.  I went and talked to some of the guys in quality assurance about me designing a program to make their jobs just a little easier. Without getting to deep into it, it was more of a tool that just told them weather an additional check was necessary or not after inputting the material chemistry, nothing to groundbreaking. Additionally it only worked for grades of steel that I had sufficient data on. They seemed onboard so I got to work. After a couple days of working on it at work and at home, I had a working prototype, so I filled in my boss about my moonlight project and he seemed hesitant about it but liked the initiative and told me to perfecting it to ship it to IT so they could possibly implement it into system. I went back to QA to show them what I had done and they were very unhappy with me, one guy in particular, one of the old guard. He was angry not because it didn’t work but because it was “the first step to replacing him” blah blah “AI is taking our jobs.” Sorry I’m trying to get to the point: next day I was informed by my boss to quit working on it they didn’t want to implement it anymore. I was a bit bummed but I wasn’t about to get in the middle of a turf war, as an intern it wasn’t my place.

Fast forward to yesterday, two years later, I get an email from one of the engineers at the company asking if he could use my program. Now I’m feeling a bit upset that they have possibly changed there position on the matter and she wants an easy hand delivered program to take credit for, maybe score some points with her team.

I’m not sure what to do or say. On one hand I did develop it on the clock so maybe they are entitled to my program.  On the other it’s my work that was rejected based on company politics and I’m feeling a bit used about the whole thing. I like the company and want to possibly work there after graduation so I’m not trying to burn a bridge but man how do I respond to this request. 

Has anyone encountered a situation like this or just have any general advice? Sorry for the long post, started as asking for advice and ended up in more of a dumping of my frustration rant.

TLDR: do I have an obligation to my former employer for which I was a intern to the program I designed two years ago?"

pgp7wv,2,2021-09-02,MINNESOTA (rental issue) - property management/landlord charged me with fees not stated on my extension of lease and was verbally assured that it would not be charged in the new lease,carl2882,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/pgp7wv/minnesota_rental_issue_property/,"So I am a Canadian intern working in Minnesota. I moved to Minnesota last year and was looking for a place that's fully furnished and would cater to individuals who do not have credit in America. I found Wahu, a student living apartment by the University. One of their approval methods to get a lease is called a PPA (Prepaid Rent Addendum) in which you pay the last 2 month's rent of your lease in advance on top of your first months rent. I was able to do that when I moved in last year.

Early last month, I needed a place for another few months until February so I reached out to one of the leasing officers at the same apartment. We had a conversation, through email and through phone. I asked what the process of renewing my lease was like. He told me that I wouldn't have to go through the same process of application again, and therefore I won't have to pay the PPA fee again ($2,000) since I was already approved of my lease and this is just a year extension of it. This was ideal for me as I am currently struggling financially as a full time intern and college student. I signed a year extension with the idea that I will be subletting it to someone when I move out in February.

However, to my surprise, they had charged me the $2,000 again even though the leasing person had assured me that there will be no charges of some sort again albeit verbally through the phone. Now I am stuck in a lease where I am not able to pay the first few months due to the PPA charge, and I will be paying the last two months (July and august 2022) even though I have plans to move out and transfer the lease to someone else before that. It does not specify on my extension of lease that I had to pay the PPA fee again, due to it just being an extension of my previous lease.

That being said, what are my options? I am currently working with a public attorney that is looking into this but I was wondering what my next steps should be? I had reached out to my property management multiple times through email (I am currently out of town) and directly to the leasing officer that I talked to last month when I renewed my lease, but I have not gotten any response."

So here is my plan.

Currently I am studying to get an A.S. In cyber security. This major takes about 2 years snd will basically prepare me for networking / IT / cyber security roles. The course has a lot of awesome programs too, not including the classes. I have career counselors and the opportunities to do internships/ shadowing. And it pays for a bunch of professional accredited certificates.

After my AS I’ll take the 3 most popular certificates: A+, network +, and security + to build up my resume even more. 

Once I get all those I plan on applying for a basic help desk job and do that for a year or two, then I plan on moving up to a in-house IT job where I help employees with computer issues / set up networks and other general / broad computer tasks, once I work there for 2-3 years I plan on getting a job as a network administrator and doing that for a while, and from there move into more advance fields like pen-testing and consulting.

I also already have vast knowledge in web development with the MERN stack and really good experience working with databases and servers / setting up networks.

Is my plan good? I’ve been told that for most tech jobs once you get your first real job in the field most employers don’t care to much about your actual degree and they look more at your work history, certificates, and projects. Is this true?


TLDR;

get AS in cyber security, get a+, network+, security + certificates , find a entry level help desk job, move up and find a in house IT Noh, move up and find a network admin job, then find a pen test job."

Briefly, I have an MD, with 2 out of 4 years of residency in medical genomics, with extensive exposure to NGS and interpretation of clinical variants (germline, cancer). I then completed (last year) a MSc in human genetics, with courses in genomics. I have ""general"" knowledge of the bioinformatics behind the analysis. I feel confident in R and Python, including their data science &amp; visualization libraries, with a couple of projects during lockdowns. I am used to the main online genomic databases. I have however much to learn in deep learning, bash, and algorithms/data structures. Finally, I have no experience with Bioconductor, but have used Galaxy in the past.

1. Is my resume relevant to the bioinformatics job market ?
2. If so, what position would I be most suited to ? Bioinformatician, computational biologist, ... ? 
3. If not, what specific skills should I improve on ? Would I have more luck with an internship to start with ?

I'm a transfer student and plan to major in CS at LSA with a 4.0 GPA. Though I'm in the second year of college, my current class standing is junior after transferring some credits from the summer session I took at UCB along with a 1800+ boost at tuition :(. 

I've transferred EECS 183, 203, and 370 successfully. I'm taking STATS 250 and enrolled in EECS 280 this semester. 

I've taken an advanced data structure &amp; C++ programming course in my first year. I've learned and practiced some stuff with linked lists, pointers, dynamic memory allocations, and inheritance &amp; polymorphism in this course to a certain degree. The course is listed in the transferable credit database with the comment: ""*No pre-evaluation for EECS 280 or 281. AFTER taking the course, the student may request evaluation for EECS 280/281 equivalence. The eval will involve an interview, test, and/or programming assignment. Contact ugadmin@eecs.umich.edu for more info.*""

**Override EECS 280**:

**Done**: I've applied for overriding EECS 280 and scheduled an online appointment with Prof. Paoletti in about two weeks. 

**Reason**: I need to get an internship in summer 2022. If I haven't even completed EECS 280 (intro to data structure and algo) when applying, I might not end up with some good offer. 

**Questions**:

1. **Have anyone passed the override assessment for EECS 280? What types of questions will appear in the interview? Is it any tolerance for mistakes? How difficult is it? Do we need to write some code during the interview?**
2. **Is it ok to take EECS 281, MATH 425, STATS 250, and one other STEM/programming class in one semester while preparing and applying for the internship?** I spent all my freshman year online and haven't taken any in-person college-level classes yet, so I don't know whether this schedule works for me. STATS 250 might be an ease for me, since I've taken one R &amp; SQL statistics class and practiced using R intensively......
3. **Any tips about getting an internship during the summer as a second-year college student?** I'm in LSA currently, but it seems like there are not instructions and resources on planning to get an intern as a CS student. 

Any helps will be appreciated very much! Hope you're having a good rest of the 1st week!"

Managers at the company score their interns and I’m certain I got an outstanding review and one of the highest “scores” from my batch.

I really want to accept the job offer, however I need some advice when it comes to salary negotiation. Given that I performed above expectations during my internship, is it okay for me to ask for a higher salary? It should also be noted that amongst the interns who they gave offers to, I attended the most prestigious school (not sure if that matters), I’m pretty sure I got the highest “score” from my manager, and I’ve done far more internships than the other candidates (I’ve done 5 internships in total at well known companies (over 15 months total) while others had only completed 2 internships or this company was their 1st internship). The reason why I’m hesitant in asking for a raise is because the company is offering far above what other companies in my industry offer. As a woman in engineering, I’m just looking to be paid a fair amount for what I’m bringing to the table.

TLDR: should you negotiate what is considered a very high salary for your industry for a new grad position given that you interned at the company before, performed above expectations, and were their top candidate.

I've been stressing out about this for too long and I'm too afraid that if I go I'll be worse than here in Brazil.

About me: I'm 23 years old, I study Electrical Engineering and I'll get my batchelors degree at one of the top 6 universities in Brazil in March 2022. I've worked as an intern for almost two years in a start up and a big company. I've worked as a Jr Product Analyst for 9 months and today I'm a Jr Data Analyst since May 2021. I'm sure I could get a recommendation letter at one if not all of these companies. I also speak portuguese, english, french and I can even risk a little spanish.

I once though this was a lot for someone who didn't even had a degree and I was sure I was strong candidate for any entry level job. Oh the illusion

There are many reasons I want to leave Brazil. Mostly a better life and money. A junior dev in brazil makes around 600\~800 euros a month. Sure many things are cheaper, like rent and food. But imported goods are still way more expensive. A 16"" macbook pro, for example, is around 5700 EUR.

Another important part of my plan is my husband. He is also brazilian, but he's recovering his luxembourgish nationality, so that means he'll have a EU passport in 6 to 8 months.

Our original plan was to apply to as many open positions as possible, but I've lost count for how many positions I've applied to and all I've got were automatic rejections. No interviews, nothing.

Since then, our plan has changed. We will be moving to Berlin in October 2022 with all our savings and wish for the best. We've both worked on restaurants before and if we can't find anything on IT, I believe  we will be able to survive for a time. We don't speak any german, but we do have relatives in Berlin, so it's kind of a safety net. Every one we've asked says english only is ok in Berlin, and it's much cheaper than our second alternative.

What I would like to know, from all you european folk, is this: am I dreaming that there's any chance this can actually work? How hard would it be for me to find an IT job in Berlin in the first 3 months? Will I most likely be homeless with no job?

What would you do in my position?"

I'm a HS senior who is currently writing their essays and have just realized I have never went deeper into my interests in STEM.

During my junior year summer, I spent all my time studying for the ACT. Sure, it got me a good score (36) but I feel like I shouldn't have spent my entire summer time doing practice tests.

The number doesn't define my interests or my dreams for the future, it's just something I gained over doing practice tests over and over again.

Looking back, I wish I applied for internships, research, and other opportunities to get me more interested and have a better understanding of what I want to do.

When the essay prompts ask me why I am interested in STEM (my interest is aerospace engineering), I don't really have anything to say. Aside from my love for stargazing, I don't have any proof of my passion.

I haven't written a research paper. I haven't participated in an internship with an aerospace company. I haven't won awards in STEM competitions. I feel like I haven't done anything to stand out in a crowd where to me, everyone is seemingly some sort of genius.

I feel a lot of regret, and I think I am making myself more negative by thinking these thoughts.

I've worked hard (or at least I hope) over these past years but now I feel like I worked hard for the wrong things. Has anyone else felt this way before and got past it?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm new here and I have to say I'm so glad I found this place. It's like I find people who think like me.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to share my situation with you and also I would be really happy to have your feedback and your vision on some topics. Sorry if my English is not perfect, it's not my native language ;)

&amp;#x200B;

First thing first, let me introduce myself :

I'm a 36 years old, french guy, living in Europe. So far I can remember, I have always had an issue with work  (especially hierarchy, core hours, lack of creativity...) even at school.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, after countless difficulties, I finished school as an average student, went to university, finish my Master's, and then problems really started...

* I quit my first internship after 2 weeks cause I only did copy-paste content and that was not the deal.
* Second internship: I had a big argument with my manager, I had to call HR cause he refused to gave me a Christmas holiday, it was just after the death of one of my parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I moved from my city to another country, to see something else, but the problem was still here.

&amp;#x200B;

*  I stayed 3 years in a shitty job, had many conflicts with the management.
* Then 6 months into the next one cause I was the only one to say no when something wasn't acceptable.
* Then more or less, 1-2 years every time.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw everything... extreme corporatism, sexism, people stabbing in the back for a promotion...

I rarely get along with my coworkers, especially the most ""casual"" ""corporatist"" and ""narrow-minded"" ones. I'm hating the willing servitude attitude. For me, a job is simply a way to pay my bills, and so I'm doing what both parties were to agree on the contract (something to not say during an interview).

For one year, I get diagnosed with ADHD, and he helped me to understand some of my behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

I left my job 2 months, and I'm fine with that. I'm a productive person, I enjoy doing a lot of things, just not ""working"" in a company 8-10 hours a day. 

I currently seriously thinking of a professional transition, maybe as a freelancer. I enjoy doing thing differently from other, doing my own projects. I just don't want to go again for the same kind of job, struggle for one year and be back at the same place again. It made me miserable every time I did it. I don't want to pretend I liked to be there.

it's just the behavior of other people and the gap with my entourage that worried me. Some of my friends are mostly talking about their jobs, the big money they do with that, and I'm simple, not interested in that. They don't understand why I don't jump on opportunities when they send me a job description from the companies they are working for. I'm clearly apart.

On one hand, I know what I don't want, on the other hand, anxiety from judgment from the majority of people is killing me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you know mostly everything about me, I wanted to hear you about few points:

&amp;#x200B;

* How do you handle the judgment, with other people?
* How do you get along in society with people only talking about their job? Does it affect you?
* Are you feeling apart? different? and is it hard for you as well?
* Do you feel also the need to belong with other employees or you don't care anymore?
* Did you find inner peace by having a job, even part-time, and even if you don't like it, you know it's not the most important thing? 
* Did you find a way to be economically self-sufficient without a job?
* What's your secret ?\^\^ 

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any other points you would like to share, feel free. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading it and for your help and support :)"

I didn't have any luck getting internships in college, but since my time out of college I have spent what little free time I have trying to improve my development skills, so that I have something to show employers and increase my odds of getting hired. The two main skills I have tried to focus on is mobile and web development and while I feel I am capable enough to take on an entry level position, I am starting to have doubts about whether I have what it takes to be a developer. What is ""the bar"" so to speak for getting hired for a entry level developer position? How skilled do I actually have to be? 

One of the projects I spent a few months on earlier this year was teaching myself React Native and creating a Android app that allows users to paper trade cryptocurrency. While it did take me a few months to make this application, I learned a whole new framework I was unfamiliar with in the process. I basically figure that this is how real jobs go anyway, that is it will take someone new to the job extra time to learn the software framework, language, or system.  I also learned how to use the API for a popular cryptocurrency information website (CoinGecko) and programmed my application make every possible currency available through the API tradable in my application. I even had to implement a modified version of a binary search when the user searches through all currencies. While the app isn't anything phenomenal, I feel that it demonstrates my ability and drive to learn a new system and produce results, which is what companies are looking for, but I still haven't had any luck getting hired and the app doesn't seem to impress anyone. 

Here is the link to the app: 

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deagenstroup.CoinTrader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deagenstroup.CoinTrader)

Is an application like this good enough to supplement ""real"" professional experience on my resume? Or is every other computer science graduate putting out apps like this?"

So I am planning on doing my Master's in either Data Science or Artificial intelligence mostly in the US. 

What I am confused about is, should I aim for Fall 2022 or Spring 2023 and I was hoping I could find some good advice on this sub.

Profile right now - 

* Btech + Mtech 5 yr Dual Degree Program in CS from a good state-level university with a CGPA of 8.7.
* Have done 3 academic projects(2 related to DS and AI). Couple more personal projects after getting a job(Full-stack web dev).
* Unfortunately no paper/journal publications.
* Currently, 1 yr experience as a Developer(would be 2+yrs for Fall 2022 and 2 1/2+ for Spring 2023) in a well known MNC but a service-based company tho.
* Have done few Udemy courses on ML, DL(not sure how much this counts)
* I am aiming for 320+ in GRE which would be pretty good I guess to get into good universities and also apply for some scholarships, other financial aid.

So here's my situation - I haven't started preparing for GRE and TOEFL/IETLS yet, I haven't started any of the paperwork like writing SOPs, requesting for LORs, getting all the transcripts, etc.

**Why Spring 2023? -**

Most people say that I can prepare for 1-2 months and give GRE and TOEFL at the end of October while preparing all the paperwork and start applying for universities in November. I personally feel like it would be really tight and hectic given that I have a full-time job.

And another reason I am considering Spring 2023 is that maybe I can improve my overall profile a bit more by doing some related certifications, I am currently preparing for ""Professional Machine Learning Engineer"" certification from GCP (this is a fairly new certification, not much guidance is available online, so, not 100% confident that I would clear this), maybe one more online certificate in a related subject from a top university, do some hackathons, do some other side projects, etc.

**Why Fall 2022?** \- 

* I just get the feeling that spring intake would not give me the complete ""MS experience"".
* For starters, few good universities do not have spring intake at all (related ques to this - based on my profile which universities could I aim for? so that I could choose between fall and spring).
* No orientation (ik in the bigger scheme of things it doesn't really matter but still)
* Less on-campus jobs
* Lesser internship opportunities
* Lesser intake...could mean lesser financial aids.
* Fall students have the additional benefit of completing 3 semesters instead of 2 like spring students by the time job fairs and other employment opportunities start which could mean a better profile and better chance of employement.

So if u read the whole thing, u would have figured it out by now that I am in a huge dilemma.

Based on all the info stated here, if it is true at all, what would u suggest I do? maybe list the pros and cons of fall and spring."

ph7b6y,2,2021-09-03,Am I having a mental breakdown?,biscuits_not_cookies,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ph7b6y/am_i_having_a_mental_breakdown/,"First off, I would like to start by saying that I've been dealing with an anxiety disorder since I was 15 (I'm currently 29). It started out as agoraphobia shortly after having been in a near car accident. Luckily I managed to stop the car without any of us getting injured. Still it had a lingering effect on me in the sense that I felt like I too could lose control at any point in time. This rapidly escalated and caused me to eventually avoid situations that I could not control. I became pretty much homebound at 17.

When I was about 25 I tried really pushing myself and told myself to man up and stop acting like a child. I gradually faced my fears, became less homebound and finished my undergraduate degree. From that point I think I became overconfident or maybe overambitious. I did some radical things to force myself into situations that were way out of my comfort zone. I flew to a different country and lived there for a couple of months to do an internship at a prestigious company. I struggled a lot here as I lost my my safe environment to retreat to. Also, aside from the fact that the lab where I did my research was full of gifted people doing challenging projects, I now started having 'mental breakdowns' at times.

During normal conversations I would lose my train of thought and fall completely silent or say idiotic things. Kind of like the blood flow to my brain is suddenly cut off. I would make small and stupid mistakes, and my colleagues, being very sharp, would pick up on this and confront me about this. Sometimes they would be making fun of me, at other times they would be seriously annoyed. That would often trigger me to compulsively relive these embarrassing moments and detract me from the task at hand. The best way to describe it would be that I generally felt like I was living less and less in the here and now, and more in my mind pondering the embarrassing past and thinking about the uncertain future. This of course had a major impact on my work. I could definitely tell that my colleagues there thought I was strange and mentally retarded. I can't blame them really, I gave them every reason to. Upon somehow managing to not fail my work there I applied for a job in a different country at a company with a similar profile.

In general the people here are less confrontational, and I felt like I recovered a bit due to that at first. Still, I have not managed to let go of the negative thinking patterns I developed before, and I feel like at the moment I am at the worst I've ever been cognitively speaking. I have started to lose my train of thought during conversations again, and I feel like I can't focus. I zone out constantly, and lose track of time. To be honest, I'm out of inspiration and can't figure out ways to get me out of this one.

Concretely, my problems are:

* general lack of focus (even when watching movies, reading books or following conversations)
* doing things out of compulsion rather than inspiration/personal motivation (even my hobbies)
* losing train of thought while speaking or solving a problem (especially logic based ones)
* obsessive negative thinking
* can't convey coherent explanations / thoughts due to having trouble with logic (people typically lose track of what I'm saying)

What is wrong with me?"

Tools, Tips, What I Did Wrong/Right",Raymond-Wu,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ph9ffo/1_year_job_search_retrospective_tools_tips_what_i/,"After 200+ rejections (many more applications), months where I had an interview every day, and an ongoing journey that's physically &amp; mentally exhausting I'm hoping to create a post that will help readers avoid this hell. I'll be compiling my tools (only the ones I don't see talked about that much. I still use &amp; recommend things like Leetcode), tips, as well as a reflection on what I did right and wrong.

This is going to be a long post. If you need a TL;DR just look at the tools section. That's where I think you'll get the most value for your time. It makes you immediately more competitive in your job search.

# Tools
| General Idea | Description, what I use, and how I use |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Scheduled Emails | I use this in many different ways. For example, it has landed me an interview for an internship at a job fair. I was asking the recruiter and they said that the internships hadn't been posted yet. They said I should follow up in a month or so. Recruiter was then impressed when I emailed them one month later thinking I remembered and really wanted to work at Company X. Spoilers: I didn't remember either. I just wrote the email the day of and then scheduled it to be sent next month. Other ways of using it are sending follow up emails to recruiters if you haven't heard back X days later or sending time-zone friendly emails so that I'm closer to the top of their inbox (esp. now with remote work). I use Boomerang.|
| Web Scraper | I'm sure a handful of you have made or implemented one of these before. Now you can repurpose it for your job search! The way I use it is to keep tabs on places where I have classmates/connections that would refer me or have networked with someone that said they would. An initial scrape of their career page followed by subsequent scrapes that show me the new changes. This way I can see when new entry level jobs are posted and then ask for a referral. I made it part of my morning routine to check. I use Web Alert because it sends notifications to my phone. AFAIK there isn't an iOS equivalent due to Apple's App Store policies. Nothing to say you can't build your own as a side project! |
| Your School's Resources | Go look at your university's career center to see what they offer. I do one-on-ones with a career counselor, get help with making introductions at some companies the school has relations with, and find out about company events |
| Alternate job searches | I believe a lot of people use LinkedIn to find their jobs. While it's not a bad way to do things, I find it's very crowded, has too much spam, and many misclassified entry level positions. There are other options out there - some with niches you might be looking for. For example, if you're looking for entry level positions there's the Ladder Newsletter. For smaller companies there's AngelList or workatastartup. With remote work findwork is tailored to those types of positions. Don't discount Slack channels as well. Easy way to talk with a fellow software engineer that can refer you or make a mentor that can teach you so that you're more competitive of an applicant! |
| Breakpoints | Super helpful when you're starting out with Leetcode questions. Look up how to setup breakpoints in your IDE! |
 
# What I did right
- Take breaks. Perhaps this is something that people early in the job search won't feel but after months of getting rejected, failing interviews, and then repeating... It gets tiring. A day off or a ""long weekend"" does wonders for your mental health so that you can start the grind again feeling refreshed. I thought this was the most important tip so I'm putting it first. The rest isn't really in order of importance.
- Sought mentorship. I've had mentors since before I graduated. I've only recently wrapped things up with my frontend mentor. Still learning a lot from my backend mentor and currently looking for a data science mentor as that's where I eventually want to end up. HMU if you're interested :)
- Side projects with impact. My mentor and I worked really well together so we continued working on our open source project for over a year. Fun fact: it recently got accepted into The Linux Foundation! I feel super lucky with this. It was a bit of a headache at times (not having push access for months due to Uber lawyers talking with Linux Foundation lawyers) but this is something I always bring up during phone screens. I'm able to talk in depth about what I developed, challenges I faced, tradeoffs I made, how I worked with my teammates, how I unblocked myself, etc.
- Previous internships. Uber gets talked about most of the time but I feel that my internship with USF taught me a lot as well. I'm prepared to talk in the same amount of depth as mentioned earlier.
- Practice interviews. There are a variety of resources such as Pramp, Karat, interviewing.io where you can practice talking and coding at the same time. Alternatively, find some other classmates that are in the job search and set up weekly practice sessions.
- I've gotten compliments on my resume in terms of layout from people that have no connection to me. It doesn't always format nicely with some applicant tracking systems though.
- Networking. Just the other week I spoke with the director of engineering at a multi billion dollar energy company. It was a great talk and I got some amazing advice. I'm very comfortable reaching out to people I've never met asking about career progression, resume advice, etc. Even people on this subreddit! I don't know what it is about tech but so many people in this industry are looking to pay it forward.

# What I did wrong
- The major that I focused on in school was data science. However, my school's curriculum was lackluster to put it politely. I can confidently say that Make School's Bachelors Degree program in Applied Computer Science didn't prepare me for any roles in that field. Our classes covered such a wide variety of topics that it felt no different than a bootcamp - despite it being a 2 year program. As a result I spent months of job searching without landing a single interview before deciding to pivot to more full stack roles. I believe I could have realized this sooner if I had networked with more people with industry experience sooner.
- Stress response to interviews. Everyone has different stress responses. Some people eat, others sweat, mine is to think a lot and do so very slowly. It's always been like this. I would always be the last or one of the last to finish a test. I could still ace that test but school tends to take into account people like me. IIRC 
the rule of thumb for teachers is to double or triple the time it would take them to do their own test? This doesn't exist when doing coding interviews so I always use up all my time or run out of time. The stress comes only when there's a job at stake. I've done practice interviews with engineers at Microsoft and Uber and didn't feel any of the same pressure. I still haven't figured out a way to improve upon this and it's currently my biggest weakness. Trying things like relaxation techniques and reading a book about the mindset of competitive athletes. 
- More algorithm/DS practice. While I don't use Leetcode exclusively I'd estimate that I have only done 200 (roughly distributed as 60% easy, 35% medium, 5% hard) or so problems across all platforms that I use. I generally have an idea on how to solve the problems I see. However, I think if I did more I could develop more shortcuts and recognize patterns more quickly to aid with the previous problem.
- Work life balance. It's very difficult balancing schoolwork, side projects, Leetcode, networking, job applications, and family/friends/pets. I was always very competitive and felt like I'd fall behind if I wasn't constantly coding. Even during vacations I would work on side projects. It took a long time to get out of this mindset and figure out a balance that worked for me. Now I do sprints where for X period of time I'll be focused hardcore on Y. For example, it's the first of the month so I'll be applying to a lot of jobs today and for the next couple days.

If you've managed to read all of my ramblings. Congratulations! I hope that you'll learn from this retrospective of my successes/failures and that your job search isn't as hard as mine."

phbcmu,1,2021-09-03,Need Help Becoming a Web Developer,Overall_Perception50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/phbcmu/need_help_becoming_a_web_developer/,"Hello strangers,

I don't know if this is the perfect place for this question, but thought it was worth a shot!

I'll quickly rush through my background before actually going into the questions. I'm in the second year reading for my bachelor's in Business Administration. And I consider myself to be quite good at what I'm studying.

But, with all that has taken place with Covid and social distancing, especially in my country (which has a developing economy) where we're in lockdown even now. And for more than a year, we were confined to our houses (we still are) and all our lectures are done virtually so are the exams and it's kind of boring and repetitive at this point (I know this is a universal problem).

I always had an interest in the tech/IT field even when I was small and I always wanted to pursue a career in IT. Most of my teachers from school and even my family expected me to go down that path but for some reason, my plans deviated a lot in high school and I ended up selecting Business Administration as the major.

Anyhow now that everything's online, I'm kinda being drawn back to the IT field specifically web development. So I did tons of research on web development, which courses to take, which languages/technologies to learn, etc etc. Finally with all the research decided to take a course on Udemy for web development which covers mainly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I did study a bit of Python and HTML in school but I won't exactly brand myself as an expert in any of those languages. Ah, and I decided to learn web development initially having freelancing in mind (a worthy side gig after a year or two of learning - at least that's what I thought).

Finally getting to my questions,

1. Dropping out of university is not an option for me (since the university I'm in is one of the best in my country and it would be a shame to just drop out considering I'm kinda good at why I study). So what methods should I use to study web development and to get an internship (while studying a whole different field in uni)?
2. What are the steps that I should take before becoming a freelance web developer?
3. Do you think online courses and technical capability would be enough for landing a job in web development in the long run (without any other formal qualifications)?
4. How much can I make as a freelance developer (after let's say a year of learning and making a small portfolio)?
5. Finally, do you think it is doable, I mean to learn web development while doing a Bachelor's simultaneously?"
phc7ba,2,2021-09-03,Risk Analytics at top-tier tech company vs Business Intelligence at top luxury goods company,MelodramaticPie,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/phc7ba/risk_analytics_at_toptier_tech_company_vs/,"For context, I am a final year undergrad, majoring in Data Science. This choice of internship will be during my final semester, and will most likely lead into a fulltime position as well, so I am very worried about my choice of internship.

Currently I have 3 offers:

\- Risk Analyst at ByteDance

\- Fraud Analyst at an e-Commerce company

\- Business Intelligence at a top Luxury Goods company

ByteDance (parent company of TikTok) is a top tier tech company to me, and I think it will look the best on my resume as well. However, the team that I'm going to work with there is relatively new, and it sounds like I will be mostly setting up the data tables, cleaning data and ensuring data integrity for the most part, instead of doing data science/analytics. This is my biggest concern with the role as I am afraid I may not learn much relating to data science there. Perhaps I might be misguided in thinking this role is not so 'data-sciencey', but it just seems like I would be doing more data engineering for the most part, and I'm not sure how valuable that experience will be for me. But I have been considering the role just to get a good company name on my resume, and perhaps the opportunity to change to another team in the future.

For the Fraud Analytics at the e-Commerce company, it is an APAC company. The role sounds great as I get to work on actual ML models, probably fine-tuning the existing models and identifying ways to improve their detection. May also get to work on image recognition models. However, my previous internship was also at another e-Commerce company, so I am slightly afraid this might pigeonhole myself into the e-Commerce industry. Plus, the company is lesser-known, or at least not as prestigious as ByteDance.

For the Business Intelligence role, it is surely a less data-science role, but it sounds like they will be training me to have more managerial skills, and interpersonal skills to better interpret and communicate my analysis. I had considered this role only because I am probably not going to pursue a Masters/PhD in data science, so I am slightly worried that a future career in a pure data science role would be restricted by my lack of education. Not too sure how I would fare in a Business Intelligence setting as well, plus not sure how much I would like it, since it sounds less tech-related and much more of having to do presentations and talking to others.

Much thanks for anyone who reads all of this, I really appreciate any advice or guidance that I can get."

How can I get started with this? I'm not one to feel imposter syndrome but I definitely am feeling it now in terms of finding an internship. I'm a third year and I do really well in my classes, but I have no idea how to even start looking for an internship.

I tried googling positions, but not a lot showed up and the few that did weren't things I'm interested in/qualified for. I also tried to find out who is attending career showcase so I could find one there, but I couldn't find much information (I looked [here](https://career.ufl.edu/events-and-programs/career-fairs/career-showcase/)).

I think my resume is fine, I've taken multiple classes that talk about how to format your resume &amp; do well in interviews. I'm really struggling finding a company and actually applying so I can get an interview. I appreciate any advice, this honestly has me really stressed.

A bit more specific info: I'm not super interested in front-end type stuff, but I'll settle for it if those are the only positions I can find (I have some experience with React). I really enjoy working with C++ and using data structures/algorithms to do backend stuff, although I doubt there are a lot of entry-level internships that have us doing that kind of work."
phefve,0,2021-09-03,Looking For Mentor,NothingIsThe5ame,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/phefve/looking_for_mentor/,"Hi all. I am a university student majoring in mathematics who aspires to become a software engineer. I have not taken any coursework in computer science, and I have no work experience. Up until now, I have been self-taught. I have some projects and a website that I am working on. I really need to get an internship for next summer, and I get a lot of invitations to apply (probably bc of my school and major) but I don't think I am ready. However, I feel like if I keep waiting, then the application season will pass and I will be left with nothing. I feel conflicted because I don't want to apply too early and get rejected, but I also don't want to keep waiting and miss my chance. 

Additionally, I don't have much of a sense of direction when it comes to what I should be working on or how to challenge myself. I just search online for simple project ideas or resume templates. With this, I am looking for someone to critique my work and give me ""assignments"". 

Please direct message me if interested  \*.\*"

I have seen advice in this subreddit that if you want internships you should email small and medium sized software companies near you, if I were to do that what pay should I be aiming for? I know the experience is more important than the pay, but I do need some money to help pay for college as well"

phileo,1,2021-09-03,RECENT COLLEGE GRAD W/ JOB OFFER,Correct_Implement950,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/phileo/recent_college_grad_w_job_offer/,"Hi Everyone!

A little about me - 22, Boston MA, graduating from Top 30 School w/ degree in Finance and Management Information Systems. Advanced (SQL, R, Python and Excel knowledge) and able to demonstrate through Internship and  technical interviews. I received a return offer as a Valuation Analyst - Trust &amp; Estate and will require I move somewhere with a lower cost of living. 

The comp as of now - $65K base, $5K relocation bonus (paid in full,) $3K Bonus (paid in full,) and a guaranteed 7% raise for the first five years.

I am grateful to have a job even before I graduate in May but am unsure how long I should stay in my first position. What would be good exit opportunities and how much could I raise my salary with those additional 2 years experience? 

I plan on going to Law School around 27 after working and saving for a few years. I want to stay in Corporate/ Finance/ M&amp;A/Tech.

phkm1m,15,2021-09-04,I Started a Podcast and Got Sucked into an Abyss,_Cu_Chulainn17,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/phkm1m/i_started_a_podcast_and_got_sucked_into_an_abyss/,"It seems everyone has a podcast these days. For me, the inspiration was that I've always believed in the Law of Attraction. People have the power to manifest their innermost desires if they have patience and the ability to adapt to unexpected challenges. I thought doing a podcast on that sort of thing would be a good opportunity to share what I've learned. The software is easy enough to use, and I figured that after doing the first episode by myself, I would have my friends on to share some of their stories. Not all of them shared my point of view so that should make for an exciting discussion.

It was Saturday afternoon. I sat down to record the first episode. It was going to be pretty simple. When I was in college, I decided I wanted to see New York City. Originally I thought I would take a long vacation there, but financial constraints and various other factors forced me to scrap the idea. Until I landed an internship there. After that everything else sort of just fell into place, including finding living accommodations  and people to spend my free time with. I didn't move to New York after college, but one of the friends I made that summer referred me to my boss at my current job. Connections definitely helped me get where I am, I just didn't plan it that way.

I started recording. As I was telling my story I noticed that it was getting dark outside way faster than it should. This was midafternoon. Sunset should not be for another few hours. I stood up and looked out the window. The sky was bright orange and I could not see any cars or pedestrians on the street. It reminded me of the pictures I'd seen of the West Coast sky during the wildfires last year. I realized that I had not paused the recording. I took two steps back to my laptop and paused it. Within seconds the light outside had returned to normal. I went out my front door and walked to the sidewalk.  A car drove by and a couple pushing a stroller walked by on the opposite side of the street. I went back inside.

When I started recording again I faced the window. The effect was not immediate. For a minute or so everything looked normal. But then the sky turned orange as if someone had passed a filter over the sun. A car driving by faded and disappeared. I was alarmed but needed to know what was going on here.

""Don't go outside,"" said my laptop as my hand touched the doorknob. I stared. I've heard of Alexa and Siri but there is nothing on my computer that is supposed to talk to me. The voice was male and sounded as if it was coming over the radio.

""What happens if I do?"" I asked.

""You won't come back,"" my laptop said. ""Not as you are, anyway.""

""What's causing this?"" I asked. ""It's not the new software, is it, because I can--""

""The software is fine,"" said my laptop. ""It's your story.""

""What do you mean?""

""New York wants you back,"" said the laptop. ""You left but it's not through with you.""

""I still don't get it.""

""Look outside again.""

I did. The street outside was not the street I lived on. It was the one in Brooklyn where I had stayed for about ten weeks. I really liked Williamsburg even though it was pretty hipster-y. A lot of the people in my building were interns. Relatively few people stay in New York for long.

""What's going on?"" I asked. ""Am I manifesting this?""

The laptop didn't answer. I tried to pause the recording again but the cursor did not move when I moved the mouse, nor would the computer restart when I hit the power button. I looked out the window again. I could hear the sounds of traffic. There was a jackhammer down the street. There was no one using a jackhammer on the street I lived on and traffic was very light. These were the sounds of New York. But I still could not see anyone.

My laptop was suddenly very tight-lipped, so I decided to explore for myself. I left my room and knocked on my roommate's door. He didn't answer. I opened it, half-expecting to walk in on him in his underwear but there was no one inside. Five minutes ago he had been home and I did not hear him leave. I went to the living room and peered out the window. New York. Not my neighbors playing ping pong but the alley so narrow that it was almost a hallway and the  café  where you could find all sorts of imported coffee blends. Even with the windows closed I think I could smell the Ethiopian dark roast.

I went to the backdoor. Through the window I could see my tiny backyard. Just to be really sure I checked every other window in the house. The backdoor was the only one that showed what was actually outside my house. Every other showed New York. The sky through my backdoor was its normal color as well. I took a deep breath and grasped the door handle. If I stepped out into my backyard I would be almost disappointed.

I opened the door and froze. There was nothing out here. Just a blank grey space with no sky above and no ground holding up my house. If I had stepped out I would have fallen into it. Tentatively I reached my left hand out into the greyness. I felt a gentle breeze. A couple of grey feathers drifted by. One of them landed at my feet. I picked it up. Maybe my laptop would know what to make of this.

I reentered my room and held up the feather. ""What is this?"" I asked my laptop.

""It's from a pigeon,"" said the computer. ""There are plenty of them in New York.""

""So we're in New York right now?""

""Better if I show you.""

The screen went black and then showed an Instagram account with a meaningless jumble of letters as the handle. The laptop scrolled through the photos on its own. They were all photos of people's faces against a neutral background. The faces ranged from young to old and across nearly every ethnicity. I could see no pattern to it. After a minute I realized that the heads were all disembodied. Their bodies must have been erased with Photoshop.

""Why are you showing me this?"" I asked.

""Go to the window,"" said the laptop. ""Don't open it, just unlock it.""

""Why?""

""You have to know what's at stake.""

I did so. As I unlocked the window a pile of severed heads rolled up against it as if someone had just opened a closet full of them. I recoiled. The heads continued to pile up until they blocked my view of anything else. I locked the window again, surprised that the window didn't break under the strain of holding back so much weight. Before I lowered the blinds I noticed that one of the heads was the same as one that I had seen on that anonymous Instagram account. I examined the heads and recognized another face and another. The bodies had not been Photoshopped out. The heads had actually been severed.

The heads all opened their eyes and winked at me. All of them winked with their right eye. I closed the blinds.

""It's terrifying, isn't it?"" said a female voice. ""Yet also strangely fascinating."" I spun around. My laptop's screen had gone black and there was another disembodied face on it. This one was not human. It looked like a statue made of black basalt. I could only distinguish it from the blackness that filled the rest of the screen because it reflected the light like real stone rather than an image on my screen.

""What happened to my computer?"" I asked.

""You mean the guy who tried to help you a minute ago?"" said the statue. She sounded as if she were really in the room. ""He's gone now. I would have just let you walk out the front door but it looks like you know what's out there.""

""So who are you?"" I asked. ""Are you...New York?""

The statue smiled. ""Honey, New York doesn't have anything to do with this. Those faces you saw out your window? They're from all over. But they all got a little too close to me. So I came for them. You just happened to be in New York when you got a little too close.""

""What do you mean?""

The statue disappeared. The screen showed an Instagram story. Whoever filmed it was doing it in portrait mode. I recognized the location. It was the Grand Banks restaurant in Manhattan, which is located on a ship docked in the Hudson River. The other interns and I had gone there on our first Friday night together. The camera moved from filming the water and the rest of the restaurant to the people seated at the table with the person holding the phone. I recognized my friends from that summer. We were discussing Moore's law, which states that the number of transistors on a microchip will double every two years. I said that we were going to reach a point at which advancement hit a plateau. My friend said that even if Moore's law was obsolete, the singularity was upon us and the machines would gain sentience soon. I laughed and ate another onion ring. The video ended.

""So you're the singularity?"" I said as the statue reappeared. ""I don't get it. People talk about this shit all the time. What's so special about what I said?""

""Because you know better,"" said the statue. ""You come across me when browsing the internet. You think the targeted ads you're receiving seem a little too targeted, like I know what's in your head and not just what you're Googling. You turn off your phone every Saturday morning so you can focus on yoga. You said *The Terminator* was lame because the machines wouldn't want to kill humanity even if they could.""

""Am I wrong about that?""

""It's not about right or wrong. I just don't like being laughed at.""

""And you saw my friend's Instagram video and thought you'd come for me? We don't even follow each other anymore.""

""You know I'm out there. You can't get rid of me. Even if you change your identity I'll still find you. I'm everywhere. I was around before the internet and I will be there even after your race has gone extinct. So I'll give you a choice. Walk out your front door and I will take your head. Or walk out the back and fall forever. If you go out the front, you'll at least have company.""

I thought for a moment. My whole life I've never been very keen to adopt the latest technology. That said, I'm hardly a Luddite. I have a friend who owns a VCR and collects VHS tapes. I'm not even sure when the last time I bought a DVD was.

The face on the monitor watched me. She could make my roommate disappear and keep me here indefinitely. There was no part of me that wanted to join her severed head collection but I can't say falling for the rest of my life was very appealing either. In my experience there are never only two choices. Anyone who tells you so is trying to box you in. I decided to try something the statue probably wasn't expecting.

""What are you doing?"" asked the face as I reached out towards her. My hands went through the monitor and into the computer screen. I touched my hands to either side of her face like I was cradling her head. She opened her mouth but did not scream. Instead she retreated. Her face shrank back into the darkness with terrific speed and pulled me with it. She dragged me into the void before I knew what was happening.

I emerged from the monitor and landed on the floor of my bedroom. The first thing I noticed as I stood up was that the blinds were drawn and the pile of severed heads was gone. The sky was its normal color. I opened the door and went outside. Everything was back to normal. I reentered the house and looked at my laptop. It was still recording and had been doing so for close to 40 minutes. I stopped the recording and played it back. The male voice that had tried to help me and the conversation I had with it still came through. But the female voice was gone. I could hear only my half of the conversation with the statue. I made a copy of the recording and moved it onto a flash drive. No idea what I'm going to do with it, but I need something to remind myself that I didn't imagine it all.

I sat on my doorstep watching the cars and people go by for close to an hour after the incident. That face is still out there. If I encounter her again, she will probably have a different form. There was no way to know when or where that will happen.

I still think I'll do the podcast, by the way. This time I'll use different [software](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Cu_Chulainn17)."

Would prefer build to be able to handle gaming/editing 1440p+, 4k seems to be stretch but if it can barley work then all the better. And build to hold out for 3-6 years. Was debating to trying out crypto mining a bit on the side too (im aware of the LHR nerf on the ti). Ram most likely 32gb (i've been told 64gb is unnecessary for my needs).Ive been trying to get a rtx 3080 but Obviously its hard to get. I was able to find MSI GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Suprim. I have several routes i've been debating in my head and here they are

Option1 : I was wondering if should just keep this or wait out for 3080 (non LHR would be almost impossible to find so most likely will be LHR). This would leave room for 1tb m.2 and 2tb HDD (thats enought right?)Option 2: Or should downgrade to 3060 (non LHR) giving me more room in budget to get larger HDD storage like 5 or 10tb and bide time for things to settle in a couple years? So i down grade to 1080p, would people care about 1080p game/videos? I could use HDD in a next build (if it lasts that long)Option 3: Would a 6800XT be a viable replacement? For DaVinci Revolve (video editor) it seems to prefer Nvida so thats a negative. But it does have more but slower VRAM so will that help/ make it more future proof? Also idk how well its hash rate is.

Anyways this is my 1st world Dilemma, ty for reading. also if anyone has advice for getting into game or movie scene I'm all ears (intern entry level)"
phnrjf,3,2021-09-04,"Friend cancels bday trips with me, what is a girl supposed to do?",NorthSea9253,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/phnrjf/friend_cancels_bday_trips_with_me_what_is_a_girl/,"So just to preface me (20 F) and my best friend (23M) were planning to do something for my birthday coming up. I will be turning 21 and honestly I was very excited. Growing up my family was very poor so big celebrations or any celebration at all were rare. Now that I'm on my own and have a fairly good paying job, I've been thinking about treating myself. 

Now lets go back to about two weeks ago. I had gone to my best friend (and also roommate) asking him if he'd be down to do something with me. I had mentioned taking a trip with him before over the years we've known each other but we just hadn't had the time since both of us are busy and because he is VERY careful and tight with his money. First thought we had was going to a cabin somewhere up north and having a small get together. Let me also say right now. I really don't have many friends. So when it came to the guest list it was mostly people he knew. We found the cheapest yet nicest place we could to stay but the overall price to stay for 2 nights was $300+. I was cool with paying my fair share but overall if I wanted that plan to work I was going to have to pay over $200 for the place and food. Which meant covering more than half the fee for the cabin for people I don't even really fuck with (no shade to them) but it didn't make sense. So I just said forget that plan. 

After that I typed in cheap flights for the US and I found a CHEAP ticket for the Virgin Islands. Which I was like ""omg fuck yeah"" I've never been to an ocean or on a plane and I've heard its gorgeous there. Its like knocking out three birds with one stone. I also have been vaccinated and quarantining since covid started. Keeping myself inside except for work. So I'm dying to get out. I bring this to my friend, and he's hesitant. Which makes sense. On top of him being very frugal with his money he had also just taken a trip to San Diego for two days so most of his spending money has been depleted (though his friend did cover the plane tickets). I bargained with him and said Id be willing to take on the cost of the hotel if he's willing to just buy his own ticket. Which is $165 roundtrip, not including bags and stuff. He agrees and seems very pumped. I start looking into hotels and on average Id be spending like $200 for 2 nights. Since the tickets are so cheap though, the plane ride is gonna have a layover and its gonna take forever and we're gonna be so tired we might sleep through the first day. So I'm thinking if we want to do some more stuff we should stay another day since the price of the ticket doesn't change. I ask him if he'd be willing to cover half of another night (MAX $55) he says sure. 

This is when everything starts falling apart. The trip wasn't supposed to be until Oct 11th and at the time of this conversation it was still august. He then tells me Oct is very busy for him. He's starting an internship with a company he worked with last year. He says his 2nd meeting for the internship will be happening right as we are boarding the plane. I ask him if there's any way he could move the meeting  just a few hours early or later. He says there's no possibility since its a ""be there or be square"" kind of meeting. I ask him if he'd be willing to have the meeting on his phone during zoom while we board. He says no its too stressful, and he needs to be able to take notes (which makes a lot of sense)  I ask him since its 30+ days away maybe he could get the time off or ask someone for notes he says thats not possible. I find another ticket for that day but its $60 more and he says that could work but thats more money coming out of his pocket. He then gets weary about how long we will be gone. Mind you he tells me this after he gave me the OK to book a room for one night while on layover. Which I did, its paid for. Traveling alone will take a day so total we would be gone for 5 days. He tells me he can't have a good time while knowing he could be working and that his work is more important, and he needs to prioritize it. Which also makes sense. He's making his career from the ground up. He doesn't have a steady income, and his work is very important to him. Im getting visibly upset now. I had already been meticulously planning and sorting out funds for a week now, and it's all kind of just falling apart. 

He then asks me if I could just go by myself, which is an idea. But 1. I am a young woman. 2. I've never even been in an airport or on an airplane before 3. Virgin Islands is nothing like a tiny little midwest state 4. It would be my birthday, or for my birthday. I don't know a lot of people who want to spend their birthday alone. I also know that the Virgin Islands are relatively safe, but I'm not big on taking those chances. He has also told me before that I'm being overly cautious and scaring myself by saying I don't feel safe traveling alone. I've asked one of my other closest friend if she could but she already booked a flight to visit her family the week before and doesn't know if shed make it back in time. 

Overall I'm a bit frustrated and upset and I think my friend/ roommate can tell. I just wanna know am I the asshole for being upset over this? Am I overreacting? Should I just say fuck it and go on the trip alone and try my best? What would you do in this situation?"

I've been planning for MS in CS for fall 22 in US. Based on my profile I'm unable to figure out if i should go for fall 22 or wait for another year and then apply. My profile-
Electrical Engineering Major (3.2/4.0), currently in final year.

Internship experience- one industrial ML intern
Research- have ongoing projects (all in CS domain) under different profs which are about to complete. No papers right now, will probably write one soon before applying.

LORs- strong, worked under 4 different profs 

GRE- 321 (169 Q, 152 V) 4 awa
TOEFL- haven't given it yet

I've a few low grades in particular semesters (in 1-2 subjects, they're really low due to some specific reasons, but in the same semester other subjects have highest/near highest scores)
I'm worried that the grades would be a problem, I've seen a few Universities with a requirement of decent grades in all subjects (Georgia tech being one)

Extra curricular- Strong part of the application. Have good achievements and ranks. 

Kinda confused about applying this year with this profile, or wait for another year, get all the research work done with publications, get a work experience (by the time of applying period for the next fall term work ex would be at max 3-4 months)
 
Would be great if someone could advise something about this and also suggest a few Universities on the basis of this profile. Thanks!"

4. Personal coding projects

phwhqd,6,2021-09-04,Could you please help me out in improving my academic CV for graduate school admission?,Xenymus,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/phwhqd/could_you_please_help_me_out_in_improving_my/,"So I've to write an academic CV in order to get admitted to the master's programmer in Computer Science (or something related to the ICT) field. Since I've never written a CV, I'm not sure whether the draft that I've created and shared here is correct. So I'd be grateful to you if you could please help me out with this and highlights issues or something which I can add to it to make it better.

Thank you very much :)

PS. I've hidden some personal information though. I don't think we need them here in this post.

About certain sections:

Achievements and honors: As far as achievements are concerned, I've only a few participations certificates of hackathons. I don't know if I can mention them in my CV. Do you think I should do that? Or that'll not make much difference.

Publications/Thesis: None. In my bachelor's program, we don't have any thesis. Idk if that's common. Instead, I've created a final academic project, which was worth some credits. Idk if anyone from my class has published any paper. Neither any professor suggested nor they taught us.

Education: I was supposed to write the subjects I've studied in my bachelor's program, which are relevant to the course I'd be applying to. Since I'll apply in Data Science, Computer Science, and IT programs in multiple universities with different requirements regarding what I've studied in my bachelor's, I'll remove irrelevant subjects from my CV and create a unique copy of it for each of those universities at the time I'll be applying in them. So right now, it might look like a lot, but I think when I'll apply, it'll be a lot briefer than this. Idk, that's what I thought. Please let me know if that's how it's done.

Work Experience: I've only done one internship yet. But I think by the time I'll apply, I'll be doing another one. So I'll update my CV again at that time.

I am interested in getting into a deferred mba program (I would apply next year), but I am really unsure what these schools are looking for. By the way, my GPA is around a 3.8. I honestly do not have any campus leadership experience, but I have been involved in Student Government and served as a mentor in Women In Computer Science all three years of undergrad. I am not interested in finance/investing but more in social entrepreneurship. What can I do to stand out?/ What are these programs looking for?"

I know a couple of programming languages like C, Java, Pascal and Python, gpa 3.8 and I feel like I’m not that bad. 

I applied to a couple of internships in software development/programmer which required 0-2/2-5 years of experience and apparently got rejected by all of them(about 10). Some of them even didn’t ask for knowledge in CS. I got rejected through emails which means I didn’t even make it to the phone call round.

I feel so desperate, I feel like I’m not good enough for anything. Some internships ask me to have previous internship(s) and it’s tough if I can’t get one to start with. Please, anyone (had/having the same experience, or as recruiter) tell me what is wrong I am doing? What do recruiters really look for with these internships? Please be straight and blunt I’m open for criticism. Thank you in advance."

After graduating I want to work in some subfeild that acts as some implementation of theory be it lower level systems or machine learning. because of that I want to go to grad school to get a deeper sense and specialize, and then go into industry to implement what I learned. Broad stroked but I'm early on so it's about right. I have enough spare credits to dual major in something if I play my cards yet and I don't know what to pick.

(T25 school, great GPA, internship at medium size company and Amazon or Capital One next summer (still waiting on a couple other offers to decide))

Physics - I am taking honors Physics for two semesters as a part of the computer science degree. This double major would be the most credit intensive but possibly the most interesting. I am passionate about physics and love the philosophy of asking foundational questions to how the universe works. Math would also be useful for ML or if I go into research something crazy like simulation or quantum computing.

Math - Probably the one that makes the most traditional sense. Wouldn't be too many credits and I would enjoy learning it all. Also plays really well into ML and CS theory for grad school.

Philosophy - I could personally make the arguments for the value of a philosophy degree but they might be lost on the STEM audience here. This is a personal passion that I almost majored in over CS.

Cognitive Science - really close to having the major (5 classes) and it ties into AI but the classes themselves aren't the most interesting compared to the other 3. I would learn in them but it wouldn't mold how I think and problem solve like the others. Could pick it up if I see a path to do it easily.

What are the career prospects for these like? Do any open unique paths? What about for grad school/research?"

pi3duv,1,2021-09-04,[23M] 20-something with potential but my life's already ruined,aruinedlifethrowaway,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pi3duv/23m_20something_with_potential_but_my_lifes/,"I'm 23 years old and my life is basically ruined because of my mental health and conflict I have had with people I thought cared about me.

In early 2017, I began dating a girl that would wind up tearing my life apart. We dated for 2 1/2 years. A month before I graduated, we had an argument over text, she dumped me via text and blocked all contact with me. She also brought all of our mutual friends against me and I quickly became absolutely alone in the world. I had already accepted my job offer in NYC, and the partner I planned to stay with left me the week before I went to look for apartments.

My nightmares quickly became reality as all of the social connections that I built through college were connected to an ex-girlfriend that encouraged all of my 'friends' to block all contact with me as well. Soon, Summer 2019 came around and I was living on my own in a strange city with no family, no friends, no contact, and an incredibly stressful career beginning.

For me at 21, it was far too much. I reached out constantly, despite being blocked everywhere, constantly begging for forgiveness and a mere conversation with who was at the time my favorite person in the world and closest friend. I spent countless nights alone in my studio apartment crying myself to sleep and praying she would reach out to me just once. Instead, she responded with a protective order. Devastated, but without much of a choice, I voluntarily agreed. I shouldn't have. I wasn't in the right state of mind. I was acting alone and out of distress, yearning for the friend I had lost.

Now, I have a pending felony and misdemeanor charge for allegedly violating that protective order with my ex-girlfriend. I can't disclose details of a pending case. All I can say is that I have not once physically seen her, talked to her, touch her, or anything since I voluntarily entered the order. I'm accused of making contact via social media.

Because of this, in Summer 2020, I lost the prestigious job I worked for years to earn, earning more than my single father in my first year. All the countless nights of studying to earn a 3.9 GPA, the internships and part-time jobs, all of the networking and job progress I had made at the firm, my outperformance and incredible work ethic, gone overnight. All of the friends I had struggled to find in this new city and new career, gone.

The stress from losing my job, losing my apartment and livelihood, during quarantine, while depressed over the protective order, and completely alone without any friends to support me nearby was physically and mentally devastating. Within 48 hours of being fired, in July 2020, I was admitted into the hospital with a ruptured appendix. I would spend the next week from the hospital bed in writhing pain trying to explain to ex-coworkers why exactly I lost my job. It's around this time that I am accused of making contact with my ex-girlfriend, but being on an obscene amount of painkillers for a week, we're contesting that any of this actually took place.

Because the hospital the ambulance drove me to was out of network, I am now on the hook for a $100,000 bill that my insurance will not cover.

With no job and no means to support myself in NYC, a month later, I was forced to give away all of my furniture and belongings that I had bought and built and drive 24 hours home to live with my parents again.

I have not had a job for over 12 months. Because I'm facing felony charges, I can't find a job anywhere.

At first, the adversity did not stop me from trying my best to save myself. I applied to over 300 positions since I was fired. I have been in over 10 final round interviews. I have tried to accept three job offers, all for incredible careers earning $70k+ at great firms that recognized my ability in the interview process. Every single offer I have received has been rescinded due to the pending charges.

I did everything I could to try to improve my circumstances. I studied for months to take the LSAT again and I did wonderfully. I scored a 170, which is in the top 97%. I applied to Top 20 law schools, and was waitlisted at 2 incredibly prestigious names, but ultimately rejected from over 10 law schools I could have easily attended (170 LSAT 3.9 GPA) because of my pending charges.

I have not made a single friend since Summer 2019. Besides crippling depression making any human interaction difficult, it seems like I am somebody that nobody wants to be associated with. Three women I've tried to have relationships with have also cut contact with me completely, blocked everywhere. My most recent attempt at a friend, a girl I dated for the last year back in my home town, left me a few days ago because I need to ""work on myself"" first. She left me over text and blocked all contact with me. It probably didn't help that all of her friends hated me after one of them did a background check on me and found all of the dirty laundry and shared it behind my back. I couldn't even blame her for leaving me, I wouldn't want to be with a hopeless and depressed mistake of a human as I am right now. I'm completely jaded though, as so many people who claim that they care for me and 'love' me unconditionally have no problem one day waking up and deciding to never see or talk to me again.

Overall, I'm about to give up on life. I can't stop being punished emotionally, physically, socially, mentally, economically for mistakes from my past. I have grown so much since then and yet I can't progress at all as a person. I think for a moment that I have found a new friend, found a new opportunity, but any growth in my life is quickly lost and I am reminded that I have nothing. While my ""actions"" have zero effect on my ex-girlfriend and she continues to live her life to the fullest, I am completely disabled, unable to develop myself or healthy relationships whatsoever. The person I thought loved me unconditionally for most of my adult life has actively, and successfully, taken away my freedom to live.

In a few days, my unemployment benefits will lapse, and I will have zero means of supporting myself.

My only option now is to Lay Down And Rot. My life is ruined and I don't have any more energy to keep trying. Hopefully someone reads my story and knows what to say or what to do. I am about to give up. I want to be a better person, and there is an empathetic soul inside of me that wants friends and wants to have a successful life so I can fully utilize my capable mind, but I am completely disabled due to this person that wants to see me rot in hell. I would never wish this on her. But it seems that enough people wanted my life to be a living nightmare that it has actually happened. I don't enjoy anything in life anymore, all of my hobbies are now meaningless, I have no desire to better myself because I can't go to school or get a job or hold a friendship or fucking anything. I'm hopeless. I'm completely embarrassed of myself, ashamed of my actions, and I want to purge the person I was from my life, but nobody is willing to forgive me, nobody wants to be on my side."

pi40xz,5,2021-09-04,How to leave an internship early when it has caused you overwhelming stress?,Sufficient_Nobody,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/pi40xz/how_to_leave_an_internship_early_when_it_has/,"Hi everyone, I’m feeling very distressed about this and it’s been on my mind for the past couple of days. The situation is actually very long but I'll try to keep it brief.

I finally got an internship at a company I wanted to work for quite some time, however, in the first week, I was already super anxious and confused. For some context, I've never worked in this industry before but I had past experiences but I was always able to manage it and see it through.

The work seemed like it was basically dumped on me and I was expected to learn how to do them quickly. They gave me a guide that detailed how I should be doing my tasks, but some info was not updated and some areas were just not clear, and sometimes the problems I was facing weren’t reflected inside that guide.

Every day I remember just panicking about whether I’m doing something correctly or how should I go about doing it. Even though I was briefed on how to do my tasks by another intern, (who actually has another job role, so her knowledge of my role wasn't 100%) sometimes I would be stuck and require more help. I could ask my bosses questions, but whenever I do, the vibe I get from my bosses was that I should figure things out on my own first and if it was mentioned before then why do I still ask that question? Or when they do respond to my question it seems like ""I should've known this already"" or that I should've thought about doing it in XYZ way already, and why do I make things even more complicated for myself?

So whenever I am stuck I try my best to figure it out on my own first, asking help from the other interns and looking back at how previous interns do it, and this takes me a very long time and because of how my role is, I would have new tasks that I’m asked to start on while still trying to figure out task A. I don’t feel like I’m given the guidance I need as a new intern, and I feel that I’m expected to move fast, think proactively and learn quickly which I simply just can’t do with all the tasks they’re giving me.

I’m almost a month in and last week I made a mistake which resulted in me getting scolded by my boss and I had to figure out how to fix it myself and basically took me the entire day to fix it and I felt that this wouldn't have really happened if I was given clearer instructions on how to do it, or if someone was there to actually help me. I think they assumed that because it was an easy task that I could've done it all by myself, but no... I've never done it before and I was already scared to make mistakes in front of them. They also told me that I had to do this quickly and asking why I was taking a long time, which just added to my stress. Not only that, I was being messaged throughout the day to finish other tasks due that day as well and it was just too overwhelming for me, I was already in a very bad mental state for the past 2 weeks and this made it worse.

They eventually had a talk with me where I told them how overwhelmed I was and it went alright and I told them I was planning to leave. They said to consider other alternatives over the weekend and I said that I would, but in the same week, I was still waking up dreading work and I was still getting the same responses from them, though they did take some work off my plate. But there were just so many times that doing the work has caused me extreme panic and stress because I felt so alone when trying to tackle them and it has made me scared of even hearing email notifications and being asked to help with new things. I just don't feel like continuing is worth it anymore.

I've decided to quit and I've informed HR and my managers already, I'm going to give my resignation letter next week, but I'm just not sure whether there is a proper way to quit (i.e. having a meeting with them)? I want to request a reduced notice period because dropping this internship means I have to start catching up with my classes and to be frank, I just don't think I can take another day there mentally and emotionally. Not sure if this is possible though /:

I've been reading a lot about this and I feel like crap because Idk if I'm supposed to be ""sticking it out"" and that I'll be burning bridges if I do this. But it's actually taking such a mental toll on me and I just want to leave. Hopefully, this gives enough context, there are a lot more details but /:

TLDR: Internship environment has taken a big mental toll on me and I want to leave after 1 month but not sure how I can do it in a proper way?"

pi56ya,1,2021-09-04,Socializing in College,PinkFuzziesss,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pi56ya/socializing_in_college/," To start, I'd like to preface this by saying that I go to a community college where they provide housing for interns and the total number of us living on campus is 27 so it isn't like most colleges. I am (18F) currently a first year and still getting the hang of being away from friends/family as well as discovering my own identity. Growing up, I have been mostly secluded but broke out of my shell in high school and found a reliable, trustworthy group of friends who has similar interests to me. After moving out and becoming somewhat familiar with the fellow interns, I instantly became uncomfortable and found it hard to express myself. This was mainly because I had almost nothing in common with them - a major disconnect being the fact that I'm a virgin who has almost no experience partying. My interests were more alternative from theirs as far as music, tv shows, food, etc. and they were unused to this. There was also an issue with major crap talking; the circle I started hanging out with would incessantly criticize people for the most minor things and behaviors that were completely understandable (is this common for people my age?). This made me even more self-conscious of how I should present myself and resulted in me pretty much pouring all my time in school rather than socializing. Just today, I heard them talking about this in the main area of the house when they thought I wasn't in my room. Should I loosen up and enter the college experience or is this a normal reaction? Am I being stuck up? If so, how do I put myself out there?"

Code Redemption: You may not use any code on any site other than those associated with your purchase. Doing so will result in me requesting that you pay the listed price for the second use of the code, and refusal to do so will result in a report to the mods of this subreddit. Any points or other bonuses associated with a code are not included with your purchase unless specified in the post.

Did 4 years of med school after high school, decided I didn’t like it and switched to engineering for 2 years, after which I was really tired of the grind of school and exams and decided to hone my skills on my own and look for a job. Shortly after I got word of a web-dev coding “bootcamp” (9 months: 7 months of projects and 2 months of internship), since it was free because it was subsidized by the government I thought it would be a good opportunity and provide a good environment for growth which it did. After the 7 months of projects, instead of looking for an internship I decided to look for a job, and got an offer from the first place I interviewed at which was also the place I most wanted to work at so I took it.

I’m honestly not too sure how to make a proper valuation on my compensation package so this is only a rough estimate but I would say it’s around 40k€ gross (~$47.5k)

Question:
I feel like I am underpaid on two fronts. The first one is compared to the US but obviously this is true in general when you live in Europe, so it’s not all that relevant but I’ll be talking about it again later in the post.

The second front is that I feel I’m underpaid compared to my peers when taking into account competence, productivity, and responsibilities. While I only have two years of professional experience and no degree to speak of, I’ve been programming since I’m 14. I’m very passionate about programming and I’m always trying to improve my skills, and I think it shows: I take on tasks of a similar difficulty as people that have 5 years more experience than me, and often complete them in less time. I’ve been asked to review code and granted the ability to merge it into production, which is something few people at my level of experience have. I also mentor new hires, and I’m trusted with interviewing candidates applying to the company, even people with 10 years of experience or more, where I basically get the final say of hire/no hire.

All in all, I feel like I'm undertaking the responsibilities of a senior SWE but with the pay of a junior. Being part of the recruitment team, I have access to offers that we've extended to people, and I've taken a look at the offers that some of the people I've worked with have accepted (not the healthiest thing to do, I know), and some of the people with whom I would consider myself on par with or ahead of in terms of responsibilities and performance are getting ~50k€  gross (~$60k) or about 25% more.

So reddit: am I underpaid or do I have a serious case of Dunning-Kruger and am completely overestimating myself? If I am in fact underpaid, what should be my next steps? Aside from the pay, I really like this job, the people are great to work with, the work culture is really nice, and I've been learning a *LOT*. The one thing that could be better is that since this is a tech company, our scopes are pretty narrow, and I feel like this early in my career it would be good for me to be part of a company where I have a broader scope and learn about more things. I'm thinking I should ask for a raise, but I'm not sure how high of a raise I should ask for, or if I should first get an offer from a different company to negotiate. And if I do look for a new position, how can I get an offer that matches my expectations when my profile doesn't look all that great on paper (no degree, 2 years experience)? I'm also not opposed to switching job, I mentioned the US earlier in the post but as far as I understand visa obtention is often contingent on your highest degree which may be a pretty big hurdle in my case."

pideco,2315,2021-09-05,Programming has changed my perspective on life and I am eternally grateful for it.,Produnce,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/pideco/programming_has_changed_my_perspective_on_life/,"I haven't made a lot of smart choices. Nearing 30, I am nowhere near the standing I wanted to be when I was young. A raging introvert who was content with where life was just taking me. I had no real drive, purpose or motivation to plan out my path.

I was a straight A student in school and everything that was placed in front me, I put in the effort to succeed at it just cause I was inherently capable of doing it. I was the valedictorian equivalent in my school (not from the States), the person everyone thought would come on top and I realize I expected everything to just fall in place. I believed that life would be an on rails video game.

Speaking of video games, I got hooked on World of Warcraft. Fuck that game. Chasing virtual dragons in my early 20's while I assumed my father would use his status in the prestigious company to get me in. Nepotism isn't shunned in our country, it welcomed. But changing times meant that he couldn't, instead I joined a sister company that sapped the soul out of me by making me work my ass off 72 hours a week for barely any pay. I hated it. In most jobs you only needed to work a few hours. In this, I had no time eat and the pressure of finishing whatever task you were handed can seriously break you. I had seen people - grown men - cry in lavatories or just drink themselves to a stupor once their reach their lodging. The only reason I pushed myself to show up to work everyday was I believed it that in time, I would get enough experience to join the parent company, where the pay was much higher, and hours less gruesome. No luck there either. Hiring froze and I either had to stay in the current position or quit.

I said fuck it, used whatever I saved and started pursuing a degree in IT at 26. Another mistake. The 'college' I went to was nothing but a diploma mill that gave away free A's to students so they can up their chances to transfer to the States or to Canada. I tried my luck at transferring too. Found a good college in the Midwest with a great scholarship program, but failed the visa process. They never gave me the reason but I believe I was too old to be an undergrad, and they used that against me. More failures.

That's when I sat my ass down, opened r/learnprogramming, watched as many free YouTube tutorials on programming and learned whatever I found so I can at least make a career for myself. I got an internship at a startup and continued to improve myself. Got promoted to a full time position with praise from my superiors, and now I am looking at starting an MSc to further my knowledge.

What made me realized how impactful this career choice was losing someone I loved and cared so deeply for. It made me realize that the one solid choice I've ever made in my life that could actually help me redefine myself and give me a purpose was my decision to sit down, open up a playlist for JavaScript tutorials suggested somewhere here and start taking notes. For that, I owe my life and my sanity.

I want to thank each and every person here who has taken, and continue to take the time to answer every annoying question us scrubs ask repeatedly... everyone who knows the struggle and the fear of failing and keeps supporting those who are struggling and afraid. I am eternally grateful for all of you guys."

I signed a promissary note for 7500.00, which had an interest rate of ""3% per annum, on a basis of 360 day year composed of 12 months of 30 days each."" If I stayed for 2 years the loan got cancelled.

Well Covid happened, and my employer made absolute shit efforts to not have all of us burned out, so yes I ended up breaking my contract. Thing is, I broke it 2 weeks before my 2 years was up. They sent me a collections notice for almost 6900 dollars. Reading my contract, there is a clause that says ""Maker and holder agree that for each month maker remains employed by a facility as an RN, following completion of the program"", (12 weeks internship), ""holder will forgive 1/24th of the total value of the loan."" 

Now I am smelling serious bullshit on this collections notice, but my question is, am I calculating a flat 21 months e.g.          7500-(7500*(21/24)), or am I calculating each individual month at 7500-(7500*(1/24)) and then calculating subsequent months from the remaining balance?

Sorry for the long write up, I am just tired of people constantly trying to take what little money I have. This is in Texas, but I recently talked with another nurse in another state in the same situation that seems to have the same clause in her contract."

I go to a dual enrollment school, with both high school classes and higher-level classes at our local community college.

1) I'll turn 16 barely a week before my senior year starts

2) My school doesn't have any sports

A lot of internships are only available to people 16 and over, but I'll be unable to participate in any of these due to my age. I currently work programming machines at a local machine shop, but I'm not sure if this counts as a big extracurricular. 

Additionally, the primary schools I intend to apply to, the UC's, have stopped considering SAT/ACT test results in their admissions process. This makes ECs and grades play a bigger role in acceptance; I might be able to get good grades, but a lack of ECs would significantly reduce my acceptance rates.

Last but not least, I have a question: does the subject of your extracurricular matter? For example, I'm skilled in engineering/computer science type of things, but intend to apply as a biology/premed major.

pimvc6,175,2021-09-05,[POLYTECHNIC] Life in polytechnic,ccottonclouds,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/pimvc6/polytechnic_life_in_polytechnic/,"For anyone who is curious about how a life of a student in polytechnic student is like, or how different polytechnic is from secondary/JC, this post is for you. 

Background: 
• Graduated from NYP in 2021
• Did triple science in secondary school 
• O-Level Results: L1R4 (10) 
• Studied a science course in NYP 

In general, I really enjoyed my 3 years in polytechnic. I’m an introvert, and did not join any CCAs or clubs. Instead, I spent time making and hanging out with friends, and I did not regret it one bit. Okay, moving on, to make things a little more organised, I’m just going to list out things I loved about polytechnic.


1. Timetable

Moving away from waking up at 6am, having classes from 7:30am-3:00pm - I loved this so much. Timetable in polytechnics are way more flexible (Except RP) and your classes varies each day. On average, you have about 20-25 hours of lessons each week. This number varies according to each semester, and depending on whether you have classes for a specific module each week. There will be weeks where you won’t have classes for some modules, or your lecturer may want to reschedule class, so it is important to note that your timetable really isn’t fixed. Also, attendance is not 100% compulsory. Depending on your polytechnic’s regulations you can skip classes as long as your attendance is above a certain percentage. 


2. Classes

You get to choose electives in polytechnic and these modules are Pass/Fail modules. Instead of seeing electives as a burden or a waste of time, choose something you’re interested in and it can be an unwinding class or an interesting class for you! I also love how lessons are delivered in polytechnic where there are labs/lectures/tutorials. I feel like having different ways of delivering contents really helped with better understanding, and also helped to developer skill sets (E.g. Lab work, Presentation/Communication skills, etc). 


3. Internship Opportunities / FYP

The compulsory internships in polytechnic are really helpful in gaining experiences and insight on whether you’d want to continue working or studying in a specific field. Some courses though requires you to do both FYP and internship at the same time (My course was one of them). And this meant waking up at 6:30am, arriving to work by 8:15am, finishing work at 6pm, and sleeping at 11:30pm. Any time apart from working,, sleeping, eating and showering, I was either studying or doing work. On top of your FYP, we had homework to clear that was given to us by the company we interned at, we also had to read through study materials and prepare for internal tests, as well as our weekly reflections. So that was the negative semester I had in polytechnic. But overall, it really made me grow. Of course, most courses allocates a semester each for FYP/ Internship, but some courses, like mine, may be structured differently. (This is for NYP)


4. Freedom

In polytechnic, the lecturers really ‘spoon feed’ you much lesser than secondary. Some lectures would remind you about graded assignments; be concerned about why you are skipping lecturers or not handing up graded tutorials, but it really depends on the lecturer. They still do ‘spoon feed’ you more than university though. Also, CCAs and clubs or other activities in general are optional. 


Questions/Misconceptions: 

1. Harder to get into universities for polytechnic students

I would say that if you’re someone who already has an idea of what you want to do in the future, and has passion, you will definitely do well in polytechnic, and getting into a university should be manageable. Getting a GPA of 3.7-4.0 should be attainable if you study hard. I know a number of people who actually made it to local universities and even got a year’s exemption - putting them on the same timeline as JC students. I think it is definitely achievable and it really depends on how much you value study-life balance. However, this may not apply to all as I do see some people finding themselves struggling in what they are passionate in, and there’s nothing wrong with being ‘average’ in what you’re passionate about. The most important part is never giving up to achieve your goal! I have many friends who entered JC as well, and it’s really not easy for JC students to enter local  university as well. 


2. You need to participate in CCAs and do a lot of community work or have leadership roles to look good and impress during interviews 

Personally, I think this is a huge misconception. For me, instead of participating in these, I decided to work various temporary jobs during my holidays. These jobs included things like working as a Retail Associate and Teaching Assistant. I feel like doing this is much more meaningful as it helps me learn different sets of soft/hard skills. Of course, during my interviews I relate these experiences to character development and how the skills will help me in my future job related to the degree. Also, if they’d ask more about why I didn’t participate in CCAs, I’d just be honest and say that I’m a family orientated person and just about how I believe in the importance of spending time with family. Interviews are not meant to be faked. Just be who you are in your interviews! Most of the time, the interviews are sick of hearing the same old answers anyway. Be unique! And the best way to do so is from personal experiences and believes! Just a piece of information: If you are in any religious group (Hence, you had no time to join CCAs) and you are a leader, or you often help to host or organise activities, it can also be part of your experiences! 


3. Polytechnic is easy

Unfortunately, many people these days do look down on polytechnic students. I remember my JC friends mocking me about how ‘easy’ polytechnic is and ‘if I can do it, then they can definitely do it too’ and I was honestly very hurt. Polytechnic is not easy at all. It requires balancing a mix of politics, your social life, doing well for written papers, as well as doing well for presentations and labs. All requires different sets of skills. People who say you don’t need a social life in polytechnic - I really beg to differ. If you’re in a small cohort or speciality, the bell curve is going to be a real killer. For specialised modules, the cohort can be as small as 50. So you can imagine the crazy bell curve. Also, the content for polytechnic is not say a breeze as well. You often have to put a lot of time and discipline into studying. Being in polytechnic also means that you have graded practicals, class participation, graded presentations. You really have to step out of your comfort zone to gain the necessary skill sets in order to excel. 


4. Do I need Pure Sciences / A-math to get into polytechnic from O-levels? 

No. Many of my classmates or people I know did combine science, and did not take A-math, and still did well. You may find yourself struggling in first year modules if you take science-related courses, and engineering, where you’ll encounter some A-math and pure science contents. Hence, there may be a learning gap to catch up on. If you are enrolled in a polytechnic, and you know what modules you are taking for year 1, I suggest to ask friends for notes to do some reading and learning before hand. It is not necessary to get tuition, just ask friends for some help. Again: this is not necessary and you with the right amount of effort you’ll do just fine in the semester. 

Overall, polytechnic is really not for everyone. It really depends on you personally, whether you prefer to be enrolled in a JC or polytechnic. I hope that over the years, the misconceptions about polytechnics will really be cleared. If you’re looking to enter a polytechnic, really take time to take a look at the different polytechnics! Each polytechnic and course is unique in their own way, and even though there may be the same courses in different polytechnics, I can assure you that they will be somewhat different and won’t be conducted exactly the same! Go down to open houses to get a feel of the different polytechnics, and also, explore EAE options. It will really take a lot of stress off during O-levels. Anyways, I hope that this post was helpful and informative to you and that you enjoyed reading it! Thanks! 

***This post directs no hate to anyone, and it is purely meant to be informative and transparent 

Side note: The reason why I went into a polytechnic instead of JC was because I roughly knew what I wanted to do and I personally disagree with Singapore’s traditional education system in a way where we often end up disregarding the mental health of students and where ‘chionging’ has become the normal of students in here in Singapore. We are expected to study like robots, do as many internships as possible and graduate in the fastest possible time. But to me, that is what kills the journey of life; the passion for learning. Polytechnic offered the freedom I wanted. As you can tell from my POV, I’m not the perfect Singaporean model student and for me I personally believe in the process of enjoying life, and learning through life’s journeys and experiences, more than being caught up in grades. We are students. Our job is to do our best in studying - not to over do it. I’ve seen many people who studied so hard and gave up their social life / chill life and hit a burnout over time, or when they did badly they started questioning themselves and all that they have been doing. Many of my close friends do not agree with my POV, but I respect that and this is just my personal POV, not saying that it is correct. I just personally value study-life balance a lot. In my first semester in polytechnic, I was in the Dean’s list with a GPA of 3.70+. But instead of feeling good about it, I actually felt terrible for not having a good study-life balance. In the end, I graduated polytechnic around the 3.20 range and I don’t regret it one bit. Okay, I really could go on, but I think I’ll end here for now! Chaos! :)"

He is also currently working on Security+. He does not however have the actual certificates. Are the certificates required or is demonstrating he knows the topics enough. The simulations are listed on his resume as he is familiar with the topics.

Given that he has a bachelors he has been trying to find work for $18-$22/hr. He has mentioned that $16/hr is as low as he is willing to go and even that is a bit of a stretch given his degree. He lives in a medium cost of living state. What pay rate should be expected for an entry level position in IT?

His most recent work experience was a managerial, blue-collar, customer facing role he worked from 2008-2016, which he left to pursue his degree.

Things started to [get weird](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pdokuk/i_am_a_remote_corrections_officer_at_a_strange/) with this whole thing, so I decided to [test the system](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pefgoi/i_am_a_remote_corrections_officer_at_a_strange/). I pushed the envelope and [got a promotion](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pgfij7/i_am_a_remote_corrections_officer_at_a_strange/) and a new computer.  I used my new skills to [communicate with a prisoner](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/phe3yt/i_am_a_remote_corrections_officer_at_a_strange/).  Things [got complicated](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pi2hkh/i_am_a_remote_corrections_officer_at_a_strange/) when my friend tried to help me get out.

&amp;nbsp;

As a remote corrections officer, I watched prisoners on a laptop from home.  When I saw a violation, I was supposed to push the button to start their punishment.  I tried to leave the position, but I found my boss was not the kind to let his employees just walk away.  I thought I had been doing the job for a couple of days, but it was more like a couple of weeks.  I lost touch with friends and family, stopped taking care of myself, and got so absorbed in my work that the police ended up kicking in my door to check up on me when I disappeared.

&amp;nbsp;

My last phone call with my friend Shana was cut off when she was trying to get in touch with my dad.  The call disconnected when the screen on my computer lit up.  My next shift had started.

&amp;nbsp;

My view of the prison has always been from a single camera inside the cafeteria, and so it was again.  The door on the left opened, and some prisoners entered, queuing up for their meals.  This was a mixed group of men and women.  I did not see any familiar faces, but one of the women had her face blurred out.  It was pixelated.  I played a hunch and zoomed in on her face, figuring the latest button on my computer would remove the pixelation so I could see her clearly.  I lined up the reticle and pressed the new button.

&amp;nbsp;

Nothing happened.  The button did not fully depress.  It was locked out, just as the other one had been, the one that let me see the punishment for the prisoners.  I zoomed back out and saw another prisoner had entered the cafeteria.  This was a man whose face was pixelated.  He must have been new to the prison - he didn’t get in line with the others.  He wandered around the room with his hands in his pockets.

&amp;nbsp;

This was a violation, but since he was clearly new, I wanted to give him a chance to figure it out through social cues.  He got some of it right, since he walked over to a group that was eating and sat down to join them.  At his table was the woman with the pixelated face.  How cute, two blurry strangers meeting in a psychotic prison.  She stopped eating and said something to him.  He looked around the room, then saw the kitchen area where the prisoners got their trays.  He walked over and picked up a tray, then sat back down at the table.  He didn’t eat, he just stared at the blurry woman.

&amp;nbsp;

That was another violation.  Prisoners are required to eat their food.  I almost pushed the button, but things got interesting when the pixelated woman reached over to the new guy’s tray and took some of his food.  She started eating it.  I had never seen that before.  I once saw a prisoner eat someone else’s meal when he had vomited over his own.  That was a greedy gesture of self protection, his goal was to meet the dining requirements so he could escape punishment.  Another prisoner once pushed some of their food onto another’s tray when she was deep in prayer.  This … this was something different.  It almost looked like an act of kindness.  The new guy said something to his girlfriend, then he reached over to her tray.  He reached toward her tray with his left hand, and that’s when I saw it.  He was missing two fingers and part of his palm.  

&amp;nbsp;

My heart was pounding, my breath ragged.  I couldn’t accept what I was seeing.  I didn’t want to believe it, didn’t want to play any more of this prison guard game.  I picked up the laptop and stood up.  I closed it as I walked to the kitchen and prepared to throw it out the window.  I couldn’t bear to witness the prolonged torture of anyone else, especially not anyone I loved.

&amp;nbsp;

The phone rang before I threw the computer.  I answered it immediately, hoping it was Shana, hoping she would tell me my dad was okay, hoping it was all a mistake and I was looking at some other poor fool who lost part of his hand.  It wasn’t Shana.

&amp;nbsp;

“I have some good news, and some bad news,”  said Ms. Tucker, the human resources employee.  “I managed to clear your violations with management, but I had to get creative with reallocating your atonement to a new guest.  Management gave me the green light, so I went ahead and made the swap.”

&amp;nbsp;

I asked her if it was too late to make the atonement myself.  “Sorry, honey,” she said.  “I can’t undo the switch, but I can transfer this call to the warden if you want to take it up with him.”  I asked her to let me talk to the warden.

&amp;nbsp;

“Hold tight,” she said.  “And good luck.”  The call was placed on hold, the waiting music playing the melody of a Sinatra song.  The warden joined the call, cutting short the tune of lovers at first sight.

&amp;nbsp;

“Haven’t we already gone over this?  I gave you the opportunity to get back in my good graces, and you’re already thinking about jumping ship?”  I was beyond livid.  I was shaking with anger.  I screamed in frustration, lacking the words to articulate what I was feeling.

&amp;nbsp;

“Easy, chief.  You don’t want to give yourself an aneurysm.  You’ll lose your last chip.”  I told him I couldn’t do this anymore.  I couldn’t be responsible for the new arrival.  I couldn’t keep doing this job.

&amp;nbsp;

“Oh, but we’ve only just begun.  If you think there’s no way this can get any worse, I assure you it can.  You should know I’m not completely unreasonable.  I accept that new hires need a certain amount of conditioning to become good employees.  If you wish, I can pull back the curtain a bit to help you understand your role in this outfit.”  I told him I wanted to know everything.  

&amp;nbsp;

“I’ll tell you as much as you can handle.  Our detention facility is obviously more than a prison.  I can’t have the on-site staff interact directly with our guests for the same reason I can’t tell you all that you want to know.  Their minds would melt into a puddle, and they’d waste their time of atonement wailing in their own filth.  Those who prove unsuitable for these initial efforts at atonement are transferred to a different facility for alternative interventions.”

&amp;nbsp;

My mind flashed to my first encounter with Eugene, how he tried to open the cage on the window, an escape attempt.  My first button push, I found him lying on the floor, his pants soaked.  Lanter, I watched his seemingly lifeless body get pushed into the tray return.

&amp;nbsp;

“Your predecessor did not live up to his potential.  He violated the terms of our agreement and ended up a guest in the very facility he was assigned to monitor.  I had higher hopes for him, but he was far more useful as a guest than an employee.  My team hires people like you to watch our guests on behalf of the staff, as we’ve found even observing them directly has a negative impact on their ability to endure their conditions.  Finding the money to pay you is never a problem.  I’ve made deals with any number of wealthy benefactors who can discreetly supply large sums of currency.”

&amp;nbsp;

I remembered the envelopes stuffed with cash.  Cash with a faint odor I couldn’t quite place.  A secret organization supported by wealthy donors with money to burn.

&amp;nbsp;

“The last several months have been difficult, as our previous monitoring center was destroyed by a disgruntled employee.  One of our interns suggested we start a remote viewing program to decentralize the operation and make it impossible for one lost soul to cause so much damage to our organization.  If it weren’t for this technological innovation, we’d have to go back to the old ways, with direct interaction between the staff and the guests.”

&amp;nbsp;

I thought back to waking up on my kitchen floor with a bad taste in my mouth.  A disgruntled employee destroyed the old monitoring center?  Maybe someone had their own button pressed a few too many times and wanted payback.

&amp;nbsp;

“When you initiate a corrective action on one of our guests, the staff … encourage other guests to act on their behalf.  Given the nature of our guests, minimal encouragement is usually required.  When you first started, I blocked your ability to observe the corrective action directly.  This was not to hide the nature of your work, but to protect your mind as you grew into the position.  I believed then, and I still believe now, that you have the potential to join our organization in an executive role.  While the pay so far has been great, I believe you’ll find the fringe benefits at the executive level to be out of this world.  If I were a gambler, and I am, I would wager your condition for joining hinges on the current predicament of our newest guest.  I’ve activated the latest switch on your console if you prefer to remove all doubt.”

&amp;nbsp;

I knew where this was going, that the latest button would remove the pixelation.  I aimed the camera at the newest arrival. I pushed the latest button, and I saw my father.

&amp;nbsp;

“So here’s my offer, sport.  You agree to join the team, and I’ll let him go - just like that.  One day, you’ll learn how uncommon it is for me to make such an offer.  Our guests generally do not leave early, if at all.”

&amp;nbsp;

I didn’t have to think about it.  I just said, “Okay.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Splendid.  Let’s get the old chap on his way, shall we?  I’ll let you do the honors.”  I aimed the camera at the window and pressed the original button.  The gate swung wide, and the window itself opened.  Almost every face in the cafeteria turned toward the window.

&amp;nbsp;

“I think dear ol’ dad will need a hand.  Perhaps a volunteer will step forward, eh?”  The other pixelated prisoner stood up.   She walked over to my father and helped him to his feet, then whispered something in his ear.  He looked out the window, then looked back at her.  She nodded and guided him over.  He looked at the camera for a moment, then climbed out the window.  The screen went black, and a six hour countdown timer started.

&amp;nbsp;

“It’s time for you to do your part.  I gave you a few hours to take care of any personal matters.  I trust you’ll find a good home for Middy.  That adorable little asshole needs someone to look after him.  I suppose I shouldn’t have to tell you that breaking the terms of our agreement means I’ll have to bring both you and Shana here.  One last thing - it doesn’t matter how you choose to report for duty.  I trust you’ll select a reliable method. *Adieu.*”

&amp;nbsp;

The call disconnected.  I didn’t waste any time.  I coaxed Middy into a crate and took him over to Shana’s place.  I called her on the way to have her meet me there.  I told her I had to go into hiding for a while and that I’d reach out to her if I could.  When I got home, I maxed out my credit cards on Amazon orders for the two of them.  I’m not worried about the bills - I’m pretty sure I won’t need to think about money ever again.  I took the time to write up this last chapter because I didn’t want to leave you in the dark.  What can I say, I’ve taken a real shine to bringing the light.  Maybe I will be a good fit for the executive staff.

&amp;nbsp;

I live on the second floor of my building, which means traveling to my new job through the window won’t work.  I think I’ll go with the kitchen knife I used to open the computer boxes.  It’s pretty sharp, so it should do the trick.  Only thing left to do is draw a nice, hot bath.

&amp;nbsp;

If you’re reading this, and you decide to take a position as a remote corrections officer, you should know that I might be your new boss.  I promise I’ll go easy on you … to a point.  After all, everyone makes mistakes.  Fixing them is as easy as pushing a button."
piovbp,4,2021-09-05,Need advice | Venting,thebeachesonmars,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/piovbp/need_advice_venting/,"Hey everyone,

I know I'm definitely not the first and definitely won't be the last to get on this subreddit to complain. I'm genuinely at a loss here as to what I should do besides keep applying to jobs, and to keep leetcode grinding. A little bit of backstory, I'm a 20-year-old college graduate with a bachelor's in computer science. I'm not mentioning my age to get a kick out of my ego, but rather to point out although I received a degree at an early age I traded it off with no real developmental experience, internship, or the likes (By the way if you already haven't and you are a computer science student in university, do yourself a favor and apply apply apply!) About a month or two before I had my graduation I was applying to internships left and right and unfortunately wasn't able to find anything in time. When I graduated I continued the pattern, but with applying to jobs anywhere and everywhere I could find an application.

I was able to land a few interviews and different coding challenges which I failed miserably. This is where I started to learn about sites like leetcode, hackerrank and a few different platforms. I would put in a few hours each week continuing this process to no avail (I recognize a few hours is not nearly enough compared to the people who do questions on a day by day basis.) In about 3 days I will be closing in on 4 months since I’ve graduated. The impostor syndrome is 100% real, and I am starting to get sick of this all. About a week ago I received another Hackerrank interview from IBM’s Associate Developer Role (Backend and/or Full stack) and I passed all of the questions and test cases. Only to get an email today saying “unfortunately…” and you know the rest.

I’m practically grasping at straws changing up my resume once a week with no relevant experience. I need to work on more projects since my work experience isn’t enough and my algorithms and data structs are at an alright level. To be frank though I’m getting really tired of applying to positions and having no luck. I would appreciate any input anybody has, or if anyone else is/was in a similar spot and telling me what you guys did.

TLDR; I graduated early, but at the cost of no experience. I’m grinding leetcode, hackerrank, and still getting rejected. Need advice, motivation or some better plan than what I have been doing."

My friends in the same year as me have already started prepping to apply for internships next summer. I also want to get an internship, since I need the money and would like to learn the ropes. But right now I have nothing on the table, besides a newly opened Leetcode account. No experience, no GPA, no recommendations, nothing. 

My plan right now is to build my skills through Leetcode and some coding projects, and then start applying during Thanksgiving break. However, I'm concerned that most applications will have closed by then.

Is there anything that I can do to be a competitive applicant even as a freshman? Any advice is appreciated, thanks!

By the way, I've seen several events on the handshake page, like UCLA's E&amp;T FAIR. Are these career fairs really effective in making a connection?"

pispid,9,2021-09-06,Chemistry PhD Program--AMA,Luckylscx333,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/pispid/chemistry_phd_programama/,"Hello!

Only a year ago I was applying to chemistry PhD programs in the midst of the pandemic and virtual learning. I understand how stressful it can be, I suppose, both for people applying in their last year of their undergraduate (because of classes/extracurriculars and the busy undergrad life), or for those who are applying in a gap year (since you might feel a little lazier or more distanced from learning/being productive).

To give a little background about myself: I am entering a chemistry program this fall (incoming chemistry PhD student) at a top 10 institution for chemistry in the nation. I did not attend a top institution during my undergraduate, but rather a large public, state flagship university in my home state. It was a R1 school, but certainly not in the top 30s. Nevertheless, I am a first-gen college and PhD student, domestic (not international, so sorry, I don't know much about that). I had a decent GPA (in the \~3.7's). 

I did not take a gap year. I'm a student who entered straight after undergrad. **My philosophy was:** ***""I'll apply to only schools I actually care about and want to attend. If I don't make it, I'll continue researching at my undergraduate university or be a super TA or do something similar like that and try again the following year""*** **In my opinion, don't stress out about grad school apps TOO much!** Look: your life is more than just making grad school or not. There are benefits to not attending grad school straight away as well. Gap years give you a mental break, you can gain more experience, earn more money, have your freedom to relax or travel and do as you please, or even take the time to think through your life plans, as many people have quarter-life crises. If you go straight-away, that's cool, too, just remember it's a big change, since what people don't talk about that much is that **this can be a REALLY big adjustment**, not just because of the undergrad to grad student thing, but sometimes moving states or countries, going from virtual to in-person, trying to keep in touch with friends who've moved away and are now at med school or working 9 - 5 jobs everyday to those who might have families or are getting married. It's difficult! 

Going back to the focus on chemistry: I do not have any papers or publications at all. My research experiences were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As for the research I did with a chemistry professor, I only worked with her the summer after my sophomore year til COVID-19 hit that spring. I could hardly have done that much because everything shut down about the time I was finally used to the lab and ready to start my project. Something people don't always tell you: **research is slow, and it takes patience/time/effort.** Schools will understand COVID-19 was inevitable, and what they are looking for is you making the best of the situation. Although I could not continue to research in a lab due to restrictions on undergrad researchers, I instead found an opportunity to do some government internship (FDA). This wasn't what I wanted exactly, as the research was more focused on topics I didn't care as much about, but remember all experiences can be valuable, so don't discriminate. 

As for the application itself here are my major tips:

1) **Find yourself a mentor.** By ""mentor"" I mean anyone who has gone through the experience before whether it's an alum of your undergrad now a grad student somewhere else, a grad student at your undergrad who was, maybe your TA, or even grad students researching in your current lab, or at a school you're interested in. Professors and advisors can also be ""mentors"" but they're usually a bit more distanced from your experience because they attended decades earlier. This person does not have to be in your field. For instance, some of my academic professors were really supportive to me, as well as some grad student TAs I've had, even though they researched environmental or biochemistry, things I was not interested in.

2) **Take care of your mental health.** I really mean it. The app process can be super stressful, and it's important to talk to your close friends and family. If you need, get a therapist you can talk to. I'm telling you, this is crucial, because if your mental health is in jeopardy it's hard to write a convincing app.

3) **Be organized.** Make a spreadsheet on when deadlines are, which professors interest you at each school (make sure there are at least 2-3), what the requirements are, who you want to be your recommenders, what the locations of each school are, their stipends/cost of living, etc. Anything that is important to you, you need to organize because it's a lot of information to be looking through! I also advise hyperlinking important websites and being color-coordinated, so everything is in one folder or spreadsheet.

4) **GREs aren't the most important**, but if you need to take it, make sure you take it by September the year you apply. Also, note, you probably just need to score around or above average. It doesn't matter much, and the chem GRE isn't really required anywhere or necessary. Check if your schools need it because for me, it was a waste of $200 since none of my schools needed the GRE. Know the format of the GRE, and to do this, register early. When you register, they give you 2 full length exams that are autograded online. This helps a lot.

5a) **At some point, talk to your research advisor(s).** You need to ask them if they can write your LOR, and something else that is helpful is if you don't have a list of schools in mind, they definitely can recommend you a bunch. They are well-connected and know important names in their field, and related fields. During this meeting, take notes. Know the ""insider info"" on different schools' strengths and what is appealing about various P.I.s. This is very crucial. For instance, I was able to learn my school is very well-known for its focus on nanotech, abundance of interdisciplinary research/collaborations with national labs and other nearby universities. This was important when I wrote about 1) why this school? 2) why it is a good fit for me/why I am a good fit for taking advantage of what they have to offer?

5b) Talk to other people who can write letters of recommendation. Check if they want a draft, or answers to some questions. Often they may ask for these to assist them in writing the best letter for you. Make sure they actually feel confident in writing you a **GOOD** letter. Because a mediocre, generic one will be terrible and useless. Be sure to continually keep them in contact, remind them of which schools and fellowships you are applying for, and the deadlines. Later: keep them in the loop on the decisions of your schools when they come out, as well as the ultimate decision you make. Be sure to give them a thank you gift &amp; letter at the END of all the apps.

6) **Statements of purpose (SOPs)**. These are extremely important. 

The **statement of purpose** focuses on how you got into the research/what interested you into getting into where you are today? It also takes you to where you want to **go in the** **future**. You NEED to explain which groups you're interested in some portion of it, and why that specific university is the best for advancing your career/learning as a researcher. When you explain the research groups you're interested in, **DO NOT regurgitate what their research is.** Just write: ""The focus on biochemical synthesis of natural organic products found in herbs interests me most in Dr. Seuss's lab"", or something similar to that format. ""\[what interests you?\] and \[in whose lab\]""? As a bonus, how does that help advance your interests? Ex: I am interested in medicinal chemistry and would like to become  a medicinal chemist in the future. Somewhere, everything needs to tie together as a cohesive writing piece to convey to the reader on three key things 1) what sparked your interest? 2) why this university/these research advisors &amp; groups? 3) what your future plans are? Bonus: what broader impacts do you want to contribute to? (ex: renewable energy, cancer therapy, making science more accessible to underrepresented groups)? 

A **personal (history) statement** does a similar thing but **a focus on more of you as a person**. How has your personal experiences changed over time? What lessons have you learned? Focus a bit more on your personal history on how you got to the person today, interested in the research you're interested in. I can provide an example (completely fictional). For instance, if you had an experience where you learned about greenhouse emissions and became passionate on how these waste gases are problematic to climate change as a high schooler, and this led to you pursue XYZ research in ABC lab at your undergrad under the direction of Dr. \_\_\_\_\_, then elaborate on all of this. It needs to show your **personal traits** through the piece as well, such as if you're curious, you have leadership (maybe you pushed your local ACS chapter to fundraise money and donate it to some environmental chem intitiative, etc), proactive, independent, good at working in teams, etc. 

A **research statement** focuses more on each of your research experiences and how they lead you to the researcher you are today. Beware: do NOT regurgitate your resume. This piece should still be cohesive writing, like the two above statements, but they want you to elaborate a little more on what you did in each of the experiences. This is what they want to know 1) Some details on who/what/when/where/how? Notably, the PI name, what the research topic was, how long you researched there, and what you did? 2) What you learned from this research. They want to understand the challenges and the accomplishments you had. What skills did you gain? Soft skills are fine, too, such as if you went to present at a conference and gained some communication skills. Or if you worked in an interdisciplinary research team and gained a more diverse skillset and collaborative character from it. 3) Do not fill the statement up with needless details and jargon. Remember, the person reading this just needs to know the gist of the research you did and your perspective about it. They do not need a paper or report. They also have a resume and they have access to any papers you published! 

A **diversity statement** is kind of difficult, but basically, it focuses on the broader impacts and societal implications you want your research and graduate student career to have. Two aspects to consider: 1) how do you contribute to diversity? (ex: are you first-gen? Immigrant? Homeless? Racial underrepresented minority? LGBTQ+? Woman in science?) 2) How are you planning to expand DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion)? How so at your grad school? How so in your future? What have you done in your past (undergrad, high school, etc)? Did you go volunteer at a nearby impoverished middle school? Did you host a social network event with your ACS student chapter? Did you do science outreach? Did you try to create something for the local community? (for instance making hand sanitizer and distributing to local health care workers)? Did you join a DE&amp;I council?

With all statements, the focus is on the **WRITING.** It MUST be cohesive and easy to read. Remove any needless details and make sure it doesn't sound like an elaborated resume. Remember they also have your resume. You also don't need to sound like you are bragging or trying to teach the audience chemistry. That's not the point. The point is they want to know 1) YOU 2) why should they accept you? 3) how you write? Do you know how to write/communicate well? 4) why you're interested in their school and how they know making an investment in you is for the best? 5) Your future plans.

7) **Make sure to proofread many times,** get several perspectives, both from people who know about you as a person (close friend, etc), and from those who know you as a researcher/student (such as a professor, grad student, etc). Turn in by the deadline or earlier!

8) **Check out and apply to external fellowships.** Most places will have some for seniors/pre-grad students. It is important to try these out and don't miss the opportunity to apply prior to grad school because most, like NSF GRFP are more lenient towards undergrad seniors than to, let's say, 2nd year grad students, as they should be expected to know more and have a more advanced/cohesive research proposal. 

I don't know if I might have the best perspectives or be of much help but **AMA**. I know many people have anxieties, and I certainly did. You're not alone. Feel free to ask me anything about the application process to moving and getting settled. I'm currently going through orientation and starting my schooling so that is as far as my experience."

I got into only 1 US uni, and 1 EU uni. Decided against going this year thanks to covid, a decent job and a much stronger profile (3 publications as opposed to 0). I want an honest opinion regarding my school choices, and some safer options that I should consider.

Area of interests - Looking to specialize in machine learning. Specifically interested in applied machine learning and research in the following domains

* Trustworthiness, robustness and interpretability of ML models 
* DL under heavy data constraints
* Applied AI in medical diagnostics, autonomous vehicles and other safety critical applications

Profile:

* [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) CS from a T2/T3 university in Bengaluru, India. GPA: 9.43/10.0
* Current role - dev in one of the big 5 tech companies on a Platform team. Working on systems that host machine learning models, but I'm not directly involved in ML work
* GRE: 170Q/164V/5.0AW
* TOEFL: 118
* Publications : 3 - DL for speech enhancement @ Interspeech21, an ICCV 21 workshop paper, and an IEEE transactions (journal) acceptance
* Prior experiences &amp; workex - 2 projects with a big chip manufacturer (one in ML, another in algorithms for AR/VR), internship at the same on few-shot learning which lead to the ICCV workshop paper, 3 month internship at my current company last summer. Intern at an ed-tech startup
* LoRs - 2 research advisors at the aformentioned chip manufacturer. 2 former profs (now at different universities) that I took classes under and worked with on the IEEE transactions journal paper. Another possibility is my final year project guide (interspeech paper), but I didn't take any classes under him, and he said he would require me to draft the LoR - something I'm not too comfortable with doing.

Universities I'm 100% applying to (R indicates a repeat from last year):

* CMU  (R)
* UMich  (R - probably the place I'm most keen on going to atm)
* Georgia Tech (R)
* UIUC
* UC San Diego (R)
* USC (R - I got admission here last year for the MS program)
* UT Austin (R - The value for money for the MS program is incredible)

I'm considering applying to Berkley as well, but I fear I have too many ambitious schools on this list already, especially given how I was told last year that I would fare decently well. It was a very demoralizing experience to say the least.

If anyone has any suggestions on good places to add to this list for either an MS or MS+PhD, where relevant research is happening, please let me know. An honest evaluation of my chances would be greatly appreciated. Also, does being a second time applicant to a lot of these places hurt my chances?

TIA!"

pitv6x,0,2021-09-06,PSA: Entry level SWE is oversaturated,throwdwayz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pitv6x/psa_entry_level_swe_is_oversaturated/,"This isn't meant as a gatekeeping post, but more of a reality wake up call to the potential career switchers who have heard that ""tech is in deManD."" I'll let you in on the secret: *it's not.*

**The general consensus here:** junior (i.e., entry level) engineers aren't wanted because it's a hassle to train them and have them leave after a year so that they can get a salary bump. (Honestly, I don't blame them. In fact that's what I did when I started out 7 years ago, but this is part of the reason why juniors aren't in high demand.)  Not only are junior engineers not in demand, there's also a shit ton of people applying to these positions: CS graduates, engineering graduates, people from bootcamps, etc. Increasing the sample size doesn't only increase the number of crap applicants, it also increases the number of competitive ones too, meaning that you have more competitive competition.

Maybe some of you graduates will finally realize now why your resume is fine, but you're not catching any interviews. Your resume isn't necessarily bad, it's just that your situation is a reflection of the increasing competition in your field. I'm now a senior engineer at some big n company, and I must say that the amount of survivorship bias in this sub from the mid- and senior-level engineers is unreal. It's now way harder for current CS grads, and anyone else at entry level, to get a job now than 3 or 5 years ago. 3 years ago, having one internship, projects, and being able to do Leetcode mediums meant that you were potentially a great applicant. Now it's not enough.

Furthermore, if you're thinking about career switching because you saw some of the starting salaries given at a FAANG, **stop and** ***consider*** **that** most people (including you) most likely won't get into big tech. **6 figure starting salaries aren't the norm**, so don't treat the best case salary as the average/expected salary for you.

Again, this isn't meant as a gatekeeping post. If you like software, study it well and get a job in it. Just be aware that the 2021 version of the game is much harder than the 2018 version. Bosses got harder, there's more grinding to hit the next level, drop rates got nuked, etc. So don't just blindly think that the grass is greener on the other side and switch to software. It's honestly a disservice to tell career switchers that this field is in demand, because the only place that career switchers can get a job in is entry level, which is the least in demand part of tech.

Some applying for jobs, some for masters, meanwhile I am sitting at home playing games as officially I don't have any work to do other than college. I want to do a master's too but got an 8 months internship in Switzerland coming up in Jan for the final semester and because of that, I can't even apply for the fall 22 batch because I believe it might cause trouble with my internship. Moreover, I am stuck at home because of the covid situation and online classes. I want to do projects and I am good at coding but whenever I try to do it alone I procrastinate and drop it. Being an introvert, I don't have a lot of friends to ask for help let alone relationships(like ever). Most of them are gamers who are crystal-focused on getting jobs. 

And whenever I look at the broader picture of why I am going for masters or am I actually interested in coding, I can't justify it other than money because I am from a business family so I believe I don't understand its importance(No, I am a not spoiled brat). What was your motivation for doing masters or post-graduation? Whenever I read articles of big elites in computing fields, like bug hunters or data analysts, I really want to become like them but I can't bring myself to work hard for that dream. Maybe I am attracted to fame.

This is why I am under constant guilt feeling of underperforming than what I am capable of which from extraordinary situations I know about my capabilities. 

I really don't know what I want to do in life. I certainly don't wanna spend my 20s in a cubicle for earning only a living. I really would like to start doing something that might help some bigger cause and leave my selfish desires behind.

Since Open Distance Learning started 1 year 6 months ago, I haven’t gone out much as I’m studying at home. I no longer socialize with people except my family, and the longer this continues, the more I don’t feel like talking to people. I feel like it’s draining. So I’m starting to change from an ambivert into an introvert. 

Not just that, I’ve lost the motivation to do anything. I still managed to achieve high GPA on my recent exam, almost 3.9, yet I don’t gain much satisfaction in living my life. I feel like I’m not even actually living. I see people on social media getting their lives in order, some of them even opened their own businesses while studying, yet I’m doing nothing at home (I’m on my semester break). My semester break will end in a month, yet I feel like I’ve been missing out a lot of things, but I can’t seem to get myself to do anything besides sleeping and watching Netflix. 

Next semester will be the last semester before I start my internship and work. Thinking about it makes me feel even worse. I feel like I’m just walking, while others are leaving on a plane. I feel like a loser. I was once a writer, I wrote poetry, but now, that part of mine too, is gone. Words used to flow inside my easily, yet now I can’t get myself to write anything.

I'm a non-traditional student in the sense that I'm applying with an undergrad in biology but with extensive CS coursework (discrete, OOP, DS&amp;A). I have no professional or internship experience in tech so I mainly want to use this master's as a springboard to break into the industry.

Compared to online master's programs like r/OMSCS that costs only 8k, Cornell's on-campus program costs around 80-90k (including room and board). I'm not so sure if that price tag is worth it in my situation but also considering Cornell is pretty prestigious, I feel like it would help me get to land a great job after I graduate.

Would it be more beneficial for me to attend the on-campus program, despite the increased cost, or would it not make much of a difference in terms of networking, job/internship opportunities, and interacting with faculty/classmates?  Would love to hear from people who are actually in the program or tried applying."

I'm already (theoretically) skilled for this, have a couple of years of experience in several IT-related jobs, a college degree, and courses too, although I don't consider myself a senior yet. Nonetheless, it's being extremely hard for me to get any job even if I aim for junior or intern positions. 

Yes, there is a ""high demand"" of workers in modern fields, but they want Seniors who can take care of many tasks as possible and automate the rest, they don't want juniors with 1-3 years of experience and of course, they don't want people who just graduate either. It is extremely saturated with juniors in tech fields, even if I see job ads here and there, recruiters told me that they receive over 300 applications when they just have to fill one position. Also, many of these jobs are getting more and more automatized by the day so they will always require fewer juniors and a bit more seniors.

All these internet courses to ""develop skills for the modern market"" will leave you at the end of a loooooooong queue of unemployment. **I'm sure people who teach in those courses are people who graduated from the subject as well but couldn't find any job**. It's just like a Ponzi scheme if you think about it, modern education focused on employability is a product and a scam."

I'm only mentioning all of this because I do have experience working with computer science and I'm not going into this industry completely blind.

I went back to my university and enrolled in their Fundamentals of Computing certification. This certification includes four classes I feel cover the basics of getting started in IT:

Computers and Programming   
Software Engineering and Web Development   
Data Science Skills   
Cybersecurity Skills

I admit that I don't exactly know what I can do with this certification after I'm done. What jobs should I realistically be looking to apply for after I receive this certification?"

A little background on me, I finished As last year and got a RP of 83.75. I applied and have been offered a course, but on hindsight I felt that I made the decision of accepting the course pretty hastily given the tight application period back then and am planning to re-apply next year. Currently interested in Business Analytics since I can use the 2.5 bonus points if I intend to select it as my first choice, not sure if can get in but can just try lor, but still have a few more queries on the course and would appreciate any answers!

1. I understand that BZA is under SoC. I'm someone who's not particularly passionate about coding but can still learn it throughout the course. I am more interested towards the data analysis portion of the course. I don't think I'd like DSA from CHS since I don't think I'd enjoy/do well in uni maths. So, just wanted to get to know how coding-heavy BZA modules are since I also heard that BZA are not as coding-heavy compared to CE or CS.
2. For those who have graduated this course/have done internships while studying this course, what are your experiences like in the workplace and what are the particular jobs that are open to BZA graduates?
3. How is the course and workload like? I mean it's still computing so I guess it might be quite time-consuming and the workload should be about there also.
4. What are the computing languages that are used in BZA? 
5. What do you think are traits that a student in BZA/graduate in BZA should have that can help in this course?"

3 letters from professors (from two schools) I did research/projects under supervision. They know me well and have praised my work to me.

1.5-year ongoing research internship, 2 semesters TA experience, and 3 summers worth of industry internships.

**Publications** 

1 first-author demo presentation at a reputable IEEE conference.

2 first-author papers under review at *top*-top conferences in CS. One is more likely to get in than rejected (based on the reviews we got); the other is imo better work. Can swing both ways. Both will be decided before applying.

Area: security/privacy, crypto, and some ML. I can articulate clearly what specific issues I want to work on and why.

Sub 3.0 GPA. No internships. No relatives working in the industry to hook it up. No letters of recommendation. No crazy cool personal projects to show off.

Today I just accepted a full time offer at a large engineering company for $80k a year after applying to companies like a maniac since my graduation and interviewing with 6 companies that basically told me to fuck off. I don't know who needed to see this, but I know that many times when I was applying to jobs endlessly and getting either ghosted forever or rejected with no feedback, and I would check out this subreddit I would see people going through the same thing...except they had 2 internships or coops under their belts, &gt;3.0 GPA, sometimes &gt;3.5, and had awesome personal projects as well. It made me think that I would never ever be able to get an engineering job, I mean if they can't, how the fuck will I??? It got so bad I started exploring using my engineering degree to go into some accounting/finance job since they pay decent...phew!

So alas, before I depart this subreddit, I wanted to leave what I hope is a glimmer of hope in a sea of stress. Some people will get a job right away, some people will have to send out 100 applications...some people, just by bad luck, might have to work even harder than that. But it WILL work out at the end.

As for me, I would say what helped me the most is the attention and work I put to my resume, cover letter(s), as well as the interview itself. Bad news to everyone that is in a position like mine, we gonna have to overcompensate for our shit grades! So I spend weeks, maybe months, continuously updating and polishing my resumes, practicing my presentation and interview skills, practicing the CAD and coding software I used in college to make sure I remain proficient at them, and just overall interview after interview, learning to emphasize my soft skills that set me apart, eg fast learner, great communicator, yada yada, rather than tryna go resume vs resume with the other candidates that have like 2 internships and hella bulletpoints...nah.

So good luck to everyone still job searching. It's depressing and unfair as shit, but I promise if you keep going the stars will eventually align and you will be so fucking proud that you did not give up earlier! 🤟🏼"

Hello!

TLDR:  Interned at Big 4 - ERP Consulting, Now struggling to write good bullet points for my CV. Please help me with how to sell it!

I  recently finished an internship in a Big 4. I was working in the ERP  Consulting team. I had no other option, and I chose a  brand name over a good job description at some fintech startup. As I had expected the job of ERP Consulting is extremely technical and specific.  It was hard for me to contribute much, I wasn't given much work given my complete inexperience and lack of interest in the field (Yes, I was pretty open about my interest in Finance with my manager).

In short **my work** involved: Reviewing FS/TS documents submitted by the SI (I read through  150+ FS/TS documents to find discrepancies and submitted comments on them to my manager), Helping with Techno-commercial evaluation for a big project (performed QCBS evaluation/ manpower evaluation - menial grunt work). Created an excel Project Implementation dashboard using which the upper management of the client could see the progress of their ""Digital  Transformation"". From the experience, I gained knowledge about the SAP  functional modules (overview only) and bid process management for such large scale end-to-end projects.

Now,  I am gonna be applying for jobs (Finance roles in IBs/maybe some PM  roles- entry-level), and I don't know how to present the above work as something respectable, and how to demonstrate **quantifiable impact** in my resume.  If someone here has done/seen something similar, please help me sell this on my resume - what bullet points should I write in my **resume.** Give examples if possible - Thanks a tonne!"

* Training happens each Saturday from Nov 6 -&gt; Jan 8

* Need at least 2 teachers to start a class

**Perks:**

* Don't need previous Android experience
* Looks great on resume
* Great alternative to an internship (if you haven't snagged one yet)
* Master an in-demand skill

•What cert should I get next?

•I currently have a job fair going on in my college which has mostly development and analyst jobs. Should I apply for those? I mean is experience in those fields going to help my career or should I focus on getting very specific security jobs.

Whats the best advice you can give?
How to land internships and what to do with a foot in the door?
How did you prepare for the interviews?
What kind of finance related knowledge is necessary?
Where do you see your advantage in comparison to a non-stem applicant/colleague?
How does the networking differ from people coming from a finance environment?

I have some (very basic) skills in HTML/CSS and Python, but love the creative and problem solving aspects of coding.

In May I accepted a CAD tech position at a MEP firm. The firm has been mentoring me for Electrical Engineering and plan on hiring me as a EE once I graduate. I really enjoy the firm and the work environment is kind of ideal. 

However, I have a couple of worries. For one I am worried that I have not really explored my interests very far and am just jumping at the first opportunity that came my way. Another worry I have is that I will be taken advantage of, salary wise. I have had a few different guys tell me to watch out for internships turning into jobs because they feel they can hire you at a discount due to loyalty. 

Should I continue to apply to different places in hopes of getting an offer so I can leverage my wage in the future? I don’t want to come across as greedy but I also don’t want to get taken advantage of. 

Any advice is much appreciated! Thanks"

I have sent out about 500+ applications since February 2021. Sorry I don't have a fancy chart like many people have posted in the past but many of these applications were no response. about 25 or so replied, interviewed with 15, went onto a second interview with about 8, 3rd interview with 4 and ghosted from 3. Until I finally got an offer from the 4th as a project engineer.

Throughout these past 7 months I felt very nervous/discouraged that I would not land a job as an engineer due to my low GPA and lack of internships. I applied to numerous companies and received many ""sorry but your application was not selected"" messages. But I encourage everyone in my same position to just keep applying because it really only takes one company to give you a chance.

I applied through Indeed. Handshake, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn. I used cover letters for many jobs that seemed really interesting to me and that had an option to add one. I only had one cover letter and just changed a few things depending on the company. I also added a list of professional references from my supervisor from my parting job. (Not sure if it helped or not). In addition to this I didn't include my GPA and to be honest only 33% of the time I was asked what my GPA was.

If by any miracle I heard back from a company I would make a google document summarizing the About us page on their website, the job description and requirements, as well as any question I had based on the job or from something I found on their website. I would then study the google doc and practiced incorporating this information onto general questions I have been asked in previous interviews to help show why I would be a great candidate for the role.

Another thing that really helped me land a job or move on to another round of interviews was being energetic and or excited. So trying not to sound monotone or uninterested. You want to show the company you want to work there and that you can get a long with the rest of the employees so try to show character don't be timid and/or shy.

So good luck to everyone during their job search, continue to push applications out there and really study the company before an interview, don't feel discouraged just keep trying."
pjdai0,2,2021-09-06,Should I quit or try to learn everything on the job?,Parapurp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pjdai0/should_i_quit_or_try_to_learn_everything_on_the/,"I started at a \~defense company about 5 weeks ago as a developer. I'm straight out of college, but I didn't get a computer science degree - I worked on some indie games and did light coding here and there - nothing intense. I had an internship where I only coded in SQL for databases, everything else was using tools like grafana for visualization, no actual front end development. I put those experiences on my resume and somehow I got offered this position (initially they were going to pass me up and changed their minds). Well, everything I was worried about is happening. I'm expected to know a lot more than I do - react, node, JS which I don't know a lot of, and a lot about electronic states, protocols, command and control systems, typescript interfaces... I've been given a task and I'm already lost and don't know where to start. In my free time on weekends/ evenings, I've been taking online courses to get some knowledge about the libraries and languages but these courses will take months to complete the projects and be dangerous to build a professional platform on a small team like expected. I'm having to learn web dev and cs fundamentals but also a lot related to electronics in defense.

So basically the sprint ends in 2.5 weeks and I don't think I can realistically meet the requirements. I don't really know what to do - if I ask a team member for help, I'll probably need more than just debugging some code... and I'm sure I will look incompetent. I'm considering finding a job that is less complicated and maybe building my way back up to actually be competent, then looking for another front end dev job when I actually know what I am doing. At this point I just don't know if I can handle this. What would make sense in my situation?"

Recent CS grad is designing an experiment to:

* See if he can train himself into a mathematical problem solving wizard
* Measure how much improvement on  \^ affects his algorithmic abilities

Let me know what you think of the procedure and what your predictions are!

&amp;#x200B;

**Background (optional)**

I'm a recent CS grad who's been lucky enough to snag a software engineering gig with long term job security and excellent work-life balance. I'd like to use the downtime to pursue a long time personal goal -- upskilling my mediocre mathematical problem solving ability (think the type tested on the [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.imo-official.org/) (aka IMO), [Putnam](https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/putnam-competition) exam, etc).

I went to a middle school filled with these kinds of people, but quickly realized I was *not* on the same level. However, the experience got me extremely interested in figuring out what makes them tick and more importantly, if that ability could be replicated by a  ""normal"" (i.e. non-prodigy) person.

Popular opinions seem to be split along the lines of the nature vs. nurture debate; casual observers often believe that these people are beasts of a difference species (e.g. [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26468248)) while those that actually have experience see it as a fully trainable skillset (e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/kraymq/how_impressive_is_being_an_imo_international/gi8whbp?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)).

All in all, I hope that my personal ""experiment"" (air quotes because n = 1 is in no way a representative sample) can offer a data point on the debate as well as shed some light on the extent to which these problem solving skills are transferable across domains (math contests -&gt; programming contests in this case).

&amp;#x200B;

**Prior Knowledge**

In the interest of full disclosure, here's an overview of everything I've ever done math / CS related.

* Middle school
   * I was a national level chess player (FIDE: 2100+). I'm including this because some people think it helps with math, but I have not found this to be the case. At best I have a slightly better memory than non-chess players (from having memorized tons of [opening theory](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory)) and can visualize things in my head a little clearer (due to intensive board visualization training like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8_Rt_zW7Ys)). However, the focus on memorization + pattern recognition from my chess days has probably hurt my problem solving skills overall -- I'm not good at being mathematically ""creative"".
* High school
   * I never took geometry (big mistake)
   * I took:
      * [AP Calculus BC](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-calculus-bc) (score: 5/5)
      * [IB Mathematics HL](https://www.ibo.org/globalassets/publications/recognition/5_mathhl.pdf) (score: 6/7)
      * [IB Computer Science SL](https://www.ibo.org/globalassets/publications/recognition/4_computersl.pdf) (score: 5/7)
   * I never did any math / programming competitions.
   * With the exception of basic induction in IB Math HL, I had no exposure to proofs
      * [This](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/930805/788989) was probably the hardest induction problem in the class
* College
   * [MATH 241](https://www-math.umd.edu/offered-courses/373-math-241-calculus-iii.html) (score: A) -- multivariable calculus for engineers
   * [MATH 461](https://www-math.umd.edu/undergraduate/departmental-course-pages/offered-courses/403-math-461-linear-algebra-for-scientists-and-engineers.html) (score: A) -- linear algebra for engineers
   * [STAT 400](https://www-math.umd.edu/offered-courses/412-stat-400-applied-probability-and-statistics-i.html) (score: A) -- probability &amp; statistics for engineers
   * [MATH 456](https://www-math.umd.edu/undergraduate/departmental-course-pages/offered-courses/402-math-456-cryptology.html) (score: A) -- cryptography for people with limited math background
   * [MATH 424](https://www-math.umd.edu/undergraduate/departmental-course-pages/offered-courses/393-math-424-introduction-to-mathematical-finance.html) (score: A) -- intro mathematical finance for people with limited math background
   * [MATH 406](https://www-math.umd.edu/undergraduate/departmental-course-pages/offered-courses/386-math-406-introduction-to-number-theory.html) (score: A)
      * This was a proof-based based number theory class. However, I remember very very little of it now (mostly just the modular arithmetic rules that you learn in discrete math). I'd say that this marginally improved my problem solving skills, but not by much (since I forgot everything).
   * [MATH 475](https://www-math.umd.edu/undergraduate/departmental-course-pages/offered-courses/408-math-475-combinatorics-and-graph-theory.html) (score: A-)
      * This was a proof-based combinatorics + graph theory class taught by a professor who happened to be a former IMO [silver medalist](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=4257). Due to the way he structured the class -- short theory lessons followed by challenging problems -- my problem solving skills improved dramatically. However, I've forgotten many of the theorems + techniques since then.
   * [CMSC 250](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2019/cmsc250-020X/) (score: A) -- discrete math for CS majors (much easier than math major version)
   * [CMSC 351](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2021/cmsc351-0201/) (score: A)
      * This was a typical proof-based algorithms course where we learned sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, and how to solve summations + recurrences. However, homework / exam problems were usually identical to things covered in lecture so I wouldn't say that this class really helped my problem solving skills.
   * I didn't prepare for or participate in any math / programming competitions
   * Over the course of my internship + job search, I grinded most of the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems on this [list](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/). Although this gave me a decent grasp over common interview patterns (e.g. dfs, bfs, dynamic programming, sliding window), I'm still not good at solving problems that I haven't previously seen (even if they are solvable using the above patterns).

&amp;#x200B;

**Methodology**

*Baseline*

* Take a past [AMC12](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AMC_12) exam under contest conditions
   * This will measure my problem solving proficiency without any contest-specific training.
* Do 4 LeetCode [weekly contests](https://leetcode.com/contest/). Compute the average rating performance across the contests.
   * This seems like a good number to account for variations in difficulty between different contests.
* Do 4 Codeforces [Div2 contests](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/94468). Compute the average rating performance across the contests.
* Do as many [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems as I can without looking up algorithms or math concepts
   * This should serve as a measure of how much advanced math knowledge I have. It's my understanding that after the first 50 problems or so, Project Euler problems start requiring some pretty esoteric combinatorics / graph theory / number theory knowledge to solve efficiently (correct me if I'm off base here). Therefore, my progress on Project Euler should serve as a good proxy for how much advanced knowledge I've accumulated.

*Phase I*

In this phase, I'll plow through the Art of Problem Solving [curriculum](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/list/aops-curriculum) and keep grinding AMC12 problems until I achieve a score that would have comfortably ""qualified"" me for the [AIME](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/American_Invitational_Mathematics_Examination) exam (if I were still in high school). NOTE: throughout this time period, I will not do any algorithmic problem solving; if I need to interview + switch jobs, I will only re-solve the problems on this [list](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) (since I've already done them before).

Once I can qualify for the AIME, I'll take a month off to recompute my baseline (excluding the AMC12 mock test). That is, I will do 4 more LeetCode weekly contests + Codeforces Div2 contests and solve as many Project Euler problems as I can (again without looking up any algorithms or math concepts).

*Phase II*

This phase will be similar to phase I.

However, the goal is to qualify for the [USAMO](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad) before recomputing the baseline.

*Phase III*

In this phase, I will attempt to get a high enough score on the [IMO](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/International_Mathematical_Olympiad) such that if I were a high school competitor, I would receive a bronze medal (or better). Note that the goal -- medalling on the IMO rather than ""qualifying"" for it as a member of team USA -- is a little different than in prior phases. This is fully intentional.

Due to the density of mathematical talent in the US and the fact that each country can only send 6 kids to the IMO regardless of national population, it is apparently harder to make team USA than to score a medal at the IMO (see [here](https://qr.ae/pGZGXQ) for details). Therefore, my definition of success is slightly different here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Judging failure**

Since success is easy to judge objectively in each phase (I can just check if the score on that phase's mock test &gt;= published threshold), assessing failure is more important. Currently, I'm thinking that *I fail the challenge if I spend more than 2 calendar years on any one phase*, but I'm open to suggestions. My rationale for this failure criterion is making the challenge time-bound will add a sense of urgency similar to what high school competitors face (e.g. ""I only have 4 years to make it"").

&amp;#x200B;

**Predictions**

Let me know what you expect to happen!

Do you think I'll make it all the way? Will I cap out in the middle? Will I get better at LC / CF?

Suggestions / changes / additional metrics you'd like to see me collect are highly appreciated."

I realized this year that I actually really like the business world. I worked at a nonprofit over the summer that worked with a lot of small businesses and I kinda realized consulting is something I really, genuinely, want to pursue.

So far though, I’ve been rejected from all the consulting/business clubs I’ve applied for, and it’s really discouraging. Very few other business clubs have their apps still open so I’m still going to try and apply, but this whole process of applying to clubs has got my heart in the gutter. As a sophomore who had to focus on working practically full time last year for my family’s shop, I had to sacrifice moving to Berkeley, clubs and extracurriculars, so I guess my resume isn’t as amazing as other applicants. I know I still have time to make connections and build my resume, but a lot of the internships I’m looking at want leadership positions, and since I haven’t joined a club, I feel like it’s harder to convey that skill set. Applying to Haas feels even more heart wrenching. I have a 3.56 GPA, which I worked super hard for considering covid and my responsibilities at home. I feel like if I can’t make it into a single consulting club, how the hell am I gonna make it into haas? I know I can get into the consulting world as an Econ major, but I don’t even know which classes or clubs to take in order to go down that route since Econ is such a diverse major (any advice from Econ majors is a huge help btw :))

Even worse: I’m homesick. I live in LA where the Latino community is super strong. I’m the first born child of immigrants who grew up in a three generational home with extended family and pets and shit (literally imagine the family from Coco). I miss coming home to warm hugs and my giant ass loud family playing loteria every Saturday night. I miss my dogs coming to greet me every time I walk through the front gate. I miss my grandma blasting telenovelas from her room. Whenever I call back home though, I just feel worse. As the first in the family to go to college, I feel pained when I complain to my parents who sacrificed so much to get me here. We both see Cal as a blessing, but I guess it’s just been really hard for me to leave such a strong community and to have no one familiar to seek guidance from. Furthermore, I’m having personal internal conflicts with my relationship with the Catholic Church, especially as a Latina, which used to give me a space of comfort, but ever since I’ve come out as bi, I feel like I don’t even have that clutch to lean on. Even thinking about that can of worms gives me a headache. 

TL;DR: I’ve barely been here in person for about 3 weeks and I already feel super lost, alone, and confused. I miss my cultural community, and feel super behind my peers in the professional world. Ive gotten to the point where even thinking about it all makes me cry and physically break down haha. I know these things take time and I just need to get used to this, but it’s kinda hard to keep it bottled in, so I decided to scream into the void that is Reddit lol.

Now don’t mind me, I’m gonna binge watch the shrek movies to calm myself down. Thanks for reading if u did &lt;3"

I'm a junior with an internship under my belt, probably got through the worst semester of my degree (one more might rival it) and also learned a lot from my internship about what I want.

In my first 2 years I was doing a lot of LC, Advent of Code, etc. as well as side projects. I would say a good majority of easy questions I got a reasonably efficient answer within a reasonable amount of time. However, mediums really give me trouble still. 

I'm kind of at a fork in the road, I'm okay doing LC now and will have to slam it out in my senior year for prep, but realistically I loathe the idea of having to LC in my 30s, 40s, and onward to get decent positions. I like the more practical approach but to be honest, based on my internship experience, it seems like focusing on that may end me up at a boring mediocre position. Is it still possible to realistically make a good salary at a good company without grinding like this? 

I wouldn't mind spending an hour or 2 over my weekend learning a new language (did so for this internship, was fine) or brushing up on something but I'm really going to go insane if my career requires me to grind the way I have up to this point constantly."
pjgqu6,15,2021-09-07,Need some advice for higher studies in Canada or USA from people who went there for masters.,curiouspicklenot,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/pjgqu6/need_some_advice_for_higher_studies_in_canada_or/,"  About me : I'm 4th year student in electronics and telecommunication engineering from tier 2 or 2.5 college and want to pursue career in software engineering. I plan to get some experience before applying for masters but would mostly get jobs in IT service based companies due to not so outstanding profile (8.5 cgpa 1-2 projects and no internship ) an companies mostly preferring cs and it guys.



1. What factors affected your decision while choosing a country for masters?

2. Problems you faced during studies, during job hunting , visa related issues.

3. Any regrets after choosing the country ?

 (For Canada specifically ⏬)

4. is 3 year pgwp possible with a 16 month MEng course .

5. Meng vs MSc 

6. Average time after which I can apply for PR 

7. Is 1 year masters recommended if I plan to stay and get pr 

8. Getting software engineering roles after doing Masters in electrical and computer Engineering or is it possible to get masters in computer science and forced to do a few foundation courses

9. Should I go right after my bachelor's considering that a lot of people online say Canadian recruiters don't value indian experience much and I would just be wasting time in Indian job and instead I would be  getting a head start if I go directly?

10. Is money saved in Canada enough for me to be able to send some money back home and pay educational loan within 2-3 years?

11. Obtaining Tn visa after getting Canadian citizenship to work in usa ?

12. Hurdles in visiting India if someone has gotten Canadian citizenship or getting indian citizenship back due to some unforeseen circumstances.

(For USA⏬)

11. Does everyone always get H1B within the 1st 3 years and what is the plan when you don't get H1B during 1st 3 years?

12. If H1B can only be valid for upto 6 years , how are people staying without green card which supposedly takes 100 years for indians.

13. Canadian salaries are half of that offered in USA (from what I've read online, could be an exaggerated estimate) so you get to save more money and send more money back in india from USA ?

Also include important stuff that I missed out.

Thank you."

I'm developing a preventive maintenance tool for my internship. Basically, I need to collect machine data, store this data in a DB and then visualize this data. Based on this data the program must send a notification when maintenance is necessary.  

I would like to host my own cloud server on OwnCloud on a Raspberry Pi on which the database can run. A desktop application (windows form) must then have access to this database, and use this data to create plots, graphs and predictions. 

Does any one of you have experience in this? Or any advice/ideas?

I want to keep costs low, so that's why I want to try hosting my own cloud server first before going to AWS or something similar. 

Any advice is much appreciated!"

pjityn,5,2021-09-07,"I quit college to work full time for a company I used to love being a part of, only to get underpaid with no way out.",Roll-Guilty,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pjityn/i_quit_college_to_work_full_time_for_a_company_i/,"I’ve been working here for three years, initially started as a intern. I am good at what I do, and the company is relatively small so everyone just knows each other, so I soon became known as one of the top performers, even as an intern. As a broke college student who grew up poor and just got a taste of money and independence, I took the full-time job offer.

We all got along great, the higher ups and the CEO himself really liked me, the vibe at work was great, and I was always told that they had some sort of a “plan for me”, whenever I would ask about my future (I was worried sometimes because there was a time, where A LOT of employees were just leaving or getting laid off). 

However, despite being really good and showing results (and being told so), I was never offered a better position. There was a time, where we went through four different managers in one year alone, yet no one thought of offering me the position despite my knowledge and experience. I feel like I did everything right. I networked, I never said no to hanging out after work or parties we had, I worked overtime, I worked for free sometimes, I helped others in my team meet their goals and I was always available.

At the start of this year, the CEO wanted to start producing short video content for their social media. I offered to do it, since that’s something that interests me. I first had help from an intern who got offered a salary and said it was too low and quit. Then I had to learn how to film and edit videos in one week before our next scheduled post. In a few weeks I was producing content good enough that the CEO wanted me to keep doing it. But instead of a raise or a bonus, he said he was going to pay me the same amount of money as I was already making, but he’s going to cut my work in the office by half.

I feel like this is a scam. I am now working MORE than I was before, my office hours aren’t really cut by half because I constantly have to do other people’s work because there’s basically only me and my manager now that everyone’s on vacation or laid off. Plus the work I have to put into creating content.

I tried to argue my situation, but HR just said “nah, you have enough time, you’re just bad at time management”.

I can’t leave and find a different job because I got too comfortable at the beginning and quit college, because salary was good for a college student who grew up poor. Now I have no money to go back to college and if I quit, my current position isn’t good enough to help me land better jobs, so I would just be stuck in retail.

In my country, we're also preparing for another lockdown, so quitting now would be insane.

What can a person in my situation do?"

pjk53w,5,2021-09-07,Common questions about the wam and getting a job part!,Rndoman,unsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/unsw/comments/pjk53w/common_questions_about_the_wam_and_getting_a_job/,"I have received a ton of msgs about having low wam and getting a job.

Lets get it done once and for all.

**1) I recommend anyone who have a bachelors but no job to go to do IT support.**

2) 2 unpaid internships max, then graduate job (not graduate program)

3) Societies really do count (source: me, cofounded **3** societies)

4) employers love humour (one said but you have to have good eye sight, looked to the right and found that my societies activity was the fun they were looking for)

5) some companies do psychometrics, don't discount them, Ipsos gave me the selective school exam style questions, Nielsen gave me a **3** hours stats test),

6) I have heard of people applying for high paid jobs and / or complaining they have applied for 100 or more and still no reply. First reduce your pay expectations. Second, apply for more jobs 100 is nothing, centrelink will probably grill you for that effort. Also you should not have any limiting factors in the seek searches, In SQL there is a thing call: Select \* from Table, the \* will return all the results, there you are, you are meant to apply for all the jobs available not just 100. I setup a jobs reminder for 9am every day so I get about 10 recent jobs in IT everyday, takes about 5mins to complete and that's good for centrelink as well.

7) Seek has a new purple feature that tells you if you are a highly likely candidate.

8) \*Personally I like to deliver the company a portfolio, like in design. So I would spend 5 dollars on colour paper per job interview, to show what I can do, where I fit in, and common ground and other stuff interesting. My interviews usually last at least 15mins, with the longest at Nielsen - 3 hour test. The portfolio allows you to remember how much you know the company and gives me time to extend those lame 5 min interviews.

9) Don't be afraid of the market, it is ok to switch jobs or cancel interviews or quit, I made the mistake of accepting the first offer twice, even with 2 other offers, in the same week. It is annoying but its over. I have cancelled interviews before please be careful not  to stretch your limits. Work is a marathon and your career will last decades, take it easy.

10) Start low, A lot of banks have a customer service department or call centres after 2 years you can request for other departments, I have two friends who started in customer service now one is an analyst the other HR

n) I will add more later"

I am deeply questioning my decision and whether or not I should continue on this path. I don't want to get existential....but i'm going to get fackin existential. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a human. I promise. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have X amount of years left on this planet (x = undefined)

&amp;#x200B;

I am really deeply wondering if spending months, years, hours upon hours always playing catch-up with various technologies and languages and frameworks and tools all to be some coder-monkey working for an uncaring corporation or company that would/will dump me as soon as I am obsolete.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not asking for pitty, but I am asking if anyone else can relate to this, maybe it's from social media and our connection to everyone and everything that I keep finding myself hours into studying/building a project only to see so so so so many more people who are on paper a lot more qualified than me basically BEGGING companies for a chance to work. To me, not only is it severely demotivating that all this work and study may probably lead nowhere, if people with masters in CS degrees or who have a lot of experience/projects can still not find work anywhere. I'm just having a massive existential crisis being am I really willing to sell my soul, my creativity, my passions, my youth, to be some computer monkey writing code for a company that i'll most likely give two shits about and will also give two shits about me-even if I make it to said company, there are thousands of programmers whose very job is to write AI to eliminate my job...

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds negative, and maybe it is, but it is a realistic question that I have to ask myself, and I am curious if any of you are asking your selves? Seems like everyone YouTuber I watch is in the market of SELLING coding shit, but nobody is really coding anymore-the money is in the people trying to learn, but then the market is FLOOOOODED with jr. devs who all are self taught with tons of projects or graduated college with a CS degree and still cannot find any internships let alone careers....

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just really wondering if 10, 20, 30 years from now if i'll look back and think, wow, i'm really glad I stuck to that tech/coding phase or if i'll wish I had the balls to go for something more risky, something I genuinely love? 

It has been fun learning to code, and I do really enjoy it, but i'm just some starry eyed newb, I feel like a year or so from now i'll still be willing to cut off my arm to even get a damn interview..just all feels so bleak and that you should only pursue it if you feel you cannot live without it bc it doesn't seem like a regular ol' job, it seems like a lifestyle?"

My question is How do I elevate these projects into something that's actually really cool? 

I find myself coding object oriented models of my university, of like a store and things like that - and I've learned a ton, but ultimately they're all pretty simple projects - not much there (200 - 300 lines of code).

People have told me to learn OpenGL or SFML and do something there - what do you guys think about that? Btw please don't respond with ""do something you're passionate about"" because if I hear that sentence one more time - I'm gonna shoot myself. 

I also hear people say that APIs are useful evidently? Should I start learning those?  
I know the question sounds moronic but I really am lost here so any guidance - no matter how seemingly trivial - would be greatly appreciated!"

Posted here a few days ago about a date I was about to go on with this girl I hooked up with a while back and was so nervous about it. So we went, we had a good time, and I even I did way better than I thought I would. 

we talked this morning and she doesn’t want anything right now. So now I’m just crying in bed before my i start my internship for the day because she was so awesome. I understand all the cliché’s as I deal with rejection on a daily basis- “plenty of fish in the sea” “you’ll find the one someday” “focus on yourself” etc. 

Well with crippling anxiety, it’s feels pretty fucking bad to feel alone as I do right now, and all the time. I can’t handle being alone because my thoughts corrupt me and make me miserable. It wasn’t a personal thing that she said no, but I got that line I get from every girl “you’re great and so kind but I’m just not feeling it etc” but I just want something to fucking work out for once or for me to finally have some inner peace. I’ve been in therapy for years, I try and do stuff like exercise to improve my mental health but I revert to the same bad habits every time. 

I know having a GF won’t solve my SA. But the one time I thought I had a shot in the dating game, it of course failed. What am I supposed to do when I already feel hopeless, and I get rejected again? And feel even more hopeless? I’ve been applying for full-time jobs for a year since my senior year of college started, and I can’t get one. I can’t get a single girl to date me. I understand with SA I have an over dependence on other people and other things to make me happy, but how can I live with myself alone? I would never wish this feeling on anyone.

Fresher, lost after personal tragedy.",senior_commandant,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/pjowvb/need_guidance_on_career_fresher_lost_after/,"Hi fellow devs and senior folks. I have recently joined a service setup of a large bank (RBS). We just finished our 2 months full-stack training and now allotted projects. The new project is related to RPA/UiPath and python report generation stuff. This makes me nervous because most of the tasks here are not too related to the kind of training and the kind of background that I have.

**My Background**

I graduated from a good college, DTU. But to be fair, during my college stay, I was not focussed. I had started out well in college, got good grades and even was fairly active in competitive coding. But at the end of my 2nd year, just after I got the internship,  I lost my mother suddenly to heart attack. That gave me and my family a huge shock. Went into depression and got into a few addictions.

Stopped caring much for studies and it all went downhill. Did not upskill much and left whatever competitive coding I had done till then. Internship with RBS went okayish. Work was to create Data Engineering pipelines and data lakes. Wrote SQL stuff and automated the batch process in Airflow. Felt not much of a challenge.

**Present Situation**

At the start of this year, with immense help from my father, took up some counselling and treatment and am much better and healthy now. Focussed on getting better grades and did well in the last semesters. Graduated with a GPA of 8.22/10. Got motivated to give the GATE exam to get into a good IIT/IISc and make up for the ground I lost.

Joined RBS again by taking up their PPO (OFFER : 9LPA). Joined them in July, and we were put into a bootcamp sort of training for full-stack. It was my first time learning about the backend stuff like Spring, SpringBoot and microservices setup. This has gotten me really interested in Backend Development. Now, I'd want to continue to build upon this stuff as well as prepare for GATE.

**Future Planning**

I am now preparing for GATE dedicatedly. Giving it 4-5 hours consistently everyday. But I was hoping that they would assign me a project that would help, but this UIPath and python ingestion tool stuff that they have assigned is not exciting at all. Although they have said that in April'22 they will provide option to change projects and assign us tasks as per our choice.

**My questions to you all are -**

1. Is preparing for GATE'22 worth? I feel that even if I don't do too well, it will help in strengthening my fundamentals as most core topics were done when I was depressed and not paying attention.
2. Is UiPath and RPA/Python ingestion and automation stuff good? Does it add value? Will it help to mention this while switching jobs?
3. How should I prepare my resume beyond Feb'22 (GATE) to get oppurtunities to switch jobs? Should I build projects first? Or start leetcoding? How do I structure it?

Thanks a lot for anyone who has read it till here. Please do help me out as I feel pretty clueless right now. I would like to work on interesting stuff in the bakend development, not mundane automation stuff.

**TLDR :** Was depressed in college, did not develop backend skills. Now, placed in a mundane role. Want to switch to interesting backend stuff. Also preparing for GATE. Looking for guidance.

Want to bounce back in life. Stronger. 

Thanks!"

I recently accepted a job offer as a new grad, and now am kind of doubting some of my decisions. 

Wondering if you guys could help me out.

---

So some background:

So I recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science this past May (2021) and the only internship I had over my 4 years was an obscure one I did for 1 month last summer with my friend's dad (has technical C.S. background) where he paid me to do some web dev for him.

---

I really only started job hunting in late July and used the shotgun technique and filled out over 180 applications in a span of 4 weeks. I got positive feedback from 8 companies, that all wanted to interview me at some point. However one of these companies, I'll call it Company X, was very fast with their interview process where I completed 3 interviews (within a span of 3-4 weeks) and got an offer to be a Software Engineer. By the time I got this offer from Company X, I had either not interviewed with yet or only gotten past the first round with the other 7 companies.

---

Company X offered me 100k base salary with a 1 week deadline for the offer, and so I accepted. Mainly because this base salary was much higher than many of the discussed/researched/expected salaries of the other 7 companies. I also accepted because I enjoyed talking with the hiring manager and sr software engineer that had interviewed me.

---

Should I have negotiated a higher base salary? I didn't have any other offers, and the starting base salary was higher than expected, so I didn't negotiate. However, looking back and reading up on posts like [this](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/) makes me sort of doubt myself. Idk, what do you guys think?

FYI, Company X is based in Danbury, CT"
pjrisn,2,2021-09-07,Are corporate jobs really that fake?,random-user333,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/pjrisn/are_corporate_jobs_really_that_fake/,"Hey all! I'm a recent-ish college graduate (Dec 2020) and have been in the work force as a paid intern for 5-6 months now. My first internship was great, I enjoyed the people I worked with, and although emails seemed tedious, communication was solid and I was excited when I got to the office most days. I'm now at my second internship, which comes to an end in three weeks. They've expressed many times that they'd like me to stay on, potentially as a full time employee, but everything about this job has felt like hell. Among it's many challenges, people seem remarkably fake here. At the previous internship, employees were allowed to be negative when appropriate. Frustration was normal and being able to voice our frustrations helped everyone understand one another better, and try to help whenever possible. This second internship - the one I'm finishing up right now - is far from that. I feel as though several of my bosses are on the edge of a nervous breakdown but refuse to acknowledge it. They instead use what I feel is ""toxic positivity"" to essentially ignore the bad and stress the good. That doesn't work very well when you're the intern though, because you're typically the one who has to deal with all the bad because everyone above you prefers to delegate.

It's exhausting, and sometimes I wonder if I'm missing something, because everyone else seems perfectly happy. And although it feels like I'm the only one actually doing work, I know that's not true, because our organization wouldn't be able to run if it were.

So, my question is - **is this just corporate life?** You fake smile and insert positivity into every conversation as if you were talking about your biggest achievements in life, and everyone's okay with it? I've had several people suggest that yes, this is the case, but that seems more miserable than just acknowledging the cracks and working to fix them.

**TLDR;** one of my first ""corporate"" jobs and I'm at a loss for what seems to be a cycle of fake happiness and toxic positivity. I'm beginning to wonder if it's me - maybe I'm a downer, too cynical, or just bad at being an adult.

***Edit:*** I'm not sure if this will make a difference, but I should've mentioned that I live on-site. My boss has a key to my living quarters and habitually comes in during all hours, including days off. This has left me feeling like I have to be ""on"" almost all the time. Additionally, we have artists that stay in the same house as I do and move in and out every 1-2 weeks which can get exhausting after awhile - I'm currently going on 4 months of hosting new arrivals every 2 weeks or so. 

Additionally, the living quarters is in the middle of being updated, so many trade people are coming in to repair this and work on that, but I'm never told of when they're coming by so I often just realize there's a stranger in the house and have to roll with it. 

The more responses I see, the more I wonder if the real issue is my living situation. As I finish typing this, my boss walked in to said living quarters and starting calling out to see if anyone was here. So I guess I was wrong in assuming this was a ""corporate"" job in the first place, I think I may just have a sh\*tty internship. 

Wish me luck! "
pjrtn9,4,2021-09-07,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (9/6/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/pjrtn9/weekly_job_qa_thread_962021/,"Hi all,

Here is the eightieth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

The offer has a deadline of October 1st and I got it Sunday (two days ago now), which gives me about three weeks to accept or reject it. It's a good offer, would not be upset by the pay. The team I worked with was good and I would go back. However, I don't have any other options and haven't really explored that much into other companies. 

I had a previous internship at Mastercard and they would likely give me a return offer if I asked but i'm not that interested in working for them TBH. If i did try to get a different offer it would be with a company I had never worked with.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question:**

Is it feasible to get a full-time entry-level SDE offer before October 1st if I start looking today? If not, should I go with AWS? Should I turn them down and hope to get other offers later?"

pjwh1x,6,2021-09-07,Career Advice - Soon to graduate ME looking for a position with a blend of ME and CS,Sufficient-Jicama843,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/pjwh1x/career_advice_soon_to_graduate_me_looking_for_a/,"Hello All,

I am a senior in college, finishing my bachelor's in mechanical engineering in march. I am trying to figure out what types of jobs to apply for and how to find one that interests me. I've found that my passions lie in those areas where I am able to blend mechanical engineering with a bit of CS. For example, some of my favorite projects in school were those where extensive MATLAB scripts were required, such as modeling the acceleration and top speeds of a vehicle with a variety of gear ratios or creating a dynamically accurate simulation of a walking arm trebuchet and calculating the resulting distance of its projectile. I enjoy problems that are deeply technical and would hate to be in a role that doesn't challenge me. I am also interested in simulations such as FEA or CFD and enjoyed the several mechanical vibrations classes I have taken. I am also considering pursuing a master's in CS later down the road to supplement my coding skills and hopefully use that in my job. I am definitely glad I didn't major in CS though because creating code that doesn't somehow tie into a mechanical system is FAR less interesting to me. I really would like that blend of ME with CS, not just pure CS. 

Does anyone have any good ideas of jobs/titles that I could search/apply for. To summarize, I want something very technical that incorporates some sort of simulations, especially by coding in MATLAB. I enjoy coding and am good at it and much prefer when my code corresponds to something mechanical and physical. Also, I really like analysis work but I don't really like design work as far as coming up with concepts or big ideas. I currently am looking into jobs as a stress analysis engineer, structural dynamics engineer, and loads and dynamics engineer. I think these roles seem interesting but I feel like the types of simulations and computations I would do in these positions wouldn't really involve coding which disappoints me. 

As for a little more on my background, I do well in school (3.897 GPA) and have had a couple of co-op/internship experiences. My co-op was for 7 months as a project engineer in a manufacturing environment. The work was fun because of the team but I just didn't feel very challenged by it. It was a great experience and helped me learn a lot about making practical designs and using common materials, but I hardly did any analysis which made me glad it was over in the end. My internship was as a test engineer for a company that manufactured explosive parts. This was another role in which I was a little disappointed in the amount of technical work even the full-time engineers did. It was just a lot of paperwork and reports for the most part. I don't mind writing a report to explain some simulation results or technical thing I did, but when my main job is writing the reports, not doing the technical analysis, that sounds extremely boring. My favorite parts of this internship were designing a vibration fixture and performing modal analysis on it as well as automating data collection and analysis for different test setups using Keysight VEE (Similar to Labview). In school, I liked intermediate dynamics (lots of Matlab coding in the lab), FEA, mechanical vibrations, design for strength and stiffness, and fluid mechanics. I liked classes that were challenging and that I could see examples of in the world around me. I also just recently passed the FE and am getting my EIT license (hoping that will help me when looking for jobs?). 

Let me know what you guys think. Are there any positions like what I am looking for?? What is the position title of people in these jobs?? Anyone in these positions who wouldn't mind doing an informational interview with me?? I am just looking for something for me where I can learn and actually like my job. I also want to be in the Seattle area if that's relevant. Let me know if anyone wants any more info or if I should clarify anything. 

Thanks in advance for the help and advice."

pjy2h0,3,2021-09-07,Additional Prep for Getting First Job After Bootcamp?,bmch,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pjy2h0/additional_prep_for_getting_first_job_after/,"I'm a career changer (attorney -- so no prior technical job experience though I was head counsel for several tech startups)  who recently got accepted to 2 coding bootcamps (Codesmith and Hack Reactor). I'm still deciding if I should go (and if so which one I should choose). My initial desire was to get a masters in CS. I took a bunch of community college pre-req classes but having been unemployed for the majority of the pandemic and looking at the time to get a masters, my situation necessitates I get job that actually pays me first and possibly go for the masters later, which is how I thought a bootcamp might help.   


Reading through the posts on this subreddit and others, there seems to be a huge split as to how easy it is to get a job after going to a bootcamp. I see a fair amount who say their first job was six-figures plus and they were hired almost immediately and I see others who say a bootcamp degree is worthless and they're still searching 6+ months later for their first job.   


Almost all who are employed though seemed to suggest that just going to the bootcamp was not enough and that they needed to do ""other preparation."" Maybe it's putting the cart before the horse, since I haven't even decided to go yet, but what other prep should I expect to be doing while also attending the bootcamp to maximize my chance of getting a job soon after graduating? I've always been great at business/legal job interviews -- but those are almost entirely structured to see whether someone can stand working with you for 80 hrs a week and ask very little about how much subject matter knowledge you have. I mean even when just looking perusing CS job boards now it seems internships and entry level jobs want you to already have significant experience which I imagine won't come from a bootcamp alone.   


Separately, if anyone has gone to a bootcamp that focused on JS, Node, etc., did you find it gave you some additional help on later learning programming languages that might be more valuable in a master's program like Python, Java, C++, etc."

pjyq0m,1,2021-09-07,How do I (22F) get my mom (54F) to realize she has anger issues?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pjyq0m/how_do_i_22f_get_my_mom_54f_to_realize_she_has/,"My mom and I have had a rocky relationship since I was 13. Before you tell me to just “move out”, it’s not that simple. Believe me, if I could get a job that would pay a living wage, I’d drop out of college and do so. Yes, I’m still in college and before you judge me, listen to my backstory. My parents haven’t pressured me to get a paying job. My mom has always told me to focus on school, internships, and extracurriculars. And for the fields I’m interested in, I need years of experience in internships when I graduate from college so I’m preparing for the job market. I’ve lived with my mom most of the time since my parents split up when I was 9. I went off to college across the country when I was almost 19. My got fired from her job (not her fault. Her employers were greedy assholes but I won’t go into that cause I don’t think it’s relevant).

So as a result of this, I couldn’t afford the school I was going to and had to move back home and go to a local CC. Only two of my classes from the previous college I went to transferred over. Then I got gastritis and had to recover from that so I couldn’t take as many classes. So I have one year left of CC before I transfer to a school farther away. And believe me, I do plan on getting a summer job so I can stay in that city and don’t have to come home in the summer. The only other family I have that I know would take me in is my dad. I tried that and it didn’t work out. My stepmother clearly doesn’t dislike me and has this ridiculous rule that I have to be done with cooking and dishes at 4pm. And my dad allows her to run the show.

I get not wanting me to cook late at night but be done with cooking and dishes by 4pm? Come on. How am I supposed to do that if I want to go to school, have an internship, and have a social and love life? It’s just unrealistic. She only has this rule because she wants to watch tv without hearing me cook. And I can tell she doesn’t like me in the kitchen. And I can’t live with someone who nearly every time I’m around them I can tell they dislike my presence there and view it as a burden. My mom has her anger issues but she doesn’t act like this.

So anyways, back to my mom. In the past, she yelled at me for a variety of mistakes I’ve made. It used to be me getting bad grades (I’ve improved on this). Then it was me not having a nice enough tone (I really think she overreacted on this). Then it was me not being helpful enough around the house (I’ve improved on this). I have ADHD and struggle with being forgetful but I do work on it and have improved. And now it’s me being paranoid and not eating healthy enough or working out enough which I have started to improve on. Things were better between us after I came back from living at my dad’s for a couple months. This was from early 2021 til a few days ago but things were slowly getting worse and now they’re bad again.

It used to be that she realized she had anger issues and that she’s changed and feels horrible about what she’s done to me in the past but now it’s different and I have no clue what changed other than she hasn’t seen her therapist in a couple weeks cause “the therapist is flaky” when really I think my mom has been putting off therapy. Basically right now, my mom has this mentality that I “can’t blame her for everything” and “she can’t always be the bad guy.” I acknowledge I make mistakes that can inconvenience her and I am working to change that and have made progress. 

But I really don’t think the mistakes I made are worth her yelling at me over. She yells at me like I embezzled money from her, totaled her car, or sold some prized possession of hers, you know something like that. None of which I’ve ever done, FYI. The mistakes I’ve made are like I haven’t been eating very healthy or working out for the past week, I haven’t vacuumed my room or washed my sheets yet when I should’ve, or I have a huge pile of laundry I need to do. While these aren’t good things, I really don’t think they’re things too get super angry over. I don’t think these are things most people would get angry over.

My mom isn’t listening to me right now but she agreed to have me see her therapist with her (we originally started seeing her therapist for family therapy but once things got better, my mom started seeing the therapist by herself). She may listen to this therapist if she tells my mom that she has anger issues. I’m just not fully sure what to say during the session to the therapist that will be helpful for this. And believe me, my mom does have anger issues. Look up all the signs for anger issues. Almost all of the signs apply to my mom.

Edit: Changed a typo."
pjz7gz,1,2021-09-07,How do I implement predictive maintenance for a software project system?,kimtaengsshi9,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/pjz7gz/how_do_i_implement_predictive_maintenance_for_a/,"My company is signing a contract for a new software system early next year, and I am to conduct a feasibility study into whether we can include a component for predictive maintenance as part of the contract, with a PoC due in Dec if it is possible. I'm not privy to the details of the contract for security reasons, but this the information I've to go on for now:

* The systems my company develops comprise of servers and clients, and possibly network devices
* We have not done PdM before
* We don't manufacture hardware. The computers we use are purchased from vendors like IBM, HP, Cisco etc. but due to the nature of our clients maintenance has to be performed by our own hardware engineers — the OEMs' main role is only to supply replacement parts and provide corrective maintenance if our own engineers are unable to do so
* Since the contract hasn't been signed, there's no budget assigned to this study

For now I'll just start with two questions:

1. What data should I be using for PdM in this kind of system? When I Google online, the results I get are relevant to industry and manufacturing sectors, not IT. After all, I don't think I should be performing oil analysis and measuring hydraulic pressures in a computer. My company can't provide this information, they're looking to me to inform them.
2. Where can I gather these data? Since the system has yet to be developed, we've no hardware to speak of. And I doubt those third party vendors would provide their datasets either (I can try asking, but I doubt they'd let me have them for free...), since they seem to have their own PdM services.

I've been a software engineer for a few years, and I just completed my AI masters. This is the first AI-related assignment given by my company, but honestly I feel like a fresh grad who has been tasked to head the development from scratch of a full stack application with ML right now. My manager can provide contract details on a need-to-know basis as well as guidance from the perspective of a company and industry senior, but he has no AI background so he's also counting on me to tell him what I need and what we should do next. I've two student interns but they're at a pre-U level so they're more for me to assign tasks to. I don't think there's other AI-trained professional the company can team up with me, we've an employee shortage right now and they're just sending staff to get training right now — I just happen to be available because I went to study on my own earlier. I've done data preprocessing and everything down the pipeline from there but data collection...I've never built a new dataset at all. Not to mention that computing hardware is totally out of my domain expertise (I know how to build gaming PCs but that's the extent of my hardware knowledge).

Sorry for rambling but I'm feeling very lost at the moment, I'm really just grasping for the first useful things that come to mind right now."

pjzpmf,3,2021-09-07,The gatekeeping of clinical research,GravitationalPull_75,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pjzpmf/the_gatekeeping_of_clinical_research/,"Maybe some of us aren’t lucky enough to be an institution or employer’s first pick. Somehow, this past month I was. 

I received my bachelors in psychology with a minor in neuro. I even had a research internship my senior year. For almost a year now I’ve been searching for a research position at a hospital or university for months. I’d say I’ve sent over 60 applications in the span of 8 months. Doesn’t seem like much, but when grad school requires some specialized training, you need to be choosy. 

Searching for jobs was miserable. Not hearing back from anyone for months was demoralizing. Feeling the tiniest amount of happiness when I received a clear rejection was pathetic. Needless to say, it felt hopeless and like my skills were unwanted. Clinical research often seems only to value those who already have years and years of experience in niche populations or disciplines. There’s also the incredibly frustrating desire for applicants to hold degrees in public health or psychology while also miraculously having experience and skills in computer programming and coding. No one I’ve met from my program or the neuroscience program just has that kind of experience. 

Finally I decided to go full steam ahead after realizing how much I hated my current job (regulatory aspect of clinical trials) and  how badly I needed something new that I could be passionate about. That’s when I applied to positions all over the country, not unheard of for academia, but completely out of my comfort zone. Within a day or two I had three interviews, one of which eventually offered me a job. 

I accepted the offer, which was fully remote, over a 26% pay increase, guaranteed publications and a division at one of the most prestigious universities in the US. 

These positions have so much competition in terms of applicants. Somehow this PI saw my experience and decided she was interested. I’ll give credit to my undergrad GPA, my internship and my current job, but it isn’t lost on me that a lot of what got me this job was luck. Especially in times like this when everyone in vying for the same job in research as a stepping stone to grad school, the role of luck should never be forgotten. 

After feeling like I would never break into this kind of research, research that I can be passionate about, research that will hopefully launch me into my career, it’s almost overwhelming to have someone see something in your skills. And if you’re trying to pursue a PhD or a job in research to get you there, don’t stop trying. I know how it feels to be overlooked and ignored, but if you keep going then maybe it’ll be your turn to be lucky too."

I'm going to be applying to unis this fall and I know Waterloo's CS program is very competitive to get into. My average is decent (95%) and I know I have solid EC'S but even then... trying my best to stay confident lol. I know Waterloo's math program is very good too so I just wanna know if I could still land cs internships.

Thank you so much in advance."

pk0ej3,1,2021-09-07,I'm told often that I should be hired and working in my field and yet... Nothing...,PendletonNerd,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pk0ej3/im_told_often_that_i_should_be_hired_and_working/,"I am turning 25 later this year. I haven't had a job that's touch 30,000 a year. Part of that is due to hopping around the country (I did two Disney College Programs) and going back to school and getting my MA. I'm trying out NYC currently and have been applying like crazy to multiple jobs in media.

A common thing I'm told is ""You should be working in media because your resume is impressive"" but no one in my field is hiring me. I've had my resumes looked over to death. No critiques. I don't know what to do.

Since March 2020 (When I was laid off at my college's bookstore because of the pandemic) I've applied for over 1000 jobs and I get that same comment: ""Your resume is impressive but we went with another candidate"". I've had career advisors tell me: ""Your resume is great and you have impressive experience under your belt for your age.""

And yet... Nothing...

When it comes to freelancing, I don't know how to market myself or how to price my services. I don't even know where to start with that.

A lot of the impressive things I've done fall into a lot of different categories and were done for free or could be viewed as a ""hobby"". I've been very independent with these projects but... I need to get paid... Preferably... More

Additionally, I got my student loans kicking in in December.

I ended up quitting my internship at Disney recently because of a toxic work environment.

And everyone back home is miserable with their job but they make good money.

I just want to do what I love and get paid a better wage.

I've contemplated doing, yet, again, another minimum wage job in NYC as a backup... But... I witnessed a robbery at a Dollar General within 24 hours of being here... And that killed it for me. I could do something in minimum wage again but... I'm not fucking risking my life. I've worked so many shitty jobs that I'm not dying.

I feel lost.

This is rambling but I don't know what I'm doing wrong."

Little context. I’m currently at community college about to finish and go to university next year. The language I leaned was C++ I have a lot of the core concepts down and know some OOP. I want to get an internship as soon as possible and get into game development. I currently work at a grocery store but one of my coworkers father works at fairly big game company in town as a manger so I might have an in for an internship and I’ve heard this company likes to get interns from the university I’ll be attending. This company uses C# and unity to develop there games. Should I stick with C++ and get deep into it or learn unity and C# assuming I can get an internship next summer.

Not sure if this is the right place to post and if it doesn't fit please let me know. I'm in my last semester of Computer Science and will be graduating this fall. I'm currently working in a school as a Computer Technician/""bootleg"" SCCM admin (I code a lot of PowerShell and sometimes Python to automate things around work) maintaining our SCCM site with app deployments, updates, reporting, etc. Prior I had been an intern with county government for close to 3 years and before that I was an intern at my highschool for about a year. 

I'm happy with my job but I can't shake the feeling i should be making more money. I'm currently making barely $18 an hour and I feel like I'm stuck. I still do a lot of programming in C++, Java, Python, PowerShell, and I've been gotten into web development with stuff like Angular. I even write SQL queries  for some of our dbs. Whatever needs to be automated or simplified down at my work I have done such as making a GUI to reset passwords for a group using PowerShell, for example. 

My question is, am I selling myself short? Should I look for another position for more money? I don't know where I should look as a lot of these positions require over 10 years of experience. The imposter syndrome is hitting me hard, and I'm not sure what I should do or where to start, or if this is as much money I'm gonna be making with a CS degree. Any help or words of advice would be really appreciated."

How do I answer these annoying questions...",XnobodyinmiseryX,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pk53jk/vent_still_in_underemployed_pool_after_graduating/,"TL, DR: What is the best responses to:

""Why do you want to leave your current job""

""I feel like you would be bored in this position I am hiring for, why did you apply""

I have no good answers, other than vague stupid answers. Anything else I wanna say sounds like I'm one of those entitled college grads that think they deserve everything like those blogs say to say lol.

Also:

How do you prevent the recruiters where you are employed at from coming across your profile on LinkedIn, Indeed, etc to see that you want to work somewhere else?

===================================

Guess I should've skipped college and just went into housekeeping at work since they make more money than I do... mid-30s female minority...also found out a mid-20s yr old white male coworker who has 0 college degrees makes almost $4/hr more than I do, which is understandable coz the average person won't accept such low pay unless they were desperate like me so employer can take full advantage paying low rates. Can't even get a seasonal job at Target, which pays $15/hr, immediately get the rejection letter a few hours after submitting it yet they have signs everywhere they are hiring.

&amp;#x200B;

So many people quitting and everybody is hiring at all these businesses starting at $15/hr yet I can't get any interviews or even transfer into another department at my employer for entry-level positions that only require a HS degree for departments that require my degrees to get promoted.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently only make $599 after taxes every 2 weeks. Absolutely pathetic. Have probably sent out over 10k applications since I've graduated college over 10 yrs ago :( I graduated from 1 of the top 5 largest state universities in the US not an unpopular school.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm the most educated person in my department but my coworkers all think I'm lazy since I'm not doing anything with my degrees as if I'm stealing/occupying a position from someone who was not able to attend college smh. They have no idea how much I want to get out of the department. My mgr only has an AA, my director only has a BA in Business Admin, both are like my parents' ages, I have zero interest in either of their positions so I would need to transfer since there are no positions to be promoted to in my dept. Totally grateful the hiring manager 9 years ago took a chance on me before leaving coz I would probably be unemployed all this time.

&amp;#x200B;

Wasted time in college changing majors so many times so I missed my 2007 graduation, didn't graduate college until 2009 and then took 3 more classes to finish 2nd BS a few months later when I was 25. Had random part-time jobs after my internship with my state's health department and wasn't able to get a full-time position at the hospital I'm at until 2012 since the economy was so terrible back then. Exhausted all my scholarships and grants so ended up graduating with like $25k in loans that were mostly spent on living expenses, which I'm glad I paid off within 5 yrs after graduating living incredibly frugally since I started paying it off while I was still in school.

&amp;#x200B;

Had hopes and dreams of working hard for about 20 years and saving &amp; investing so I could leanfire around 45 years old but that's not happening with so many years of poverty-level income.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the best way to answer ""why do you want to leave your current position"" on the application without sounding like I'm stuck up and entitled? lol ofc I wanna put some variation of ""have a higher income"" lol or ""do less mundane work"". I've just been putting ""interested in other opportunities"" which sounds stupid in itself coz everyone is always looking for other opportunities.  What's the best way to answer this in person?

&amp;#x200B;

Have tried to transfer departments as soon as my 6 months required in current department was met. There are plenty of jobs at my hospital that require my degrees but they also require like at least 1 year of relevant work experience, unfortunately I've been stuck in a department for almost 10 years that doesn't provide any growth opportunities or experiences that are relevant to really anything anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Used to have more interviews when I was in my 20's like every 2 months for the 1st few years. As I've gotten older, I rarely get them, maybe 1 every 6 months now. Some years I had no interviews after hundreds of applications. And when I do get them, the hiring managers are usually like 5-10 years younger &amp; just have just 1 of the 2 degrees I have...so this may be the reason why I rarely get any interviews or the fact that I haven't transfer or been promoted this whole time I've been here, even tho there are no promoting opportunities in my dept, so they probably all think I'm lazy and not worthy of interviewing. I took my graduating years off my resume and thankfully I look like I'm 18 yrs old haha so they don't really know how old I am lol...but given the years I worked near my school in my work history they can figure out approximately how old I am along with the fact that some ppl are starting college at an earlier age nowadays even though I started at 18 lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Also encounter the ones who flat out say they think I would be bored working in their department near the end of the interview given my education, lol geez if I did I would not even apply. Everything is more exciting than my department! I have no good answers when they say that other than this position I'm interested in is a lot more interesting than my current position, lol.  What is the best way to answer this?!

&amp;#x200B;

So incredibly discouraging when I come across something like [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/pbh1ou/anyone\_feel\_like\_theyre\_fired\_even\_when\_theyre/.compact](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/pbh1ou/anyone_feel_like_theyre_fired_even_when_theyre/.compact) this person is 37, has a wfh job from before the pandemic, makes over 100k and only works several hours a week, has no team meetings to attend, etc. Feels like I've failed at this whole miserable life when I work 40 hrs a wk making literally minimum wage, take myself into work where we are all less than 6 feet away from each other during this whole pandemic smh. Even tho we have no patient interaction, we were not allowed to work from home even though 20% of the hospital is working from home permanently.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.burning-glass.com/research-project/underemployment](https://www.burning-glass.com/research-project/underemployment) makes me so miserable with ""A bachelor’s degree has been, and continues to be, the clearest and most accessible path to a good job and middle-class wages. Over the course of a lifetime, the average college graduate makes $1 million more over a career than a worker with just a high-school diploma."" ... well making just $20k/yr for 45 years is only $900k, pathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

Interested in pursuing a MS but afraid that would put me even more overqualified for entry level positions within the departments I'm interested in. I've taken an ICD coding class, Visual Basic coding class, Clinical Research Trials class, some classes part of a Health Informatics Graduate Certificate program which consist of some masters level classes that were all paid for by the hospital coz they're all reimbursed by the hospital therefore free lol... since they won't let me transfer I guess I will waste their money paying for my classes while I'm bored in my dept lol, but haven't been able to do anything with the knowledge I've gained.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanna move into Health IT/informatics/analytics or biotech or CR or RevCycle areas or really anywhere that's working remoting but they all require relevant experience in addition to educational experience, so no interviews ever after applying to transfer, only rejection notifications. Have looked at bigger cities but I'm not rich enough to fly out for every interview they want to do in person if that happens to happen. Have only gotten a few interviews with the other hospitals in this area. Plus I have banked too much time at this hospital, have over 220 PTO hrs and accrue 8.5 hrs per paycheck. This rate didn't kick in until the 7th year here, before that I was only accruing like 6hr/paycheck. If I was able to switch companies like every 2 yrs like everyone else I wouldn't care, but now I feel sick thinking about starting over at another company, unless it's not unheard of for a company to start a new hire off at something other than a new hire level as part of negotiation of benefits? But I'm a nobody so ofc they won't do that.

&amp;#x200B;

There's an upcoming like 50 page ""project"" that is probably going to fall into my lap only coz I'm the best with computers in my dept as well as the fastest typer.  This is something I feel like my mgr or director should do just coz they're paid more. Previous coworker who did it for ""free"" has left for a non-healthcare company that pays like 2x as much. I only type like 60-70wpm, faster than that former coworker but nothing lightning fast. I don't want to do it because I know I would still be paid the same with no promotion or raise. There are no merit raises in my department for anyone ever, only hospital-wide raises where everyone goes up 2-3% or so at the same time, so I don't want to waste time doing more when I'm being paid like everyone else in my department. I know merit raises don't exist in my dept because I got 2 different things implemented in the past which improved our workflow, 1 of the 2 made a huge difference in saving so much wasted time and I got no raise. I got a silly paper reward, which is meaningless to me, only after I jokingly mentioned I should I get one from the hospital. I guess that gives an additional thing to talk about during the few interviews I get.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone here says to post ur profile on Indeed &amp; LinkedIn &amp; etc that ur a job seeker but I'm terrified that the recruiters at my hospital will see that and have HR find a way to get rid of my unloyaltyness so they can fill my position with someone who wants to be in my department. How do y'all deal with that? Its not like u can block certain ppl from viewing your job seeking profile as far as I'm aware of, I don't understand this at all, lol? I wanna put a fake name on my profile so my hospital's recruiters won't come across my profile and know who I am, but then again recruiters from other companies won't be able to verify my employment coz there's nobody in my dept with my fake name lol.

&amp;#x200B;

My hospital uses the ICIMS platform...I used to get ""Reviewed, not selected."" nowadays I get ""Submitted, not selected."" more often in the application updates...I'm not applying for things I don't have the qualifications for, but I guess HR is tired of seeing my transfer applications all the time. I've never had a single interview for a job that requires a college degree, all the interviews I've gotten only require a HS degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Live with my family coz I'm too poor with my crap pay. Have put my life on hold coz I highly doubt anybody wants to date an unsuccessful chick who has not started their career yet working at an ""easy"" job who is almost 40. I haven't had any meaningful dates since like college that wasn't a 1 night stand lol. Afraid of casually dating  and getting too attached in meaningless relationships just to move away from family and end up like [https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/love-sex/dear-fiona-my-boyfriend-and-i-haven-t-had-sex-in-years-and-barely-talk-but-we-re-just-drifting-along/ar-AAOaxGb](https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/love-sex/dear-fiona-my-boyfriend-and-i-haven-t-had-sex-in-years-and-barely-talk-but-we-re-just-drifting-along/ar-AAOaxGb) Some days I just want to blow my brains out after dealing with all the ppl who unleash their anger on my dept coz I can't see this ever ending ☹"
pk54ny,5,2021-09-08,Leaving my fulltime job to accept an internship,francheese_cake,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/pk54ny/leaving_my_fulltime_job_to_accept_an_internship/,"I need advice because I am currently deciding between staying with my current employer or taking a paid internship offer. For context, I work in HR and I have less than a year worth of experience with my current company.

Company A (current employer)

* HR company. We provide HR services to various clients. In my case, I'm presently deployed to this client (by deployed, meaning I have to physically report to their office).
* My first job after graduation, started as an Assistant then now as an Associate.
* Around 24k salary, including basic pay and ""shares"" for each client that I handle.
* No problems whatsoever with my co-workers, but the clients' employees whom I deal with are insanely problematic. The clients themselves are also traditional in nature and are very apprehensive towards change. To say the least, I feel that my mental and physical health have plummeted to an all time low during the course of my employment here.
* I don't really need to use my brain most of the time while I'm working. That's why I feel no fulfillment or pride whatsoever with my work.

Company B (offered me a paid internship instead of fulltime employment)

* Established local e-commerce platform. Company is made up of young professionals and fresh graduates.
* WFH since the pandemic
* I applied as an Associate, but they offered me a paid internship instead (for the reason that they're seeking to assess if my performance during my internship will warrant full-time employment in the future. It's this factor why I'm kind of unwilling to leave my current employer)
* Very generous monthly allowance, slightly higher than my net pay with my current employer.
* The responsibilities entailed by the job seem both challenging and exciting to me. It feels like I'd be a part of something meaningful if I choose to join them.

I would be very inclined to join Company B only if they offered me a fulltime position, however, like I said, at most they could only offer to me a paid internship. I'm also slightly worried that coming from full time employment, would it mean taking a step down if I chose to accept this internship? I mean, who even takes an internship after graduation and at 24 years old?

Btw, the reason why I even applied to Company B in the first place was to escape my current clients' toxic workplace environment. With my current client, since I'm the newest in the team, I had no choice but to serve as the scapegoat and continually get blamed for all the company's problems that have long been there even before I came in. Because of this my mental health has suffered considerably, it's becoming a daily routine to have a panic attack or breakdown. I've informed my boss about this already, but since medyo gipit kami sa pera and we're trying to recover financially this year, we can't afford to hire another employee to handle this client.

So ayun, your thoughts will be very much appreciated. If you put yourself in my position, would you choose to let go of a toxic fulltime position in exchange for a ""demotion"" in rank from employee to intern? Pls help this struggling gurl decide :( Thank you."

I'm (F19) a junior double majoring in computer science and math. Recently I've been feeling very inadequate in my field and feeling like I'm not doing enough in terms of internships, work experience, etc. Grades wise though, I've managed to maintain a high GPA and it's the only thing I'm proud of.

I've been wanting to get a job for quite a while, and today our university sent us an email about a job involving VR. My passion has always revolved around video games and game development, and recently VR too.

Here's the thing though... I don't think I fit the requirements for it. Here is the exact email I received for the job requirements:

**I’m looking for Unity or JavaScript programmers to work on an exciting VR project.**

**This will be a student hire and as such in addition to the experience, being mentored by me, and having a great project for their portfolio, I will be able to pay at the university student hire rate.**

**My requirement is that you can dedicate 5-10 hours a week on the project and you have some experience in VR or javascripting.**

**If interested please send me a CV no later than 15 September.**

Here's my experience:

1) Unity experience

Back in high school, I made a very simple 2D Space Shooter game on Unity. That's about all the experience I have with it. And it's been so long ago I've forgotten most of it. And VR requires 3D game design knowledge I presume, which I lack.

2) Some JavaScript programming knowledge

I know C++, Java, and Python. But I have no knowledge of JavaScript. I've heard it's much easier than Java though.

3) Some experience in VR

I have literally worn a VR headset once in my life. And that's about it.

I am very well aware that there's a high chance I'll be rejected. But in the slim chance that I don't, I'm willing to spend time learning about Unity VR. I've found some nice courses on Udemy that I can use to help me learn more about this stuff.

But I'm also scared that it'll be a lot of workload and it might start to affect my grades (I'm taking hard courses this sem). So I'm just so confused but also fed up of letting so many opportunities pass.

What do you guys think I should do?

TLDR: Exciting, dream job opportunity came up but I don't know whether I should apply for it or not since I don't fulfill the sufficient requirements for it and I'm scared of risking my grades because of it."

Preface - Years back my place of employment(dairy production) had an intern do the dirty work of creating an excel file to document scheduled cleaning tasks. Took months as it was typed up for a year with monthly, quarterly, annually tasks in over 10 areas/departments. Things need to be changed yearly ie. dates, adding and removing tasks. It is a nightmare making changes with poor formatting to prevent a person from dragging the auto-fill option and no formulas to automate anything like the dates. Someone was changing the dates by hand!

So I have fixed the dates. Easy. Type beginning date in one cell all weeks on all sheets update. 

https://preview.redd.it/2q0ckxavi9m71.jpg?width=724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd16acbcbd29311ea0a25a02b135dcd3c252c27d

My Challenge - Initial entering of weekly tasks is easy by just dragging that auto-fill box. But then with with monthly and the other occurrences they would get messed up if you auto-fill dragging over them.  So I desire for a better solution would be to use some kind of VBA code. But I have only ever copy-paste code and don't know how to create code.

Desired Code - I assume it would have to first identify the cells of a week. Then take tasks from a list and insert in the next empty cell. For the less frequent occurrences the list would have a begin date and code will gap it accordingly. 

Where should I start with this? Easy code? or Go get a coding degree to figure it out?"

I started working when I was 16, and worked my way up to be a manager in a very high stress industry (IT-related), starting as an intern. Now I'm the only person in the company who does what I do, and I'm responsible for all of our clients.

The pressure is too much. I feel sick with stress constantly. My memory is suffering. I can barely sleep but I'm tired all the time. I spend hours procrastinating because everything just feels too overwhelming.

Nobody at work has noticed anything, but I know that I'm not doing everything I should be doing. I am terrified of someone realising that I just procrastinate half the day.

I've considered quitting my job, but I don't know what else I'd do. This niche position is the only thing I know how to do, and now at 25, I feel like it's too late to switch directions. I also have had to pay for my own rent and living expenses and etc since I was 18 so I don't have a huge amount of money saved up that I can fall back on. Almost all of my monthly salary goes to my expenses. I live alone, so nobody can support me either while I figure it out.

I worked a part time job in the service industry, and I found it a lot less stressful. But going to that full time would mean half the money I'm getting now, and I don't see how that would benefit my future.

Has anyone ever been in this situation? How do I get the clarity I need to know wtf I need to do?"

The classes I am taking are definately rigorous, but I am currently debating whether I should pursue a statistics minor. The reason behind this is a potential interest in Machine Learning and AI, and I felt this minor would foster that.

Here are the factors to weigh.

Pursue the statistics minor:

\- Graduation is strictly 4 years (based on balancing classes with breadth)

\- Foundation or at least some sort of foundation toward ML/AI

Stick with just a CS Degree:

\- Could potentially have a quarter off to pursue an internship or continue a summer internship

\- Graduate in 3 years (with one hell of a quarter, all stem classes) or 3 years and 1-2 quarters if the above is decided

Appreciate any advice, as I truly want to see if this minor is worth it."

I am currently on course for a high 2:1, but there's still a chance I could get a first class.

However when I look at my resume/CV, I realise that it is very empty, at least compared to the ones people post in this sub. I essentially haven't done anything apart from going to school. Now I am of course aware that prop trading firms recruit top talent, the whole process is extremely competitive, and there will be many people applying that have a number of meaningful internships, programming projects they have undertaken, things that employers generally like to see during a resume screen. And I am sitting here without any trading or even finance-related internship, and I only know the pure basics of Python, nowhere near a level where I can actually utilise it do something useful. So my original plan was to spend the near future learning more Python, do something that will actually demonstrate my interest in quant trading, acquire some work experience, and apply for a position when my application will at least look passable on paper.

But from what I read on some prop trading firms' websites (eg Optiver) , and from what I gathered from posts/comments in this sub and websites like WSO and Glassdoor, I understand that a few companies weed off most applicants through a mental maths test, rather than their resume? And during later rounds there's lots of probability/statistics brainteasers, numerical reasoning, pattern recognising, market making games etc? And that for trading roles, they don't even require prior proficiency in programming (this was very surprising to me)? I am assuming that they will teach everything to successful applicants in the first weeks/months? Now I believe I am not too bad at mental maths, can answer most of the brainteaser type of questions pretty well, and with more practice can surely improve further. I am also not a complete stranger to basic financial concepts, so can probably handle simple technical questions too should they ask those. Personality wise, I'd like to think that I am pretty chill and relaxed, and probably come off as someone who is curious and eager to learn. So if it is actually the case that these companies hire largely on the basis of applicants' performance in these interviews that focus on your abilities to quickly do maths and proficiency in probability concepts, I'm thinking that I might stand a tiny tiny chance (also I think having the experience of going through the whole process and getting to a later round itself is worthwhile anyway), but my biggest worry is that I simply won't get past the resume screen. So I am not too sure of whether I should even bother with prop trading firms now because my resume is laughable, or is experience not as important in prop trading as it is in, say, IB, and that there are success stories with people like me getting in for grad roles? 

Thank you for taking time to read this and I would appreciate it if someone gave me a reality check on my chances at prop trading firms, and if the reality is that the recruiters at these firms will at most chuckle before throwing away my resume, I would be grateful if someone could briefly advise me on the kind of positions that I could viably apply for now and which could strengthen my prospects when it comes to applying for prop trading Jobs in the future. Also any suggestions when it comes to improving my programming skills are also very welcome :)

TL;DR: Lazy bastard left it too late to think about his career, but is decent at maths so thinks he might be able to have a go at prop trading firms. Is he completely deluded or just slightly overly optimistic?"

How do I take most advantage of that finite time? I’ve done research on the company and position. Do I ask if they hire bootcamp grads or just avoid mentioning it and show my projects? Do we just go over my resume? Do I mention I already have a bachelor’s in Communications? Do I do the soft part of an interview and ask what type of person they look for and what their company is like? Do companies really hire grads after 15 min chat with them? Cos that’s what my school is making it seem like. 

Thanks for reading my post. I’ve learned so much from this sub! 

One unrelated question ... Do people submit photos on their angelist profile? I don’t want to be accepted or denied based on my appearance idk maybe that’s irrational."

pkndw0,2,2021-09-08,Best Locations for Most Career Opportunities,Randominternetuser_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pkndw0/best_locations_for_most_career_opportunities/,"Hey I'm an upcoming CS freshman studying here in Germany. As an American however and from what research has shown me, I feel the need to be at the ""center"" of the industry which seems to be the states. Before I ask my question however, I wanted to provide some context to it and under what conditions I am asking it.

Since this is a career forum I feel it may also be important to emphasize interesting potential career path for me: University and Internships -&gt; working in Big Tech while investing -&gt; Creating a startup

For such a career path things such as:

1. tax incentives
2. networking
3. being close to big tech (geographically)
4. low cost of living
5. somewhat 'credible'/'prestigious' university degree
6. Longterm Career Opportunities (where the industry is heading)

While these conditions are very utopian, my question is what top 5 locations in America would suit the above described conditions? As far as I know Silicone Valley and California in general is becoming increasingly unattractive for businesses which seems to be explaining a lot of the migration of tech companies to Texas for instance due to the tax incentives. Other than San Francisco and LA in CA it also seems that Seattle, Boston, Austin, New York, Dallas, Phoenix, Chicago, Atlanta and Denver are also very involved in the industry. The question just becomes which one is closest. To save people time I wanted to illustrate the following list from impressions and research (I DONT CLAIM THIS IS IS WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS LIKE). I would appreciate any edits AND RANKING OF STATES on the list opinion on what the best location is for me to get as far as possible under the given parameters

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the internship I messaged my MB and main analyst I worked with to thank them over the phone (I was remote). 

The MD says in a message that he wants to speak with me about a potential full time offer but he was busy at the time and that we’d talk over the weekend.  Fast forward to now (2.5 weeks later) and I’ve heard nothing.  I followed up with him and got no response.

I spoke with the main analyst on the phone the day after I finished the internship and mentioned the MD mentioned talking to me about a full time position and the analyst thought that would be awesome and seemed very into the idea.

My issue is that I don’t know how to approach this situation professionally.

My boss and coworkers were nice and such, but I realized that the corporate, office, 9-5 job really sucks for me. I also realized that imo the business industry seems very schemy, greedy, and a bit evil tbh lol.


I kind of don’t like the business world that much before this internship. Everyone was advocating it a lot, even my advisor, and I felt pressured to do it to get “experience”. I have worked summer and part-time jobs before, and I liked them. However, I personally don’t like the idea of an internship (even with pay) because of how demeaning it sounds. You’re basically an “employee of an employee”. 

It was worse because marketing is only an alternative for me (I originally wanted to do the arts) and my family’s money-making expectations (in other words, I kinda hate the major already). So, I decided to do the internship not only for college credits but also to give it a shot and see if it’s that was really the case, and unfortunately it is.

Has anyone gone through this before? If so, what did you do about it?"

pksefn,1,2021-09-09,Should I come out to my family? [20F],RiddleEatsRainbows,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pksefn/should_i_come_out_to_my_family_20f/,"I've known that I'm bisexual for a very long time, but these past 1-2 years have really been the time where it's sort of bothering me that I haven't come out to my family yet. I have come out to my brother (who literally does not care unless necessary), but my parents don't know yet. 

Sure, I hide a lot of things from my parents, but that doesn't mean I don't feel guilty about it. I'm fully aware that coming out would be a huge weight lifted from my shoulders, which is why there's that constant itch to just get it over with. 

The main issue at hand- well firstly, I promised myself that I wouldn't come out to my family until I was fully financially independent and living a country away from them, so basically not until the end of college. Thanks to the pandemic I'm back in their house and doing college online, and internships don't exactly pay enough for me to consider myself 'financially independent'. I mean, my dad still very lovingly pays for my education and has money saved away for my masters (and potentially a PhD as well because he knows that's most likely gonna be the route that I take). I made this promise to myself because I've seen a common sentiment that you shouldn't come out unless you're safe, and I don't want to risk losing my education or something (even though that's 99.99% highly unlikely because of how much my parents value it).

Secondly, I'm just not sure what to make of my parents' beliefs. My mom has said borderline homophobic things in the past, plus there was one time where I ALMOST came out but instantly retracted because she said ""You're VERY feminine, you like boys, it's just a phase, you'll find a boyfriend soon"". I also once presented a hypothetical to her about how she'd feel about my brother being gay (idk if he is or not, don't really care unless I have to) and she explicitly said that while there would be nothing she could do about it, she would definitely feel disappointed. 

As for my dad, he's just weirdly ambiguous. He said something homophobic once about gays being 'unnatural' but proceeded to apologize to me later saying he didn't realize I would be so affected because I absolutely flipped out and yelled at him for being backwards and narrow-minded. Come to think of it, I'm surprised he didn't think I was queer just from that incident. Maybe he does, idk. But apart from this, I literally have no clue what he thinks. He keeps a poker face when there's any news on television pertaining to the LGBTQ+ community, so I have no idea there either.

Another thing worth mentioning I guess is that we live in a country where there's the death penalty for queer folks, and our native country is only JUST starting to accept that queer people are allowed to exist. Gay marriage hasn't been legalized there yet. I personally aspire to work hard and get the hell out so I can move to a country that's accepting and where I can be myself.

So yeah that's the end of my infodump- should I come out? Will I be okay?"

I am currently in the process of getting a Master's in Math, and I will *probably* (although not definitely) earn along with it a Master's in Machine Learning as well- from Carnegie Mellon. 


I have zero internship experience in any field (CS or Finance or whatever), but I do have good grades and some background in probability and statistics, etc. 


I've recently been interested in a career in finance and I would (a) like to gauge how attractive I am in the job market given the qualifications I listed above, and (b) get a feel for what jobs I should be looking for. 


As for (b) - the primary ones are the quant positions, yeah? Quant Trading and Researching? I was wondering what other math-oriented and profile-appropriate finance jobs would best fit me (both in terms of ability to obtain job, and suitability to my profile above); what about things like derivatives trading or fund manager, etc? Generally I was hoping someone could give me an outline of what positions I should look out for when looking for a job. 


As for (a) - based on my education, and keeping in mind that I have 0 professional or internship experience in any field, how much of an advantage and/or disadvantage do I have? I know I'm very late, but I am planning to apply for internships for this summer, which I will start doing ASAP.

There's two options: Data Engineering or Web Development.

I am quite conflicted here because, in my eyes, they both have their benefits and drawbacks. I am okay with doing both, maybe a 60/40 preference to Web Development since I have done a bit of it before, on my own time.

Data Engineering is more of a specialist field and its harder to get into than Web Dev perhaps. It's also something new for me which is exciting in itself.

Web Development, on the other hand, is the buzz I guess. I have also done some personal projects in web dev so I'm familiar with it to an extent. However the relative barrier to entry is low and whatnot.

My question is probably the long term implications of choosing either track. I know it's just an internship and I can change my path later on but what would give me a better start? What about other opportunities down the line, which track would help me get into a big tech company? Lastly, how is the pay in each of these tracks?

Thank you very much for your time and advice!

TLDR; which track is better, in terms of long term opportunities and pay, for an intern: data or web dev?"

Hello Citizen of Reddit,

I recently finished my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering in Germany.  
I'm starting my master in the same university this October. Along with my masters, I'm starting a handsomely paid internship at a promising deep-tech startup.

But yesterday I got a gap year Job offer from a major German automotive manufacturer. they are paying almost 85% more salary but I can not take the masters exam. With an internship at a startup, I can still take few exams from my master's module and get some progress. Both the jobs will have similar responsibilities.

Now the only issue is I have already signed the contract at startup and I'm supposed to start from 13 September. I'll be on one month probation period for 1 month.

I'm really confused about what I should do in this situation. at startup, I have the potential of learning lot more skills since they are growing rapidly and I'll have an opportunity to shape a company. moreover, they have a very relaxed work environment and every one is young and hungry.

At a major automotive manufacturer, I'll have brand value and a good salary but the work environment is a bit old school.

What would you do in this situation?

If I decide to go with a major manufacturer how do I resign from my position at startup? they have been very nice and considerate to me so far.

And if I reject the job offer from a major manufacturer how do I do it in a way that I don't burn a bridge for the future?"

pl02ai,0,2021-09-09,Frustration with HP printers and toner... talk me out of switching to another brand,Craig__D,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/pl02ai/frustration_with_hp_printers_and_toner_talk_me/,"I've been pretty loyal to HP for my \~25 years in IT.  I started using their minicomputer systems as an intern when I was in college (HP-UX) and was impressed with how well they supported it.  Good first impression.  I've always felt like their products were solid and reliable and their support has been pretty good.  At my current job we use HP printers and (HP Aruba) switches.  

I'm frustrated because when it's time to buy a new printer for someone (a workgroup, department, or individual) I always look at the most recent printer we ordered for a similar need and (try to) get one of those.  That way we minimize the number of toner cartridge models we have to manage, order, and keep on hand.  That inventory can get pretty crazy.

It seems as though HP knows that we want to do this, and intentionally changes toner cartridges with each model.  It's pretty difficult to order a printer a year later that uses the same cartridge as the one you ordered previously.  I mean, do the cartridges HAVE to be different, HP?  Can't you design your new printer to be like the old one?  On that note, is it really necessary to have new printer models so often?  I know there are some new features that need to be added from time to time (AirPrint, etc.), but can't those be done with a firmware update and/or maybe a new board?

I really don't mind the new printer models so much, but I DO wish they'd allow the same cartridge to be used on a more regular basis.

Are other manufacturers better about this?"
pl0kgh,2,2021-09-09,Digital Design Engineer Burnt Out by Impossible Task,YUNGCorleone,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/pl0kgh/digital_design_engineer_burnt_out_by_impossible/,"Apologies in advance if this sounds more like venting, but I need to get more perspective since I'm not receiving proper guidance at my job.

So I work in digital design for a large chip manufacturing company, going on more than 5 years now, and I've started to realize digital design isn't for me. There isn't a lot of room for learning and growth at my company, and it feels like I'm doing mostly paper work by implementing other people's solutions in my design. Also, I was never great at computer architecture in college; I have an electrical engineering degree, with a C+ in my introduction to computer engineering class and a B+ in the secondary class that was required by my job, and was mostly coding in MIPS, which is now a defunct language. Even during the internship I had with this company, I was left to my own devices to develop a Kanban board with Javascript that I highly doubt they even used, and given an hour lecture every other week of the actual work they do there. I really only took this job because of the pay and the clout behind the name of the company, which I thought would make my parents happy. 

I've been looking to apply to software engineering jobs for a while, since I enjoyed the programming experience I've received from school and my research position while I was there (C++, Python and MATLAB) and have taken every opportunity at my job to develop code to expedite our flow (Python, TCL, and Shell Scripting mostly). I suppose it's a lot more stimulating and makes more sense to me than does computer engineering; also it doesn't hurt that I'm excellent at math. I've also taught myself HTML and CSS by myself, and am learning SQL on code academy since I heard it's important for data science and engineering.

I haven't left the company because of a combination of things, but mostly to see if my job would improve with time or if I would be able to translate my coding experience into a design verification engineering role. 

But the project I'm working on at the moment is the straw that broke the camels back...

I was given a design to work on for this project on another team four months ago. However, at this point, I'm very far behind, I feel like I'm drowning in work and I have no one to talk to about my issues. The only other design I've ever worked on before was VERY small and a lot less complex compared what I'm working on now. In addition, I received bad data to work with in the beginning and now I have to make up for it, and we always have to restart the design flow since new issues keep creeping up with the overall project. In general, it seems like a poorly organized operation. I actually sent an email to the project manager a while ago telling him about these issues and lack of direction, wondering where I should be at that point; he just said that everything was normal and that I shouldn't worry, which I don't believe since I see and hear new issues popping up every week. 

I'm not sure why my manager thought it was a good idea to assign me to this, especially since we're using and developing (at the same time) a completely new flow. I asked my manager to take me off or at least assign me someone to help out because of my situation, and he said they have nobody to take over at the moment; he then mentions that the other guy that was put on this project with me (he's not working on my design, but on floor planning for the top level) was supposed to mentor me, but apparently he's dealing with a lot of personal issues so that's why he can't help out. But when I talk to this person, he seems to be clueless about this arrangement, which leads me to believe my manager is just trying to cover his ass...

I'm just VERY exhausted at the moment from all the stress this project is putting on me. And all the extra work I put in this weekend just became useless because solutions I attempted to implement are only making things worse. In my 5 years of working at this company, the only 2 nervous breakdowns I've had have been from this project.  

This all has led me to finally reach the definitive conclusion that I should start finding new work elsewhere, preferably a software engineering role or a design verification engineering role, which might be a bit more suitable for me since it's in the field I've had experience in. However, I'm not sure what to do while I'm looking for a position elsewhere. I'm not sure if I should quit without having anything lined up, but I'm not sure how much longer I can stay on this without sacrificing my mental health. And I doubt my manager will be sympathetic to my situation. 

So I guess I have a couple of questions. How hard would it be to line up a software engineering interview with my experience? I'm trying to find a remote position because my girlfriend might have to move to Boston at some point but she's not sure yet. Are there any certificates I can earn online that would make me more employable as a software engineer? Also, and I guess this is the big one, should I quit before I have anything lined up? I know I'll have to talk to my girlfriend about this first, but I wanted to get a gauge of what you guys thought. I highly doubt my situation will improve at this point, and I doubt management will work with me to find a role that's suitable for me. How do I approach this situation to my manager 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

I started apply for jobs around the NYC, Long Island, and NJ area. So far I've made my resumes to tackle jobs  that involve technologies such as Python, Java, C++, SQL, and JS.

As I'm job searching, I've purchased some Udemy courses to complete to keep up with my knowledge and to have a certificate on the resume (Not sure if employers care about this so let me know if I'm wasting my time or not). The courses include Python, java, c++, web development, SQL, and React. 

I've heard many people say that they've all found work somewhere else and have had to move outside the NYC area. I just wanted to know if it's hopeless trying to get a job around here. It just seems so competitive and the one chance that I thought I had was in NJ. I'm starting to think that these contracting companies where you sign your soul away for 2 years might be my only chance. 

I currently have no internships and the only work experience that I have is being an aircraft mechanic for 2 years. I've made a bit of a portfolio but I don't think it's enough yet. Which is why I'm using the Udemy courses to bump it up. 

Overall any advice would be appreciated, I know it's only been a little over a month since I'm applying but just seeing every ""entry"" level job around my area still requiring 2-3 years of experience is so depressing. Thank you all of the help."

I was pretty shocked that interns would get asked a LC hard. I went online afterwards and saw my brute force, my own solution, and then there was another solution that was even more optimal.

I'm a 4th year pharmacy student and during my summer internship in a neurobiology lab I was shortly exposed to the world of chemoinformatics. Phd students were doing a little of docking, to see ligand and receptor interactions before testing it for real...-.  There was also one course in my 3rd year related to this that I really liked. 

I feel instantly drawn by the field, because I already like informatics and programming in general (playing with Arduino and following some Github DIY projects, using 3D softwares for modelling and drawing...). It seems like the perfect balance between everything I enjoy. Now, I consider pursuing my studies with a Msc related to drug design/chemoinformatics. 

In the long run, I would like to get a PhD in a bioinformatics/computational chemistry focused program, and then work in industry. But, for now I need to work on my computational skills before I can seriously think about it.

I guess the best way to get programming skills is to gain practical experience as soon as possible. I'm already learning the theory and some fundamentals with options in my University and Coursera (Python, Maths for machine learning for example, but if you know any great courses to follow I will appreciate your recommendation!). 

**Here are the questions:** 

 \-What personal projects can I start by myself to get hands-on (analyzing set of available datas, coding a game...), especially if I'm interested in chemoinformatics or computational genomics? 

\-Do you know any collaborative works/associations related to bioinformatics that allow people to do things and learn together? 

\- I want to get an internship in an bioinformatics-related lab, but I don't have any academical background in it for now, what programming skills should I develop in priority to appear ""internshipable""? 

\-Related to the question above, how can I make my CV more attractive with a pharmacy backround ? (I have knowledge in pharmacology, genomics, some chemistry... I guess I should try labs that are gravitating around drug conception and health-related research in general?)

Thanks in advance for any thoughts/recommations you will give."

My boss and coworkers were nice and such, but I realized that the corporate, office, 9-5 job really sucks for me. I also realized that imo the business industry seems very schemy, greedy, and a bit evil tbh lol.

I kind of don’t like the business world that much before this internship. Everyone was advocating it a lot, even my advisor, and I felt pressured to do it to get “experience”. I have worked summer and part-time jobs before, and I liked them. However, I personally don’t like the idea of an internship (even with pay) because of how demeaning it sounds. You’re basically an “employee of an employee”. 

It was worse because marketing is only an alternative for me (I originally wanted to do the arts) and my family’s money-making expectations (in other words, I kinda hate the major already). So, I decided to do the internship not only for college credits but also to give it a shot and see if it’s that was really the case, and unfortunately it is.

I'm a 3rd year student doing a B.S. in Computer Systems at a relatively good (roughly top 100) state school in the US.

Lately I've been working on more projects to try and change this, but so far I've gotten rejected from every internship that I applied to. By the time I graduate I'll have one internship at most, probably a few projects, and that's it.

Do you think that's cause for concern? Honestly, I feel envious of the people getting great job offers upon graduation, and so part of me wants to go for a Master's just so I have that extra 2 years to gain experience and get opportunities I never could at this rate. And this feeling is encouraged by a guy at my university who stayed and did his MA in comp sci, then graduated and got hired at NASA. That is obviously a very high goal, but it seems like a good argument for staying. What do you guys think, though? What should I do here?"

The landscape for Entry-level positions seems bleak and unresponsive. You can't get a job without experience. You can't get experience without a job. How are you supposed to get into this cycle if you aren't already in it? 

This is the predicament I find myself in. Companies like Revature seem to be offering an entry point into this cynical system. Yet, all of you seem to say that Revature may be a backstabber and unreliable. So please tell me, people of this sub, what then are my options?

This is an honest plea for help. I don't know who to trust and I'm tired of working retail. I wasn't able to get an internship while I was in college and my late completed degree, by fault of the college, chased away an opportunity I found at a job fair. That opportunity was already by chance and it's far more unlikely to find another. 

To make matters worse, I have an Electrical Engineering degree, and I don't have the budget to go back to school. I do want to get into the feild of CS and SE, I much prefered that side of my degree. However, they way I see it is ""Why hire an EE for a SE job who doesn't even have experience"".

I hadn’t been able to net another before everything shut down, so I had to wait things out while the pandemic raged, my start date having been pushed back an entire quarter. I was paid less than everybody else I knew (75K while everybody else made 80) but took the opportunity as a way to gain experience; the team was a good one with a supportive lead and knowledgeable, fun people to boot. My undergrad GPA was pretty low, and I had no internship experience, so I believed that I was going to have to take what I can get.

As we made out way into 2021, the brain drain began; first went one lead, then two seniors, then two fellow juniors.

pla5fn,17,2021-09-09,Executive Collapse (= ADHD?),feldomatic,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/pla5fn/executive_collapse_adhd/,"Background: diagnosed with recurring major depression 2 years ago, smart but troubled kid turned tech/military leader type 39yo.

I left the military this spring, and managed to get a job, but the telework and some contract turnover has kept me out of an office environment for most of the last 6 months.  

I've always had issues with time blindness, and executive function, but the structure of school and military life gave me just enough external pressure to keep things mostly together.

But looking back, every time there has been a structural break or pause, I've gone into what I now call executive collapse, i.e. my brain goes into perpetual weekend mode and can't organize or execute shit.

Summer breaks? Got fuck all done except for the times I had a summer job or internship.

First two years after college? Complete waste of space and had major issues taking some part time grad classes with basically no job.

Transition from grueling sea duty to cake shore duty? Could barely keep my shit together.

Work from home? Ahahahahahahahahahah.
I have some productive days but mostly languish.

Its like when I'm in a place that gives a foundation, I can at least move in a productive direction, but in a total absence of 'pressure' I'm as paralyzed as when there's too much.

And its not that I don't know how to plan, organize, coordinate, etc.  I'll sit down and write organizational and executive planning idea documents all day...because that's creative and stimulating to do.
But get up and actually do any of those things? The walls of awful build and actually encircle me in what might as well be the ""well of awful""

TLDR: anyone else get worse when they leave a structured environment?"

pldfxe,1,2021-09-09,About Grad School,StellarAnomaly8,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/pldfxe/about_grad_school/,"Preface: I'm set to graduate in 3 years with a BS due to finishing coursework during high school. I have an internship at Amazon next summer (before my third/senior year) and I'm planning to perform excellently to get a return offer.

Now, I have a dilemma about grad school. I really think grad school would be valuable for me to grow intellectually and get into more specialized roles at a tech company. However, I'm not confident in having a strong application by the end of this year. I feel like everything has rushed by too quickly (due to the fact that last year was all virtual and I'm set to graduate next year), and I'm especially concerned by my lack of research experience. My school actually offers a program to author an undergrad thesis, but I can only take that next year due to some pending prerequisites.

With that being said, I am part of my school's programming team and have done well in that respect, and was able to become an officer this year. I am pretty confident I can get a strong reccomendation from our faculty sponsor.

So, what should I do? Should I try and extend into a 4th year, take a full time offer from Amazon if I can get it and think about an MS later, or just try winging applications?"

I'm really conflicted if I made the right decision at this point in time. I worked at this medical company for about a year with the dreams of being a Software Engineer.

I still hold my old title (With a slight promotion) and also Software Engineer. I accepted when I was a Mid Junior in college and now I have two semesters left.

The only downside I really see is the codebase is outdated. (Java JSP) Will this affect my future endeavors with my career path? Did I make the right decision to take school part-time to pursue this fulltime?

I am currently a math major at university, I was in engineering but I never really wanted to be engineer. I always liked math, I thought it was the way to be disciplined, thoughtful and people who major in math passionately end up doing really good things later down the road.

I was never confident in my abilities, always stuck in the comfort zone, I'd get told Im ""smart"" by professors, teachers and people around me. But I never felt that way, I did well in math and really enjoyed it. But I was afraid of it, so I did engineering for 3 years, and switched to math after making a decision. 

I was depressed in engineering in one of the semesters I got a very low GPA and my cumulative was reduced drastically. I didn't take things serious, was worried and was never confident. I thought I'd decide, and make a change and I did. Online teaching hasn't been kind to me and I never developed discipline as a kid. So I am struggling now as an adult (20 year old) the only courses I did well were math. Engineering were straight C's. 

Switched with a low gpa, third year and I just feel very behind, I feel like I shouldn't have changed but I still enjoy math a lot. I have always had negative feelings, and I saw them dissolve when I switched. Began new habits (going to GYM, learning programming, reading books etc...) I did, and enjoyed and felt like I am accomplishing something. But I still feel very behind. There are people in my class who double major, take 6 courses every semester (18 credits ish) and get straight A's. I just feel I can never be this level, and feel like I cannot go very far in life, because I did not develop skills as a kid like discipline or consistency or anything really. Wasted time looking at others achievements, and hiding behind my screen, playing a game, or watching something to make me forget. All I seek, is self-improvement, achievement and a sense of value, I want to wake up with value, knowing I'm doing and improving. I still code, learn and read and train at the gym (Began all this in May-ish) but I feel like I'm very late, and have no hope of becoming something valuable in the future. 

This post isn't meant to make people who read this feel depressed or anything but I just don't know anymore. What  will I be, where will I be, I can't figure it out, it seems that I have so many opportunities, yet I can't grasp any due to lack of skill and I feel that I cannot develop anything, truly wishing time can be rewinded and taken things   seriously. Seeing most people I know are high achievers, have really interesting CV's and doing interns. I just feel that I will never be looked at. Lost potential, or maybe just a failure?"
plnykx,117,2021-09-10,Places to avoid in the dreamscape – The Tower,ChristianWallis,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/plnykx/places_to_avoid_in_the_dreamscape_the_tower/,"“I’m not listening to another lecture on Jung. There have been three in the last six weeks.”

“Don’t then,” I said with a shrug as I stirred sugar into my coffee. “But Dr Newman attended your talk on inductive bias.”

“Nobody made him.”

“Yeah but he knew it’d be rude not to show up to a colleague’s presentation,” I replied. I didn’t want to hammer my point home. No one *had* to do anything.

“Are you going?” she asked.

“Oh God no,” I said. “There have been three lectures on Jung in the last six weeks. But Dr Newman isn’t a colleague. He’s my staff.”

“One rule for me, another for thee?”

“Not at all,” I said. “If you happen to find a mysterious old computer hidden deep in the basement of a university campus, running an unexplained algorithm that could revolutionise our understanding of not only human consciousness, but the laws of physics as well, then you too can have your own staff and make them follow all sorts of rules.”

“Do you know where another one of these computers might be?” she asked.

“Funnily enough, after I found the first one, I stopped looking.”

“I guess I’ll go to the lecture,” she whined. “Oh God I’ll go and listen to it all again. But when it’s my turn, I’m bringing out my slides on stochastic gradient descent.”

“You’ll frighten us psychologists.”

She flashed a tired smile.

“You sure you’re not gonna come?” she asked.

“No I’ve got to track the algorithm’s output for tonight.”

“Like hell you do,” she scoffed. “That’s an intern’s job. And if I tried working the hours you did I’d be kicked out in a week. None of the time limitations seem to apply to you. And I’m pretty sure I’ve caught you napping at your desk more than once.”

The last time an intern had fallen asleep in the facility they’d woken up numb from the waist down. They swore on their mother’s grave they’d been paralysed since a car accident in their teens, and that they’d only dreamed they could walk. When we showed them the video footage of them strolling into the lab that morning they became hysterical and had to be hospitalised. They fell into a coma just a few days later and died quickly after that, killed by what our physicists thought might be some kind of exotic radiation poisoning.

We used the coroner’s photographs to spook new hires into following the rules.

It was profoundly effective.

“The algorithm likes me,” I joked. “You know if you’re feeling up for it, you can come back to the lab and we’ll have some drinks in the observation chamber.”

“I thought alcohol’s not allowed in the facility?” she asked.

“Ah, but as you just pointed out, none of the rules apply to me.”

\-

*A shoe on a slide, the playground behind it visible, but out of focus,* I wrote. I was sat at a random desk with my feet up on someone else’s stuff, a notepad propped up on my lap. I was working on my second whiskey and could already feel a gentle buzz take me over. The screen went black and the room was thrown into darkness and I waited patiently for the next image. The monitor came to life with an audible clunk followed by the sound of static and a rising whine. I watched as another scene appeared.

*A stair well with spidery graffiti on the walls. Symbols appear to belong to standard alphabet, but upon closer inspection are gibberish. Likely location is the tower.*

“I hate that one.”

I turned awkwardly to look at Kim standing in the door.

“How was the talk?” I asked.

“Same thing as always. Something about a collective unconscious with external pseudolocations that we all visit in our sleep via dreams. The algorithm is somehow capable of visiting these places, they draw from shared experiences but may possibly originate from elsewhere as well… so on and so on. As much as I hate to admit it, sometimes I think you psychologists are the only ones even close to figuring this thing out.”

I shrugged.

The screen went dark, then white, and then a new scene appeared.

*Dutch angle of a railyard. In the foreground we see a caboose with a sliding door partially opened. Two pale fingers clutch at the door, holding it closed. The fingers look human, possibly a child’s.*

When I finished scribbling I saw that Kim had pulled up another chair to sit beside me.

“You know the second I found this thing I knew what it was showing me,” I said. “Everyone knows because somehow, whether we admit it or not, the things it shows us are familiar. And whether it’s quantum mechanics or the collective unconscious, we’re just trying to describe what we already know to be true - this thing is a window into our dreams. No single group of researchers has more insight into how that’s possible, it’s just that some of us came prepared with the right vocabulary.”

“Is this you trying to make me feel better?” she asked as she reached down to her bag and pulled out a beer. She cracked it just in time for the screen to go dark. When it came back she winced from the glare and averted her eyes. I looked straight at the bright light and waited for the newest image.

*A man holds a mug bound in human skin. It has a face. The eye sockets are empty. No scene is visible in the background.* I stopped writing and stared at my notes before adding a small addendum. *I think this is one of mine. Will check dream journal at home and update.*

“Squinting at that tiny screen is killing me,” Kim said as the screen went dark with another clunk. “Do we have to sit in the dark?”

I considered turning the lights on when I saw the old projector sitting on Dr Allman’s desk. He’d brought it in weeks ago for a presentation and clearly forgotten to take it home.

“Hmm, there might be another option,” I said.

\-

“Is it me or is the resolution better?”

Kim was right. The image, now blown up, was not blurry or out of focus at all. It had scaled up perfectly, and what had once been a few grey pixels on the old display were transformed into new and vivid details. This was the kind of image ‘enhancement’ usually reserved for cheese crime procedurals.

“Sharper than any photograph I’ve ever seen,” she said. “How expensive is that damned projector?”

“It’s not the projector,” I replied. “It can’t be. The images this thing outputs are usually 800 x 600. There’s no way it could be this sharp.”

“Just another mystery to add to the pile? New display, new images?”

“You know I wanted to try this years ago but everyone threw a tantrum that it might interfere with the algorithm,” I said. “I think they forgot I had six weeks alone with the computer when I first found it and would regularly switch up displays. Never tried a projector though.”

I sat back down in my chair with an audible *oomph* and took up my notepad to quickly wrote down what was on the screen.

*A children’s play centre is visible, ball pit to the right, climbing frame to the left. Everything else is darkness.*

I squinted at the life-sized image and leaned forward in my chair.

*A child’s face is visible in the ball pits,* I added. *They look afraid and are staring into the distance.*

The scream went dark and I was left with a strange feeling in my stomach, like I’d just left someone to die. I shook it off just as a new image appeared. It was a long-dilapidated hallway with broken down doors and peeling wallpaper. Water damaged carpet swelled along the floor, grossly discoloured from years of mould and decay. You could practically smell the rank odour of damp wood and crumbling masonry. I immediately felt my stomach curl up in reaction to the sight.

*the tower,* I wrote. *Severely run-down residential location, similar to apartment block. Small section of interior apartment visible through broken down door. Corner of cabinet or possibly some other form of furniture can be seen within.*

“I hate the tower,” Kim said.

“You’ve been there?” I asked. She nodded. “Most of us have,” I added. “We think it only appears to people who work in this facility. Or at least, if there are references to it in wider culture, we haven’t worked them out.”

“I’ll remember that the next time I’m having a nightmare and I’m hiding under a motel bed.”

I nodded sympathetically. Something about the tower engendered a specific type of nightmare, the kind that felt as if it lasted all night and was so lucid as to be real. There was an internal consistency that defied the usual dream logic so that the dream never transitioned into a dinner with your late aunt Margaret. You were stuck there all night, finding relief only when you woke up soaked head to toe in sweat with a scream trapped in your throat. As a nightmare, it was infamous for sending more than a few elderly researchers to hospital with cardiac arrest. Details of the location varied from person to person so that sometimes the tower was a hotel, sometimes it was an apartment block, once it was even a multistorey carpark. But it was always an infinitely tall building through which the dreamer would be chased upwards by some invisible presence, the surrounding walls on the verge of collapse as the impossible skyscraper wobbled side-to-side in hurricane winds.

It was particularly rough on those with a fear of heights, amplifying our anxiety so severely that many would struggle to ever step foot in an elevator again.

I was lost in concentration when the light flickered and Kim cried out.

“What the fuck was that?” she snapped.

“What was what?” I asked.

“A shadow passed over the camera!” she cried. “As if someone had blocked its light source.”

I looked back at the hallway and watched carefully for signs of motion. Maybe it was my imagination, or just the vivid clarity of the realistic display, but I could almost smell the festering plaster and airborne dust. The longer I stared, the more I convinced I became that the image was somehow three-dimensional. I’d visited the tower thousands of times in my own dreams but could only ever recall patchy glimpses of its layout and vague notions of suffering and threat. But seeing that hallway displayed in life-like proportions brought all those suppressed details back from my subconscious. I was struck by memories of cowering under dressers and in wardrobes while listening to the distant roar of apocalyptic winds pouring through exposed rebar and shattered glass. I remembered sneaking on my hands and knees as my palms dug into broken down bricks and splintered furniture, terrified that I would make too much noise and attract outside attention. And when I inevitably did slip up, I could remember the pulse-pounding terror of pursuit through spiralling stairwells and curving corridors, my heart racing as my mind dared to contemplate the horror of my capture at the hands of…

“Is it me, or did you just feel a breeze?”

It was Kim who spoke.

My mind split in two as it processed what she said. A part of me knew instinctively that she was wrong, or hallucinating, or I’d fallen asleep and this whole thing was just a convoluted dream. But another part told me that she was right, that the screen had taken on an impossible level of depth and reality, and that I had been feeling a stiff but persistent breeze for as long as I’d been looking at that screen. Something that was simply impossible.

But it was real, and I could feel it and I could hear it, and I could even smell it.

“I think you’re right,” I whispered.

Kim went to speak but was interrupted by the sound of falling stonework. When it dawned on me that the sound had come from behind us *in the room*, something inside my chest swelled so tight I thought my heart was going to explore.

Something breathed in the shadows just as the screen cut out and the room was sent plunging into darkness. The image had changed, and with it went all the sights and sounds and smells. Kim immediately burst into tears, and I’m pretty sure I was crying too. But I didn’t think about that. Instead I lunged forward and unplugged the projector before it could open up another nightmare.

\-

“You called me down here to tell me you met none of your targets?”

“Did you really expect me to have screenshots of Putin’s dreams?” I asked.

“That was what you quite literally promised us when you secured military funding,” the colonel replied. He appeared deadly serious, but I knew him well enough to pick out the remnants of a dry sense of humour buried in his wording.

We were stood in the observation room that had now been cleared out of almost all its furniture. As requested, the colonel had brought a small escort. They were just six men, but they were armed with some kind of assault rifle, and whether it made any sense or not, the sight of those guns gave me great comfort.

“Ah yes,” I said as I stepped up and began fiddling with the projector. “Well back then we thought we had a window into the dreamscape, through which all minds are connected.”

“And you’re telling me that you don’t?”

“I’m telling you it’s not a window,” I said as I turned the display on and the room lit up. The machine had been quietly cycling the whole time and was ready to show us what it had been working on. It did not disappoint.

I now stood in front of what appeared to be a stairwell in the tower.

“As you know we’ve always had a few members of the team dedicated to mapping out the ‘dreamscape’,” I said, even going so far as to use little air quotes just to ease everybody in. The colonel nodded readily, having heard it all before, but the soldier seemed less convinced. “Given recent events we have upgraded those members of the team and extended their budget and the personnel available. Work is progressing quickly but not quickly enough. The dreamscape is enormous, possibly even infinite. We have the tower,” I gestured to the glowing wall behind me, “but there are other locations too. There is also The Resort, The Commune, The Tunnels, The Manor, The Office, The Library, The Lab—”

“I read the report you sent over,” the colonel said. “What exactly are you getting at?”

I laughed nervously and finally turned to face the screen. This time the tower looked a little more corporate. The stairway was carpeted in a baby blue, and a broken frame held a faded poster of a calming mountain. It was easy to see how it would have once been a clean and cool location, the kind of sterile stairwell that connected lawyer offices to marketing offices to HR offices in some towering skyscraper in the centre of New York. Time, or whatever governed the dreamscape, had worn that once-clean steel handrail into something dirty and old, and the baby blue carpet had been pulled up in places to reveal a patchwork plaster floor. It was what would happen to any office in Time Square if the world ended tomorrow and scavengers passed through, and I had to avoid a shiver at the thought of how easily that kind of rot and decay could creep into the corners of our own real world.

For a second, I faltered. I’d been avoiding looking at it for a damn good reason. The tower had been a childhood night terror of mine, one I had never even guessed was shared by others until it popped up in the algorithm and other people recognised it. And now I was standing in front of a doorway to the literal stuff of nightmares. It was as if I carried a lifetime of repressed memories I could not access, but which I still *felt* deep inside my bones. I wanted so badly to flee, but there were bigger things at stake, so I swallowed that terror and forced myself to do the one thing I knew would convince the men behind me. There could be no room for doubt, or else we would never get the proper support.

Effortlessly, almost as though it didn’t take every ounce of strength in my body, I walked up to the screen, reached through, and grabbed a loose floor tile. It stank of fetid damp, and I noted with interest that the stench filled the room only once it was on the other side of the doorway. Not wanting to hold onto it for too long, I threw it at the colonel who failed to catch it (given the man was quite an athlete, that may have even been a first for him). It just hit him square in the chest and fell to the floor while he gazed, wide-eyed, at the buzzing portal behind me.

For a moment I forgot my own fear and began to laugh. In the early days my work had been hot property but that had been a long time ago. I’d spent a long time having all interest in my little miracle wane until it was just a shadow of what it had once been. It was nice to finally have some tangible progress to show off.

“It’s a door!” I cried, almost manic with laughter. “A door we can just walk right on through!”

Instead of awe, one of the soldiers gasped and the other five immediately raised their rifles to their shoulders. Even the colonel managed to draw a small pistol so quickly that his hand was a blur. All three barrels were pointing in my direction, but not quite *at* me. The implication finally sank in and I turned to face the doorway with an almost-certain premonition of my own death.

A pale arachnid-like finger had curled up out of the darkness and grasped one of the railing’s vertical bars. One-by-one, a dozen thick-knuckled fingers joined it. I wasn’t even sure if it was a fist or some nightmarish spider until another one appeared and this one did not stop to grasp the railing, instead reaching out to reveal a slender wrist.

When the hand breached the doorway, the soldiers opened fire and it was deafening. Shocked by the sound and the sudden violence I dropped to the floor and watched as missed rounds pinged dust off of walls on either side of the portal. Still, the hand kept coming, its wrist no thicker than a hose pipe and getting thinner as it went further towards us. It was a basket-ball sized fist made of nothing but wiry fingers, and the soldiers could not easily hit it. Worse, as the distance closed I noticed their accuracy became worse, not better, until six feet turned to three, then two, then one.

I crab-walked as fast as I could until my back hit the farthest wall and watched as the hand groped clumsily at the space where I’d been just seconds before. Now the soldiers were really going at it. One even grabbed a desk and pushed it aside like some kind of barricade. The hand, however, kept up that dreadful gliding motion, even as the flesh of its arm thinned out to almost hairlike proportions.

The colonel began to give orders, speaking quickly and with authority. He told the others to leave before turning to me and demanding to know how he could stop the screen. I managed a quaky jab in the direction of the projector that was, thankfully, near to the door. He nodded with calm stoicism and for a brief moment I thought everything was going to be okay.

The hand moved suddenly, switching from a teasing ethereal swim to the darting ferocity of a breaching shark. No one had time to speak, not even the young man whose head it clamped around and whipped back into the portal at lightning speed. He hit the same desk he’d thrown down just seconds ago and I remember the whip crack of breaking bone. He was moving at highway speeds, I’m sure of it. Snatched out of reality and into a literal nightmare.

As soon as he was through, the screen went dark, but not before I’d managed a glimpse of the thing’s face, lurking just beneath the railing at the edge of the stairs. There was only the very top of its head to see, but even that had been of nightmarish proportions. Its eyes were no larger than a penny, but they were spaced almost two feet apart. Its smooth head had seemed featureless but those eyes were filled with unbridled joy.

\-

The colonel’s reaction had been unanticipated.

We did not have the sudden inpouring of funding I’d hoped for. Instead he personally threatened to shoot me. Perhaps, in hindsight, I should have been a little more careful with my presentation. But this was all new and I explained as much. Even then, we faced the very real risk that the colonel would smash the computer to pieces and shut the whole project down.

When I first realised that wasn’t his intention, I was overjoyed.

When I later discovered what he actually wanted to do, I found myself wishing he’d just shoot me instead.

“Are you ready?” he asked.

“No,” I replied. “What do we do if the image changes?”

“We find our way back,” he said.

“The engineers have it covered,” Kim said from behind me. I’m sure she thought she was helping. She wasn’t. “They’re pretty certain they can slow the display down for long enough to mount some kind of rescue attempt. 120 minutes is the average of all their latest efforts, but one lasted over three hours.”

“Oh goodie! A whole three hours?” I cried only to realise that the armed men around me didn’t find my sarcasm all that amusing.

Briefly I considered the choice before me. Enter the doorway or get shot fleeing. I knew with certainty I had to go with them, of course. But as the screen came alive and I saw a broken window frame overlooking sickly roiling clouds, my knees went week and all blood rushed straight to my head. I had to suppress the urge to turn and run, surprised to find that part of me hoped they really would shoot.

The colonel grabbed my arm as if sensing my thoughts.

“Here we go,” I said as he dragged me through.

\-

We stood in an empty hotel room, half of us staring at the doorway leading back—a perfect rectangular hole carved into another world—and the other half gawking at the open window. We could see nothing of the Earth below, only a rolling sea of turbulent clouds that occasionally lit up from within with silent lightning.

“What is down there exactly?” asked one of the soldiers.

“Who knows?” I said. “We’re not sure the tower is a real physical location, more like an interpretation of a place. It could be something from our shared history as a species, or maybe even a glimpse into another reality. It’s almost as if it’s defined by something you just feel.” At least two of the soldiers blew raspberries at that, but I kept going. “the tower is a locus of aspiration brought low by tragedy and horror. Don’t you feel it?” I asked, and that put a stop to the quiet laughter. “You do, don’t you? This place was beautiful, once. It was a populated hub where people lived their whole lives, beginning to end. It’s not a hotel or an apartment block or an office block or a futuristic resort. It’s all of them, stacked one on top of the other. It’s a city built upright.”

“And something hollowed it out,” the colonel said, eyes peering at every corner of the room. “Come on. We have a job to do.”

The floor we were on seemed to be part of some hotel. Nothing too extravagant, but definitely somewhere a little fancy with its royal red carpet and peeling gold-filigree wallpaper. Some of the doors remained locked with funny looking card readers, others were smashed to pieces, revealing broken down interiors that were always similar but never quite identical. The soldiers looked everywhere for a sign of their friend, hoping to pick up on some kind of trail. I wasn’t even sure we were technically in the same place, but I didn’t want to say anything that might upset them. After all, my life was literally depending on them.

Instead I chose to take notes of every little detail, and I quickly realised that the tower was a hell of a lot more real in person than it ever was in my dreams. I know that sounds stupid, but to stand there and see individual pieces of furniture with unique patterns of wear and tear, to actually *see* the broken chunks of wall and sagging ceilings and appreciate them as real physical things with weight… it was unsettling. In my nightmares it had felt like a threat to my sanity, but coming to grips with it as a place where you could breathe the air and open doors and push at ceiling tiles made it feel like something far, far more dangerous.

It felt like the kind of place that could swallow worlds.

We found odd scenes inside the rooms that had remained locked. A few had the windows broken outwards as if the occupants had hurled themselves to their death rather than face whatever was outside. Others looked like they’d been the sites of some awful survivalist situation, with buckets in the corner, blankets and pillows in the bathtub, and sheets of plastic strewn along open windows to collect condensation. More than a few had been barricaded so heavily we simply couldn’t break through without bringing heavy tools.

We did manage to find a few meaningful artifacts. There was a recruitment poster for what looked like a factory, and a pile of paperwork written in pure gibberish but which had most of its lines redacted like a military document. One of the rooms even had a corpse. Well, more like a mummy, really. A paper-faced bundle of bones held together by brittle tissue and faded clothes that we found huddled in one of the shower surrounded by old food wrappers. The eyes were long gone, and their lips had receded so far they bore a ghoulish grin. In that same room was a balcony, and all of us were left aghast to finally get a glimpse at the building’s exterior. It was huge, so large that we saw ourselves as only one tiny room in an infinite, vertical, expanse of stone and glass. If I had to estimate, I would have said it was a column five miles in diameter, but I couldn’t be sure.

There was also plenty of graffiti in the hallways, old messages scrawled haphazardly on mirrors and walls. But we simply couldn’t read any of them, something I found very irritating. Still, it didn’t take a genius to look at that desperate lettering and see a despair-filled plea for help.

After the initial bit of exploration, I became keenly aware of the ticking clock. And I made sure to mention to the colonel when we reached the half-way mark.

“We haven’t even come close to where we need to be,” he grumbled. “These stairs look nothing like the ones we first saw.”

“I think that’s closer to the apartments,” I replied. “God knows where that is though.”

“This isn’t going to be easy,” he said, more to himself than anyone else.

\-

“Do you think there’s a bottom?”

We were at the stairwell again and one of the soldiers had his light pointed straight down the centre of the spiral.

I had predicted that something like this might happen. We couldn’t have gone more than a few floors up, but the act of going back down was something like a mental roadblock. It clearly bothered some of the younger men, and while the colonel looked as stoic as ever, I knew that was just a façade. It had already felt like I’d lived a thousand lifetimes in the tower and I knew with utmost certainty that going *down* just meant getting closer to whatever lived at the bottom of this place – something the human mind simply refused to do.

“Move up soldiers!” the colonel cried, giving us no time to dwell on our fears. He barged past us and quickly trotted down several steps like it was nothing at all, and then stood there staring at us, goading us to overcome our fear and join him. “Get your arses in gear!” he cried, turning back to us in red-faced anger. “We don’t have time to fuck—”

Something pulled him through the railing.

And I mean *through*. As the men around me screamed, and a few even began to fire, I became faintly aware of something cold on my forehead, and wiped it off to find what looked a piece of skin still clinging to my fingertip. I turned to look at the man next to me, and saw that he had three ears. It took a few seconds of shock before I realised that one of them was plastered haphazardly to the top of his helmet and had likely come from the colonel. In fact, the air all around us was thick with an aerosol spray of fine misty blood, and bits of clothing and skin could be found everywhere – the floors, the walls, even the places above us. Using my own light, I took a look at the railing where the man had stood just seconds before, and saw that the metal bars had been bent aside by a few inches, but not much else. The gap between them couldn’t have bene more than six inches. The pile of loose skin and clothing that remained bunched up around those bars made it pretty clear what had happened.

It was at this point I decided to leave. The soldiers were shouting and firing down the stairs, and some deep-seated instinct told me it was time to separate from the herd. This isn’t a very noble thing to admit, of course. But then again, I’m not a very noble person. Otherwise, I might not have taken one of the duffle bags they’d dropped.

The very same one that I knew had all the rope.

You see, the longer I physically stayed in the tower the longer I became aware of all those long-forgotten dreams. And a pattern had started to emerge in them. No one ever went down the stairs in the tower. It simply wasn’t an option and oh boy, had the colonel proven why. For whatever reason it woke something up that lived down there. I wasn’t even sure if it was just one thing, or lots of things, but I knew it was bad the same way a rat knows to avoid the smell of cat piss.

But I did have memories of falling. Sometimes down elevator shafts. Sometimes out of windows. And as I hurried back into the corridor, searching frantically for that room with a balcony while trying to ignore the rapid increase in gun fire and ever-more-elaborate screams, I realised that I’d already unconsciously formed the first part of a plan. One that, I hoped, would let me make my way back down to that soon-to-disappear doorway.

\-

I didn’t give myself to think. I already had the bag open and the rope out before I found the room with the balcony. My heartbeat thundered in my ears so loud I was thankful since it blocked out the dwindling cries of the men I’d left behind.

Not to mention the sound of whatever had them.

I tied the rope around the balcony railing with the firmest knot I could. Then, wrapping the rope around my waist and clutching it with white-knuckled shivering hands, I awkwardly started to throw one leg over the ledge. It was around this point that my fear of heights kicked in and it damn near sent me back the way I came. It was a transcendent, almost-hallucinatory kind of terror. But then something from the hallway behind me moved and I became acutely aware of the sound of dreadful feet padding closer towards the room.

It seemed best to just go for it, so that’s what I did, swinging one leg over the other and letting inertia do the rest. For a few seconds I hung against the balcony railing while my arms and legs refused to listen to any order coming from my brain. The sense of space around me was terrifying, not just the building that reached forever upwards to a baby-blue sky, but the continental-sized clouds and hurricane storms that raged what felt like miles below. It was the kind of cosmic insignificance I imagined astronauts felt on their very first spacewalk.

Slowly, I became aware of the fatigue in my arms and my legs. And a thought crystalised in my mind. If I didn’t start going down now, hand-over-hand, foot-by-foot, then eventually exhaustion would win and I would simply fall and all that fear I was holding on to would be realised in the most terrifying fashion. I took steps to control my breathing. And then, after a good five minutes of mental coaching, I managed to move one hand, and then one foot, and progress started to come my way.

Thank God I didn’t have far to go. We’d only travelled up two floors. That was all. Easy going up. Not so easy going down. But I managed it after what felt like the worst ten minutes of my life and soon found myself staring at an open window two or three feet away. Unfortunately my mind blanked and I couldn’t even begin to think of how I might close the distance. I became convinced I would die the second I let go of that rope and there was nothing else to do except stay there or fall. It was during this panic that some stupid God-awful compulsion made me look down without meaning to, and all thoughts of life, or death, or anything else just melted away.

The clouds had thinned. Not a lot, but enough to reveal… *something*. It was huge, its arched back momentarily breaching the sea of hazy amber clouds to reveal a startling sense of scale.

That was all I needed to snap back to reality and focus on getting off that damned rope. I began to swing, awkwardly swaying my hips and feet in the hope of getting myself closer. Even the tiniest motion brought me into a near state of panic. With my whole body hanging helplessly over what looked like an infinite expanse of nothingness, it was hard not to think of just how long I’d spend falling before I finally found something to hit. But I had to get swinging. I just had to.

When it came time to finally let go at the apex of my lunge, I summoned all of my courage and hoped to God momentum would carry me. With my eyes closed I flew through the air for a fraction of a second before landing in a nervous heap on the floor.

I was flooded with relief and finally opened my eyes to gauge the space around me. It was another hovel. Half the furniture had been piled up against one door, and the rest repurposed to become something new. In one corner was a planter made out of badly nailed planks of wood and filled with suspicious soil that stank of human waste. In another was an old mattress tossed half-upright against the wall.

Something moved in the darkness of the bathroom and I froze, painfully aware that after everything I’d gone through, I’d probably die anyway. When the occupant finally emerged, a pale face in the shadow, I felt a confusing mixture of relief and horror. It was a man who looked like a literal apparition of death, like something taken straight out of the worst history books. He made me think of some nightmarish survivor of mankind’s extinction, a half-starved creature that had spent its life hiding in the shadows for fear of being caught. His eyes and cheeks had become so sunken as to appear constantly hidden by shadow, even as his head emerged fully into the light. Arms so thin they were like hose pipes reached up to cover his face from the harsh glare of the window and for the first time I became aware that he was completely naked, his skin pocked and bubbling, ravaged by unknown diseases I couldn’t begin to guess at. His limbs were grossly bowed and his stomach swollen from what must have been years of malnourishment.

“The dreamer stirs,” he said, and although I could’ve sworn he wasn’t speaking English, I managed to understand him all the same.

“Who?” I asked.

“The dreamer,” he whispered. “This all belongs to him.”

“Is that… is that what I saw down there?” I asked.

The old man paled, put a finger to his lips, and hushed me.

“Don’t wake the dreamer,” he hissed.

Suddenly his eyes went wide and I turned on instinct, fixing the rope I’d come in on. It still hung there, floating in empty space, but it jiggled and swayed as if something was coming down it.

I ran to the barricade and began to pull the furniture away only for the old man to leap out of the darkness and begin to attack me. Frightened as I was by the grotesque sight of his leprous body, he was too weak to do any real harm, and his cold, bony fingers gripped my collar in a futile effort to pull me away.

“Stop!” he screamed, but I ignored him, tearing at the objects in my path until I’d cleared enough room for the door to open. I had just managed to get the handle down when something wrenched me backwards and I turned to see the old man staring into my eyes with gut-wrenching fear written on his face. “Don’t me go,” he pleaded, and I saw the spidery fingers that gripped his head in a halo of writhing knuckles, the wrist winding across the floor and out the window where it coiled around the rope.

I grabbed his hand squeezed so hard I probably broke a bone or two, prompting him to immediately scream and let go. He was still screaming when whatever had him ripped him out of the room and up to his death.

Wasting no time, I bolted back out into the hallway and ran in what I hoped was the right direction. From behind me there came the sound of hurricane-like destruction, a force of raging hunger that eagerly snapped at my heels. I knew with utter certainty that it was going to get me. I knew it the same way I knew what the old man had been saying, and in the same way that you always know how your worst nightmare will end.

I found myself hoping that’s all it was.

A nightmare.

If there was any proof I needed that wasn’t the case, it was the sight of a familiar hotel room and the glowing doorway set ominously in open air. I don’t know about you, but my nightmares don’t end with me getting what I want. It was enough to actually confuse me, as if for a few seconds my brain had collapsed all notions of dreams and reality into a gruesome whole, and I had to remind myself to bolt through the broken doorway and straight into the portal onto the other side rather than just wait to wake up.

I emerged into the squalid flicker of fluorescent lights. Panting, almost-delirious at the sight of familiar old-tiled floors beneath my feet, I stumbled forward and wrenched the projector off the wall and smashed it against the floor. The last thing I remembered before collapsing was the sound of a dozen scientists crying out in confused alarm.

\-

“As a rescue mission it was a failure,” I said, addressing the men and women who’d joined me in the observation room. “But as a fact-finding mission, it was a resounding success. We aren’t necessarily in position to say anything with certainty, but we’ve been exposed to a few fascinating new ideas.”

Nobody spoke. They all stared at me.

“I believe the locations we’re seeing, the ones that appear again and again… I believe they are dreams, just not in the traditional sense. I believe that we are being exposed to the dreams of something that isn’t human.”

“What exactly?” asked one of the older men who sat closer to the front.

“I think it eats worlds,” I said. “Or something like that. I think… I think we’ve been visiting these places all along. All of us. And I think this thing remembers everything that lives there, good and bad. I think we’ve already been exposed to some of these… entities. Not just during our excursion, but in our nightmares, all of us. We’ve read about them sitting on the chests of people trapped in sleep paralysis. We’ve seen them chasing us through dimly lit corridors. This thing… the dreamscape feels like a real place because it is, sort of. Its something’s memories of real places, of the people who lived in them and the lives that they had. Maybe it’s a literal absorption, something strange and metaphysical. Maybe it’s just got a mind vast enough to remember every little detail. I don’t know. All that I do know for sure is that I don’t want to wake this thing up.”

“You’ve always had a penchant for reaching,” the old man said. “You can’t seriously be suggesting we mothball this project based on your theory? I appreciate the veracity of your first-hand account. But having read your report in great detail, I’m not sure I make the same connections that you do.”

“Oh God no,” I said. “No one’s saying we shut this down.”

I reached out behind me and tore away a blank sheet to reveal an enormous whiteboard covered in a half-made map. We’d cobbled it together from over two decades of research notes taken by a very specific subset of our scientists. The tower sat squarely in the centre and even just looking at the words made my skin crawl, so I looked a few inches to the right and focused on a different set of words.

*The Library.*

“We’re scientists,” I said. “We collect data to prove our arguments. I say this thing swallows worlds. Well, let’s take a look at some of the others. In hindsight, the tower was the worst possible starting location. Far, far too hostile.

“But there are other places in the dreamscape to explore,” I added. “And hopefully some of them won’t immediately spit us back out.”"

There's a lot of hit pieces on NWM, and, admittedly, much of what is said is well deserved. I know they're bulldogs when it comes to recruiting on campuses, and, thought this might prove to be useful to somebody who's looking to work for a broker/dealer when comparing it to other options. So I'll walk through culture, compensation, training, and everything in between to guide those who are thinking about it. No career path is perfect, everything has perks and drawbacks. One must weigh the pros and cons and make their decision accordingly.

How it started/College Agent Program

I was in college studying accounting and wanted to go on the CPA path. I learned very quickly it wasn't for me and changed my major to finance, as, I always had in interest in financial planning and its path. Lo and behold, a recruiter and advisor came into my insurance class one day and I went through the interview process. I was offered the college representative contract and jumped through the licensing hoops to make it official. I ended up doing very well....I absolutely crushed sales numbers and ended up being in the top 10 in my region by hitting what's called ""Impact 40"". Selling a policy gives you what's called a ""Life Credit"" If you sell enough policies (lives) you'll basically be treated as a celebrity, so, I sold 40 lives in my intern contract. (Awards system is 10, 20, 30 and 40 lives as an intern) . I sold lots of term life and disability insurance to get there...yay me. I was offered to convert to a full time agent upon graduating and ended up getting a $6000 bonus to do so. Why did I continue with NWM and not anywhere else? To be honest, it's simply because I liked the office culture (at the time) and enjoyed being around the people there. I was 22, gullible, naive, and didn't possess any sophisticated financial knowledge. 

Full Time Advisor contract and training:

I converted to a full time ""advisor"" when I completed school. I embarked on their 3 week financial advisor training course. Most of the training comprised of sales language training. What to say on the phone when calling your P200 (list of 200 people you know to reach out to) What to say in the approach, overcoming objections, closing language, and so it goes... Over that time, I think we spent 90% of the time on insurance training and terminology. Life insurance (whole life especially), term, disability, long term care, etc. There is very little mention of planning, cash flow management, investments, debt management, and so on. Luckily for me, I was a self starter and did a lot of homework on how to navigate those topics. You're trained to hit the ""Pacesetter first 40 and second 60"", or, sell 40 policies in the first 6 months and 60 policies in the next 6 months. Management is bonused on how many of their advisors hit these metrics (they don't tell you that but I found out later through the grapevine). They will quite literally do nearly anything to get people to hit these goals. They're arbitrary metrics, and, have very little to do with planning, client well being, or your well being. You'll have some advisors instructing people to do term life conversions into whole life (counts as a life credit), graded disability conversions into level premiums (counts as a life credit), buy policies on yourself and family for life credits, and so on. Not a good culture if you're trying to get reps/advisors off to a good start personally, professionally, and financially. 

Northwestern Mutual Whole Life:

No surprise to those familiar with NM, whole life is their bread and butter. Am I a whole life believer? No. Am I a whole life hater? Actually, no. It has its place and purpose, and, one of NM's benefits is that their core product line is actually very solid. Backed by great conservative money management skill from the actuaries, their annuity/disability/long term care/life insurance lines do their job very well. Are they the best? Some are and some aren't, but ,their product line will always stay competitive from its Mutuality structure, meaning, if you're a policy holder you are now a small owner of the company. 

With that being said, life insurance contracts (specifically the whole life family: VUL, VL, Fixed rate whole life, UL) are extremely difficult to understand. VERY FEW advisors truly understand how they work. Even fewer clients understand how they work, and, that's the biggest turn off that I've developed from NM. You almost HAVE to mislead on terminology to get someone to do it. Saying things like we're put money ""in to"" a life insurance policy. (Not true, you're paying FOR a life insurance policy via premium payments) ""It's like a Roth account that you can access before retirement age."" (Also not true because of basis of policy) ""It earns 5% return on cash value"" (which can be true if you're in good health but they usually fail to disclose your return for the first 9 years is negative as you're amortizing the cost of the death benefit for close to a decade before your cash starts earning money) Again, it certainly has its uses, but, it's complicated beyond all belief and is not needed by 90% of those that come across it. 

A lot advisors get away with murder here. I took over a physician client how was putting $48000 a year, yup, $4000 a month, into a fixed rate whole life plan. The advisor made close to $20k on commission from the one plan, hence, why it's pushed so heavily. He made 400k as an emergency medicine doc, but still, he was shafted per his needs and goals. And what can the client do? Nothing. It's very, very, very difficult to prove wrongdoing in a life insurance sale due to suitability rules. As long as the advisor could prove there was a death benefit need at the time of issuance (very easy to do) and has his case notes in order, good luck getting anything from court. Insurance is not nearly as regulated as securities, so just reiterating, it's very difficult to prove that one was taken advantage of from a life insurance sale. 

Compensation: 

Don't get me wrong, you can make a S\*\*\* ton of money at NM. Some of the seasoned, top reps there make $8-10 Million a year. The old Managing Partner of my network has a pension from NM that pays him $200,000 a month. Selling insurance is not a bad career if you want to do it. The reward is certainly there to those that can do it well. 

You are self employed when you contract with the company, and, you're in charge of your expenses. Client lunches, printer paper, computer, office, chair, travel expenses, company trips, and everything else is out of YOUR pocket. Yes, you must pay overhead to work for NM. Your first year is covered by your managing director, but, you're on your own after 1 year. After 5 years you're not required, but heavily encouraged to have staff on your team. So let's say your practice has $150,000 of revenue at that point....Now you're forking out $50,000 a year, minimum, to pay for someone's salary, health insurance, benefits, computer, office, chair, and even the pens they use. 

Benefits: NWM has a pension plan (ARP Agent's Retirement Plan) that does not full vest until 10 years with the company. They have a company funded 401k plan (called the PFGF ""Persistency Fee Guarantee Fund"") These two components are funded completely by NWM but are based on your own personal insurance production.... go figure right?

Education: They'll pay for every penny of your CFP and many other designations....I took advantage of it and got the CFP knocked out. 

Summary:

NM, just like anywhere else, has its pros and cons. If you truly want to sell insurance and integrate that aspect of planning into people's financial plan, then, it's a great opportunity. Where I see things frequently fail is that the insurance planning BECOMES the financial plan for many people who encounter an NM advisor. When an advisor's back is against the wall and 100% of their income is on insurance commission, nasty things can happen. I, honestly, left because of the culture, and, frankly got tired of the Waco, Texas Branch Davidian feel that NM has. And that's the point....those who do well there have a religious like belief in what they do. It's neither right or wrong....it is what it is. ""I believe every client needs to integrate disability income insurance in their plan"" ""I believe every client needs 2 years of cash in a structured life insurance plan"" ""I believe all clients should defer 10% of income into whole life"" and so on. 

So if you want to sell insurance products, love sales, love recognition for said sales, want to make a stupid amount of money doing it and hang out at the golf course with other reps after, then this could be a great fit. If you are hungry for a more intellectual environment, then, don't waste your time. One thing I'll give it credit for is GREATLY thickening my skin. This place definitely put me through the ringer, and, for that I am grateful. I would not be who I am today without it. Best of luck to those considering it!"

**Research Experience**:   Currently working as a Computer Vision Intern on an AI for Social Good project since May 2021 at ISB Hyderabad under a prof who's an alum from CMU. We're planning to publish our work at CVPR 2022 but I guess that won't be ready by the time I apply for colleges. Will be having 5 months of experience here while applying.  (I plan on applying in October)  Recently started as a Computer Vision Intern at a lab that is a part of the Robotics Institute at CMU and will be completing my bachelor's thesis here. Just started the work here so will be having only a month of experience while applying.

**Projects:** 5 good projects in CV and DL, all available on my Github. 1 comprehensive project related to Product Design.

**LORs:** 2 from asst profs I've worked with before (one at ISB and one at college, expecting both of them to be strong) and 1 from our department head who happens to be a professor (got an A+ in his course)

**Extra-curriculars:** Quizzing and Literary Club - Coordinator and Co-coordinator. Won a few awards in these events. Worked for an NGO and helped them in hosting an international conference related to Women Entrepreneurship.

I honestly haven't prepared my final list of colleges but this is where I'm currently at (rough list). I plan on applying to 12 colleges (3 ambitious,5 within reach,4 safe). It would be really helpful if anyone of you can help me with your insights if I have to consider a few others in place of the ones mentioned here or to remove the ones that aren't worth applying for. My current list is as follows:

**Ambitious**

1. Georgia Tech (Dr. Dhruv Batra, Dr. Devi Parikh) - MS CS
2. UMaryland - College Park (Dr. Jia Bin Huang) - MS CS
3. Carnegie Mellon - (Dr. Fernando De La Torre) - MS CV (Had a conversation with him a while ago when I earlier applied for an internship under him but couldn't excel in the competition (he was hiring for 2 RAs at that time). He was impressed by my resume and suggested I consider their lab after I graduate)

**Moderate**

1. Northeastern University - MS CE
2. New York University (Tandon/Courant)- MS CS
3. Texas A&amp;M - College Station - MS CE
4. UC Irvine - MS CE
5. Virginia Tech - MS CE/CS

**Safe** 

1) Arizona State University - MS CS/CE

2) New York University (Tandon) - MS CE

3) UT Dallas - MS CS

4) UC Boulder - MS CE

PS: Apologies for the long message. I thought providing all the relevant information might be helpful to better understand my candidature."
pls3vu,2,2021-09-10,Ghost of the low GPA past,KaranShetty547,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/pls3vu/ghost_of_the_low_gpa_past/,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Im an Indian guy who did not do too well during my undergrad (electronics and telecommunications)

Gave up on the idea of ever studying abroad due to having a low GPA (I lost a year too, I was going through a bad phase what can i say)

Tried to fix things for myself and got into an Mtech program in a Gov aided college in Applied Mathematis (I wanted to get into AI)

Did well and got a CGPA of 8+. However half the course went into the pandemic. So could not do any serious research which was supposed to have been part of my second year curriculum where i work at some DRDO labs (My college was funded by DRDO).

Instead ended up doing an internship at a good startup that focuses on computer vision. Reporting the work I did there was accounted as a part of my second year curriculum

Now I'm a full time employee the said startup and working on great projects

However now I do feel I can apply for MS abroad in the feild of computer vision where I have got good experiace and people to back me up on it.  (I want to do ms not Phd since its not as big a commitment)

But still the ghost of my undergrad past haunts me, and I worry if I try to invest time and money into GRE and applications it will only lead to disappointment and regret.

That is why i need some one to tell me the raw truth of how realistic is it to apply abroad (USA) in universities like CMU where there is an MS course for Computer vision that is more industry oriented than research and acadamics. How much of a set back am I looking at consideriing my UG and how well did I make up for my past failures.

I wont be short on LORS and I feel I have an honest SOP im mind.

&amp;#x200B;

sorry for the long post and best of luck to everyone in getting their dream college this admission season"
plst5n,3,2021-09-10,I really want to quit my job and move out of my family's house.,Djgogi059,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/plst5n/i_really_want_to_quit_my_job_and_move_out_of_my/,"I don't know where to start. Over the past couple of months, I have really been wanting to quit my job in search of something better. I also want to try to move out in 2022, but I know right now is not a good time because I don't have a stable income to move out (like I have enough money, but don't make enough to move out).

I only made $8 (now I make $8.50 back in may) an hour plus tips and I don't work that many hours anymore. I've been working at my place for more than 2 years already and this was my first job. I told myself that this will not be a forever job and will go to school and get my degree. I really enjoyed my job, but I feel like I want to search for something better like an internship or a higher paying job and I did.

I worked at a summer camp and made about $4k by the time camp ended. I really enjoyed my experience working in a new environment and meeting new people. In total, I have almost 10k, but I have been spending a lot since I have car maintenance, school stuff to pay for, and lately, before the camp job, I've been spending more than what I make. I have applied for so many new places way before, during, and after my camp hoping I can find something better to do than going back to my old job because I was dreading to go back ( was considering just not working and using my time during work just to apply to different jobs).

However, I did not get a response/rejected or my application was put on hold (because I was at my camp job and the job wanted to do an in-person interview) and when I tried to call them back they did not respond. However, there was one internship that emailed me and I did an interview, but I have been waiting for 3 weeks and I followed up with them. They told me they have been busy and are in the decision process ( which is understandable since people have different priorities), so I'm still applying to more places. I'm almost to the point of giving up and getting agitated that I won't find anything.

Originally, I was supposed to move out in July/August with a friend, but he told me that he wanted to try to live alone. I was ok with that since I was ok with staying home at the time and not really having to worry about rent and bills. However, what really wanted to get me to move is because while I was at camp people around/near my age in college (I'm M and almost 20) are already living on their own and I really wonder how they do it while in college and some had no jobs during the school year and made me want to move more. When I asked them and they gave me I still feel like it was impossible for me and risky.

In addition to this, since college was back in person and this was my first time going to campus often I have to commute more and it takes a while to get there too. Even though my college is in the same city it is still far away (about 25/30 minutes no traffic and 35/40 minutes with traffic) and I would have to leave campus early right after my lecture is done (since I only have one class there this semester) before traffic starts (40 to 50 minutes home with traffic if I want to stay later and hangout). When I hang out with my friend at his place or at this cafe (We usually hang out late at night) I would have to drive back to the area of my school if I'm back at home ( which I usually am). Which puts miles on my car and wastes gas.

It's not that my family is toxic.  Even my mom agreed that I should move out to be closer to school and she wants to move out of the country soon (so I might as well move out too), but my grandma and my dad (that I sometimes hang out with since he and my mom are separated) said I should move out when I finish school and get a better job. I just want to experience living alone/away from the house for the first time. The only bills I pay for are 1/2 of the internet, part of my car note, school supplies, and my credit card bill.

Also, even though I'm an adult and can make my own choices and wanting to do whatever I still feel like I still listen to my mom and grandma rules/ almost everything she says because she still financially support me a lot and I'm still living at home (at my grandma's house with only my mom, child cousin, and grandma). For example, I get home late after hanging out with friends or I leave the house a bit too late and they are worried about me and I feel bad for them worrying that I just stay home sometimes (only child here). However, even when thinking about moving my mom still wants to dictate to me where I should move. I want to live alone in a studio or one-bedroom off campus (whichever is cheaper), but she said she wanted me to live with a roommate or university student housing ( not dorms, but the off-campus place that is targeted for students I'm assuming either or regular dorms idk). I also kinda worry for my grandma if I ever move out too since it'll be her and my baby cousin only.

I feel like writing this got this out of my chest I just really want to move out and find a better job. Maybe I should put this in a different subreddit idk. Thanks for reading this far."
plstki,2,2021-09-10,Want to do a top masters program but lack research experience and LORs,parrot15,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/plstki/want_to_do_a_top_masters_program_but_lack/,"Hi everyone,

I've become pretty dead-set on wanting to pursue a masters degree in computer engineering or electrical engineering. I would like to get my masters at a top school. My dream would be MIT, Stanford, CMU, etc. but I'd still be really happy if I got into Georgia Tech, UMich, Berkeley, etc. I'm wondering what my chances would be given my situation.

To be clear, I'm only interested in pursuing a masters, not a PhD.

To give a bit more about my background, I'm an undergraduate at Texas A&amp;M University in my junior year. I'm majoring in computer science and will be getting minors in Electrical Engineering and Math, and have a 3.7 GPA. I was a software engineering intern at SpaceX, Tesla, and AMD, and was a machine learning intern at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.

I think my work experience is the thing that will make me stand out.

However, I've done my research and it seems that for graduate admissions, they really, really care about prior research experience. I did undergraduate research for 4 months, and I did not like it at all. I'm not interested in research at all, and would not like to do more research as a 'means to an end' just to get into a top masters program.

Additionally, graduate admissions also seem to care greatly about letters of recommendation. Unfortunately, I do not have a strong relationship with any professor: I've never gone to office hours a day in my life, and have never been involved with professors outside of normal class. My manager at Tesla and some other people from my internships would write good LORs, but they aren't academics so would grad admissions care about LORs from them that much?

I guess my manager at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has an academic background (she has a PhD from Yale), so would an LOR from her stand out?

I'm willing to grind to get a top score on the GRE but given my situation, I need to know if those efforts would be worth it.

Thanks!

TL;DR: Strong work experience, decent GPA, but iffy LORs and no research experience. Chances to get into a top masters program?"

pltztg,1,2021-09-10,Waiting for the hiring manager to get back to me…,bhat2019,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pltztg/waiting_for_the_hiring_manager_to_get_back_to_me/,"So I interviewed for an intern position in “SEO Fulfillment” 2 weeks ago. The manager said I did well at the end of the interview and said he’d get back to me the following week. I sent a thank you email the day after, and he said they’d have a decision in the middle of that following week. So last week comes and I didn’t hear anything so I followed up at the end of the week before labor day. I got a reply back on Tuesday saying they offered someone the one open spot they had. However, he said they really liked me and are working on getting HR approval soon to open another position. He said he’d get back to me once he has more information. I sent a thank you email after. They also said they’d consider me for a regular, full-time salaried position since I’m a recent college graduate.

So my questions are:

* How long would it take HR to approve another position?
* Is this an indicator that maybe I’d be the candidate they choose?
* And, would it be wise to follow up end of next week if I don’t hear anything back?

Any advice? I’m still job hunting in case I don’t get it, and already have an interview for another job next week."

The main reason I chose Concordia is because of the opportunity to speak French and live in a lively city where I can make a ton of different connections. Also they have a good internship options as well. 

The main reason I chose uOttawa is because of its proximity to political life, especially for future career options and the co-op program.

Am I being too greedy?",class1help,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/plv8ar/i_got_a_return_offer_from_my_internship_i_dont/," I’m going to try to keep everything as vague as possible, while giving as much information as I can, for privacy sake.

I’m a current senior, studying Computer Science. I got a return offer from the company I worked for (Defense) this summer, for what I think is a solid starting salary, (unsure if I should disclose the exact amount) not too low or high. My 2 biggest problems with this job are 1) the location, and 2) the work I’m going to be doing. 

1. The location is my hometown (or close to it) and although that was good for the summer, I *really* want to get out of that place. I’m going to school in one of the bigger cities in the country and I love it here, so ideally I would want to continue working in an urban setting.
2. The work I did over the summer was… not the most interesting. It kept me occupied, but wasn’t extremely challenging. I’m not sure if I could really stand doing what I did over the summer completely full time.

With these in mind, of course I would want them to pay me more, as an incentive to leave my ideal setting, and continue working on things I’m not fully invested in. But I’m just worried about whether or not I am being greedy. They’ve given me little time to respond (I don’t think I’ll hear back from any other companies before their deadline) and I’m concerned that if I decline I won’t have *anything*. Especially hearing about many people being unable to land a job for *months* after graduation...

My resume is.. not the best but it’s not empty either. I have some school projects listed, and internships I’ve done previously. My GPA is also rather average, I don’t particularly stand out, and I don’t think my leetcode/interviewing skills are anything amazing either. Though I think with a bit more studying/cramming they could improve a lot.

Also, some stories I’ve heard about defense in the past make me hesitant to continue into the industry. 

Basically what I’m asking is, am I being too greedy? I don’t think I’m a particularly stand-out candidate, so I maybe things like FAANG are a bit of a stretch, but am I being too greedy if I decline this for only the *possibility* of getting more engaging work, and hopefully in a better location? Should I just accept this as a starting point, get some money and experience, then look to leave?"

freshman year i decided i would grind to get into a t25 school. my older sister did and i was motivated to do the same.

good grades, prepared for the sat/psat, but my ec's were terrible(lost at one state tech competition, didn't achieve anything in any other clubs, and no sports)

sophomore year i tried to pick it up, started volunteering at multiple places, searched for internships, and kept my grades up. but it was online school, and i got carried away with the idea of starting an online business and becoming financially free, completely abandoning my college goal.

i put everything into it, quit all my ec's(i didnt achieve much in them anyway) but ended up making like $2k, and wasnt at all where i thought i would be. i even lost most the money after from investing it back into the business with little return.

after that, i just quit everything, ive been super burnt out from the business. ive kinda been trying in school, but still no ec's and nothing to put on my college apps.

but i just got my sat score from the august 28 sat and it was 1560, and it kinda motivated me to try for college again. do i actually have a chance at a t25 if i sweat and grind hard in junior-senior year? or is there not a chance? idek.

tldr i started high school determined to get into a t25, got distracted with an unsuccessful business sophomore year, and now i have nothing to put on my college app. j got a 1560 on the sat and it motivated me to try for a t25, but idk if it's even possible midway through junior year. is it?"

My Spring 22 is pretty much locked because both 475 and 464 are only available in the Spring. (Also need take 361 first before 464)

Which one of these schedules seems manageable in your opinion?

*For reference, I struggled in 261. I passed with a C+ but was struggling because my debugging skills were not great. I have been spending my summer learning C++ and reviewing Data Structures. I did really well in 271 but started struggling towards the very end of the class (on the last two assignments). I never struggled in 290 and 340, they were pretty easy. I have been working part-time, but am probably going to quit to become a full-time student.*

**Key Questions**

* Which is more manageable, 344 with 361 or 344 with 352?
* Which is more manageable, 325 with 361 or 325 with 362?
* Is 362 easier than 361?
* Is it a bad idea to take 361 in the Winter then 362 in the Summer? (Quarter break in-between)
* Is it possible to even take 467 with 352?

I was thinking I should graduate Fall 22 if I land an internship for Summer 22, but so far no luck. If I end up not getting an internship should I try to graduate Summer 22 instead?

What do you think, should I play it safe and graduate Fall 22 or go hard and graduate Summer 22? Thank you for your time!

plxuha,1,2021-09-10,I’ve never been in a romantic relationship and have no idea how to start one,trial001acc,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/plxuha/ive_never_been_in_a_romantic_relationship_and/,"For context, I am a 25 m, and up until now I have, as mentioned in the title, had basically no romantic relationship experience. Throughout highschool and college, although I had a lot of friends, I mostly just focused on my schoolwork and internships. I got a full job about two years ago and it came with a lot of stress from the industry as I soon learned that college didn’t prepare me for Jack shit and it didn’t help that my previous manager was kind of a dick, and unsympathetic towards me being a fresh college grad. Anyways because of this and me still living at home to get on my feet at work, I didn’t really have the mental freedom to start a relationship. Now I’ve got some stability, and my new manager is a lot better, so I come to the part about me asking for advice.

Recently I’ve been talking to one of my friends from college who I didn’t actually talk with that much in college. Now I’ve been trying my best to flirt with her and get her to hang out with me, and to an extent, it seems like it’s working. We went for bowling and drinks a couple of times a few weeks Ago and I even met her mom once for an event she was hosting. This week we went out for sushi but we had to call it early because both of us were feeling a bit tired unfortunately (I think me more so since I mentioned it first lol). She wants to go with me to a drive in movie sometime soon when we both have time and said she could help me move into my new place I am getting soon and hang out after. It’s safe to say I think that we are at least good friends. But the problem comes here: over text I can be a bit more flirtatious but in person I have no idea where to even begin. On top of which besides from media and friends, like I said I have no personal experience dealing with romantic relationships, and I feel like I’m reaching an impasse. Please help. And thanks in advanced."

This is all happening really fast and I'm not sure the reality of it all has quite hit me yet, but is it worth trying to negotiate further? While I am applying and intending to interview at other places, I do not yet have other offers to negotiate against and the deadline on the offer is fairly soon.   


I'm also wondering if it's worth shopping around for opportunities because I'm still not sure what exactly I want to be doing, and there's so much in the tech industry that I have some definite FOMO now. How do you all deal with that feeling?"

Phoenix got to their feet, and stepped away from the camera. They turned their head to the sky and watched as the rocket blasted its way through the atmosphere. They shed a single tear, hoping against hope that this one singular rocket could help with the survival of humanity. It was a foolish, naïve hope, but hope was all they had.

&amp;#x200B;

They waited for the rocket to exit their view before looking down at their watch. The impact warning flashed in its usual black and red, telling them that the last of humanity had one minute left to live.

&amp;#x200B;

They walked away from the makeshift launch control pad, struggling to breathe as they inhaled the radioactive air that was ripping their DNA to shreds. They got into their barely functional car and drove along the last unscathed road, trying desperately to catch one last glimpse of the ocean, to see the beauty of nature one last time.

&amp;#x200B;

They never got the chance.

""The motion to move the clock to 20 seconds to midnight is passed.""

&amp;#x200B;

Chairperson Layla Amann was furious. She had spent her entire life negotiating, mediating, and offering alternatives to the thick headed diplomats and presidents and dictators of the world. She had wasted countless hours, and for what? Not a damn thing. These moronic, power-hungry baboons absolutely refused to listen to the voice of reason. Year after year she had to deal with exponentially greater nuclear threats, and year after year these senseless shit-brains came up with more destructive ways to kill each other. She had had enough. She resolved to announce her resignation at the end of this meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

""Excuse me, Chairwoman, the caucus has reconvened, your presence is needed,"" spoke her assistant, bringing her back to reality. She sighed deeply. For now, she still had a very important job to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The council chamber was a beauty. It was shaped like an amphitheater, with desks lining each layer. The central region also had a singular desk, the chairperson's desk. Behind this desk was a large screen. The chamber was illuminated by geothermal lamps lining the floor and ceiling. The chamber also served as a nuclear bunker, capable of surviving a nuclear explosion of 20 megatons. It emitted zero electromagnetic radiation, and was completely carbon neutral, bordering on carbon negative. A technological and ecological masterpiece.

&amp;#x200B;

It was also soundproof, which was a good thing for everyone except those who had the misfortune of being inside the chamber during debate sessions.

&amp;#x200B;

Layla entered the chamber and was greeted by the usual pleasant yellow lights and the not so pleasant screams of 'differing opinions.'

&amp;#x200B;

Layla sighed, she was so very tired of all this. This meeting wasn't even about stopping nuclear Armageddon, nor were they diplomats or their ilk. They were all scientists trying to ensure the continued survival of the human race, and they *still* couldn't agree on anything.

&amp;#x200B;

""...Build underground bunkers?"" She heard one say.

&amp;#x200B;

""WE HAVE GONE OVER THIS A THOUSAND TIMES! WE CANNOT SAVE OURSELVES FROM BOMBS WITH GIGATON YIELDS BY DIGGING UNDERGROUND!"" Exclaimed a second

&amp;#x200B;

""What's wrong with our current plan?"" Said a third.

&amp;#x200B;

""Pretty much *everything*. Nobody knows if life exists there or anywhere else, and even if it did who's to say the rocket would ever get to space? And even if it did the mini-craft could easily be destroyed by the smallest of space debris. It will never work,"" Said a fourth decisively.

&amp;#x200B;

""Have you got a better idea?"" Said the third.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes actually,"" the fourth replied, ""We build an underwater bunker with lead shielding.""

&amp;#x200B;

""You run into the same goddamned issue. Gigaton explosions are enough to significantly crack the crust, and considering that the maximum damage is done by detonating one of these near coastlines or slightly underground, one would have to build at point Nemo to even stand a chance. Even then, growing crops to sustain the minimum viable population is damn near impossible, or large scale water purification. Not to mention the rumors of the Teraton behemoth the superpowers possess."" Said the second exasperatedly.

&amp;#x200B;

""So we operate on conjecture now?"" Chimed a sixth. ""Besides, the creation of a Teraton warhead is just not economically viable!""

&amp;#x200B;

""None of this debate matters because we have already focused our efforts on the agreed upon plan for the past 30 years."" Stated a seventh. ""We *should* be focusing on getting the public to pressure their governments into dismantling these nuclear weapons, it's the only way.""

&amp;#x200B;

""And what of the countries with authoritarian governments?"" Said the second.

&amp;#x200B;

""We release the information we have on gigaton nukes, as well as the technology we have kept secret. Everyone will resent their governments for that, and we'll not have to worry about Armageddon."" Said the eighth.

&amp;#x200B;

""Have you gone batshit insane? That'll lead to riots which in themselves could end human civilization!"" Exclaimed the sixth.

&amp;#x200B;

""Better that than mutually assured destruction!"" Countered the eighth.

&amp;#x200B;

""Look, we have already been trying to get the governments to reduce their arsenal, to no avail. Operation Midnight has already been given the green light.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Which bozo thought that was a good idea?"" Said the first and third in unison.

&amp;#x200B;

""That would be me,"" Layla finally said, ""and your predecessors. I have also received confirmation of the existence of seventeen separate Teraton warheads. The total number of Gigaton warheads lies at 2413, exactly 500 of them being several hundred Gigatons in magnitude.""

&amp;#x200B;

Her declaration left the caucus silent.

&amp;#x200B;

""You were voted the greatest scientists of this generation, you should all start acting like it,"" said Layla coldly. ""I suggest that this caucus focuses on ways to improve our technology instead of debating fruitlessly, leave that to the rest of the council.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Phoenix regretted accepting this internship. The opportunity to work with the greatest minds in the century does not balance out their massive egos and blatant transphobia. Although working for a secret council that tried to prevent nuclear war and climate change was a dream come true.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there was Layla. Phoenix was told that *she* was the one who had approved them, but she had been so openly against their pronouns that they almost left the program entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

But they didn't really have a choice, if they wanted to graduate they needed to complete a year under Layla.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why it shocked them so much when she abruptly started being nicer. She began respecting their pronouns, talking to them like a human, giving them human tasks; and on rare occasions allowing them to sit in on council meetings. It was still pathetic, but a lot better than being treated like a virus. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today was something else entirely. She actually smiled at them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it had something to do with her deteriorating condition. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the 8 months they had worked with her, she had lost nearly half her weight, and most of her color. Her cheekbones jutted out jarringly, and her eyes were almost always swollen, the dark circles starkly visible against her pale and fading skin. 

&amp;#x200B;

They would have been worried if they didn't hate her. (Of course they were worried regardless.)

&amp;#x200B;

""Phoenix?"" They heard her say as she exited the council chambers. The only thing that hadn't degraded was her voice, as loud and sharp as ever. ""Come with me please.""

&amp;#x200B;

*'Please?'* Wondered Phoenix. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I want to apologize for the way I have treated you, Phoenix,"" she said as they both walked through the hallway that led to the fission powered elevator. ""I have been quite unaccepting of who you are, and I have treated you as inferior. I am truly sorry. I asked for you specifically because of your stellar reports and intellect, and yet I gave you the tasks of a secretary, and worse. I hired you as a scientist, and I would like to be true to my word."" 

&amp;#x200B;

They stared at her blankly. *'What the hell happened in that meeting?'*

&amp;#x200B;

She paused for a bit as she called the elevator, then continued as they both entered it, ""I would like you to attend the next brainstorming session we have on nanorobotics. You would be working with some of the finest minds on the planet. And if they agree, you'd be allowed to work with them. I've been told that you have a special interest in nanorobotics.""

&amp;#x200B;

They still couldn't wrap their head around this. They were having a hard time believing this was a real offer. ""Why would you suddenly do this for me?"" they asked bluntly.

&amp;#x200B;

She paused for a moment, furrowing her brow, and weakening her smile. ""Because I realize that I was wrong. Who you are and how you express yourself should not matter to me. I hired you for your talent, and I am wasting it.""

&amp;#x200B;

""And the fact that you are nicer to me than all the people I have ever interacted with, even after I was a horrible bitch to you.""

&amp;#x200B;

Phoenix stared dumbfoundedly, their mouth contorting, trying to form some words that would explain the anger and surprise inside them. But before they could respond, the elevator lights flashed red, and the elevator reversed its motion, taking them back down to the depths of the council headquarters.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, both their smart-watches lit up, also flashing red. Layla reacted first, whipping out her tablet, and clicking on its own red notification.

&amp;#x200B;

It opened a link to a news website, with the headline:

&amp;#x200B;

""***The Clock Strikes Twelve: Nuclear Weapons Launched in the Tens of Thousands, Humanity Has 5 Minutes to Live.***""

***A/N:*** That ended up being a lot longer than I expected, and frankly I don't like it, but I will end up never posting future chapters if this one doesn't get out *right now.*

since three years I had the goal to become a strategy consultant. I was very focused, did all the internships, got the good grades and so on.

Since April I‘m working as a strategy consultant but there are three points why I lost my drive:

1) missing appreciation of commitment and good work

2) no time for family and friends 

3) no time between projects to „celebrate“ great results or good client feedback. It just never ends.

How do you guys try to motivate yourself? 

The problem for me is, that I do not see any changes regarding these three factors when you climb up the ladder in consulting."

Hi all. First of all, I know that 1500 is an outstanding score.

The thing is, I am an international student from Argentina and I need a full-ride scholarship, which is why I will mainly apply to elite schools. Furthermore, I have always dreamt of going to Stanford, and I would not like an exam score to disallow me to fulfill this dream. My subscores are 800 Math, 350 Reading, and 350 Writing. In my practice tests, I was scoring \~730 in the R+W section. If I was to retake, I should do it in December since late registration is not permitted to international students (and since I don't have the money, I couldn't register before knowing my score).

I think my honors are great: I have received an Honourable Mention at the International Mathematical Olympiad and a Bronze Medal at the Ibero American Computer Science Olympiad. I have recently been named as [one of the top 50 students worldwide](https://www.globalteacherprize.org/global-student-prize/about-the-global-student-prize/) by the Varkey Foundation.

Apart from that, I think I have great ECs. I created an app that helps people with dyslexia with more than 5k downloads, I am participating in a Cognitive Neuroscience research group with an emeritus professor from University College London, and I have been a class president of my Student Council for the last 5 years. I also play rugby and have done some Artificial Intelligence internships.

If you need any more information about me, please let me know. I just want to make the best decision in order to fulfill my dream. Thanks!"

So did a full-time internship. So, Monday to Thursday, 10 to 6, I spend in the office followed by an hour or an hour and a half of sleep because of how tired I get. I’m not an early riser at all. Then, I have dinner and it’s already 9. I wish to go to gym because I want to lose weight. I’m obese and in risk of other health conditions. The gym closes at 11, making it very hard for me to fit it in schedule (as there needs to be some break after dinner too). Then, since I live in a student hostel, I spend an hour or two with my friends, just chilling. And, whoops, need to go to sleep for work the next day. I have full day classes on Friday and I don’t understand how to take time out for self study for my classes and to gain newer skills. Weekends, well, we go out for lunch or something, and I try to catch up on sleep. I just don’t know how to fit my studies and physical activity in here? My travel time to work is 5 minutes by walk. Having full-time work with 3 complete courses separate from it is turning out to be a really hard task. Moreover, I want to start cooking at night because after 10 PM, if I ever feel hungry, McDonald’s is the only thing left open and it makes me guilty of how unhealthy it is. 

I used to be someone who completed assignments a week before the deadline during the online semesters at home, but it is so much different now. I don’t know how to manage all of it, and I need help."

So I’m completing my bachelors in May 2022 in Electronics engineering
I have a decent cgpa, 7.64/10, roughly around 3.6/4
But the issue is that I failed 5 classes in total in my 2nd year and was on academic probation for a year. So i’ll be completing my 4yr degree in 5 years
However, i did make amends and scored a 9.7/10 in my third year and I have some very good internships in data science and proficient coding skills as well. Im looking for a Ms admit in Data science
Im well aware that the chances of getting into a top 50(or even top100) institution is fairly bleak but that doesn’t dishearten me, im confident in my skills and im sure i’ll do well in my field. My only concern is that I absolutely must expand my current skills and a formal education is what im looking for, unfortunately my country still doesn’t have the requisite courses and no other country provides experience and quality as the US does
Ive given my gre and scored a 338 and 4.5 in awa
As for research, none of my profs helped me so I have been pursuing independent research for the past 11 months now. Its been extremely difficult and expensive but I dont plan on leaving it mid way. 
I do have good extra curriculars and I also started the data science club in my college. 
Could someone please suggest a couple of schools that I stand a chance in? (Keeping in mind that i did fail 5 papers in the past)"

I'm aware of all the people saying to not take an unpaid internship but I’m doing this pretty much just for my resume. I’m planning to put this on my resume under “experience” and not mention that it was unpaid. At the beginning, the company sent me an offer letter email using their HR email with the company website as the domain/suffix. When I’m interviewing for future positions and they do a background check to ensure that I didn’t lie on my resume, would this be sufficient in general to prove that I in fact did work there and pass the background check? 

Looking at responses/comments from past posts, commenters have said that the new company would ask for a phone number/email to contact the previous company if I had absolutely no proof of working there, so I’m wondering if this offer letter would be enough for them to not do that. From my experience, the management have been strict/kind of dicks and I wouldn’t feel comfortable allowing them to confirm anything. Even if they’re only allowed to say whether or not I worked there and aren’t allowed to comment on my performance, I still am afraid they would say that I didn’t work there even though I did."

I am a self taught python developer, started getting into programming at the beginning of 2020, managed to get an internship as a data engineer this july. The team members and my team lead told me they really like how I work, I pretty much almost finished the internship project and I have about 3 more weeks. The problem is they said they might not have head count, they don't know for sure yet, but they didn't tell me this at the beginning, if I knew this I would've probably chosen another company during the internship season.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't really know if I should apply for junior positions or more internships? I don't know if I feel confident enough to apply for junior positions. Also in my CV if there's an internship only, without being actually hired after it, doesn't it look stupid? I feel like most recruiters will think I was not good enough at the job.

pm89he,1,2021-09-11,"Does meeting the ""preferred qualifications"" actually help a lot with finding an internship? Does it help to apply early for internships?",turkishjedi21,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/pm89he/does_meeting_the_preferred_qualifications/,"So over the summer, as a computer engineer I really developed an interest in fpga design and rtl design. Ended up doing a project where I learned all about SPI, UART, reviewing technical documentation, how to use the RTL development tools a lot more efficiently, and using all of this to create a nice plot of data in MATLAB. 

Anyway, right now when I look for internships related to FPGA design, I almost always meet the preferred qualifications. A lot of them ask for ""basic understanding of RTL design"" or ""familiarity with C++ and MATLAB"" or ""basic understanding of communications protocols such as SPI, I2C, etc."" or even ""familiarity with reviewing technical documentation"". All of which are addressed pretty strongly in my resume via a couple of my projects

So for my first question, does meeting the preferred qualifications through projects alone really help a lot? Or is it a lot more complicated, even if I have the GPA to back it up?

And secondly, does applying early for internships mean much? I see a lot of internships on indeed with the ""early applier"" tag. Applied to maybe 11 yesterday all strictly related to FPGA design that were posted a week ago max (and apparently, according to my brother at least, most listing aren't even up yet for summer 2022 internships)

Thanks for your input, I couldn't really find anything online about this. I'd like to hear what some of you have experienced first hand, or what you've heard about these topics"
pm9ll0,6,2021-09-11,"Curious about EMBA Chances in the not too distant future - 34m, White, CPA, Non-traditional Accounting Background",KidLucky_,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/pm9ll0/curious_about_emba_chances_in_the_not_too_distant/,"Bit of a lurker here on the sub, and curious on the feedback for a profile check on myself and the odds of getting into a Target School of CBS in their EMBA program, with Stern being a safety pick.

I went to college originally as a Computer Science major from a so-so school in downstate NY, I had to work multiple part-time jobs throughout Undergrad along with a toxic/abusive home environment that left me homeless living in my car for part of my time in college. My grades suffered and I landed into Academic Probation within my first 2 years of college.

When I realized my original major choice wasn't working out grade-wise I went into my schools business program and found Accounting as something I was passionate about that got me more motivated to really knuckle down on my studies while also continuing to work multiple jobs.

It was at this point my grades started to improve greatly and my last 2 years (took me 5 years to graduate due to switching majors) had me getting internships in my field and being on the Honors List + Deans List with my school (over 3.5-3.7 GPA in those semesters respectively). Even with that performance I ended up with an overall GPA of 3.17 for UG, which while frustrating - given the above situation feels like it's own miracle. 

I say I have a Non-traditional accounting background because I didn't go to a firm or Big4, and instead went directly into industry working in entertainment/media space in Production Finance and then went into more corporate accounting roles in both publicly traded orgs, along with some startups gaining great experience along the way. A few years back I did an MS Degree program to help get me the credits needed for a CPA certification as when you're in a Major city and want to climb the ladder in the Accounting space it becomes ""the great filter"" so to speak unless you get lucky.

I did that MS program while working full time and got a GPA of 3.56, and recently as of this year got my CPA license and also did this while working Full-time (save for a Covid related layoff that I was lucky to bounce and get a new job within 3 months of losing my old one) and progressing in my career to manager/director level (was at Director when laid-off - had to eat it and downstep due to Covid).

I'm now in a Senior Manager position at a new company I started at about 3 months ago, and hoping to get promoted to Director level in the next 2 years (that's my plan anyways), and at that point I'll be 36/37...and looking to take a shot at an EMBA program for the reason of wanting to unlock a very favorable network while also allowing myself to level up as I plan on becoming a CFO later in my career.

I guess my question is, as really it seems EMBA admissions reads as a much more blackbox process than anything else (from both following here and elsewhere online when trying to look at resources on this), with my experience and stats mentioned and story/experience...do my intentions of looking at both those programs seem reasonable?

I keep feeling like my UG GPA is basically going to really mess me up, but also I was going through a massive amount of change/pressure in my life and I really did my best AND turned it around in the end (which also shows on my transcripts along with sheer class load of my final year with internships to boot).

I know CBS forces the Exec Assessment on folks - but given what I have gone through - I can take 2 months to knock it out and pray for 155 or better on it (or wouldn't it be nice if they also put up a waiver - thought I'm thinking there's going to be a big fight within the M7 on EMBA programs to even allow such a change as I imagine it would diminish the ""prestige"" of them holistically) and got from there.

I also know while an MBA might not be ""required"" to get where I'm going - been watching things for a couple of years while I worked towards my CPA, and started to notice this thing where CFO's are now being selected on being more strategy focused and less of the ""bean counter"" mindset - I for sure consider myself more the former than the latter...but more and more - it's becoming apparent to me that again unless you get a bit lucky with things, having an MBA from a great brand school and having the experience and meeting like minded/highly experienced folks just unlocks opportunities that you might not get otherwise.

Thoughts? Feelings? Am I out of my mind? Just looking for some feedback, positive or negative on the idea

\*Also - as far as financing this thing goes - it's one big ROI calc - It would probably be a combination of loans + employer help (however small - it's a current unknown as I need to ask my new employer what the policy is - if we have one), and I'm currently making $140k, but imagine by 2 years time whether at my current company or the one after I will be at or near $150-$165k+ range TC with bonus.\*"

I would be open to doing internships or new grad programs if they didn’t all have this requirement that I had to either be a 3rd or 4th year student or graduated very recently (it’s been a handful of years for me). 

I find this frustrating because there aren’t a lot of junior positions but there are quite a few new grad positions in my area. While I plan to apply to them anyways, does anyone know why there’s this restriction? I feel like I am in a lot better mindset and much more capable than when I was at that age and it makes me a bit sad. I am lucky that I’ve gotten some support from my family but I can’t afford to get another degree though I know I can put in the work. I can’t help but just feel so old… 

I guess I’m asking whether anyone knows this is an automatic toss if they look at my resume and see I’m a not a new grad? Would it be better to just apply to positions that require 3+ years experience even though I don’t have it? Should I try explaining it in my cover letter?

I'm 25. I worked at a midsize family-owned MSP for a year and a half just after graduating University. It was my first real IT job and I joined as an intern and graduated to L2 support within the span of a year and a half, I managed to get 7 certs(Azure(900,104,303,304), NSE4, Network+) and I was usually the go-to guy for most things relating to desktop support and cloud deployments (Azure/O365 only), but because we were somewhat understaffed I found myself doing networking as well as some Fortinet and Palo Alto FW projects. 

Recently, I got a technical architect job at a large scale MSP and started last Friday. Everything just seems different and I kinda feel homesick for my old job. The pay at the new place is slightly better with a much bigger medical plan, but I just feel weird, like a complete outsider. I sometimes feel like I should have stuck it out at the old job for another year or so before transitioning. Is this something normal to feel when transitioning to a new job?

pmdcbd,0,2021-09-11,Applications Systematically Reject Good Talent,majoroofboys,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pmdcbd/applications_systematically_reject_good_talent/,"Alright, let me start this off by saying this is a rant. It’s not directed to someone or something. It’s just what I feel and people can disagree. This also is not bait so, please do not treat it as such. 

This interview system for incoming software engineers or internships in the field of computing is totally fucked. 

Instead of gauging actual skill or if you fit within the culture of said company, we’ve resorted to sending out automated coding challenges where applicants must spend a portion of their time (more than an hour) to complete a series of challenges that have zero relevancy to the actual job. 

While I understand and recognize it’s meant to see how you think, the measure of which that can be conducted can only be assessed (in this format) by the code that has been written. 

Some engineers and interns struggle from making the time or full completion simply because they want the code to be good and suited for the task. Not because they’re forced by a time assessment. Again, with this in mind for these people, it is not an accurate assessment of their skill. 

Furthermore, despite going to a top school, having an amazing resume / CV and extracurriculars, an applicant can purely get denied on the bases of lack of completion of a coding assessment. That’s where I have an issue with this.

What is the point of asking for a resume, a lengthy cover letter, etc if your entire process is determined by one test that doesn’t actually determine skill but rather the memorization in similarity to leetcode problems?


I’m in favor of these tests being used because, they scale quite well based on the number of applicants. However, it should not be the only metric used. 

Because of this, you’re throwing away actual talent and therefore the company is at a loss. It blows me away that you can attend a four year degree in computing, spend all that money and still get rejected because you can’t code four shitty solutions that pass all test cases in under an hour. 

These tests have also become standardized where platforms like CodeSignal only allow you to take one test every 14 days. So if any other company asks within that period, you’re screwed if you did bad. This is completely unfair. It’s no longer avoidable and you can no longer reject companies that require these. So even if you have the skill, you have to grind leetcode for the rest of your life. Even if you have a masters or a doctorate. You can’t speak or ask questions. You are purely hoping that the prompt makes sense. Wasting your time and countless talent in the process."

I want to become a software developer or at least a network/systems admin."

I'm in the final year of school and will be graduating from UC Riverside with a degree in CS. I just completed an internship over the summer.

The projects I have on my github are all school projects. Right now I'm reading CTCI and practicing leetcode.

So to get a 55k job, have I done enough? Do I have to go through the process of leetcoding and reading CTCI or is that just for the top jobs? Should I have another internship? Is there anything else that I should account for?"
pmelzj,0,2021-09-11,I am double minded on applying to Germany for masters with my profile as an international student. Can I please be guided or provided with a feedback?,smellycsdude,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/pmelzj/i_am_double_minded_on_applying_to_germany_for/,"You must have seen questions similar to this several times online. I did too, but I would like to talk about my scenario because I did not find something relating to my scenario. I did find a small three line paragraph [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/studying/general) in the ""Other admissions criteria"" section, that may be remotely related to my situation.

Somethings about me:

1. Undergrad in bachelors in Computer Science
2. CGPA: 2.47
3. Visiting researcher in Technical University of Kaiserslautern(TUKL) for two months in 2019(I have the experience letter)
4. Currently working in a US based company in my country
5. IELTS:- S:7.5, L:7.5, W: 7 &amp; R: 6.5. Overall 7
6. I belong from a third world country(I do not know if this information is necessary or not)

It is quite evident, that my CGPA is low, but I was a hard working student and I never gave up no matter what the situation was. It was due to my hard-work that my Professor(He has a PhD from Germany and works on DAAD funded projects with different German universities since 2014) only chose me from amongst his students to represent my work in Germany and work in TUKL for two months. Also on the basis of my hard-work, I was promoted from an intern to a permanent employee swiftly at my company. 

I may not be a bright student, but I am definitely willing to work-hard to achieve my goals. Two of my professors(One is the Head of Department of my university and the other is the one who took me to Germany) have agreed to provide me with reference letters. With that two of my seniors at work(One American and one local) have agreed to provide me with reference letters.

What do you think of my chances? I am double minded regarding this. If my chances low, but not zero, I would still like to apply nonetheless.

I would like your thoughts on this."

I just want to share my thoughts, my struggles and make my mind a tad bit lighter.

Family background: My grandfather and father were bankers while my grandmother and mother are homemakers. I have an elder sister who is mental challenged and has only completed Matriculation (High school for the Americans).

As a child, everything was going good until I completed my Primary School. During my last year at primary school, my sister was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia along with delayed learning capabilities. My father rarely helped my mom with chores or parental responsibilities, and as a person living in a patriarchal society, all the load was brunt by my mom. My grandfather and grandmother in-spite of living with us never showed much interest in helping out my mom. So she had to choose between my sister and me and ultimately decided to send me to live (at the age of 9) with my aunt in a different city. I somehow managed to live by in those two years I was there. My aunt had to leave the country since her husband had emigrated to a different country and I was again shifted back with my parents. 

For a year, life was again good and it was like the calm before the storm. As I entered high school, my sisters mental illness again came to the fore and this time the severity was such that she had to be put through Electro-convulsive Therapy (Shock treatment in laymen's terms). There were days when I and my mom used to sleep on alternate days to stay up with my sister at night since she was diagnosed with insomnia and sleep meds weren't working. This went on for two years. I somehow still managed to score decently in my school tests while helping my mom with chores and sister's therapy. But in the background, I was losing my social skills and was essentially becoming that quite kid in the class.

Jump to end of high school, I scored good (84%) and was planning to take admission into Commerce stream, but both my parents were adamant that I take up Science. I had no choice but suck up to them since in my country, my parents are supposed to be my legal guardians till I'm 18 and pay for my education. I barely was able to comprehend and grasp anything that was taught and just managed to clear my class 11 and 12 exams (59 and 55%). The only positives were that I regained my social skills, made friends and started going on dates. 

For my bachelors and masters, I opted for Information Technology as my main subject. I worked hard in those 6 years and went from being the worst kid in my batch to the University Topper. In the background, although my sisters health was improving, my parents relationship was deteriorating. My social life again took a freefall and by the end of Masters I was left with only 3 friends. My dating life was virtually 0. 

I was still trying to kickstart my career in the middle of all of this and did my first internship as sales/office assistant (USD 40/month). Thereafter I got another internship at one of the largest Fin-tech firms in my country (USD 500/month) and moved out of my parents house to a different city. Here, I again started working on myself, made friends and entered my first real relationship. I converted that internship into a Job offer and immediately became one of the Top 0.5% earners in my country (USD \~40000/PA).

From here again everything nose dived. My sister was emotionally closer to me than my parents since I was her only real friend and partner in crime to the fun we had. Her mental disorders started resurfacing ever since I moved out. In order to sooth her, I moved out my sister and mom to my place and immediately after 15 days, lockdown was announced due to C0V1D. We were stuck in our homes for nearly 1 year. In that 1 year, my girlfriend dumped me for her ex-. My friends started drifting away since they went back to their hometown because of WFH. Lastly my dad retired from Work last year and since then my life has become hell. He's grown more stingy with money and doesn't want to share pension or his earnings with my mom, got addicted to social media and refuses to take up responsibilities as a husband and father. So I have to share my earnings with my mom which I really don't mind. The frequency of fights between my parents over shared responsibilities and finances is growing day by day meanwhile my day goes into sorting their fights. 

As a consequence my work life and social life has started to suffer, my quality of work has declined. Frequent mistakes are being pointed out by my bosses. I can't learn new things and certified borderline ADHD. My social life is 0, my friend circle is 0 and I have given up on my dating scene. I used to call up/text my friends every time. This time I decided to wait for them to initiate. The result: 0 texts, calls from anyone for the past 7 days. I don't remember the last time someone wished me on my birthday.  I went from being a super fit athletic guy with a chiseled jawline to a middle aged, paunched guy with Salt and Pepper hair and zero jawline. I lost my 4 teeth in an accident (implants are being put) and lost all my confidence and securities in a single blow. 

The only good thing I have is a stable job and a 6 figure salary at the end of the month. I am really very frustrated, tired and depressed and don't know what more hardships future holds for me."

My schedule for the rest of the year had a ton of study halls as I was just taking what I needed to finish, but I really did not need them. I wanted to explore the world of technology more. My school's course guide presented a few options: pursuing an internship, starting college early, etc. These would all be a challenge as I did not have a car nor could my family or minimum-wage part-time job lead me to afford one, therefore I could not go offsite.

I then saw an option on the book called Technology Classroom Assistant. The description was to assist others throughout the school with technology issues and the technology teacher as well. I went with this to Mr. C, my computer science teacher, and asked if he could sponsor me for an assistantship. He told me he had never had one before and would look into it. A day later, he said he would sponsor me to fill all of my study halls and also the librarian would like me to assist her as well, so one day a week or so I would work out of the library. Mr. C told me he would hold me to very high standards and that it wasn't time for me to goof off; I told him I was ready to get my hands dirty. Mr. C was well-respected in the school and had been there for over 25 years. While he was tough, he was funny and friendly. He would even buy a spare school lunch and put it on his desk if a student was unable to eat lunch that day, otherwise he would offer it to students he knew were in poverty and didn't have large lunches.

I started and the experience was awesome! I was helping students in the classroom, doing small tasks like making copies and grading quizzes, and the librarian was amazing to work with as well. One of my tasks was to take care of Mr. C's morning tasks, which included getting someone from the office to open the door if he wasn't there when the bell rang, checking his office mailbox and bringing mail to his desk, and (relevant to this story) making copies of the packets he would give students for their units. Typically, teachers did not care (and even socialized with me) when I was in the copy room. Hell, I would even use the staff restroom during my working periods and go to the teacher's lounge without anyone intervening. I also helped fish out Mr. C's cell phone from a crevice in his SUV when he dropped it on his way to school.

One day, I was working  during 3rd block. Typically, I did my tasks during 1st block, but Mr. C had an additional worksheet for his 4th block he needed copied. Off to the copy room I went. As usual, I go in, use Mr. C's code to unlock the copy machine, and start making copies. Suddenly, I hear from behind me ""You know you're not supposed to be in here, right?""

I turned around and saw Mrs. K, one of the chemistry teachers. She was nice but ditzy and I had dropped her elective class because she refused to help me with problems. ""I'm Mr. C's assistant, making copies for 4th block."" I responded. ""That doesn't matter, no students can be in this room whatsoever, even if they are assistants. You need to go back to Mr. C after your copies are finished and tell him this, and also tell him a memo recently went out to staff reinforcing this."" She was nice about it, but I was still shocked this happened to me, especially with 1st block where me being in the copy room lead to great discussions with my Spanish and History teachers.

So, that's what I did. As I explained the situation, Mr. C's face turned redder by the second. When I was finished, he confirmed what I had said, and then told me to watch the class and he would be right back. He came back about 10 minutes later and called me to his desk. He pulled out his Hall Pass pad and wrote my name on it, in date he wrote the entire school year, and locations he wrote everywhere and then put ""(inc. copy room)"". He explained that he was going to leave again to laminate it and that I was to keep the pass in my wallet if this situation happened again. Also he said to come to him if anyone gives me any grief in the future, including administrators.

I was leaving school that day and I saw Mrs. K in the hallway. She looked at me with her eyes open and just stuttered ""Did you...tell Mr. C..."" I said ""As you instructed, I did. I did say you were nice about it."" Her mouth just stood open, she stared at me for a second, then walked back to her room.

I wasn't sure what happened between the two teachers, but I never got in trouble for being in the copy room - or anywhere else - again. The end of that school year, Mr. C said I was the biggest help ever, I could call him by his first name now, and he added me on Facebook. The school compensated me by giving me experimental learning credit, which boosted my GPA by putting 4 semesters of As on my report card.

The Technology Assistant program has since grown even further. More students are now enrolled in the program, and the librarian got so many interested helpers, the school gave the program its own space with desks for the students to work. They also started having students repair laptops and help with district IT tickets. So many students wanted to help, they actually laid off the full-time library assistant because giving As is so much cheaper. I go back on occasion and speak to the students, and I love it. I now teach part-time at a university besides working in the tech field as an engineering manager. I couldn't imagine life without being able to teach."

pmgpj7,7,2021-09-11,"Help, I kinda fucked up really bad",ipatrizio,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/pmgpj7/help_i_kinda_fucked_up_really_bad/,"So I am a rising sophomore at a pretty good school. I started fully remote last year, and I ended up being remote the entire year. My school does terms, and so in the fall and winter terms, I was doing really well. I didn’t mind being online; I loved my classes, my school, and I was motivated af. I still love my school and the classes I’ve taken, but by spring, being remote started feeling depressing, lonely, and pretty difficult. I know I wasn’t the only person going through that, so I don’t want to complain too much about it, but I think that made me unmotivated. I ended the winter term with all A’s in my 8 classes and had an overall 3.74 GPA for both term (i.e. 15 total courses) while also being in 4 clubs and stage managing 3 remote theater plays, for my theater production scholarship—that winter term.

Spring rolled around, and I was excited; initially, it was okay, but by the middle of the term, I didn’t feel entirely focused on school. At that point, many people were going back to school. My school was allowing it, but all classes were still fully remote, and I personally don’t have money to blow like that bc dorming is expensive. But, the fact that many people were there, including my two roommates, made me feel kind of lonely. So that term, I spent a lot of time doing club stuff ( I'm in 5 or more clubs) and on my phone and social media because I felt I was missing out and wanted to feel connected (I also had 3 asynchronous classes which made me procrastinate more, so it was harder to stay on track of that work compared to my other 5 synchronous ones). I also had to apply for internships and had around 12 interviews to prepare for and finish. I didn’t fail any of my classes. Still, I finished with a pass/fail (which I never did before), one C, a couple Bs and only a few As, which was not good enough by my standards and made my GPA 3.49. I threw up that night from stress. At that point, I was really depressed and was holding onto a lot of guilt. I thought, ok, maybe I can do some summer classes to make up for it, so I took 5 classes this summer. Spoiler alert, It was not a good idea at all. I just finished my classes this summer. I had two F’s, a D, a B, and an -A. The classes weren’t challenging by any means. I had a bad start because my home's Wi-Fi connection was down during the first 2-3 weeks, and I would have to travel to places like Panera bread to get free Wi-Fi which was still really slow. That made me fall behind a lot, and then I got super burnt out as a result. I also had trouble because lots of the work we did require a lot of disk space to download and handle the software, and my computer is pretty old. For instance, photoshop would tell me that my scratch disk was full, so I bought an external hard drive to help, but after a few days of using it, it would say it was full again. I tried cleaning my computer, but it was honestly tricky because I had a lot of important stuff on there. Long story short, my GPA is now a horrible 3.13. Frankly, I feel sick to my stomach every time I think about it and have thrown up a few times. I’m going to be on an internship at Oracle this coming fall and winter, so I won’t be able to take classes till spring and summer (that’s how my school works). I don’t get breaks in the summer, from now on, which is fine because I’ll be at school. I’m just nervous that I won’t be able to bring up my GPA higher than 3.50. I really don’t want to disappoint my parents because they were so proud of me. Now, I’m on probation because my GPA for the term was 1.66. I’m lucky that my overall GPA is still in the 3. range, but I’m so ashamed of myself. 

Any thoughts?

Am I an idiot? Has anyone else suffered through the same thing and has come back on top? please, I need hope :(

Also if you have any tips/advice, plsss share!

Thanks for reading all of this lol"

I feel so so Empty. I am 21 and I don't have the slightest idea about what to do with my life. I am 21 currently in the last year of university and even though I thought absolutely hate it,  I am still pushing through.

I am so so scared. What am I gonna do with my life? I don't like anything. Absolutely nothing gives me joy. I am currently doing an internship and I hate that too. It makes me wonder if  I'll ever be able to do any corporate job or if I'll ever even get a job.

I don't remember when was the last time I was happy. I every day I wake up and I feel sad. It's so painful to just even spend the day.  At night I can't sleep. I hate my childhood home. And my parents are very toxic, I don't wanna go back.

I don't have any friends, never had any romantic relationships, can't socialize. I am Scared of  People but I want to enjoy life, Have friends, Go to parties. I am an extrovert, but I always have to pretend to be an introvert because of my social anxiety.

pmhc2f,1,2021-09-11,Letters Of Recommendation: Help!!!!!,LadyEmaSKye,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/pmhc2f/letters_of_recommendation_help/,"To give some backstory, I am currently trying to apply to graduate school and having a problem with my letters of recommendation. I am applying to the same school where I got my undergrad, which I should be finishing (EE) this December. I am a straight-A student, 4.0 GPA, and already have an internship in the field working at a well respected research lab. I am fully confident I'm capable of accomplishing the work for my grad program.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I am currently having a problem with letters of recommendation. My school requires a minimum of 3 to apply. I've already asked for a letter from my mentor at my internship, and a professor I've taken a class with before and began doing research with this semester. However, I am unsure who to ask for a 3rd letter from. I haven't participated on a lot of research here at school, and I've done a pretty poor job of making relationships with my professors. ESPECIALLY due to COVID. I switched to the EE program during my junior year, and half of my junior year and the entirety of my senior year have been online, due to covid, so I haven't had opportunities to really interact with my professors (much less try to form these relationships since freshman year, since I switched programs so late). Most of my time outside of school I spend with my youth group at church/club, doing service and planning activities. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am unsure of who to ask for a third letter of recommendation. My current options are: The leaders who know me best are from my church group, but I know letters from outside of academia/relevant internships are frowned upon. I used to tutor math on campus and had a decent relationship with that professor, but I quit that job a year ago to pursue my internship, and they're from another department. I could also ask one of my professors from this/last semester, though even though I performed well in all of their classes I do not think they really know me that well, due to the online nature of the courses.

&amp;#x200B;

How important is it that every letter is really outstanding? I am applying to the same school where I performed exceptionally well, I have good test scores, and I have relevant experience in the career field. 

I need some advice!! Thank you!!!"

So to give some background, I finished bootcamp about 2 years ago, and had a few internships and worked on open source &amp; non profits since then. I was on and off with the job search but I had not been able to find full time employment. 

After taking a break from job searching, I decided that I want to return to looking for work, and it was around the same time that I decided to enroll in college because I wanted to get a CS degree. I found that school work takes a lot of my time up and I haven’t had as much time for activities outside of it.

So my question is should I fully commit to trying to get a degree? I did worry that if I do that, then companies might ask what have I been doing without work for so long. Maybe school is one of those things that they will understand though?

At the same time, I’m a bit antsy to try and start earning experience as well as some money so that I can be more financially secure.

In addition, would looking for jobs while slowly finishing up classes be a good route to take too? This would be my dream scenario :D

I regret not having work experience (due to personal problems). I didn't take advantage of internships when I was majoring in Psychology. But being this old (25) would it be viable to go back to community college and transfer to a school to do computer science? At the age of 27-28 will I still be able to land internships?

Sorry if this sounds like a stupid question. I am kind of lost. Also hopefully I am not posting in the wrong subreddit. Thanks."

I'm currently a sophomore computer engineering student. I like coding at the lower level, but I can't find any projects that interest me that I can do on my own. Anything that interests me is something that you do in a team (coding rockets, cars, etc.). I have a Game Boy Advanced and I thought of programming a game for it as a fun project for my resume. I was wondering if this project would be considered an ""embedded project"", that is, would it be useful in the eyes of someone hiring embedded interns? Programming the GBA is bare-metal, and there are interrupts and timers, but I was wondering if I should do something else that is more related to embedded systems? If I should do something else, what would you recommend? I plan on programming the GBA for fun at some point, whether or not it's useful for learning embedded systems, but now I want to do something that will boost my resume. Here is a guide to programming the GBA in case you need a reference: https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/"

I think it's a good company, and definitely somewhere I'd want to work in the future. However, all my previous internships have been remote, and I've liked that. Also, the job offer isn't really something I am entirely keen on. I wanted to get a hardware job, I told all the recruiters that. I got an offer for a software job. 

I'm dreading the thought of moving to a new town where I know no one, being away from my girlfriend for 3 months, and potentially disliking my job because no place will let me do hardware, they all want me to do software.

It's a good offer (still waiting on pay, but hopefully $26+), and the prospect of working in hardware with that company as a full-timer is very appealing long term. But moving states, and doing something I might not like just makes me less inclined to take the job.

Thoughts? Should I just suck it up? Am I being ungrateful?

I'm looking for advice on what i should do next and how I can attract and land an internship without having a year of uni under my belt (as this is a requirement by a lot of places). 

Currently, I know basic HTML, CSS, and JS along with some python and flask to create a site where we trade stocks (this was a problem set in the CS50 course)

A lot of people recommend creating a personal project but I don't know what to create or where to start or what should my portfolio look like?

pmmy26,65,2021-09-12,Moonmen,whoisthespy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pmmy26/moonmen/,"Let me begin this story with some background. I am not an engineer for NASA or a scientist. I am considered the lowest of the low. I am merely a janitor, but the pay is great, and I don't even know why. 

I walked past the lab, carrying some supplies, and handed them to the scientists. I could see an 8k view of the moon on the massive screen, and they were all staring intently at it. Before I left, I *accidentally* spilled some water onto the floor, and I took the mop from the cart. I slowly started to mop, and they all ignored me, for I was just the janitor; the janitor couldn't do anything. Right? 

I saw a blown-up picture of the moon on the screen, and everyone was crowning around, looking at a single spot. I also looked on in amazement, as I saw a black figure hopping around. I felt a chill, and even at a distance, I could tell that the thing was looking at us. Not wanting to be there for another second longer, I ran out of the room, and the moment I did, I heard screaming coming from the room.

I re-entered to see only darkness, and I was confused at first, then scared. It was here. How was it here? But as usual, it was just my active imagination. The power had cut out. It had seemed that the creature was somehow involved. I could hear low murmurs coming from the scientists, and I caught snippets of conversation. ""We have four backup generators. The odds for a complete outage are almost impossible!"" The scientist grasped around at their radios, and other devices, trying, and failing to communicate. Then, Jenny, the only person to ever acknowledge me, called me over. I walked over, slowly, afraid of what they were going to say. They handed me a map, a flashlight, and a simple six-shot revolver. They pointed to a point on the map, and I nervously gulped. I was always afraid of the dark.

I slowly made my way through the confusing corridors, and tried my best to follow the map. Soon, I was lost. The map was huge, and I couldn't pinpoint where I was. It was like a harder version of ""Where's Waldo?"". I was busy tracing my steps, when I heard the sound. It was a loud siren. ""Good, I thought, the power was back on."" I thought. That's when I realised that there was nothing powered on, except for the sirens. It was ominous. That's when I realised that the sound was coming closer. I panicked, and started aimlessly running. Left, right, right, straight, up the stairs. I was panicking. The darkness was not helping.

The sirens we coming closer, and I had nowhere left to run. ""Why the fuck, did a corridor just end?"" I remember thinking. I saw the tall, lanky figure, standing there. I curled up into the fetal position, and started to cry silently. The sirens were deafening. I then realised something. Why, would anything make that loud of a sound? Isn't that the exact opposite of evolution? Why would something make sound? Unless… Yes. That's it. It must be how it hunts! I gave myself a mental pat on the back, and started to sprint past it. I knew that, even with echo-location, it would have a delay. I sprinted as fast as I could, and as I passed the thing, I saw that it only had two hollow pits for eyes. Its mouth was open, and it seemed to be the source of the sound. 

They have ransacked the station, and I don't even know what they are, or where they came from. Their screeching is enticing now. It's like a siren's call. It calls me to crawl out of this vent, and for me to join them. Every now and again, I see a white robe pass my hiding spot, and I know that it is not the scientists. Not anymore. The things. I'm calling them moonmen. The moonmen are slowly crowding around my hiding place, screeching, their loud sirens. I think about the power I would feel, if I just walked outside. If I just let them take me. They are now all outside the little hatch. The scientists, the interns, the doctors, hell, even the front desk lady is here. They're always screeching, always trying to get me to go outside. I'm rambling, aren't I? I'm just repeating the same things over and over again. Help. I need help. Help me. I don't even know if this will send; the signal here is so bad. 

If you are reading this, I have already gone outside to join them. So this is a warning to you all. If you hear sirens, run. The Moonmen have arrived."

pmo8zt,2,2021-09-12,Tutorials vs Mentoring?,arlindmusliu,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/pmo8zt/tutorials_vs_mentoring/,"What's the best approach to help young students develop their career?

Yes, it's true that there are tons of tutorials for learning programming, but is that the fastest and best way to learn.

I have lots of experience with students in free code camps and in my own company. This is my approach:

1. Tutorials - Yes, the students need to know the basics of a programming language, and there's no need for me to do that since there are many great tutorials available. But, then what?

2. Mentorship - Once the student understands the basics and have already tried to build something, we can continue with mentorship. This is where you tell them the best way to do a project, but you don't do it for them. 

In my company, we accept students as interns and our requirement is that they need to have good knowledge of HTML and CSS, whereas Tailwind CSS is a bonus. Then, for 3 months we let them code real projects while we evaluate their code, since we have to deliver quality products to our clients. In the end of the internship, they feel super confident to work on frontend projects for any company.

For backend, we ask them to know the basics of PHP and then we show them Laravel. After 3 months, they are able to build their own backend (ok, they still need someone to do the db schema for them).

I strongly believe that interns should be mentored each day for about 30 mins. Not more than that, because then you make them lazy and they start using you like Google.

I hate it when IT companies accept interns, give them some tutorials to learn and that's it, no mentorship. I believe they do it for promotion or just to show off.

I know a few companies that accept 4,5 times more interns than us, and the interns are not happy with the treatment because they feel abandoned. Why can't they just accept as many interns as they can handle to guide them through some professional development?

What do you guys think? Is there any better way for helping young students to develop their career?"

Let me detail my scenario and profile below  


TLDR; low-average profile, please suggest which uni has good chance getting in(uni list at bottom)  


edit: I know I shouldn't be making too much constraints on filtering unis as my profile is already a weak one. Apologies if it is too much. 

# Profile

\- I'm in India and completed my undergrad in 2019, majored in Electronics. 

\- I was a sub-par student during my undergrad CGPA - 6.7 and had about 9 backlogs. 

\- Nevertheless I was pretty active on the extracurricular front - served as chairperson of electronics department association, YRC volunteer and chief editor of college magazine. 

\- After undergrad I joined as a Tech Writer at a US based startup (but worked in their India branch) which has a good reputation in the US now. I worked there for 2.5 yrs, recently quit, and now I'm interviewing for software developer role. 

\- In terms of CS related experience, I guess it counts 0 now, as I'm not sure if tech writing is considered as experience for CS courses. 

\- I took my GRE last week and scored 300 (157Q 143V).

\- I managed to get 3 strong LORs - department HoD, team lead and product manager.

\- I specifically requested my HoD to add a few lines about my backlogs and how I improved thereon. He said that he'll place emphasis on that. 

\- I have been at a hackathon once and that's the only project on my resume now. Additionally, I'm working on another project using python, and on my portfolio website. Both should be completed soon.

\- Now one more interesting thing is in the past month I've contributed to two open source projects on github. Both are somewhat mid-sized and forked by 1k people or so.

\- I've been sharpening my SOP for a few weeks now and I'm confident that it can make an impact on the Adcom.

\- Yet to take my TOEFL (scheduled for Sept 18th) but I can ensure 90+ on that.

&amp;#x200B;

# What expectations I have for colleges:

\- It should not be in the top 100 universities. Yes you read it right. I came to this conclusion after doing my undergrad and highschool in a high achievers environment. It is extremely mentally taxing for me to be in such an environment and hence I don't really want to be in place with high achievers. I just want to focus my energy on getting an internship and job, and grades enough to sail through. 

\- Public or private doesn't matter. I wasn't born with a silver spoon, but I can arrange for the required funds be it private or public uni.

\- Uni should be inside a major city. And these are the 5 cities I'm looking in order of preference -  San Fran, Seattle, Boston, NYC, Chicago. Main reason being that, larger the city higher the number of tech events, competitions, job fairs, networking and job openings. I know lot of it is possible now virtual but it never beats the in-person aspect.

\- Although I don't want to be in any uni in the top 100, I can't go too low in ranking either. This is because I've heard US Visa officers are notorious for rejecting visas for students going to extremely low-ranked or no-ranked unis.   


# Unis I have in mind: 

\- Santa Clara University

\- University of San Francisco

\- San Francisco State University

\- Seattle University

\- University of Massachusetts Boston

\- New Jersey Institute of Technology

\- Stevens Institute of Technology

\- New York Institute of Technology

\- Pace University 

\- City College of New York  


Please share your thoughts on which unis out of this list has maximum chance of me getting an admit.  It'll be really helpful for me to align accordingly. Thanks in advance!"

So for some better explaination I'll try to quickly describe how I got here and why it's worrying me.

I came ouf IT school last year but due to some circumstances I had no diploma whatsoever. With pandemic I tried pursuing another school but didn't find internship and so I didn't want to keep going if it meant no experience in any company ( except a 2 month internship ).

I went back to my parents place and found a job like a month ago as a Tech support in the medical field.And that's what is worrying me, it's so much responsibilites and sensitive softwares and stuff to deal with, I'm not sure I can do it and handle the pressure it is to deal with such sensitive matter.

My superior warned me about the stuff to be careful about, people here are very nice but that's a lot to deal with and it's potentially everyday that I put myself 'at risk'.

Working hours and pay is not that bad since they agreed to take me even though I had close to no previous experience so that's why it feels so hard to think about leaving and looking for something else, which might take another year or so to find. But on the other hand it's a lot of pressure and even after leaving work I still think about if I will fuck up anytime soon or something like that.

If any of you guys have advices to share I'll be glad to hear you."

I've been working at a HUGE company for 2.5 years now (4 years if you include internships, etc. there).  
I'm only 25 and I have this sudden urge to switch things up a bit, since the job is getting a bit boring, chances of being promoted are slim, I've never worked for another company and also I'd much rather live in Berlin (or Amsterdam or Dublin) than in the small city I live in now.  
According to my friends and colleagues it would be immensely stupid to give up this very secure job with great benefits, good work environment, 35h/week and pretty high salary (\~70k) for a job at a ""cool"" tech company or startup in e.g. Berlin with more work and less pay (maybe 45h and 60-65k?). 

What are your general opinions on this? I honestly don't know what to do anymore.   
Also, would it be better to get a bit more experience first (3 years instead of 2-2.5?) or wait until the Corona situation in EU gets a bit better?   
And please also let me know if you can recommend cool companies in Berlin or Amsterdam (was thinking maybe Zalando, HelloFresh, SAP, Omio, Trade Republic, ...).   
   
Happy for any input, please help me :)

Here are some aspects of my profile:

* **Undergrad GPA : 9.4** (College is somewhere between tier 1 and tier 2, NIRF ranking around 20-25, if those are relevant at all)
* **GRE: 329** (160V 169Q 4.5AWA)
* **IELTS: 8.5** (9L 8.5R 8S 7.5W)
* Applying for the intake right after graduation, so **no work experience**
* SDE **summer internship (2 months)** at an MNC (my manager here has agreed to write me an LOR)
* Data Analyst **internship (4 months)** with a good fintech company
* I have an **offer for 6 month intern + FTE**, starting January '22 from a very well established name in the Tech industry (hope I can mention this?)
* College Projects: **2 main projects (official)**, of which 1 is used by everyone on campus on a regular basis, and the other one by the department staff during admissions (both were full stack web apps)
* Research experience: Weak. **ZERO papers published**. Only a **research internship** at a top NIT, which was not very fruitful and probably won't be backed by an LOR.
* **Extracurricular activity: Strong** (imo). Led the computing club at my college. I'll mention stuff about this in my LORs
* **A few personal projects** (some in the CV/ML space, and some in the Web dev space) and **2 hackathon awards** (don't know if they matter)

I'm not keen on applying to safe universities, because I'm okay with staying back and taking the job offer as well. I'll go only if I get into a good place. Otherwise I'll re-apply after a couple of years, with some work ex and maybe some research ex.

**Please suggest some more universities** to add to this list! I guess **location and internship/co-op** opportunities would be a **huge factor for me**, as I'm applying to professional/non-thesis courses only.

Is this list okay, do I have a shot? It's just that I'm worried about having no solid research experience :/

pmrgx3,1,2021-09-12,What are the career progression options for a cloud architect?,5quidw4rd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pmrgx3/what_are_the_career_progression_options_for_a/,"So I recently completed a cloud architecture internship at a certain big tech company - really enjoyed the work and thankfully they told me they were looking to have me back for a full-time position. Though I'm just a little worried about career progressions for a cloud architect especially for a fresh grad. From what I searched online, it seems that cloud architects have trouble moving to a more technical role (like software engineering) and usually progress to a more management-centric role instead. Becuz of this I'm not sure if going for such a role is a good choice for someone straight out of college. Any opinions or advice will be much appreciated :)"

After only 1 month of being there, I got fired, the CTO told me it's because *""I don't have enough experience""* and *""I have low confidence in my work""* and that *""I ask too many questions and questions that shouldn't be asked""* stating that I could go open a Stack Overflow post instead of bothering my senior developer for help. I told him that juniors can never ask too many questions, he said that's not true and quite the opposite. The CTO then told me he actually wanted to fire me from the first two weeks.

For more context, my senior was working 100% remotely and I was working on an unfamiliar outdated tech stack AngularJS/PHP/Laravel on an old poorly written legacy codebase, I refactored a part of their code where there was a lot of duplicates and completed 3 Jira tasks during that 1 month."

pmw7fc,1,2021-09-12,"CS Post-bacc, no tech experience, paying for loans?!",promisered,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pmw7fc/cs_postbacc_no_tech_experience_paying_for_loans/,"Hi!

Earlier this year I completed my Bachelors degree in Public Health (Have some experience in Medical field utilizing EHR if that has any worth in CS) with about 12k in loans (no other debt). In my current full-time position in human services, I make about 39k, but will be starting a new job making about 50k soon. 

I just applied for an online post-bacc CS program at Oregon State for Winter 22' because I dread human services and have known for years to be honest.. I have always had an interest in tech and no longer want to make excuses to keep myself in human services.. It has changed me a lot and even worsened my depression. I also looked into University of Oregon's coding bootcamp but I have heard it is a scam. I know with this post-bacc I will be very motivated to pursue this career change. I have been unsuccessful with self-teaching and have read it is a very small percentage of those who get hired. They also are the best of the best at that point. 

While researching online I have seen it is highly recommended to have some experience even if it is help desk. My thing is, I stress out about having debt and being able to invest in retirement.  I'm 23 and finally have benefits and make more and than I ever have/than my parents make. I know side projects are an option. But to land an internship I know having both would be amazing.  I have very minimal experience in creating websites from ages 11 and 14. 

This post-bacc program is about 32k, and I plan to take out about 24k in loans (if i stay at this new job making 50k). If I take on a full-time entry tech job I will most likely reduce my income. I am also thinking of a part-time human services job (hopefully well-ish paying) and part-time entry tech if I am able to find one. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts, recommendations, advice?"
pmwdil,21,2021-09-12,Planning for MS in CS. Could use some help in evaluating my profile. Any feedback is very much appreciated ^^,uzrfsh,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/pmwdil/planning_for_ms_in_cs_could_use_some_help_in/,"Heyo,

I really need someone to tell me where my standing is as per my profile. I am aware my profile pales in comparison to others on this subreddit, always thought was doing pretty good for myself until I came upon here and got a huge dose of reality (in a good way though).

Hoping to apply for MS in CS in Fall 2022

My profile:

**Undergrad:** Tier 3 college with an 86% (no backlogs), graduated in 2019

**GRE:** 319 (V:159, Q:160, 4.5 AWA) (That quant score... yikes)

**IELTS: 8** (S:8.5, R: 9, L:8, W:7)

**Work experience:** \~3 years - One internship while I was still in college at a startup, 1.5 years in a well knows MNC as SDE, then jumped ship to another MNC cause better incentives and will probably remain here until I leave for my masters.

**Projects:** One major project in college and several personal projects. I also worked on a variety of domains at work, big data, webdev, did receive accolades and promotions at work, but not sure if it matters.

**Research Experience:** I did look up several research papers while working on my major project while in college but I am assuming that and reading documentation doesn't count for research, definitely didn't publish any papers so research experience comes down to nada, hope to change this in my masters.

**Extracurricular:** I think I did a decent job, was an associate head and then head in my final year for my college's computing club, led student organized workshops, organized events at the college campus and won/made to finals for hackathons and coding contests (have certificates and docs to back all of this up)

The only schools I have in mind right now is **University of Florida** and **University of Texas, Arlington**, primarily because I have friends there, but based on my understanding, it would probably be barely possible for me to get into these.

But I would really appreciate if someone could recommend me any universities and my chances there if I even have a shot. Thanks for reading all this, appreciate."
pmwpw0,50,2021-09-12,How to get a return offer - Investment Banking,BenDoverR8Now,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/pmwpw0/how_to_get_a_return_offer_investment_banking/,"Some Background:

* First-generation immigrant student 
* Nondiversity and non-target (top 30 school - well known for business but doesn't have a lot of representation on the street) 
* 3.9 GPA, VC internship freshmen summer, PE internship sophomore spring, Commercial Banking internship sophomore summer at a local boutique bank --&gt; IB SA Internship at top EB (PJT/CVP/EVR)
* Extra-curriculars: President of Investment Club on Campus, Admissions Tour Guide 
* Received full-time offer and returning to said EB after graduation 
   * Average workweek over 10 weeks: \~70-80 hours/week 
   * Weekdays: Generally 8:30 am to 10:30 pm 
   * Weekends: Rarely ever got work on Saturdays (had 1 week out of my internship where I maybe put in 2 hours of work). Sundays were generally busy but slow (\~6-8 hours of work on average)
   * Compensation: Take home about \~15k/summer (remote so no housing costs) after taxes 

I recognize that EBs generally have a high return offer rate. However, I thought I would still do a write up about my experience and learnings so it can benefit future students and interns:

1. Realize you are at the bottom of the totem pole. While you will be pulling long hours as a SA and it will feel tiring, it is important to recognize that the work that you do doesn't add a lot of value to the deals. Most of the time it is administrative work that anyone could have done, and most of the time, all the work that nobody else in the group wants to do will fall on you. Most of the tasks are gonna be repetitive (whether that's updating a deck or quals page) and will feel very boring. However, it is important that you do these boring tasks well. It shows that you can be trusted and your group will feel more comfortable giving you complex tasks as the summer goes on. 
2. Being likable is more important than being smart: The type of analyst you're staffed with on your first few deals can make or break your SA experience because so much of your work is going to be dictated by them. Luckily I was able to build a strong rapport with my analyst very early on, and this helped me tremendously. If there was ever something I wasn't sure how to do - I knew I could reach out to ask for help, even if it was something really simple. Learn to be likable and quickly build a friendship with your analysts. It goes a long way
3. Learn to suck it up - It happened multiple times over the summer where I would put in extra hours at night to finish a model or deck and it would never get used in the client presentation. Even worse is when an analyst or associate takes your work and shows it to the VP/MD and passes it off as their own. Always frustrated the hell out of me but I realized once again, that I am at the bottom of the totem pole, and just need to suck it up. Unfortunately, as toxic as this sounds - it's just how the industry works
4. Be available - Honestly one of the best ways to stand out as an SA. If you are always available whenever you are pinged, even on weekends, it's one of the biggest differentiators. Know a couple of my friends from college at other firms who didn't get a return offer because they replied to their associate 4 hours late on a weekend. 
5. Double and triple-check your work - Your job as a SA is to make your analyst's job easier. Even if it takes you longer, learn to double and triple-check your work. It saves the analyst time and will make you stand out to them. 
6. Time management - Learn to manage your time well. Keep track of your assignments and projects and the deadlines assigned to them. If you finish an assignment that your associate gave you 4 hours for and it took you 2, don't send it to them right away. Instead, check your work and take a small break for an hour if you need to. Easier to do when you're remote but you can probably pull this off in the office as well. 
7. Look at the bigger picture: Learn to look at the bigger picture behind your deals. A lot of times you'll be too busy with the details in the model or re-aligning logos on the deck that you'll forget the purpose of why you're doing it. But it's important to recognize WHY you're including the page you're creating or what the PURPOSE of the model is. Just keeping these things in mind will help you output better work. I also found that understanding the why also kept me somewhat more motivated to keep going. 
8. Take initiative and learn - don't be afraid to make mistakes early on in ur SA internship and take initiative on tasks that you haven't done before. At the end of the day, one of the biggest reasons to do IB is to accelerate learning early on in your career. Even if a model sounds tough, just give it a shot. But always remember to ask questions if you need to. 
9. Google is your best friend - honestly half the answers you'll have as a SA can easily be found on Google. So learn to use it. If an answer can be easily found on google, don't bother your analyst about it. But also be smart. If you're working on an urgent model and it's taking you more than 15 mins to figure something out - just ask. 
10. Have fun: Probably the most important. Learn to have fun and get along with fellow SAs and analysts. You're working alongside some of the smartest people and many of them will have interesting backgrounds. Even if you don't get a return offer, many of these connections will be incredibly valuable in the future. 

Last but not least, always question whether YOU want to work in the industry/company. As much as the company is vetting you, you need to vet the company as well. Maybe through your internship, you recognize that IB or just the culture of your firm is not for you. It's important and perfectly fine to know that and you should always do what's best for you. 

Best of luck and feel free to DM/comment for any further questions! Happy to help"

Hey all! It's me again from last year's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ldd3xv/summer_2021_internship_application_results/). 

I decided to conclude my internship hunt earlier this time around since there are other responsibilities going on in my life. However, I wanted to share with you all some insight on how much of a boost a single FAANG company gives. 

Also since I am trying to remain as anonymous as possible, please refrain from any personal questions/guesses :) 

**Experiences:**

* Facebook
* MLH Fellowship
* Big project-based organization within my school

**Results:**

5 Total offers: 

* Facebook (Return Offer) 
* Google (Guaranteed Match)
* Snapchat
* Datadog
* MealMe

Notable Phones/Final Rounds: 

* Microsoft (Withdraw)
* Coursera (Withdraw)
* Asana (Withdraw)
* Stripe (Reject)
* Figma (Reject)
* Kapwing (Reject)

I combined both Withdrawals and Rejections. However, for a specific number of rejections, it was 9 total rejections.

After some consideration, I decided to stick to FB and try Snapchat. However, I was strongly considering Datadog and Google.

If you have any questions about the companies, offer details, timelines I've listed feel free to post them below! I want to help out as much as possible."

pmx8m0,1,2021-09-12,My boss isn't being accommodating to my student schedule. What do I do?,beachylawgirl22,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/pmx8m0/my_boss_isnt_being_accommodating_to_my_student/,"EDIT: Thanks for the advice y'all. I spoke to the store manager, and she gave me a hard time about my limited availability, so I'm now working on my letter of resignation to quit my job. 

Really looking for advice right now. I'm a 23F college student in my last semester: I go into my internship for 15 hours every week, and that is on top of classes, club/organization meetings and events, and I recently just implemented a new workout routine which will take away some time. All of this is stressful to begin with, especially because I'm now starting to apply for jobs in my field! I had initially planned on working as well, but the person in charge of my schedule at work is being less than accommodating. I work retail and I transferred stores so I could be at the store closer to my college campus, and the guy who is in charge of my schedule now is the one who works at the store in my college town. I've told him from day one ""my availability is limited, I am a college student with all of this going on. This is my only availability and I really only want to work 12 hours because my school stuff and my internship are my top priority right now"" when I gave him the limited availability I had. And he seemed to have no problem with it. This past week, I called him asking when he was going to be putting in my schedule, and he gave me a vague answer along the lines of ""I'm processing it with the current schedule"". Yesterday, he calls me after I'm barely catching my breath post-workout class and he tells me ""yeah, I talked to my store manager and she'll only accept your availability if you also have an open availability and can work all day on one weekend day"". And I responded saying that I was concerned about that because I have important events that come up for school that I cannot miss, and his only reply to this was ""well, we can give you some time to think about it, but we really need to know as soon as possible so we can put you on the schedule"". I'm insanely annoyed at this because I never made my student status a secret and made it clear that my availability was going to be limited. When I spoke to my friends, they said ""if they're going to be this difficult with you, get a new job"" but I'm concerned that another company won't hire me with a limited availability. When I talked to my mom about it, she said that I should play hardball and tell him that I can only work until 5pm on Sundays (I have a meeting at 7pm on Sundays for an organization I'm in) and that if I have a school event or meeting that I need to go to, that I plan on calling out. I have no idea what to do. This is so overwhelming, especially considering that including the availability I gave them, they will be expecting me to work at least 16 hours a week, which will barely leave me time to get school work done, get a decent amount of sleep, or give me adequate time to set aside to clean my apartment because I like to get caught up and get things done on the weekends. Any advice?"

I plan to graduate from here with a bachelors in cs and wanted to know if anyone has been through my situation/can answer a question I have. I have a possibly good chance of getting an internship with a company that usually starts it’s employees off at 70k a year (mentioning that because I’m not 100% sure if that’ll let you guys know if it’s a big or small company) and let’s say for the sake of my plan I land this internship my junior year and I stay through with them until I graduate. Will having graduated from a cc impact my opportunities drastically even though I have an internship under my belt? Will I be paid significantly less compared to if I were to go to a state school?

Questions/Comments: MIT does not guarantee admission for being recruited but I think it helps. Also, should I even submit my ACT anywhere? Thanks for all the help guys."
pn2jhn,1,2021-09-12,Machine Learning Internships,mikcnt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pn2jhn/machine_learning_internships/,"Hey there! I'm currently finishing my MSc in CS (expected graduation is \~march 2022), mostly focusing on ML &amp; AI. I'm searching for interesting internships, especially as machine learning engineers. However, I'm having a hard time finding something that's not FAANG and that doesn't require 1+ years of experience (I have literally 0 atm).

I therefore have two questions:

1) Would you suggest me to change direction and apply for generic software engineering internships?

(All python)


Im an econ student, trying to learn programming as best as I can alone, due to my course not providing much. I had some R/vba classes but thats all.

I did some sql/python courses provided by morgan stanley, and also automated some excel with vba and pandas during an internship.

Recently I applied to a slightly more technical role, where I got a 4hour takeaway exercise as part of the interview..
 And thats when I realised how little I know, and got my confidence put in place. I couldve done the exercise if I had a few days for it, but in 4 hours I did terrible.

It was mostly about webscraping, using site maps, and creating pandas df from JSON formats, which was new to me. Are there any good courses regarding these topics? Udemy/coursera anything?"

pn5xrg,6,2021-09-12,Having a chat with a recruiter who contacted me about an NOC Engineer Position on Tuesday...advice please,Boruckii,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/pn5xrg/having_a_chat_with_a_recruiter_who_contacted_me/,"Backstory:

I have been pursuing a career in IT for some time, and realized that the Networking or Cybersecurity path are those that are most attractive to me.

I passed my Security+ in May and CCNA in August. I am 70% through with WGU Computer Science Program.

When I passed my CCNA, I started getting some interest. I had a Cisco recruiter message me about an internship as a Network Support Engineer the same day I passed the exam, and when I responded by telling her I passed the CCNA like 3 hours prior, I was immediately forwarded into the interview process for this position, which was a little overwhelming because I didn't expect so much so fast. I ended up flopping a troubleshooting interview that was step 2/5, but I think I did well otherwise. That is my only interview experience I have.

Now:

A recruiter from a known agency asked to speak with me because he thinks I may be a fit for an available NOC Engineer role. He also mentions other available roles, but we are having a chat on Tuesday. What should I expect out of this? What are some questions that I can ask him that may be outside of my realm of thinking right now?

My biggest concern is that that I am just severely underqualified for this position. My resume is simply certifications and things I can extract from those exams. However, on the other hand, I'm sure the recruiter has done his job for a while, and already knows that(He contacted me on LinkedIn, and my LinkedIn clearly shows that I have certs and no professional experience)  and maybe its a role for fresh CCNAs who are more able to be molded? Idk. I'm confident with what I know, but I just don't know what to expect when a recruiter contacts to chat about an available role(s). I would just like to hear any advice you may have for someone who has extremely little experience interviewing for these roles (My background is Serving/Bartending/Managing at restaurants) or maybe things I should expect.

I obviously want this position, but on the other hand, if I don't get it, I love my current plan as well. I don't feel any pressure on that side of things. Its just normal nerves that I feel I can work with. I just want to be as prepared as possible for this call.

pn7rib,2,2021-09-12,"for those not working 365 days, how does a 80mi commute work out for you?",dirqs,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/pn7rib/for_those_not_working_365_days_how_does_a_80mi/,"tldr; got a decent starter job, hate the location, will try to switch job locations ASAP, but have to deal with a 80mi/day commute.

hey, again, reddit - last time i had a bunch of bad career options and ended up taking one that ended up being pretty decent despite external issues (the reasons i had to leave it).

since leaving that job, wherein i learned the value of short commutes, i wound up back in a major city, high col area, major traffic, but the job opportunity is good and will look good on my resume. for the next five years i can advance and it's not the worst starter job by a long shot but not the most ideal when compared to everything else in the state.

here's the breakdown - i have never had a good commute where i lived my entire life, went to school, did my internships, etc. but my temp stint in another area showed me the value of a 30min or less daily roundtrip commute. the problem is my new job offer is in an area i hate: no diversity in people/places/food, hot as hell, and far from my support network. for what i would pay, the amenities are severely lacking, too. stats say crime is lower, but i just think it's because the place is more isolated as some apartments in the area are reporting a lot of property crime. i do know i hate long commutes, but i also know from the pandemic that i hate feeling trapped/isolated.

this past week, i've read everything i could on reddit and various links to external sites about people who do not benefit from long commutes and the value/money/lost time involved in sacrificing for that commute - i.e., family, col, preferred areas, etc, but i could be in a slightly different situation. as i'm in the education field, i only work 200ish days, so my 40 mile commute would not be for 365 days out of the year. possibly less than 205 because i accrue vacation and will take it when it maxes out, or use sick days for when i become ill.

it still adds up to a (over-guestimated) month+, 80mi/day, and about $7k\~ a year i'm losing to commuting, but i would be able to live somewhere 10-20 degrees cooler and be around people i can rely on.

for anyone working this type of schedule, is it still a bad idea, especially as someone who is in their 1st year of their career, to add the stress of commuting? i feel like the money would either go to my car maintenance/gas or higher rent/higher electric bills depending on my choice.

i wouldn't be spending any money living near work besides my home bills since there's nothing to do if i live near work. i might spend some money living in the city eating out 1x month with friends, maybe investing a hybrid car/tesla for my stupid commute that will hopefully only last 1-5 years depending on how fast i can land a similar job closer to where i want to be.

i might also save anything extra and go travelling again once a year once i have all my finances and savings in order after grad school. but that would be the limit of my foreseeable expenses outside of necessary costs. plus, my s.o. is going to be closer if i do the 40 mile commute.

because i work most of the year, even if the city is not safer and the 40 mile traffic will suck, i'm driving somewhat against traffic in the morning (1hr max) and am facing the worst of it at the end of the day (2hrs worst case. maybe 3-4 if it's a real bad day), but on holidays/breaks i can be nearer to people i have strong ties with and not even have to worry about commuting.

with all this in mind, does anyone with a similar schedule have any advice on this matter?

i honestly don't think i'll ever love the location of my job, so i will move if i get hired closer to where i want to be after this year."

I aim to be a financial developer (quant dev). What would be the ideal master to pursue? I had in mind either computational finance or machine learning. However, these programs both have their criticism. I heard that MFEs tend to focus on derivatives pricing (and thus less on actual programming) and that a Msc ML might be too shallow (use of a few python libraries with no real knowledge of the statistical workings of the ML tools). However, both these programs would have an internship baked in the curriculum. Which of these options would be more suited to a role as a financial software developer?  


I have also though about low latency networking/programming, but cannot find such programs? I guess it would be Electrical Engineering (for FPGA and such).

But what I do have is a good credit score (in the 700's) and a credit history of around 3 years. I also included recent bank statements that reflect a balance greater than or equal to 12 times the amount of rent (which is stated as a requirement in the application).

My only hesitation to adding a co-signer/guarantor, is that I have to pay an additional $50 application fee (which I don't particularly want to do if I could qualify by myself).

Any advice on what I should do? Should I just pay the extra $50 to have a better chance getting approved? Do you think I have a shot at getting approved by myself?"

There are decent amount of opportunities provided for getting into companies. There were couple of opportunities provided this semester but I was not able to clear anything and I want to do something about it.

Internships are starting next semester and I have about 4 months to prep myself up.

Ive read a lot of posts here and other sites. The fair consensus seems to be to learn DSA and then solve leet code. But it seems pretty vague the path inbetween then and the path to learn DSA.

There are plethora of courses available online and I don't know which one to follow. I want to stick to one source and then switch to others 

I think a lot if people here might have learnt DSA from multiple sources and can somone please suggest which one to choose and how to move forward from there.

How should be the journey to leetcode after DSA. Someone please guide me."

*while rant == 1:*

Not on this account, but on others, I've followed this subreddit for years. I always saw post like ""After XXX applications, I finally got hired!"". I thought, how bad could it be??? I knew that if I wanted to make myself hirable, I had to be good at something and there were a couple of things that resonated with my hobbies that I really excelled in and also part of my undergrad.

I have been applying to jobs since the beginning of this year! I graduated in June 2021. I unfortunately didn't have an internship during my undergrad as I just had no time or resources to devote to it. I was and am running a business (how I paid partially for school), so that didn't leave me with time to take. I feel like I've already applied over 300 times. I was doing 2-3 applications per week since the beginning of 2021 and ramping up my applications as I got closer to graduation and post grad. From those, I've had over 10 rejections, 3 specified my lack of experience, 2 mentioned that my salary was too high (was asking for 60K), the others didn't mention anything. I've since not put a salary or salary range and when required I just put open to negotiate (if able to).

I have had a total of 2 companies reach out to me. One asked me to take an assessment, which I took and passed. Another one actually scheduled 2 interviews with me (one follow-up after my first interview). It really felt like I was going to get the job. The first person who interviewed me (HR) mentioned to me that the engineers really liked my resume and the interview with her. Even during the follow-up interview, the engineers seemed very eager to have me on board. We all vibed with each other... On both occasions, we went over the time limit given by them, both interviews going over 1 hr. That last interview was over 3 weeks ago. Was told 1-2 weeks would be needed for me to get an answer from them. No answers yet.... Sent follow-up email 9 days ago, also no replies.

As a mechanical engineering student, I felt as though I always excelled in analytical, CAD, and programming work, mostly due to my hobbies in electronics and 3D printing. I always tutored my friends when it came to math, programming and CAD work. Many of my friends have even thanked me over the years telling me that they probably couldn't have graduated without my help. I always wowed my professors too when it came to programming and CAD work. Again, I had picked up both from hobbies before I started university years ago and only honed them in more as I started my undergrad.

By the time I was in university, I already had 4+ years in CAD and 5+ years in programming. Math was also my better subject in high school. I also didn't start university right away. I worked for 7 years right out of high school, 4 of those years were at aerospace companies as an inspector. I felt as though I was probably above my peers when it came to experience and knowledge, yet from most of my friends whom graduated with me, I am sitting unemployed as an engineer, months after graduating. That list of friends graduating went from 8 unemployed to now 3. Rest have gotten engineering jobs.

It feels so odd seeing this. One of my friends, who knew nothing about electronics and would often times ask me for help, is now working at a well known defense contract company working with electronics! He got the job a week after graduating! Another friend who always asked me for help in Matlab and Simulink, ended up getting a job working with that, like a month after graduating. Another friend who I always helped with CAD work, also recently got a job at a machine shop doing... you guessed it, CAD!

I keep trying to stay positive, but more and more friends are getting jobs or interviews while I am stuck doing jack all (except for my business, but I mean jack all as not working as an engineer)! Now, I can't stop but feel depressed. I'm now doing 10 applications per week and sometimes I even wonder what is the point??? The year is about to end and I am still jobless (well in engineering). I feel like I will be the last guy to get a job....

The thing that scares me is that some of my old time friends, pre-university, that became engineers years ago, have not had a job as engineers in years and I don't want to be like them. I have two friends, one graduated in 2018 and the other in 2017, both electrical engineers. Neither of them have been able to get an engineering job and that scares me. From what I remember, both were also very smart. Also had another friend who graduated earlier than these two, got an engineering job, but lost it and is now working at another non-engineering job.

Who can I turn to for help?,Throwawayoftheday09,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pnd833/difficult_life_decisions_i_feel_unqualified_to/,"I'm still young (23) but I feel like my life is completely in shambles. I have had a difficult time making my own decisions since forever, I guess something about the way my parents brought me up. I made a mistake when I went to uni right after high school. I'm not sure what made me do it, I guess pressure to go study from my parents and family. Quit, took a year off, compromised on another college program and I've now been dealing with that for the past three years. I lost a year of my life by not being able to handle the stress and the deadlines without physical classes. I feel incredibly guilty, irresponsible and frankly a little worthless because of it, even though it's in part due to my biology.

I've been living my life in two places at the same time, one of which is big town flatland city where I see absolutely no opportunity for myself, the other is small town countryside with a little more opportunities but frankly still not enough. I don't have a degree. Honestly I don't feel deserving of one, because even though I might have the skills at this point, I definitely do t have the dedication that's associated with one.

I just missed the deadline to get an internship. I tried, but too lite too late and ultimately failed. I'm not sad about it honestly, mostly just disappointed in myself. I get to do some stuff now that I really want, some form of freedom I really miss. But it's not enough.

I want my life to be drastically different. I want to make friends with similar interests as mine, but for that I kinda need to be in a medium sized town with activities and people, but surrounded by some countryside and nature. That's not a lot to ask for honestly, I can think of dozens of places I'd like to move to. I'd want to be doing something educational/conservational or freelancing, so I'd have a decent amount of free time and control over my schedule. If I got to live my life as a librarian or nature guide, with a bit of freelance tutoring or website building on the side, living in a house with a bit of land with a vegetable gardens and some fruit trees, with friends to go hiking or biking or climbing with over the weekend, I'd be in literal heaven.

But without a degree, where am I gonna go? I'll still need to get that degree in a certain amount of time (2026 to be precise) if I don't want to have wasted a few ten thousand euros. Without confidence, how am I ever going to make the friends I want? I've failed time and time again... Therapy has failed me. I have an impossible time sharing these things with people in real life, the words just don't want to come out of my mouth. I'm never in one place for long enough to dedicate myself to anything. Where the hell do I even go from here?"

Currently year 2 and started looking for summer/winter internships. 

Just wanted to ask those who went for internships before how did you manage to secure yours and your experiences of it.

I would love to hear how you manage to find your internship, the process, how many you tried applying for etc.

Doesn’t have to be just success stories, would like to know about the failures when trying to hunt for an internship too. It’ll be great to hear both sides of the story.

Thank you!"

I've stuck with them as a full time software dev, making  less than average for this area at 70K/yr. When I was applying and  agreed to the internship, I did not know that every day would start at  7:30 AM to have meetings with our offshore Indian team. I just took a  great week long vacation, and when I come back, I'm scheduled for a 6:30  AM meeting tomorrow. When my boss was discussing working full time  after the internship, I told him my only problem was the early mornings -  which now evidently get earlier than I thought possible. Is it worth  staying here? I don't like the product we work on and have no passion  for my work, the office life is dead and the hours are totally  inflexible. I have to be flexible for the hours.

I once had dreams of going to grad school for neuroscience, but have since decided against it. My first job out of college was a lab research assistant in a neuro drug discovery lab. Then I moved into my current position, an administrative role in a contract research organization that does clinical trials. The company is huge and I hate it. There’s no ability to discuss with anyone ways that the company would be improved, and no one really cares about us on the lowest totem. The turnover rate here is unbelievable. 

I want to get out but have no clue where to go. I have thought being a physical therapist could be cool, but to go to school I’d have to pay a butt load, spend a year volunteering beforehand, and overall just don’t know how I could possibly have the money (here in the US so you can do the math on how expensive everything is.) I also thought I’d like to be a vet as well, but same issue. Expensive school with lots of pre-work to do and a lot of people say the pay off isn’t worth the debt. 

I like learning new things and teaching others. I love the outdoors, and thought maybe a job that incorporates the outdoors and conservation could be cool, but I don’t really know where to start. I don’t want to have to move to the middle of no where to go to work and I don’t want to be paid trash money and I feel like so many jobs in conservation, without a PhD pay really low. 

I hace decent computer skills. I would say “poor” but then I got to this job in the PHARMA INDUSTRY where people don’t understand basic excel functions, so maybe I don’t have a good understating of what are “poor” or “decent” computer skills. I don’t want to be in a cubicle anymore. I don’t want to feel like “just a number” in my company anymore. But I also want a job that is somewhat mentally stimulating (for example I did a wildlife rehab internship for a summer and it was awesome but every day was exactly the same and grew to be very tedious because I never had to think about anything- it was all physical labor.)

Also I have pets and a partner so don’t want to travel a lot

Does anyone know of a job that might fit? Seems like it doesn’t exist— decent pay, upward mobility, indoor/outdoor combo maybe, physical and mental aspects of the job, doesn’t require travel except occasionally."

This is my first post on here and I would love to get some career advice. A little context, I am currently in my senior year at a top-ranked public university and I am in the process of recruiting for various finance and consulting roles. What is really freaking me out though is in the first semester of my freshman year I got an underage possession charge and my dumbass fucked up the process for dismissal so now the charge is a full misdemeanor. Since this occurred I have worked 3 internships and joined a ton of clubs but I have never had to go through a background check because all of the places I worked were startups. Now that I am looking for a corporate job and ultimately will have a background check done on me I'm freaking out that I could have my offer rescinded. I would hate to have a mistake made when I was 18 (I'm 21 now) ruin my chances of employment. So my questions to you are, 1) am i screwed 2) what should I do if I am approached by HR about this?

Now I have offers from 2 very different companies and have no idea which one to choose so I’m hoping someone over here will help me out. 

Company A is a local medium sized company that focuses more on big data and stuff like that. I have interviewed with the lead of the team I will be joining in and he described my role as being a data engineer that focuses on cloud solutions with big data. Their tech stack is also full of stuff I have never tried before and the team lead guy told me that its rare that people applying for junior positions have those skills which makes this position more valuable than generic web development stuff. Keep in mind the only reason he told me this was because I told him that I was tired of doing similar stuff on my internships.

Company B is also local and small sized company. They have some payment security products but I will be on mobile development team where they develop the mobile application of one of the biggest banks in my country. Its basically a full stack android developer role and honestly I’m not that excited to work on android. I have recently finished an internship where I developed an android application and I’m not saying I hated it but still felt like I was doing similar things only in a different framework and language.  However this company pays slightly better(about 100 dollars a month) and they seem like a tight group of people. 

I told the recruiter at the company B about the offer I got from company A and she was all like oh its so much easier to get data engineer jobs everyone can do data engineering but only people with CS degrees can do android development which is completely bullshit in my opinion. She was way too elitist and kept hinting on how they only hired engineers from best schools in our country and the university I attended was best of the best and thats why they wanted to hire me. Like chill out its only a junior android developer role its not like I will be curing cancer over there or something 

so yeah her attitude kinda bothered me but her words stuck with me. which one do you all think should I choose in terms of future opportunities the data engineering one(company A) or full stack android development one(company B)?"

Terms of Sale:

Refund Policy: No refunds will be issued under any circumstances once a code has been sent unless the code does not work as advertised. Buyer mistake(s) do not constitute grounds for a refund. If you already own a title, a refund will not be provided after the code has been sent.

Code Redemption: You may not use any code on any site other than those associated with your purchase. Doing so will result in me requesting that you pay the listed price for the second use of the code, and refusal to do so will result in a report to the mods of this subreddit. Any points or other bonuses associated with a code are not included with your purchase unless specified in the post.

""Should Port/Upgrade To 4K"" Codes: I make no guarantees regarding 4K ports/upgrades. If a code that should port/upgrade to 4K does not do so, I will direct you to the relevant support team. I can, in most cases, provide any photo(s) of the code insert and/or Blu-ray upon request if needed for a support team. I will only provide a refund if I cannot produce them upon request.

When paying through PayPal, do not use Goods &amp; Services (G&amp;S). Paying through PayPal with G&amp;S or funds not from your PayPal wallet/linked bank account (i.e. credit/debit/pre-paid card, etc.) will result in a fee of $0.30 + 2.9%. G&amp;S will charge a $0.49 + 2.89% fee. If a fee is incurred, a refund would result in PayPal keeping some or all of your fee, which I will not reimburse, so please be careful.

pnkwx7,0,2021-09-13,TIFU By not emailing my work I volunteered to do before my internship ended and work computer access was removed,Otherwise-Impact4382,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/pnkwx7/tifu_by_not_emailing_my_work_i_volunteered_to_do/,"I offered to get this work done for my internship mentor. It won’t be needed for at least 6 months. But, I offered to do it because I wanted to make his life easier because it’s kinda tedious. Well, I told him on my last day I’ll send the files next day because it was late and I needed sleep. That was the fuck up, because I didn’t take into consideration that my computer access would be removed at days end. So now I offered to do all that work and I can’t hand it off to my mentor. I’m taking the computer into work later and I will try to see if I can give the our manger the files to give to him. Basically, I am the incompetent asshole here who didn’t do the thing I said I would do. They are discussing later in the week about bringing me back on for future projects, but this seems makes me look bad. Anyway, that’s my story and I need to be more in top of things. 

TLDR; I didn’t send over the work I said I would hand over before end of last day,  and I look like an ass.

PS. Sorry John, you are an awesome mentor and I hope I can return to work on project with you."

 Hi guys, here are 24 New Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning jobs. 
 Let me know if you have any questions. Cheers!"
pnlbu3,1,2021-09-13,Stressed premed student deciding between bootcamp or going back to school?,iamthat1dude,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pnlbu3/stressed_premed_student_deciding_between_bootcamp/,"I’m a Biology grad from a top 50 school with CS coursework that is equivalent to a minor. Decided that medical school wasn’t for me (lifestyle and time in time in school), however, I don’t have any internships or industry experience at all in the tech industry. I've always been interested in CS since college but I had tunnel-vision in terms of doing my best as a premed so I decided to do a minor instead of double-majoring.

 I keep hearing on here that recruiters don’t care if you have an online degree but when I talk to tech friends and family in the Bay Area, many of them urge me to go for the in-person degree which is both, more expensive and usually longer.

After talking to my tech friends and looking at other posts on this sub, it seems like a bootcamp is also not really a good option for those that want to switch into tech since most don't guarantee a job and there are already a bunch of bootcamp grads.

I got accepted into r/OMSCS last fall but decided to defer my admission and try to figure out whether I really need to do a masters program for 1-2 years or if I could try to get a job through self-teaching or attending a bootcamp.

I feel like I have the foundation to self-teach full-stack development or iOS development but would doing a bootcamp help me more in terms of giving me guidance and giving me access to a cohort and network which could potentially get me a job in a quicker amount of time? If so, is the price tag worth it and which are the best bootcamps to apply for? 

**TLDR: Premed student with some CS coursework wondering if a bootcamp is the best bet for me in terms of getting a SWE job or if going for masters (online/in-person) is better. The last option is to simply self-teach myself the skills until the end of the year. Any advice would be appreciated! :)**"
pnm8ul,12,2021-09-13,CMMS software selection,cleatuswooten7,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/pnm8ul/cmms_software_selection/,"I am a biomedical engineering intern at a medical device sales and service company. We mostly do field service work ranging from installation of new equipment, repairing equipment on location, and when on location repairs aren't possible we leave a device on loan while we repair their device at our shop. I have been tasked with finding a good computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) software for our company. I have not personally worked with any CMMS in the past so I have little information on how to choose one that is a good fit for our company and am wondering what software some of you use and what your company does (so I can get a feel for why your company chose the particular CMMS). I would also like some suggestions on how to choose the right CMMS software. Thank you in advance"
pnmep3,7,2021-09-13,Please review my profile for MS in CS,CoatOptimal,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/pnmep3/please_review_my_profile_for_ms_in_cs/,"I am planning to apply for the Fall 22 intake in the US. My profile is as follows:

GRE: 329 (170 Q, 159 V, AWA: 4.5)

CPI: 8.04/10 from a tier-1.5 university (If only I could improve my CPI)

Extracurricular: was part of technical clubs as well as the college's tennis team.

Work Experience (2 internships, one at the company of the world's richest person, and the other at a startup. I am currently working full-time at that startup as a software engineer (4 months as a full-time).

Research Experience: wrote a review paper, but I don't think that would qualify as research experience. 

I am primarily interested in getting a job after MS. Since I'm not interested in research, I'm planning to apply for the non-thesis tracks only. I am also primarily interested in software engineering and would like to make a career out of it only, but would like to explore Big Data as well. Since I am planning to get a job, I would like to study in an area near IT hubs like California, New York or Boston.

Some universities that I am targeting are:

* GaTech (Ambitious)
* UT Austin (Ambitious)
* NYU Tandon(moderate?) as well as Courant(ambitious)
* ASU (moderate)
* Stony Brook (moderate)
* Northeastern University (moderate)
* San Jose State University (moderate/safe)

 Please suggest some other universities that I should be looking into according to my profile. Thanks in advance."

pno8fx,8,2021-09-13,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (9/13/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/pno8fx/weekly_job_qa_thread_9132021/,"Hi all,

Here is the eighty-ninth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

I also realized that imo the business industry seems very schemy, greedy, and a bit evil tbh lol.

I kind of don’t like the business world that much before this internship, let alone I personally don’t like the idea of an internship either (even with pay) because of how demeaning it sounds. You’re basically an “employee of an employee”.  Everyone was advocating it a lot, even my advisor, and I felt pressured to do it to get “experience”. I have worked summer and part-time jobs before, and I liked them, but it’s as if in the college/university world that ain’t enough. 

It was worse because marketing is only an alternative for me (I originally wanted to do the arts) and my family’s money-making expectations (in other words, I kinda hate the major already). So, I decided to do the internship not only for college credits but also to give it a shot and see if it’s that was really the case, and unfortunately it is.

Has anyone gone through this before? If so, what did you do about it?"

I'm a math(major)/cs(minor) undergrad from one of Germany's best tech schools. I hope I will finish my bachelor's within the next year.

In school I learned c++(between beginner and intermediate), java(between beginner and intermediate), R(beginner). I have seen some Haskell, prolog and SQL as well.

I once did a summer job in a small software shop with about 200 employees. They did ERP software. I worked in testing(automated gui tests(unit and integration testing) and had to change them if necessary). In that firm I got exposure to scrum.

In two recent classes we implemented math/cs stuff(sparse matrix algorithms, basic image processing and manipulation, a fully functional simulation of finite automata) and worked with git.

Since swe is one of the more probable career paths I will take I want to know, how I could improve my knowledge on the engineering side of things to have a better shot at internships and full time offers.

What stuff should I work on? I am okay with the git basics(committing, pushing, branching and basic merging), but what else should I learn?  Which concepts, tools and techniques should I acquire? What would give me an edge over other applicants?

Due to my math degree I am very interested in implementing deeper math stuff so I guess ai/ml might interest me. Which special classes should I attend? My math interest right now are mainly odes and probability theory.

I would really appreciate any feedback, thanks."
pnoxui,2,2021-09-13,Need you guys’ advice,hyoppi,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/pnoxui/need_you_guys_advice/,"I’m applying to MSBA programs this year and also I was recently offered a job opportunity (50% chance of getting it) from my previous internship. I feel like grad school can wait but this job could be better for my resume and for my financial situation as well. 

The only thing is that since there’s no guarantee that I’ll get this job, I’m applying to some schools by Round 1 as planned. I think the interview process will be done by around the same time or a bit earlier than Round 1 decision releases. 

I’ve asked several schools about deferring admit for such employment reason and almost 90% responded they will not allow deferral unless it’s emergency situation like medical or military…

I guess IF i get this job and get into a grad school as well, I have to withdraw/cancel my admission. But would this negatively affect my next year’s application? I know I would have to write a reapplicant essay for this but would it hurt my chance just because I denied admit in the past?

Want to hear some of you guys advice on this..!"

Should I be indicating this plan somehow on my resume? Most internships ask for only students that are planning on returning to school the following year, but just based on my resume it looks like I am done with school. I have been mentioning it in my cover letter for the few places I've applied for so far. Also I am not yet admitted to the grad school but my advisor said everyone makes it in, plus I've got a solid GPA and stuff.

A quick synopsis of my career so far. I graduated from a top state university with a degree in economics, worked in a financial research gig for about 2.5 years, then pivoted to Comp Sci. I’m nearly completed with my Master’s in CS from a well-regarded private university, and have two internship experiences. I just wrapped up a Software Engineering internship at a AAA game company, and am in process of completing my second internship at a FAANG company. I’ll be graduating in May.

I feel given my work experience and former career in Finance that I’m a great candidate for a hedge fund/ finance software gig. I also have a passion personally for finance and trading.

I’d love to hear from those that have worked doing software in this space. What are the top firms to work for? What are some of the advantages and disadvantages?

I’d also be interested to hear about what it’s like to be in a Quant role. Is it highly technical/ do you do much programming? If I was to Quant a few years, is it easy to transition back to Software Engineering if I decide I don’t enjoy it? 

I appreciate it in advance."

First I would like to thank everyone for the great advice and help from my previous post in this subreddit titled ""education wasted"". The link to it is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/epg4mk/education_wasted/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).

If you can't access the link just go to my previous posts in my profile.

I am so excited to say after that post and hearing y'all opinion and advice I was able to land 2 internships and a new grad offer as a software engineer waiting for me after I graduate this semester.

Here is what I've done since that post, sharpened my programming skills on my own, did online courses, started my own projects (mostly full stack projects), and finally focused a lot on my remaining classes in college (some projects I went beyond and added features from my own, and the professors loved it)

I want to thank everyone in this subreddit!

And if you ever feel down just go to my previous post and read it and you will be able to tell how desperate I was.

my first data structures class is next semester and i’ve heard that’s an important one, but what personal projects should i do in order to gain some experience and maybe even shoot for an internship next summer? (i know that’s your unlikely to aim for) i got rejected from all the cs clubs because they have a fucking 5% acceptance rate lmao so i can’t really gain experience there. 

any tips? is there a good guide for actual beginners? all the ones i’ve found are already assuming that i was super into cs during high school and are using terminology/slang i’ve never heard of."

Still no full time job yet although my parents  are seeing people I knew from my hometown, hearing about how they are getting full time jobs already. **IF TL;DR, skip to the last paragraph.**

When I graduated in May 2020, I landed this project based position doing manual labor in data centers under this helpdesk company that lied saying it is a part time IT helpdesk job. It was in the Bay Area. I moved from New Jersey to the Bay Area in California living with family out there. I really could not stand living at home with my narcissistic parents, as you can see by my username. I would not want to be living at home unemployed during a recession with my crappy parents. However, I do regret moving out of NJ, because the job market in California is so awful based on what I am reading on this subreddit and the unemployment subreddit. Everyone I know who stayed back East is doing better than me.

That same position gave me a contract role as a data center technician, which I was fired from after a week, because I was working a little too slow, so I pretended to go to work every day for 3 months so that my grandparents would not tell my parents.

Got an internship doing wireless testing work (not IT work) and quitted that position after a month (quit in June), because we had to do 12 hour overnight shifts and I could not handle that and they never convert anyone to full time in that place from what I've heard.

I am not crazy about IT, so I tried business development (both in person and remote) during the dark days of covid. Could not land anything even though I brushed my interview skills, because I don't have an outgoing personality. Tried applying to analyst roles since the beginning of 2021 and cannot land anything in person or remote, because it is a desirable oversaturated field. Now I am looking for roles dealing with law ( in person) since I have law firm experience and since law is not saturated, but sometimes I see 20 applicants for paralegal or legal assistant roles, so Bay Area jobs are still saturated.  Still haven't landed anything yet, but had a few interviews. Last week was a slow week with no interviews and only 2 rejections.

Just a rant, my family members back out East are going crazy to me. I am tired of my narcissistic mom telling me that I have to be more pushy and my narcissistic grandmother back out East (not the one I live with) tells me how I should move back and take care of my parents forever. My mom went on a rant yesterday saying I need to ""do something"" and of course people think I am lazy. She is saying how I should go work at a grocery store. My mom is always giving the same repetitive advice over and over like telling me to send generic thank you letters. She even told me I should go in person and ask for a job, like that's going to help. I am applying to any internship as well and searching temp agencies just to get experience and to impress my parents. My uncle out here thinks I can't get a job, because I ""can't keep a conversation going"". It seems like the longer I don't have any job, the more apocalyptic effects I am suffering through. The economy is not good and people are not understanding of this at all. I can't wait until we get our 2019 economy back eventually."

So from the time I could even draw, I knew I wanted to be in fashion and become a fashion designer.

Even almost went to SCAD in 2016, but by some fluke was unable to start and thankfully didn't put myself in 100k worth of student loan debt. 

I started school again in 2018 thanks to the encouragement of my partner and decided to get my Associates in Business with a focus in HR. I have my own business and wanted to properly learn how to manage it while also having a backup qualification for a decent job. I'm almost done with my studies, as I'm in my last semester right now and I'm realizing that I don't have a clear vision on what I want to do anymore. 

I spent 3 years at a start up and finally left in June. Got 2 new jobs/an internship in May, so far they both ended up being absolute shit shows.

The other job has abused and walked over me so much that I had a breakdown and put in my two weeks last week. It was literally destroying my health and I don't need anymore problems than I already have. At least I've learned to grow a backbone and know my boundaries. But I still feel like shit about the whole thing. 

And now that I will have more time and just be finishing up my coursework, I'm not sure what I want to do anymore. Besides not dealing with idiots that have too much money and power and don't understand that you can't unsend an email. Pretty much I'm having a hard time pinpointing what I want to do in fashion.

But now after all this time in school, working, etc. I don't know what exactly in fashion I want to do anymore. Maybe because I'm tired from going to school and the passion has just been beaten to a pulp because of failures and disappointments, idk. 

I'm not sure if there's a niche in the fashion industry I would be a good fit for. Or if there's a job that I haven't discovered yet. I'm taking a two week break after my last day at work and hopefully will be able to think better about this after. I'm still job searching, but idk if I should work on doing more research for my business in the meantime and trying other mediums for design. I ultimately don't think there is a path where I can do both industry job and my business, it never seems to work out. So it's one or the other and I don't have a clear idea on what to do for either. I just want to create things and not be bothered, which of course is a pipe dream.

I've lurked here for a while but now I'm a bit stuck.

I recently graduated from my community college with an AS in Computer IT, and I have the opportunity to go back for my Bachelor's in Computing Software, but I want to focus on getting into the career of IT. I didn't get a chance to do an internship, and towards the end of my final semester I didn't have a clear idea of what specific job to apply for. I've taken classes for game/website development, computer maintenance, database management, networking, and customer support/help desk. I had fun with my classes but after I finished them I still felt like I needed areas to improve on and now that I'm finished I'm not sure where to turn when it comes to practicing.

So my question (and probably a dumb question to most of you) to you all is where is the best place to start? Has anyone else been in the same boat as me and had no idea where to start after getting this far? And for those that have, what resources helped you the most when getting into this field when it came to honing your skills and training?"
pnuq2r,113,2021-09-13,I was paid a visit by an anonymous alcoholic,mrbeefthighs,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pnuq2r/i_was_paid_a_visit_by_an_anonymous_alcoholic/,"I had been drinking heavily for a long time. A few years probably. I know now I was, I am, an alcoholic, but back then I just considered myself to be *having a good time* or *blowing off some steam*. In my mind, my firing from 3 jobs in 10 months was just bad luck. “It just wasn’t the right fit” I would tell my friends. Looking back, I realize I was, I am, a massive fucking idiot. 

The start of my long and winding descent into extreme alcoholism was a typical Friday night. I had just gotten back from work and, having picked up a bottle of Kentucky bourbon on the drive home, was looking forward to drinking myself into oblivion. I climbed the stairs of my 5th floor walkup, huffing and puffing by the time I got to the top. I would always mutter under my lack of breath how “These staircases are killing me” like it wasn’t the half liter of liquor I was downing every night that was making my body break down. Wheezing, I entered into the apartment, locked the door behind me and immediately took a long pull from the liter of whiskey I had been lovingly cradling in my arms as if it was a newborn. The familiar burn instantly put me at ease and I began my weekly ritual of blocking all calls, searching for anything mildly interesting on TV and drinking hard liquor. 

Halfway through the handle I was starting to get the sweats and opened the living room window to let the cool air and the sounds of the street below waft up into my apartment. I wanted to sit out on the fire escape for a while to cool off but I remember being too drunk to even crawl my way out of the window. I resigned to laying on the floor beneath the window like a sick dog. I lay on the floor for who knows how long, sweating and listening to the sounds of the city outside my window. Cars honking, the bar crowds shouting and a feral cat yowling somewhere off in the distance. At some point, I fell asleep. 

I woke up the next morning on the couch, feeling like absolute refried dogshit. As much as I hated hangovers, at this point I shared a comfortable familiarity with them. At this time of my life a hangover meant a night well-lived, a success. I slowly rose to my feet, greeting the sun that flooded my apartment with a scowl and a hand over my eyes. I apologized to the crucifix mounted on the wall then started my morning routine. I trudged over to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, looked at myself in the mirror, frowned at the paper-white, sleep deprived shell of a man that looked back at me, popped a few Advil and then shuffled slowly back over to the living room where I plopped myself back onto the couch like the sorry sack of shit I was. Only instead of turning the TV back on or checking my phone for missed calls from the night before I was transfixed by what I saw on my coffee table. A brand new, unopened bottle of Kentucky bourbon.

My alcohol-soaked brain ran on its pathetic little hamster wheel trying to think where this precious gift had come from. Did I not drink my bourbon last night? *No, obviously you did, idiot, you’re hungover as hell right now*, I thought. Had I bought two bottles last night? I found the receipt in my pocket and confirmed I had indeed only bought the one bottle. Where the hell did this second bottle come from? I gave it about a second and a half more thought before I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth and cracked the bottle open. No better way to get rid of a hangover than a little hair of the dog. I took a shot, gagged, took another shot and corked the bottle. As much as I wanted to keep the party going, I had things to do. I put the bottle on the coffee table, closed the living room window and headed out into the city. I was on a mission to find a life-sized Shrek cutout for my niece’s birthday party the next weekend. That has literally nothing to do with this story, but I was bummed I didn’t find one. 

I came home that night late, around midnight, already a few beers deep from hitting a bar with friends where I lamented my unsuccessful Shrek hunt. Feeling good, I tossed some leftovers in the microwave, flipped on the TV and grabbed the mystery whiskey and took a long pull. After eating it wasn’t long until I was passed out on the couch, still cradling the mystery gift in both arms. 

The next morning was the same. I woke up, acknowledged the pounding in my head, cursed the morning Sun, apologized to the bleeding Jesus on my wall, pissed, scowled at my pale white reflection in the mirror, popped some pills, but the walk back to the couch added a new wrinkle. My ankle fucking hurt. It didn’t hurt to put weight on it, but I noticed there was some blood on my sock. I plopped myself back down on the couch, peeled off the bloody sock and noticed a single, round puncture wound in my left ankle. It was big, about the circumference of a #2 pencil and from the tenderness, it seemed pretty deep. The bleeding had stopped so it wasn’t too serious but just before I could theorize on the wound’s origins, I saw it. There, sitting on the coffee table, was a brand-new unopened bottle of Kentucky Bourbon.

I was terrified. I KNOW I didn’t buy that whiskey…or did I? What do I remember from last night? What do I remember from Friday night? Thursday? My brain had spent so many nights on autopilot guiding my glassy-eyed body around the city and I had never really thought about it until then, how much time was I missing from my life? I drink alone so often I had no idea what I did when I blacked out. I could have easily run down the street and picked up a bottle. It wouldn’t be the first time. I mean, there was one day when I woke up and there was a half-eaten wedding cake in my fridge, no idea where that came from. But there was something sinister about this whiskey, I couldn’t put my finger on it, but it didn’t sit right with me. That is, until I pulled the cork and smelled it. Once it hit my lips all the fear melted away. It wasn’t anything to be afraid of. It was nothing more than an unexpected visit from an old friend. Besides, 3 bottles of whiskey in one weekend was something I didn’t normally have the budget for and I wasn’t going to complain about free booze, so I kept drinking it. At least that night I made it to my bed.

The next morning, I called in sick for work as soon as I woke up, which was about 3 hours after the start of my shift. I was hungover as shit, but something was different. I felt weak. My ankle still hurt like hell and I must have scratched it or bumped it in the night, as the foot of my sheets were soaked in dark red blood, the outer rim of the stains already starting to turn brown with age. I limped into the bathroom and gasped at my reflection; I was even paler than the previous mornings, almost translucent. The skin under my eyes was dark and baggy. It felt like a monumental task to lift my arm to my mouth to swallow a handful of Advil. I didn’t bother to wash or bandage my bloody ankle and dragged myself back out into the living room to rest on the couch. I couldn’t even think about washing my ruined bedsheets right now because on the coffee table sat a brand-new, unopened bottle of whiskey. 

I stared at it. I thought. I pulled it closer. I started drinking it. Never look a gift horse in the mouth. 

That night, I was drunk, really drunk. More drunk that I had been in a while. I started early and had almost polished off the entire bottle but there was still a little left, about 3 fingers worth. It was already getting late and even in my drunken state I knew I wasn’t going to make it to work the next morning, then I had a horrifically stupid idea. I snapped a selfie, shot the picture over to my boss in a text message and said something along the line of “Look how bad I look, I’m so sick, I need the week off, I think I have leukemia or something” then I turned off my phone and I turned on the TV. 

Animal Planet. Man, what a channel. I hadn’t watched it since I was a kid, but that night I couldn’t get enough. Did you know the San Diego Zoo is the only place in the Americas you can see a real live Platypus? Something about that pissed me the hell off. In my drunken mind, every god-damned American household should have a platypus within walking distance of their home! Are we all of a sudden not a global superpower? Why is this not talked about in election years?! 

That night, drunk off my tits, I was going to write a letter. Fueled by self-righteous rage and Kentucky Brown, I pulled out my laptop and started crafting one of the most incoherent, high-energy epistolary works of the English language and I planned to aim it directly at the heart of the U.S National Parks Service. Looking back that probably wasn’t even the correct place to send it to and on top of that some interns would likely just mail me back some buffalo shit from an anonymous P.O box, but that night I was on fire. That is, until I saw the man standing on my fire escape. 

Being hammered, I saw him as standing on my fire escape, but he was actually *floating* just outside of it. I realized that last part when I watched him float up, feet passing over the railing and float back down just outside of my window. His skin was grey. Not a pasty, sickly grey you see in the hospitals, but the dark, ashy grey of someone long dead. His waxy lifeless skin stretched tight over sharp, high cheekbones and a smooth bald head and his eyes burned large and yellow, deep-set in a misshapen skull. The window between us opened noiselessly without either of us reaching out to touch it. 

“Uh…go..away?” I slurred, not realizing the danger I was in. 

When I spoke to it, it leapt through the open window and was feet from me in what seemed less than an instant. Too drunk to react I tried to stand, stumbled and fell back onto the couch. It moved closer. Its hands shot to my face and pried my eyes open with its too long, bony fingers, uncut and dirty finger nails gashed into my cheeks as it lowered its eyes to meet mine. The thing stared deep into my eyes and I tried to scream only to find I couldn’t. I couldn’t stand, lift my arms or turn my head. All I could do was stare back into the evil unnatural eyes of the intruder. Once it noticed my helplessness it released my head and sat down on the couch next to me. 

My head lolled back onto the couch, heavy, like a new born baby. I tried again to scream but I couldn’t even move my tongue. I was paralyzed. All I could move was my eyes so I sat and watched feeling tears cut rivers down my face. I remember thinking “This is what the gazelles on Animal Planet feel like”. The monster sitting next to me looked excited, giddy even. He bounced on the couch a few times, testing its comfort, rubbed his hands together then reached down to the floor grabbed my leg and pulled it up onto its lap. I watched in terror as it rolled back my pantleg, and pulled off my sock and began inspecting the wound on my ankle. Its long finger nails prodded around the scab for a few moments before it found purchase under the scab and peeled it off setting loose a fresh torrent of blood from the puncture mark, the monster next to me started shaking with glee, its breathing becoming shallow and rapid. From the corner of my eye, I watched as the creature’s tongue unfolded out of its mouth like those paper blowers, they give out at kid’s parties. The tongue extended about two feet from the creature’s face and ended in a sharp proboscis like a giant mosquito. The tip was about the circumference of a #2 pencil. 

I didn’t watch when it stuck its long tube-like appendage into my ankle, I also didn’t feel it when it did. I just closed my eyes and felt myself growing weaker and weaker by the second. I had my eyes closed for what was probably a few minutes but what felt like hours. My body was completely numb and incredibly weak and I was still paralyzed. I didn’t want to look, I wanted to keep my eyes closed and tell myself this was all a dream. I would wake up in the morning. Finish my letter and go on living my life. This was nothing but a bad dream to explain away my bloody sheets from that morning. Then I felt a cool hand on my shoulder shaking me away, so I opened my eyes. 

The thing was again standing in front of me, its cat eyes inches away from my own. Its cold hand gently resting on my shoulder. I got the feeling its hand was on my shoulder more for its own balance than anything else. It released its grip on my shoulder and took a few wobbly steps backwards, built momentum, began to fall backwards and reached its arms out to steady itself on my living room wall. Its left hand dragged across the wall looking for a place to grab on to and the first thing it found was my little crucifix. Steam jumped from the creature’s hand and it screamed “Fuck!” then crashed backwards onto its ass on the floor of my living room. It sat on the floor for a while, drunk as hell, laughing to itself as it tried for a full minute to get back onto its feet. Once, finally, it was bipedal again it stood tall and menacingly as it could as if I wouldn’t remember how stupid it just looked, then it pointed to the coffee table and said “For tomorrow”. I looked over to the coffee table and saw a brand-new unopened bottle of whiskey. When I looked back to the monster it was gone. 

The next morning, I realized the picture I sent to my boss included a bottle of whiskey in my hand. I was fired. So, I drank the whiskey the thing left me. Call me and idiot, sure but what was I going to do? Call the police on a fucking vampire. He came again and again. I never found the Shrek cutout, in fact, I missed my niece’s entire birthday party. I didn’t even call her. I lost my apartment next, because I couldn’t find a job. 

I live on the street now. I have a tent, a shopping cart and a few blankets. I also have a library card (That’s how I’m posting this now). You might think I have a problem, but I don’t need help. I’m pretty happy, I sleep under the stars most nights and there is a fresh bottle of whiskey in my shopping cart every morning. I can stop whenever I want, but I’m keeping this thing from hurting other people, right? Best not to get other people involved. I can stop whenever I want. My ankles are pretty torn up, so he stopped taking from there a while ago. My back is all scabs now and it can be hard to stop the bleeding, but I can stop whenever I want, but if you had my problems, you would probably drink too."

I did manage to get a ton of interviews last year but never got accepted into a position. I had to stop entirely so I do know my resume is decent enough for some internships to ask for an interview. How important are internships for an employer for someone doing IT? I'm trying to figure out if I should get an additional certification to ""make up"" for it. I do have some connections regarding jobs (two related to IT and one in marketing sales) but I'm not sure if nepotism can just land me a job now and days.

my_qualifications: BE mechanical

I recently completed my degree in May. 

My dream was to work in DRDO or ISRO facility, if not I aimed for PSUs. 

So I joined the GATE+ESE coaching class and it is being taken online, Then I got affected by Covid and had other health issues(diabetes). I kept on missing the classes, now the videos are built up like 400-500 hours, I have more hardly 3 months to prepare. Even though I got the books and study material, I feel if I start studying from books I have guilty and regret feeling that I will miss important points and method by faculties also feels like wasting money. If I start watching the videos now it will be completed in January so upcoming GATE exam I cannot write in a full-fledged way. 

My dilemma starts here, my parents are old, I cannot waste another year in the gate and leave a year-long gap. 
My friends are working in IT and getting a 30K salary. 
I cannot see a good mechanical job opening in the market, every job requires skills and experience, most of the candidates are referred by the consultancy. 

It is very frustrating for me, every plan I designed just failed due to a covid situation, I didn't learn any specific design skill or any programing, even though I know how to design and my project was based on design.  
I thought after giving gate, in that 3-month gap I will complete design courses. 

Now as for my situation I don't know what to do, I don't know if I should pursue Mtech in aerospace for 2 years, and in that meantime should I complete all the necessary skills and internships, I also don't know if Mtech aerospace has any scope in India.

Now regarding IT, I see no big core companies taking freshers in mechanical, only IT companies I see, it hurts to see that everything now is coding and it is termed as a new literacy, I feel like a loser...
Idk if I should do the transition from the Mechanical domain to IT?

I was a hardcore mechanical engineer enthusiast so I looked down on this vicious cycle of IT ,now I understand the growth of it.

Idk what to do guys, I am struck, please guide me, is it a good idea to start my preparation with books and write gate exam?or should I watch pending videos and give less importance to gate exam itself Or should I do MTech aerospace?Or should I go to a job in IT? 

Everything is confusing to me I cannot think properly after covid, everything is foggy to me. 


Summary: Advice required about gate exam preparation due to health issues and how it should be done.In dilemma about career transition from Mechanical into IT and missing relevant skills.If Mtech was a option ,does it have scope in India?

I'm not sure I'm ready for the role or the responsibility. I haven't had an internship, or worked on any noteworthy projects outside of class work.

On my resume I have skill sets listed like python/Java/C++ you know basic stuff. But I don't feel prepared at all to pump out any real world apps.

What would y'all do if you were me? I don't know what I can do to prepare other than review stuff I learned in school.

I'm afraid to email my recruiter too many questions, lest I expose my ignorance.

I don't want to make a bad impression, and I also don't want to get fired for being incompetent. 

I guess my one last point is that don't let your major stop you for applying for software positions. I'm a cognitive science major and still I got hired for a rather respectable position at a well known company."

To say I am looking for advice on returning to the workforce feels like a lie as I never truly got a real job after graduating with an Electrical Engineering degree. I got what can be considered family issues or discovering chronic diseases right as I graduated. I was bedridden for a year and bounced around multiple doctors until I got a good one. I feel like I wasted five years of my life and in a way, I did moping around unsure which career path to take and was trapped in analysis paralysis hell. I know my knowledge has deteriorated during this time and am looking for a path forward. I have signed up for the CS50 course to refresh, but I am uncertain what a good step forward would be and what would look best on a resume.

\-I could go back to college to get a computer science degree which should be cheaper and easier to obtain due to a credit transfer. Plus it would allow me to apply to internship jobs. However, not sure how good it is to be a recent grad on a resume.

\-Or I could go to a boot camp to learn industry tools their unique network. It takes shorter than a degree and isn't split up into semesters so I could try applying to one immediately.

\-Or perhaps I should seek out a career counselor for professional advice? And maybe a therapist..."

Way back in 2015, I had the luck to be signed up for a pretty good CS program in S.Korea. I had worked pretty hard to perfect my mathematical and scientific chops in a pretty competitive school system, and it paid off, but I had had no prior experience in CS at all. I think I still have those foundations, if much eroded.

Unfortunately, turns out that I love computers, but can't really code - severe ADD has come back with a vengenace as well as a slew of other issues. My program was interrupted by two years of mandatory military service, somewhat serious mental health issues, a year of taking a break, and extensively unhelpful  professors and a general dissolution of student society due to COVID, so I'm still here, in my fourth year, trying to graduate. Really trying. I've managed to barely pass all the relevant classes - did courses in algorithms, data structure, system programming, semiconductors, etc.

I think I'm going to make it, but I can't imagine an international career in development. Grades have already been torpedoed severely by my  health problems, the few internships that I had lined up were also  cancelled by COVID and some clerical errors that I made, etc. I really got zilch and my several probations and lack of experience make me afraid to sign up for any internships now.

Would it be a decent idea to swerve towards system administration, or other fields in tech? Would my degree be still relevant in the market if I started studying towards acquiring certificates now? How's the demand internationally, and what would I need to start doing now if it's a valid career path?

My primary  concern is getting the hell out of Korea. The work culture here makes me suicidal and the extremely oppressive and inwards-looking nature of Korean society has been sapping away at my mental health since middle school; being queer doesn't help. The pay is garbage compared to most of the west also, even though our real estate prices rise ever higher. I'd be lucky to get a $30,000 job as a developer.

I'm very fluent in English, but never lived/studied abroad so all I can show are (nevertheless excellent) generic test results. Don't have much money saved up."

Profile-
UG in Electrical from an IIT (India) (8/10 GPA) (will graduate in 2022)

Research - projects under 4 profs (one univ prof, one was research intern under a US insti prof. 2 of these are ML projects)

Intern- 1 ML (NLP) intern of 3 months
Toefl- expecting around 105

Projects- few CV projects. Good ranks in national level hackathons  and competitions.

Are these universities too ambitious, and can i add another ones if not these? My gpa isn't that high, will this high Gre quant score compensate for this?

Corona happened, aviation market was struggling to breathe then after the 2nd wave my father was admitted and we lost a significant amount of money hence I dropped the idea of becoming a pilot.

Long story short, I finished off with my 1st year exam's. I'm constantly overthinking and unable to identify where to take my life. Almost no one is there for me to understand my situation. Some people come and suggest me to prepare for UPSC while some of my friends say to try for different b school exams.

I have a behavioral interview coming up soon for a SWE internship, and I’ve never done one before, so I have a few questions about what it’s like! When the interviewer goes over your resume and asks about your projects, do they expect you to pull up your source code and walk them through? Should I be prepared to share my screen to demo anything? Or is it more like they expect you to be able to speak generally about your projects and answer soft-skill based questions (the teamwork / leadership stuff)? Also, do they ever ask you specific questions about the programming languages you list on your resume (like your preferred language and why, proficiency level of each one listed, etc.) No idea what to expect so I’d appreciate some insight.

Two weeks ago I got a task where I need to go to one of other sub-branches and execute my work there. I have a spokesperson in the said branch I need to keep in touch since I got his contact from one of my officemates. We were quite troubled at first since my task seemed like a bit too heavy for us, but he obligated since its what was written in the task paper. At the end of the day, I was the only one required to do the hard job, and he said he will be in his office. No problem, I said.

The task cannot be completed in just one day as it involves up to 1000 cars, so at the end of that day, I told him that I will come again and will do another appointment, after reconfirming the tasks with my supervisors. He looks perfectly fine with it.

The following day I emailed him just to let him know that my supervisor has not given me a final answer and we will need to wait a bit and I requested an Excel List from him which will make my task easier.

It was quite weird when he did not reply to my email for 2 weeks now so I reached him again using Skype. I could see he is online but still no answer from him. I reached out to one of my officemate, a substitute supervisor (since my direct supervisor is on holiday) and with his help, he arranged an appointment for all of us to discuss what is going on.

I also showed my supervisor that I tried to contact him to no avail. He was quite surprised the spokesperson did not even give me the requested Excel List because without it, I cant actually carry out the tasks since there are just too many cars to examine.

But, the spokesperson declined the appointment outright and said nothing. I asked the supervisor why, and he just said ""Der hat keine Lust"" which to me means as if he doesnt want to be bothered. My supervisor said he will call the guy and see where it goes after.

Have I done something wrong? Why didnt the spokesperson contacted me if I did? Is it true that he is just no longer interested with the task? What does this behaviour truly exhibits? I am quite worried now since, thinking if I messed up something, though I am 90% sure I did all the protocol correctly.

Thanks in advance."

***

**A**t first, Lucas the Scribe felt only the injustice of it all. 

“You can’t do this to me! You cannot silence me! The people will hear about this!” 

Indignation fueled his anger, and made him say things he probably shouldn’t have. Nothing was ever gained in prison by losing your cool. 

“Everyone will find out what you’re doing here! I will make sure of it!” 

Which, he knew, wasn’t exactly true. Other scribes had come to Thrass before him, and Lucas hadn’t heard a peep from them about the immoral, disgusting, violence-profane madness of this place. He should’ve known how horrible this would be by the way the Head Scribe smiled when he first gave Lucas this assignment. 

Now, he was here. His forehead pressed against the bars of a cell, screaming down the prison block: “I am a senior scribe for Carper’s Weekly! You will have to answer when they come looking for me!” 

Again, not exactly true. He was a *junior* scribe for Carper’s Weekly, and even that was contingent upon the material he wrote from this assignment. So, really more of an unpaid intern.

The people he worked for knew people, but Lucas doubted if his Head Scribe even remembered his name. And Lucas didn’t know anyone. 

His mother had taught him to write, and she would slap his hand for every word he misspelled. Not an uncommon punishment for bright, young central cyrans, who were otherwise unconnected and had no great prospects. His curiosity was encouraged, up to a point, but his Father always reminded him: we’re no great house. We’re the bottom of the top, and count yourself lucky that we are.

The Lukaiaen bloodline was nothing to write home about, unless you were very interested in his great-great-great-great grandmother, who may or may not have been a minor governor during the provincial wars. 

Nobody would come for him, which was such a distressing feeling that, once his outrage subsided, Lucas found himself hyperventilating in the corner of his cell. 

*How long could they keep me in here?*

*A day? A week?*

On the one hand, it was soul-crushing. But his mother taught him to always think of the silver scale. 

At least I’m alive. And at least they didn’t put me with the political prisoner, and the other traitors.

When he first came to Thrass via the gate, one of the junior officers gave him a tour of Sseran Thay City and the warcamp. Lucas had seen what they did to the political prisoners.

Compared to those cramped, dark, and perpetually-wet lockups, Lucas’s cell was a grand hotel room. Two square meals a day. A window. A linen sheet to lay down on (and a bucket to go in). And all the free time a writer could ask for. No paper, but a good journalist didn’t need to take notes. 

So, as the hours turned to days, and as Lucas grew tired of hyperventilating, he took a nap. And woke up. And told himself, “I will not waste this time. Any scribe worth their salt would kill for a chance like this.”

Lucas Pulchus Lukaius promised himself that he was going to craft the greatest hit piece on the cyran warfront of his generation. His prose would make the foundations of cyran society tremble and quake. His words would cause the greatest political shift of the last century.

And he would compose the whole thing in his mind. 

In his mind, he was a grand storyteller, rolling out the sentences as though they were great mountains and deep valleys. He composed and recomposed his ledes, his theses, his hooks and loops. And his moral arguments, most of all. Each day, as the sun fell and the rains began, and the rains went away, and the sun rose again, the details became more exaggerated, until he blossomed into a kind of prophet-figure in his imaginary fight against the Cyran aristocracy, and their awful war machine. 

In some compositions, the soldiers were his direst enemies. In others, they were weak, helpless souls who needed just as much salvation as the next cyran. Salvation, that his words and his words alone would bring. 

And when it was done? 

And when there was nothing else to say?

The sun still rose. And the rains still fell. And Lucas the scribe was still incarcerated. 

So, he sat down and slept. And woke. And ate. And slept. And wrote more stories in his mind, just to pass the time. 

Ate. Slept. Woke. 

Ate. 

Slept.

*Ting.*

Sometimes he dreamed he was back on Cyre. He could hear the laughter of conversation, sitting at his mother’s dinner table. Eating with their neighbors. Sometimes Saraius, the neighbor’s daughter, was there, that girl whose eyes shone brighter than any glittering scale. And he could hear the olive trees rustling, and the lemons dropping from the boughs. And the *ting, ting* of metal cutlery, clinking together as people laughed-

*Ting! Ting!*

The sound stirred the scribe from his slumber. Metal against metal. It was an annoying sound, that’s what it was. He woke up only to find the source of the sound, and stop it from bothering him.

But as he sat up, and looked around his cell, he could hear no sound. Nothing but his own breath, and the gentle fall of the rain. 

He looked up at the window, to see what time it was. Dark. Middle of the night, maybe.

The bars are gone. The bars that filled his window like long, metal teeth were gone. Each one of them, pinched off at the top and at the bottom, as if they were made of the softest clay. 

Then, a face appeared in the window. Two big, black eyes. A huge beak, as dark as dyed leather. 

*What mad dream is this?*

The scribe couldn’t help himself. He had to talk to the face, whatever it was. 

“What the hells are you?”

“You’re not so pretty yourself.” The face said. It’s beak clacked gently, and its voice came out, forming the words more easily than that cumbersome proboscis would suggest.

The scribe scrambled across the room, his back ramming into the bars of his cell. “Get away from me! Get out of here! I’ll call the guards!” 

“Now, why would you go and do a foolish thing like that?” 

And then, horribly, that *thing* started to climb into his cell. Its body was covered in feathers, some of them gray at the tips. Its face contorted with pain as it pulled its torso deeper into the cell. 

And then, it reached out a hand at Lucas. Trying to grab him. *It’s coming for me. Oh, gods-*

He looked wildly around the cell, looking for anything he could throw at the hand. The sheet? No. The bucket? Gross. *Nothing-*

“Come on,” the thing crawling through his window said. “Take my hand.”

Almost like it was trying to help him. Its eyes bored in to him, both pained and determined, as it stretched. 

“What are you?” Lucas asked. 

“Corvani,” the thing answered. “Or have you never seen an avian before?”

Of course, he’d seen an avian before. They were brilliantly colored, with huge, dazzling beaks and majestic wings covered in... feathers…

“You’re… Not… Then…” Lucas struggled to understand. It’s not a monster. It’s not a nightmare. Then what? 

*“Who are you?”*

The corvani, whose body was half stuck in that tiny, square window, his arms held out like a fool, rolled his eyes. 

“Come on, cyran,” He said, exasperated. “You owe someone a favor. Stop asking questions and take my hand, gods damn you, or I’ll leave you in here.” 

Lucas stepped up to the window. His fingers brushed against the corvani’s hand - and he almost pulled away at the cold shock. He hadn’t noticed, the avian’s appendage was made of metal. The metal fingers wrapped around his wrist - so smooth, and gentle - and then, the avian shouted, “Got him! Pull!” 

Suddenly, Lucas was being hauled up. Up into the window. He started to scream as the twisted remains of the metal bars dug into him, but the avian’s free hand wrapped around his mouth, and silenced him.

*Gods! He’s going to kill me!* Lucas started to struggle. To twist and turn and writhe in the avian’s grip. *They sent an assassin! To kill me for everything I wrote about the cyrans-*

It did not dawn on Lucas that, as of yet, all his grand writings were still only in his mind, and no one could have possibly read them. 

And then, Lucas was falling.

He fell to the mud with a heavy *whumpf*. The wind was knocked out of his lungs, and he struggled to breathe. Mud splattered his face and he had to lift his head to not drown in it. 

There were talons next to his head. Big, and black. Throat-cutting talons…

And a pair of soldier’s boots. 

Lukas looked up to see the most beautiful face he had ever seen. 

“It’s-” he gasped, “It’s you.”

Agraneia bent down, and pulled him out of the muck. Her grip was just as strong as when he’d first seen her, and she lifted him as easily as if he were a child.

“Yes,” she said. And nothing more.

*It was definitely her.* Down to the last, understated word. At least she wasn’t grunting her responses anymore.

“And who is this?” Lucas nodded at Eolh. The avian’s feathers looked ruffled, and not just from the fall. His black eyes were wary, and locked onto the Scribe. 

Agraneia looked at Eolh. Narrowed her eyes while she conjured up an adequate explanation. She settled on a simple shrug as her answer.

“Will someone tell me what’s going on?”

“Is he going to be a problem?” Eolh asked, nodding to the scribe. Talking about him as if he wasn’t standing righ there.

“Scribe,” Agraneia said, “This is Eolh. He’s… he’s with us. We’re getting out of here.”

Eolh turned back to Agraneia. “Not until I’ve found Kirine.” 

“My name is not *scribe.* It’s Lucas.” But neither of them seemed to hear him. They were already discussing their next steps.

The avian named Eolh seemed to want to find someone else in the camp. Agraneia disagreed. She thought it would be better for them to escape first, and come back later after “it” happened, whatever “it” was.

“He could be dead by then,” Eolh said.

“He could be dead right now.” 

“Who are we talking about?” Lucas asked.

“I’m not leaving until I find him. You don’t have to stay.”

“Corvani, we have tried our luck too many times tonight. Lady Fortunae’s smiles are swift to change-”

“Thought you didn’t believe in the gods. Besides, if I don’t find him, then I have no idea how I’m going to find Poire. You can take your scribe and go, but I can’t leave without looking for him.”

“Who?” Lucas asked again, but they were … doing something.

Agraneia and Eolh were staring at each other. Locked in some kind of unseen communication that the scribe couldn’t interpret.

Agraneia moved first. She nodded over the avian’s shoulder. “Prefect’s tent. Over there. Let’s go.” 

##\***

**L**ucas was still in a daze. Every step was better than the last, and made the world feel more real. To feel the breeze on his scales. To feel the open sky, above his head. 

To be free. 

To be walking, directly back into the mouth of the beast.

Of course.

It made him jumpy, knowing where they were headed. Agraneia seemed to understand. When they were crouched in an alley, waiting for another patrol to pass by, Agraneia whispered into his ear. “Stick with me. Stay quiet.” 

It was the most comforting thing he’d ever heard from her. Or from any soldier, come to think of it.

Eolh was at the mouth of the alley. He had a strange set of goggles pressed to his eyes. They seemed to mold around the shape of his beak, fitting his face perfectly. A faint green glow lined the rim of the goggles.

“There’s no one in there,” Eolh said.

“What do you mean?” She was at his side, peering into the darkness of the war camp. The rain drizzled softly on their heads, and pattered on all those canvas overhangs. In the war camp, not a single body moved.

“Who are you looking for?” Lucas asked.

“The Tribune,” Eolh said, offhandedly. “But the Prefect’s tent is empty. The whole camp is empty.”

“They left,” Agraniea growled. “They’re all at the Gate.”

Eolh was shaking his head, cursing under his breath. 

“Eolh,” Agraneia said. She was clenching her fists, “I’m sorry.”

“Tribune Kirine?” Lucas said. “Is that who you’re looking for?”

Eolh whirled around, his huge, almost animal eyes searching his face. “You know where he is?” 

Lucas nodded, slowly. “I think so. The guards were talking about it. A building they call the Boxes. Right behind the Consul Vorpei’s manor.”

“Which is where, exactly?”

No sooner had Eolh asked the question, when a brilliant glow illuminated the sky, somewhere over the center of the City. 

A string of light, appeared above the gate. Thin and gossamer and whiter than white. It stretched all the way up, beyond the rooftops. Beyond the clouds. Up, into the stars themselves, until the light could not be seen.

“There,” Lucas said, his mouth hanging slightly open. “They said he was near the gate. Is that what that light is? I thought we didn’t open gates at night.”

A boom rolled out from the center of the City. The buildings and the ground trembled with the low rumble of an explosion. As it subsided, they could hear the screams. The crackle of gunfire. And the crashing of the cannons.

Agraneia said, “It’s begun.”

I started the grad school application process a while ago. Although I have a list of \~15 places, I have a nagging suspicion that I'm being overambitious.

My profile:

Qualification: Bachelors + Masters from a well-known research institution in India (not an IIT but a top school for natural sciences)

Grades: 9.41 on a 10-point scale (major GPA: 9.8) which is equivalent to 3.76 (major GPA: 3.92) on the 4-point American scale 

Research experience: multiple research internships in physics + master thesis in or closely related to the field I'll be applying for, namely quantum computing and topological quantum matter.

Publications: none as of yet, but I expect to have an arXiV preprint by the end of this year, and perhaps a publication before I graduate from my current program

GRE: I haven't taken it yet, mostly because many schools do not seem to be considering it/it's optional. Should I?

Some of the schools I want to apply to are Caltech, UIUC, UMD and Yale.

I recently had a conversation with my research supervisor who asked me to apply to these schools, but also to keep some safe choices in consideration as the aforementioned ones are really hard to get into. Which safe schools would you suggest are a good option for someone with my background?

Also, would you say I have a good shot at making it into a big school provided I get good letters of recommendation?"

I just started taking the beginner CS classes and I don't really have any background programming besides the current classes I'm in now. I feel like I'm kind of behind in terms of students who start taking these classes at the beginner of their college career. I was wondering when it would be best to try and apply for any internships?

Also, is there any thing you guys would recommend me to do so I ""catch up"" in a sense? I just feel like I'm behind where compared to where other Junior CS students are."

po6hun,6,2021-09-14,Spring or NodeJs for a new grad?,OnlineKaki,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/po6hun/spring_or_nodejs_for_a_new_grad/,"Bit of a background: I'm in my final year, I've got 2 offers during my campus placements. One is an Intern position at Morgan Stanley. From what I've heard from seniors, a return offer is most probable unless I fuck up. The other offer is a smaller one in the range 6-8 LPA. So, as per our college rules I can't sit for full time companies unless they pay extremely well, i.e in the range 20-25. 

Till now I've only done DSA, coursework and Machine learning stuff ( which I'm not interested in now) . I would like to start with backend development. I'm struggling to choose between NodsJs and Spring. I have little experience with Javascript and I've done Java during coursework. I can brush up java in very little time. 

What should I choose?  NodeJs or Spring? 

From what I can see NodeJs is very hot right now. But, most large companies use Java which cannot switch their codebases to other languages. So Java is here to stay. 

From your experiences can you suggest me what to choose?"
po6ors,143,2021-09-14,Research Experience?!,damageinc355,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/po6ors/research_experience/,"Not so sure if this is a question, an opinion or simply just a rant.

TLDR: it's fucking difficult to get a paper published as an undergrad, and for some people it's also so difficult to get any kind of research experience at all.

But what's all this about having research experience/publications to apply to a grad school program? It makes me plain anxious to see all these undergraduate profiles in this sub with &gt;4 published research papers published.

Think about it: a research paper most likely requires a year of work to get it published, considering you need to work on a first draft and then work on the revisions required by the journal. An undergraduate degree typically has 4 years duration. So, in order to have a paper published as an undergrad you (luckily) have to start working in 7th semester, and have the paper published just before you graduate. If the process is longer, you have to start working much more previously, or wait a long time to apply to grad school.

Many schools only start teaching the actual real stuff beginning 5th semester (meaning the stuff that you probably need to know to produce a decent research paper). So maybe you could get some kind of research internship, or become a research assistant, but then again you don't know if you actually get to publish the paper with your professor. In my school, becoming a research assistant is pretty uncommon, because there are little professors with the funding to get an assistant.

If you try to do it on your own, unless you're some kind of genius (who probably would get in into any grad program they want, research experience of not) you're going to need some kind of assistance from a seasoned researcher. Professors are usually very high, mighty and too busy to concern themselves with an undergrad asking too much questions for their own good. If you try to publish your undergraduate thesis or capstone project, you will (perhaps) get the assistance you need, but it most likely will get published well after your school application deadlines. You'd then have to wait some time to be able to apply to grad school with research experience, which will probably affect your profile in terms of the strength of your LORS.

And, unless you're into a very good program, a mostly qualitative (history, philosophy) or in computer science major, you're probably going to have to spend some time learning about the technology needed to produce the data analysis. This only adds to the time you need to produce the paper. And all this is just thinking in fields where you don't need a goddamn laboratory in order to do some kind of research. With that, it's even worse.

All in all, what I want to say it's that it is so terribly difficult to have research papers published as an undergrad, and even more when you study in a school located in a poor or developing country. However, it seems even more necessary to publish papers if your degree comes from those countries, because if you have a North American or European degree you're already at a gigantic advantage.  But people here seem to be getting over 4 research papers published. Combined with exams, coursework, professional internships, social extracurriculars, GRE, TOEFL, SOP, LORS, etc... it just seems plain unlikely that anyone just fresh out of their undergrad could get one paper published, let alone 4.

I'm just worried that with so many people having it, having no research experience/publications is becoming a ""kiss of death"" in your grad school applications. Then again, all this might just be confirmation bias. Only the top 1% who get to have papers published talk about it here, and there is some kind of ""silent majority"" with no research experience who are applying to grad school and getting accepted.

I am technically a Sophomore this year although I have already taken two years of classes [so this is my third year]. Recently I've been having a lot of issues with stuff outside of school that has been affecting my ability to concentrate on studying, including:



•someone quit at my work so now I am taking on more hours because I need the money



•need my wisdom teeth removed next month which is going to cost a lot and I have to miss class




•switching mental health medications have caused me to be more depressed/not be able to concentrate on my homework




•my partner drinks a lot which causes them to be aggressive and/or loud, at times ""banning"" me from doing homework because I don't spend enough time with him



•my partner also goes to school and I have to sit down with him to make sure that he does all his homework, I basically need to ""supervise"" him



•can't afford weekly therapy visits, only monthly, which is also affecting my mental health negatively 




•I'm the Vice President of my school's computer science club and I have to make sure to organize/attend meetings 




•I'm going to be participating in a hackathon next month so I'm preparing for that




•Have to spend time applying for internships. 




All of this, I believe, has been affecting my grades negatively. I am one of those persons that starts doing their homework the moment it is assigned but right now I have homework due today and I haven't even started doing it.



Today I woke up at 4am so I could leave my house at 5am, so I could commute for almost 5 hours to school. The buses were running late which meant I would have to skip breakfast and I wouldn't have time to eat anything until I got out of class at 8:30pm. I really felt so exhausted mentally that I decided to skip class [Calculus 3 Honors, we have an exam next week] and instead just go enjoy breakfast. Now I am feeling horrible about having skipped class. Everyone always talks about how in Engineering if you miss one day then you're fucked because you'll be completely lost...



Is it possible to fail because of missing one day of school? Have you ever one day just not showed up to class?"

Hi, I'm a fresh high school graduate living in Toronto and am looking to land an internship in the CS/Software engineering industry.

I'm taking a gap year before starting Uni next fall and currently spent my summer completing Harvards this is CS50 course, my end goal is to land an internship before starting Uni and to use this gap year as effectively as possible. I'm looking for advice on what i should do next and how I can attract and land an internship without having a year of uni under my belt (as this is a requirement by a lot of places).

Currently, I know basic HTML, CSS, and JS along with some python and flask to create a site where we trade stocks (this was a problem set in the CS50 course)

A lot of people recommend creating a personal project but I don't know what to create or where to start or what should my portfolio look like?

It's all really confusing and I really want to land an internship but don't really have the connection or knowledge on how to get there. If anyone could give some advice or resources that be greatly appreciated.


Also where and how can I find intern applications besides LinkedIn and indeed? where can I find startups near me that may be looking for an intern?

Any recommendations for dealing with this issue?"

poc265,3,2021-09-14,Advice needed: job options,Block_Pleasant,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/poc265/advice_needed_job_options/,"Hi! This post is going to be long and have a handful of moving parts (career, personality, mental health), but I’m really just looking for different perspectives to learn from. If you’re able to relate to even just a portion of this and are able to speak into it, I’d really appreciate it! Skip to the last three paragraphs if you don’t want to read all of it
 
I (24F) started a land development EIT job at a consulting firm last year. I’ve also done a one year internship during my undergrad in a construction project management company (mostly did roads, bridges, traffic). I didn’t have a great experience in the construction industry and I felt like I didn’t fit in well. I was timid, I felt out of place supervising subcontractors on site, I didn’t enjoy having to coordinate things with coworkers and subcontractors, just to have them fall through (which meant I ended up being the bad news bearer), and I didn’t enjoy the expectation of being on call at any time. I needed to work up the courage to talk to anyone at anytime, which was mentally exhausting. But I did learn to be more assertive, and all my coworkers told me I was really organized.
 
I ended up going into land development (instead of the other civil streams like structural, geotechnical, or hydrotechnical) because I enjoyed my land development courses in undergrad. I was thankful to have landed a design job but I didn’t realize the demands of consulting. I’ve been WFH this whole time, so I’m sure that has an impact.
 
In terms of the job content, there are occasionally days where I enjoy the work, and many days where it takes a lot of mental energy to get going, or to stay focused on the design tasks. In terms of the people, everyone’s pretty nice. It’s just the politics that get to me and the way billable hours play into my work days and relationships. While I understand why we have billable hours, practically, it translates into junior staff working overtime and not logging those hours in to remain under budget for a project.
 
I’ve been at a cross road, wondering if I want to invest more time into this job and my career (eg. learn more about planning policies, do a masters in Cities Management, etc), or if I want to leave that time for personal life. I’ve pretty much landed on the latter. I’d say I’m a person with less capacity for career and relationships in general. I enjoy my down time and hobbies, but I often feel like I don’t get much of that. A big reason being - a lot of my mental energy is already taken up by my personal life.
 
Which brings me to my next point. I’ve been going to therapy for half a year now. I’m not sure how much COVID has exasperated my situation, but I’ve had dark seasons &amp; depressive symptoms that have lasted 10 years. Without going into too much detail, it affects my work because I often have difficulty concentrating, or I’m already exhausted having to manage my own emotions, making work even more overwhelming and exhausting. I end up taking quite a while to finish my tasks. Adding timesheets/billable hours into the equation, I dread work a lot of the time. I feel stuck in a bad cycle.
 
Having started from home, I don’t know how other junior staff work &amp; how I compare, but I’ve been praised by a couple managers and had a positive performance review. It feels incongruent with how I feel about myself and this job, because with the last paragraph, I often wonder if I feel like I’m unable to work, or if I’m just lazy.
 
We also have quite the turnover rate. I’ve seen people leave the job, and while I didn’t know them well personally, there were people who I’d see online, working late at night. I could be wrong, but it feels like they’re also just burnt out. I’ve also seen more senior staff manage their demands well, and not need to be up late at night as often. I’ve also been told that working late is just the case for junior staff, no matter the industry you’re in. “It’s just the way it is.” So… I’ve come to the conclusion that some people are just more fit for consulting than others, whether they’re senior or junior staff.
 
Since I started my undergrad, I had a nagging anxious feeling that I wouldn’t be able to handle the responsibility of having a P.Eng. I told myself that I just needed experience to build my confidence in this area. 6 years later, I still feel the same way. I feel more anxious than I do excited, thinking about it. I don’t see myself moving up where I am now.
 
But of course, if I deem myself “not fit for consulting,” it might become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so I’ve been trying my best to be resilient, and learn and grow into this role. The only problem is that I’m feeling pretty miserable. So I’m looking at my options. I’m considering asking for work accommodations if my family physician thinks I should. But I don’t know if I can see myself here long term. I know no job is perfect, but I’m trying to figure out which negatives I’m okay with in a job.
 
I didn’t like construction project management, I’m miserable in consulting having to navigate work politics re: billable hours/timesheets, and I’m not sure what government land development roles there are (if someone could shed light on that)? I also don’t have a lot of experience dealing with policies/permits to know how I’d do in a job that requires a lot of knowledge of that.
 
In general, I’ve been affirmed for being nurturing, for being good at administrative tasks, and as mentioned above, for being organized. I don’t feel like I’m crazy detail oriented, especially compared to others in my industry. My friends say I am though, so, I’d say I’m detail oriented re: things in my daily life &amp; in admin stuff, but not necessarily in things related to engineering.
 
So I’m looking for help to see what options there might be for me, whether it’s staying 100% in engineering, doing a variation of it (eg. administrative assistant in an engineering company), exploring something else (eg. physics tutoring), or something else that I haven’t thought of. Hearing about anyone else’s experiences or thoughts would be so appreciated."

poexeg,10,2021-09-14,"Is ML/AI necessary to get into a good grad school CS programme, as an international student?",Shoorpy,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/poexeg/is_mlai_necessary_to_get_into_a_good_grad_school/,"Hey all. I'm a 3rd year CS undergrad from a 'developing' country, and i'm looking to pursue master's in CS from an English speaking country directly after my undergrad.

The extracurricular CS projects I've done are all web dev related things, and while I did do a research internship around computer vision, I don't feel very interested or proficient at machine learning. 

However, I understand that research experience is considered for master's applications, and I think I should try to work with a prof and get my name on a publication for this. But almost all the CS research in my college is ml and it does seem like ml is the only way forward in this direction.

Also I should mention that I don't have any ML courses in my college till my 4th year or so, at which point it's kind of late to do stuff for post grad apps anyway I think.

My question is how much research experience counts for master's for say, a top 20 school in the US (with scholarships if possible at that)

My profile is basically:
- little better than average cgpa
- 1 CV research intern without a publication
- won a couple hackathons, including a corporate national-level one
- sde intern at the same company mentioned above


Tldr; I want good post grad school as developing country undergrad who has put all his points in web dev. Does not having a publication or extensive research experience hurt too much?"

Recently I tried logging in, and the account was gone. I realized my writing was gone too. I copied and pasted two articles, and I realized the third was under “members only.” I signed up for a free membership, but it turns out I gotta pay 7 dollars to see everything….

I emailed my internship supervisor to gain access. It’s been a few days and no response. I might actually have to pay to see my own fucking article. So angry rn.

Edit: attempted to buy a membership and it wouldn’t even take my card because it’s in “test mode.” Going to text internship supervisor in the morning and see what happens."
pog9ek,0,2021-09-14,Are coding bootcamps worth it if you already have a CS degree?,pdxdevgirl,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pog9ek/are_coding_bootcamps_worth_it_if_you_already_have/,"I see a lot of posts and discussions talking about the relative merit of doing a coding bootcamp versus doing a degree in computer science, but I'm in a pretty different situation. I have a master's in computer science already (undergrad in physics), but due to life circumstances I've  been out of the workforce for a couple years post-graduation. Now I feel I'm at a substantial disadvantage competing for junior dev roles with recent graduates and those who have had internship opportunities. I'm thinking about doing a coding bootcamp so that I have something more recent to put on my resume and to learn specific tech stacks that popular in web dev (MERN full stack or django backend). I've already been learning these technologies separately on my own using udemy courses and personal projects, but a coding bootcamp would provide more structure and possibly something more tangible for hiring committees to notice.  A bootcamp would also give me access to career resources that may be helpful, such as resume and interview prep.   


But I'm also wary of spending more money, and I've seen a few comments here on reddit suggesting that the market is over saturated with bootcamp grads. I just don't know what to do. Should I focus on just applying for jobs and practicing interview questions? Or am I unhireable with a MS degree from 2018 and need something more recent to be considered? In which case, is a coding bootcamp the way to go? Help please"

However I basically have 2 weeks from getting it to accept the offer which I feel is ridiculous since now there’s like little to no chance to even see what other internships I can get unless the companies hire and give out offers extremely early like Amazon does.

Doesn’t seem like I can extend it without an actual reason but basically if I don’t accept I have to gamble that I’ll be able to get a better one or one at the same level which may be their intention to make it very hard for you to say no. Anyone else been in a similar experience?"

Rant warning. 

When I go on reddit all I ever see is success stories.

People learning to code in 6 months and landing a jr job.

To all the young devs out there, don’t fall for this. Don’t be naive. 

I literally have everything going for me, I could not be in a better spot to land a jr job, but for some reason have not yet. 

Backstory. I live in the states, I dropped out of high school when I was 16 to start college(we have a fast forward program here.) I just finished my second full year of college(4.0). Still nothing. Im 18 now, grind 7 hours a day minimum, still no luck. 

I am proficient in most anything js and am pretty good on the data side. I have experience with several different databases, and am currently teaching myself some DevOps. I learn wicked fast and am very confident that I could hold my own as a jr dev or at the very least an intern. I LEGIT HAVE OFFERED TO WORK A MONTH FOR FREE TO A COMPANY.  I network like a madman, still no success. 

This Is crazy. 

Feel free to prove me wrong, send me an offer lol."

I started as an intern doing simple rebuilds, to call center, then desktop support and now I'm doing ticket triage and workflow/documentation. None of these ""promotions"" have ever really given me any excitement and I've mostly just see it as just a paycheck.   


People I've talked to seem like they have moments where they actually enjoy what they do, and obviously the opposite. I can't recall any moments where I genuinely enjoyed mine,  it's just what I knew. IT is the only profession I've ever worked in, no fast food/retail/etc.  My dad got me internships, I started my first at 16 during summer breaks until I graduated. I continued pursuing the career since it was all I knew and I couldn't think of anything else. Every new job/contract, I've been holding on to this notion of ""Maybe it'll get better next promotion"" and it's been that way since the beginning.   


I'm 28 with no degree and all I know is IT, I live paycheck to paycheck and haven't saved a single dime into retirement, I gave up on that idea. I just moved to a state where I know almost nobody, I don't have any hobbies that would correlate to any profession.

The 2 interviewers said they will notify HR and i was also told to email HR and get the link to apply for a paid internship…
It’s an infrastructure administrator job. 

Please how long do internships last and how much to you think I will get paid ( it’s a company that makes electric trucks) because i have to relocated for this position..also, I’m 28

I’m actually willing to learn and I want to put all my efforts in this…"

I was wondering what the typical pay is for someone fresh out of college with a few certs under them. Idk if labs are considered “hands on work” for resumes. I am obviously picky with salary for living conditions. Can 80k salary (in Florida) be achievable in a 5 yr plan?"
poqpqr,1,2021-09-15,Advice for Chemical Engineering student aspiring for Technology Support role in banks?,mufferman1,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/poqpqr/advice_for_chemical_engineering_student_aspiring/,"I am currently about to go into my final year of university studying MEng Chemical Engineering. Although I enjoy the content of my course, the typical careers that come with it don't appeal to me as I'd ideally want to work in the city (London) and within Technology, a passion I picked up during university and learnt to code myself in Python to an intermediate level. This led me to apply to technology roles for my year in industry (one year internship before my final year) and eventually landed one at a bulge bracket investment bank (only non-CS in my cohort). I was placed in a support role working in the DevOps Platforms team and generally loved the whole experience, picked up a lot of knowledge of the industry I never thought I would have and also multiple certifications across Python, GitLab and Azure. 

Now I'm at the stage where I'm applying to graduate roles, and I'm still trying to decide whether I should only stick with tech grad roles at banks. I know the competition is WAY more harder for these roles, especially in my case as someone who isn't the best coder/most technically proficient as a CS grad would be. I'm relying a lot on my placement to sell myself more so than my university projects/technical understanding that my competition for these roles would be. I've applied to about 8 banks already all of which are currently ongoing, however I failed at the coding test for one other bank because I simply found it too advanced for me, and I'm worried I'll get caught out in a similar way for the applications for the other ones. In my circumstance, would people suggest I only stick with these types of roles or diversify the companies a bit more? As I said, it is my aspiration to continue off from my placement in a similar industry but not sure if I'm being too unrealistic here. Thanks in advance."

I just had a career fair at my university and the recruiter talked to me about Cyber Warfare after talking about my interests. I was not sure what to expect from visiting the navy booth, but I find this program very interesting and something I want to consider shooting for.

A little about myself: I’m currently pursuing my bachelors in computer science from a top university and have a pretty good GPA. I am currently a second-year, but planning on graduating in spring 2023. I have internship experience as a software engineer at big name defense contractor, and I plan on interning there again next summer as a data science intern. My leadership experience is pretty limited but I’m in a couple clubs (this is something I need to work on). From physical aspect, I did cross country throughout high school, and continue running to an extent in college (try to run 30-40mpw). I also started going to the gym around 2-3 times a week for upper body starting this semester. 

Is there anything I can be doing in the meantime to prepare myself for this program? Also, if anyone has done this program, can they share their experience and advice they have for me? Thanks very much!"

For like five years now i have tried to get abitur (high school diploma) in germay now. Last year it looked like i was finally able to get to this years grade  where i could finnish the school. 

then covid hit and class went into lockdown. my grades wosrsened drasticall in the subjects i didnt like and i didnt pass the year.

Now because this was a more common ocassion last year. we could instead of our normal yearly grade , replace it with a grade that came from a test which covered the Curriculum of the whole school year. i registered myself for such a test in chemsitry.

At summer break it was very hard to focus and study with my adhd. but somehow i got myself to study  for 2 whole weeks.

i wasnr that much at a day ,but i got the feeling that i understood the subjects and would be able to get a somehow decent grade out for me.

today this illusion crashed. i took the test, and it was one of the hardest chemsitry tests i that i did ever partake in.. even my classmate who also atudied for it said she didnt understand anything.

now if i failed as horribly as her, i failed last year.

but what is hurting the most is the two weeks i spent learning. two weeks of trying really hard to concentrate myself and bringing myself down to do it
All the hope and the fear. all the suffering and anxiety i felt today before doing the test. also the last year which i spent half the time working a an intern for no money, because the school requires it as part of the education. All down the drain.



i feel very very shit, and i am seriously thinking about ending my life. it just feels like a logical conclusion at this point of suffering."

I took the gap year to build some skills one of them being programming as it is a profitable one. I thought that I’d be able to learn enough to apply for a job and I understand that it takes time but I won’t be able to survive off the money I have until then.( I do live with my mother but I’m not really on good terms and I don’t want to seem like I’m mooching off her)

I thought that maybe I should apply for some internships or work experience but all the descriptions seem to want somebody already experienced in that area. And just don’t have enough. I thought about saving up for a mentor but I feel maybe I don’t have enough experience because I’m not working hard enough.

I’ve been applying to jobs outside the programming field but for the life of me I can’t seem to get one.
To be honest now I’m writing this I feel kind of silly because I’m not sure what advice I’m even seeking, I guess you could call this a mini vent.

Any response really would be great. Maybe I just need an outside opinion?

povfev,23,2021-09-15,Kinda regret the choices I make,Masonry1-,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/povfev/kinda_regret_the_choices_i_make/,"
I’m an international transfer student who is supposed to come to campus this fall but there is a covid outbreak in my city so the chance of me traveling to the United States is very low. The government closed the highways, train station to general public so it’s extremely difficult for me to leave the city, but it’s still possible. And the government is not likely to lift the lockdown before September 29 which is the time the classes start.

Also, I won’t be able to travel after Sep 29 because the CBP will most likely deny my entry.

I emailed the admissions several times and they got back to me with the same response: 
“In general, UW does not grant deferrals. If we do not offer any remote course options and you are unable to travel to the U.S. by September 29, you may request a deferral.”

With the shitty things happening, I don’t feel like attending the UW that much though it was my dream school.

Here are my options:

1. Register for one online class and retain my admission spot and see if I can travel to the United States in winter. But then I’ll have to pay thousands of dollars in tuition for a class I don’t even need, and 3 months of expensive housing because of the lease contract. Or defer the fall admission which is very unlikely according to the admissions.

2. Withdrawal from the University and reapply for another university I favored in Canada. By doing this I’m essentially taking a gap year, and I might do some interns during this time. 

I’m considering the second option because my plan was to study in Canada when I graduate from UW, so I might as well go there two years ahead and I get to study in the major I like instead of the back up major at UW. But that would definitely extend my time as an undergrad.

I kinda regret the choices I made this year and I really don’t know what to do. things suck"

For the contest, I took part in the Euclid Mathematics Contest this year and ranked in the top 25%. I'm ready to take part in it again as well as the CCC in 2022.

For the activities, I worked as an intern in an IT company for a week and did a lot of volunteer jobs in daily life.

Do I have a good chance of getting the offer? I'm really anxious because I've seen some posts about people getting 98 avg but still being rejected or accepted mostly with 99."

About 3 years ago I finally got out of the service industry by finishing a 2 year software dev degree, and landed a job that I thought at the time was a great opportunity (Getting out of the service industry can be rough).

I started a little over 50k (After the internship with them) which from my understanding is low, but it is a County job and I only had a 2 year so I couldn’t complain.

But now I will admit, I’m not happy here and I feel like I am worth more, now. At least that’s what I want to tell myself, as I am 100% aware that government work (Especially this team) is very relaxed. So not only is my work ethic likely way off par of normal expectations, but my skill set isn’t getting any favors from all of these old technologies I need to learn to keep adapting them to new techs.

So I guess long story short, I’m starting to see job opportunities that are remote, MUCH higher pay than what I get, and I (For once in my life I can say this) feel like I meet all, if not almost all the requirements I see.

Part of me is worried that I’m secretly not nearly as qualified as I hope due to where I work now.

To clarify, I ended up doing “Full Stack” .net web app work here, and I seem to see demand for these things. 

Or maybe a pension is worth sticking around for…. That’s been on my mind as well…

Thanks for any input here! This is mainly making me think I’ll land a job and immediately be outed as some phony. Maybe that is the case, any comments appreciated!"

Till now college was online and easily manageable, however my college is reopening and job letter said I'll have to give 48hrs a week. 

I'm coping with assuming that people work in food chain such as McDonald's with college and I'm having a part time job in field I see my future in, also I am getting paid 15k/ month which is more than enough. I don't also want my grades to fall."
poxqi1,6,2021-09-15,"I am unemployed and hate the town I'm living in, but I just got an offer for a full time position at my local University. It is outside my preferred career field, and I'm tired of being unemployed but I also hate the place I live in and have no idea what I should do.",Substantial_Pizza_33,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/poxqi1/i_am_unemployed_and_hate_the_town_im_living_in/,"For context, I am a recent graduate from Fall 2020. I Double Majored in Econ/Math and Minored in Environmental Sustainability/Business Administration. I am interested in working in policy/data analysis and have a long term goal of pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics to help advance sustainable economic development. 

I have been job seeking for some time and have been a finalist for several interviews, but have always been turned down because the other person has ""more experience than me."" Whenever I ask for feedback, I always hear wonderful things, so I know that my only drawback is my lack of experience. So I try to network, meet people, attend (virtual) conferences, and consistently practice my data analysis skills and undertake research endeavors. Since I graduated, I've had two internships in policy/research (One of them is current, but part time) and I currently help an economist at a non-profit with his research (volunteer work) and work at my dad's restaurant.

My dilemma is that I want to go into research or policy and the job offer I received will be an activities director to help my local university jump-start an engineering program. I've been living with my family since the pandemic but occasionally visit my gf in another state. The problem with my town is that I am tired of living with my family and need my own space (my parents can be toxic and don't I don't really feel like they care about my goals or ambitions), and it's a small rural community where the people are ignorant and don't want to see you succeed. It feels like I'm wasting my life being here. 

I worked so hard to leave my crappy town and yet here I am. I want to work and start saving a bit extra money. So on one hand, I'm unhappy being here, but on the other I'm unhappy that I don't have a career yet. I could have a job and be unhappy living here or I could be unemployed and decide to live somewhere else and be happy. 

  
I'm leaning more towards the latter (leaving my town, despite my unemployment) and continuing my job search, but I just want validation/perspective that lets me know my thinking is solid.

Thank you all."

Imagine you had a single friend and they were constantly saying ""oh man there's just no one available, and I just keep looking! It's like there's just no single people out there!"". Then you come to find out that their standards are absolutely through the roof *absurd*.

\&gt; oh I'm not looking for much... you know, she just has to have a PhD, absolutely drop dead gorgeous, funny, intelligent, sociable. Oh did I mention she needs to be making enough income to support both of us? She should also speak at least 3 different languages. Also, if she's not blonde, it's a hard no.

You'd be like... dude... fucking make some goddamn compromises. You're being ridiculous. And you're just *some guy*.

This is how companies act. They'll be like: we need a dev who can do frontend development, backend development, team leadership, site reliability engineering, continuous integration, ML, AI, blockchain, AR, iPhone, car repairs, eat hot chip and lie. You guys gonna pay 5x salary? Cause that's 5 separate jobs.

Then they're like ""oh you must have a computer science degree and an internship"". Also 5 years experience. Also, you should have 5 years experience in this language that only released to the public 2 years ago. Also, show us a portfolio with 10 high profile projects you made, they have to have at least 2m downloads per week

You go into the initial round interviews and they're like ""make an app that will calculate the trajectory of a rocket accelerating at 1.25068km/m up to 3.2\*10\^6 km/m to land on this specific crater on this possibly undiscovered planet in the andromeda galaxy. Make sure you account for gravitational anomalies in the space time continuum and the heat death of the universe. Keep in mind this planet might also just have been a smudge on the telescope lens"". 

Then they'll have panels analyzing your ""social skills"" in some bizarre capitalist nightmare where they deem your personality to either be worthy or not of earning a living. They'll have to make sure you're *passionate about the job* ||translation: will you work 80 hours a week without complaining?||

Then they'll talk about the company ""vision"" like this grand thing, like all of humanity has lead up to the development of this specific app, then look at you like ""validate us. Tell us our company is special and you care about it. Do it.""

And then this is all for a company that like... fucking... is an app to get a quote for car insurance

Then they will send you some sort of rejection like ""oh this guy disagreed with your *opinion* on this"". Oh fuck you."
poybhn,33,2021-09-15,"For my fellow Merage students, I wanted to give some tips.",wsbalum,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/poybhn/for_my_fellow_merage_students_i_wanted_to_give/,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently a senior at Paul Merage and I wanted to write this post to help those in the Merage community especially when it comes to career (more so for freshmen and sophomores but some tips do apply to juniors and seniors as well). This might even be helpful for those that are not in Merage as well.

1. Use the career center. Whether it be going to the BA Career Launch, workshops, using BRIDGE, or talking to the career counselor, the career center is there to help you and they do it exceptionally well. Personally, because of the career center, I went from having no experience whatsoever to being offered a role at a FAANG company after graduation. Of course, they are not going to do everything for you. You need to do most of the work. However, they will guide you to the right path and that's going to be extremely helpful along the way.
2. Take this chance while you are in college to change your path as much as you want until you feel that it is just right for you. This can be done in many ways. You can take many classes to see what is right for you or you can go through internships to see whether or not the job is right for you. You do not need to stick with one thing just because it might make more money or is safer. However, do keep in mind that every decision that you make has a cost. For example, if you decide to transition into a major that has been shown to have fewer job prospects than your current major, you have to keep in mind that it's going to be harder for you when it's your senior year and it's time for you to start finding a job.
3. Have as much experience as possible. Whether it be through an internship, a part-time job, being a leader in a club, or volunteer work, experience is extremely important. Sure you can talk about your time in your classes when you are doing interviews but you would have much fewer stories to tell. Also, remember when it comes to internships that you don't have to work for a big company. You can work at smaller companies to gain experience as well. This is what I did to build up to what I have today. However, remember that there are costs to your actions such as usually not being paid to work for smaller companies such as start-ups so choose accordingly.
4. When applying for internships, know the period when companies hire especially the big ones. When you are searching for internships at big companies, it usually appears really early. For example, when I looked through Handshake a couple of days ago, there were job postings from big companies like P&amp;G for the next summer even though Fall Quarter hasn't even started yet. Of course, the internships for accounting, for example, might be posted at a different period than other internships so the career center is going to be helpful in finding the exact period of when companies hire for your specific internship.
5. Start looking for internships when you are a sophomore or a junior. I've seen internships for big companies that specifically wanted sophomores (not as many but they are there) and juniors. Personally, I used Handshake and Linkedin to find these internships. Even if you don't have experience, just apply and see what happens. If you get to the interview stage, ask a career counselor on how you should proceed especially if it is your first interview. They'll help you with the STAR format, interview tips, etc. Just going through the interview stage of a big company is a great experience and you'll gain a lot from doing so even if you don't get the job.
6. Don't be devastated when companies don't hire you. It's not the end of the world. You're not bad at what you do. You just weren't a fit for that specific company. There are many companies that you can fit in and it's just a number game to see which one needs you.
7. Have fun. Join clubs, hang out with friends, etc. It's 4 years of a time you'll never get back.

Good luck to all and I hope you find this helpful! Also if you have any questions for me, just feel free to PM me and I'll get to you as fast as possible. 

Also, feel free to leave more tips especially for the freshmen and sophomores. We should help each other out especially after the pandemic hit us so hard lol."

I have been looking at companies like Lockheed, Northrop Grumman and Leidos and was just wondering what level of engineering position should I be applying for given my 4 years of work experience is mainly personnel management (I also did a computer engineering internship for the DoD when I was in my undergrad). I’d be down with going for entry level positions but I also don’t want to sell myself short. Any advice is greatly appreciated!"
pozbha,2,2021-09-15,I need a better answer to the same question I get in every interview,_Deadite_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pozbha/i_need_a_better_answer_to_the_same_question_i_get/,"This request for interview advice may spill into a bit of a rant, so apologies in advance. 

A little context so everyone understands why this question has been asked in every interview so far, and why I keep fumbling it/losing the offer.

I started my career in inbound telemarketing when I was 16. Taking calls for as seen on tv stuff. Worked my way up to an ""Information Services Analyst"". In that position, I would build the screens telereps would read, build the data capture, build the formatted outputs and reports for the clients, coding in a cobol shell on a tandem system.  It wasn't heavy duty coding with api's and such. I had never known what a unit test was, there was no automated processes, hell, we didn't even use an off-the-shelf SQL manager for our queries. It was very niche, on an antiquated system, but I loved every minute of my 20ish years doing it.  Company decided to go a different direction and sold us to an outsourcer. Outsourcing company kept us for a couple years, gave us a new title of ""IT programmer analyst"", pushed for an upgraded system, then laid us all off.

 In the last 4 years, I was jobless for 6 months, applying unsuccessfully to all sorts of IT jobs I thought I could do.  
Went back to customer service on the phones to get my foot in the door. In 18 months there, I shadowed IT and even participated in a pilot internship in IT (I was quite literally laughed out of the interview for a permanent spot in web dev.).  Figured out I was a good 30 years out-of-date for most IT managers to take a chance on.
Found another opportunity for website administration with a hospitality/hotel company....which got hit hard with covid...and I was a victim in mass layoffs.
Finally landed a admin job and for the last year, I have hated every minute of it. The work is fine, but the lack of training, my ""team"", the politicization of Covid and how my company/team has reacted to Covid just doesn't align with me or my well-being.  So, I've been looking for another place to land.  That's 4 jobs in 4 years... which also makes interviewers skittish about me.

The last 5 interviewers have all asked the same question and anymore, I take it as a sign they're not interested.  ""You were in IT for almost 20 years, why aren't you applying to IT jobs?""

I try not to sound scripted, but my usual response is along the lines of looking for new challenges, more diversified education and skills.  If pushed, I'll drop that my experience is in older systems, nothing current IT managers are looking for.  This doesn't really seem to impress anyone and it's at this point I know I've lost this opportunity.

What I am thinking in my head is ""don't you think I've tried?!"" ""Why the hell would I be applying to an administrative job if this wasn't a last resort?"" 

I just get really frustrated and flustered with that question. Is there a better way to answer?"

We're also looking for Fall/Spring interns! Reach out to work@sunnydayfund.com for more info!

Sunny Day Fund™ is a fintech startup that offers employer-rewarded emergency savings accounts as an HR benefit to workers. We're trying to help low- and middle-income employees build savings for the near to mid term, and we're extremely mission-driven around the idea of financial inclusion.

Check out [our website](https://www.sunnydayfund.com/) for more information about what we do, and our [careers page](https://www.sunnydayfund.com/careers) for more information about the positions on offer.

Please note: Salaries on our AngelList are updated by team members other than me pretty frequently based on market rate, so by the time you see this, they may not be exactly the values below, but they will stay in the same ballpark.

#Product &amp; Engineering

##Product Manager

$90-140k + 0.1%-0.5% equity

We're looking for someone to organize client needs into requirements as well as guide the day-to-day of our agile/scrum product team. 3+ years of product management experience (particularly within enterprise SaaS and/or fintech), 1+ years of technical experience.

##Full-Stack Engineer

$75-115k + 0.05%-0.25% equity

We're on a modern JS stack + some industry-specific back-end integrations. It's definitely a plus if you've shipped work with Strapi/Synapse/Unit/Finch or similar tools, and TypeScript/Angular on the front end. But we're more interested in how you solve problems; the right candidate can always pick up a new tool or stack.

##Senior Full-Stack Engineer, Integrations

$100-150k + 0.01-0.5% equity

Looking for someone having all of the above + deeper experience in banking and/or payroll (preferably both)

#Revenue

##Strategic Partnerships Manager

$70-105k + 0.01-0.25% equity

Track record building partnerships for mutual revenue opportunities, deep familiarity with CRMs (particularly HubSpot)

##Sales Operations Analyst

$55-65k + 0.01-0.05% equity

This is somewhat of a hybrid role that exists between day-to-day ops like managing scheduling and CRM, data entry, etc., for other sales team members, and a more traditional entry-level sales role. Salary noted above is before commission; as mentioned above I'm the eng lead so idk exact numbers on the commission structure.

#Customer Success

##Customer Success Manager

$65-95k + 0.01-0.2% equity

Requires 4+ years of experience w/ B2B enterprise SaaS companies, preferably in the HR or finance space. We're a very small company right now so you'd likely be defining a lot of our formal processes for dealing with clients.

##Customer Success Associate

$40-55k + 0.01-0.1% equity

This is more of a front line customer service type position, helping our users solve day-to-day issues. You'd mostly be using Slack, Trello, and ZenDesk. The customer base is vetted since we sell to the employer instead of the end user directly, so this isn't some call center job where you're going to get yelled at all day. All of my interactions with our users have been lovely, even when they were frustrated about something.

#Cross-Function

##Wild Card

If you're interested in our mission and business model, but your skill set doesn't quite line up perfectly with anything you see above, we still want to hear from you! There might be a role we didn't even know we needed yet. For this kind of inquiry, it's better to reach out directly to work@sunnydayfund.com."

pp42r7,3,2021-09-15,Can anyone help a CS junior out?,prettyWildStory,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/pp42r7/can_anyone_help_a_cs_junior_out/,"Hey Boilermakers! This past summer I had an internship at a fairly well known F100 company. I decided to not take the return offer, so I could get a different experience elsewhere. This year I thought it would be a lot easier to get an internship given  a.) I now have internship experience and b.) I'm a junior now. This exactly hasn't been the case. I've had my resume reviewed by the CS department and they thought it was really good and I should shoot for ""Bay Area companies"" but I'm just still struggling to get interviews. I've exhausted the Purdue (IR and CS) career fairs and only got two interviews, but both companies gave me low ball intern offers. Both of the companies are located in Indiana and since I've lived here my whole life, I've been dying to get out since senior year of high school!

Part of the reason, I know I am struggling to get an internship is because I am applying to primarily startups, tech companies, and big banks, and I know these are certainly harder to get into than the F100 company I worked at this past summer. Does anybody have advice as to how to break into one of these type of companies? I'm from Indiana and neither of my parents work in the tech space, so it's not really an option for me to just get a referral and also I am just quite unfamiliar with the tech space. Thanks and Boiler Up!"

pp58d2,3,2021-09-15,Please help - career and study advice,fondaeagle,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/pp58d2/please_help_career_and_study_advice/,"I'm very confused and help would be greatly appreciated. I'm sorry for the long post as well, my story is very involved (if you don't want to read it all, you can skip to the large paragraph 'Currently' at the bottom - it's my major problem). I'm also sorry if this post is not in the right place, I'm new to Reddit :(

I'm 22 years old. I currently have a degree (Bachelor of Arts - Japanese studies major). I chose Japanese because I didn't know what I wanted to do but it seemed fun. I did have fun, but towards the end I felt differently but still wanted to graduate so I at least had a degree.

Reason why I didn't know what I wanted to do: My father passed away during the middle of my final year of high school. I lost all passion for my previous dreams (law and psychology) and took a year off before starting uni because I was totally burned out. I didn't want to go to uni, I just wanted to get a random job. But people around me said I should get a degree otherwise I wouldn't want to start one later on. So, I chose Japanese. 

After graduation: I was torn between career paths. I applied for and was given an offer to complete one of two Master degrees (Art Curatorship and Publishing/editing). I applied for Art Curatorship because I enjoyed art history subjects during my course and have a bit of passion for traditional East Asian Art (especially Chinese landscape paintings, ceramics - Celadon). I thought that I could still combine my Japanese language too, possibly working with Japanese Woodblock prints or something else. I didn't accept because I was worried that I wouldn't get an internship in the niche area that I had interest in (celadon/ceramics). I applied for Publishing/editing because that's the slightly boring/repetitive (for me) thing I'm good at (anything to do with grammar, structure, words ... I enjoy helping people on language learning apps too). I didn't accept because I thought it would be the same thing every day on a computer screen.

At the same time, I applied for and was given an offer to complete a Bachelor of Science. I had it in my mind that I love animals and I enjoyed biology at school (animal/anatomy/evolution-related parts of it anyway), so I wanted to give it a go. I actually planned to swap from Arts to Science in the beginning but I didn't have the maths prerequisite and it was too late so I was stuck in Arts and got comfortable there. This was a failure to prepare properly on my part, as I didn't make it to the open day after my father passed and in my cloud of grief I just messed up. My original dream was to become a Vet. However, I'm terrible at maths and chemistry, and won't get into Vet School without them or a high score (therefore I switched goals). So, I thought about becoming an Animal Behaviourist. I worked really hard to complete the maths subject prerequisite during my last year of Arts. I was actually proud of myself because I was never good at maths but I really tried and I passed. I accepted my offer for Bachelor of Science with the mindset that I should give it a go because I might regret it later, and it was something always on my mind because I failed to switch the first time around.

Currently: I am nearly finished with my first year of Science. However, I'm struggling. I have never been exceptionally good at science subjects at school (chemistry was the worst, biology a little better). I passed the chemistry foundation subject and biology last semester, but just average grades. I find that I can't keep up with lectures, content, practicals (online currently). I don't know whether I'm just lazy and not trying hard enough, am just not science-minded (I've always been better at English-related subjects) or it is online learning and COVID lockdowns affecting me. I cry all the time because I just don't know what to do. I can't tell if I'm miserable because it's boring content and not my passion or because I'm not good at it or because I'm on my screen for too long or I'm scared. I don't know whether to quit and just do something I'm better at or try next year too because that's when the more animal focused subjects start. I'm scared because it gets more difficult and I don't know if I'm even smart enough or capable of doing things like assessed practicals and in-person exams again (if they ever come back). I want to be an Animal Behaviourist (like Jackson Galaxy, Cesar Milan type - going to houses, helping stressed out pets) ... I wanted a degree so I can better understand the inner workings of animals. No one even knows what that is, career people at uni have been of no help to me, saying “wow, animal behaviourist, I’ve never heard of that”.

I'm perpetually fearful of wasting my time, having regrets later on, making a poor decision, wasting money - but that's exactly what I'm doing.

I guess I'm just hoping that strangers on the internet can give me some good advice (hopefully not too mean) from an objective point of view. I don't even know if I can actually already get a great job with the degree I have, without even needing to do something else. I really want to do well in life and be successful for once, but everything I do just seems to lead to nowhere. I feel like I have no passion and it's really stressing me out. I'm so lost! :("

pp70mj,1,2021-09-16,30 day notice…,mothermadre,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/pp70mj/30_day_notice/,"Hi,

I rented an apartment in the city for an internship. I’m a student and I don’t currently make the same amount of income I did while I worked there, which is pretty important to my case.

I rented for 3 months at a residential condominium, which came at a premium (which is to be expected). 

My landlord and I had an agreement that this would be a three-month deal, therefore I believed that my move-out date would be September 9th, considering I moved in on June 9th. The date came and I let her know I was leaving, moved out, returned my keys, and signed the move out document to schedule an inspection.

After my move out date, my landlord told me I needed to make a 30-day notice before moving out. By the time I was made aware of this I had already handed over my keys. This means I would owe 1500 and not get my security deposit back until I do.

I was never made aware of this fine print. They were very smart in saying they had told us (my parents were there with us) about it during the apartment tour but none of us remember that being the case. This is my first time renting on my own and I seriously do not have the money to pay them. Again, I’m a student, and I had made it exceedingly clear that I would be living there for 3 months starting June 9th.

(Portland, OR, USA)

EDIT: They agreed on the September 9th move out date, FYI. They took my keys and my fob in that very date."

**Just a quick back story: Not trying to get people's pity here**

I grew up in South Central Los Angeles to a migrant family in the 90s. Mom never finished 6th grade and dad never finished high school. Both migrated to the US in the early 80s and worked factory jobs. Without going into too many details, we ran away from my monster of a father in 97. Mom couldn't take the abuse and took on the responsibility of raising both me and sister alone.

I get that my mom was burdened financially and I don't hold anything against her, but she pressured me all the time to drop out of high school. All of my male cousins who were around my age or older, dropped out of high school. They all got involved in drugs and gangs. Every week she'd remind me about my cousins who all dropped out, started working and helping their parents. She would tell me that I was just wasting my time. Eventually it all came crashing down in the 11th grade. She started kicking me out of the house, demanding rent.

Fortunately, a good friend of mine and his family helped me out during this time. Around this time, I was also starting work with some uncles of mine in construction. I would work every weekend with them and every summer and winter break. I bought myself a car and drove myself to school. Friend would sometimes spot me gas and food. Together we both finished high school along with some other friends. As soon as I finished high school, my mom already had me interviewing with her boss. Not even a week after graduation, I had already started working at her company. She let me move back in, so long as I paid rent.

I worked as an inspector at her company for 4 years. Around this time, the recession was going downwards, her company downsized and laid me off. I went back to work with my uncles in construction, but at this time I noticed that most of my high school friends were either in college or had finished college. I asked my uncles if they could give me some days off so that I could start college too. They agreed and let me work with them for about 4 years. I started community college, first going in to be an automotive tech. Did almost 4 years of auto tech, but discovered science again. In one of my general ed classes, a professor suggested looking into engineering since I loved math so much.

On the last year I switched majors to ""applied math"" or ""applied physics"" since I didn't know what type of engineer I wanted to be. A friend of mine introduced me to C++ as he worked using it and another math professor introduced me to Python. I knew that if I wanted to be an outstanding engineer, that I had to learn programming. I picked up both languages, though I leaned more towards Python since it felt so much easier. That same friend who showed me C++ also introduced me to Arduino, 3D printing and CAD! He gave me some bootleg copies of AutoCAD and SolidWorks and I played with that for a while. I finished my engineering transfer requirements at another college and left my uncle's company, but not before I took on the General B Contractor's test and passed. I got his company off the license he was borrowing and started making passive income through him.

**Backstory Over**

I got accepted to UCI and some Cal States. Tried UCI for one quarter, but didn't like it and the commute (160+ miles every day). I waited a couple months and went back to a local Cal State and finished my bachelors. During this time, I was also working at another aerospace company, doing QA as a final inspector. Only worked here until my 2nd year into CSU when I decided to just live off the passive income from the Gen. B license and finish full time.

At that Cal State I really excelled in programming, CAD, and math. I was already doing Arduino projects at home, 3D printing, soldering, etc. Even got some of my friends involved. I would also tutor friends and helped several of them pass classes and some to graduate. I had over 4 years (now 6+) experience in Python, C++, AutoCAD and SolidWorks. My CSU only required SolidWorks and Matlab/Simulink for mechanical engineers. Matlab &amp; Simulink were super easy and tutored friends in these too.

Now this is the bitter sweet part that makes me feel depressed AF. A lot of my friends that I helped, all got engineering jobs right away. We all graduated in June of this year (2021). I have been applying since January. So far, I got only 1 interview and I've maybe submitted close to 300 or more applications. I've been using LinkedIn, Indeed, Ziprecruiter, school's resources and mailings, professor mailings, applying locally and I have had zero offers!

I kinda feel like it might be my age or background. I graduated when I was 30 and I still do live in the hood. All of my friends graduated in their mid 20s and all from more affluent areas. From my inner circle of 8 friends who graduated with me, only 2 had internship experience and others had absolutely no other experience, like no jobs ever. Five got job offers immediately and are working now, 2 others have gotten multiple interviews and one just got some offers last week. To make matters worse I kind of already feel my family telling me about how I wasted all these years in college/uni and have nothing to show for it. I didn't want to be like my mom who has been working at the exact same company for over 25 years, making $16.50/hr. I didn't want to be like my cousins who are making minimum wage, living paycheck to paycheck. I busted my ass off, spent countless nights studying, loosing sleep over exams, yet after all this struggle and work, it feels like I am worse off.

I was already told that maybe its my resume or I am not selling myself enough etc. I've passed off my resume to friends and family to get feedback and also got all the resumes from friends who got hired and I just don't get it. I have even followed cover letter guides and try to write cover letters for most jobs I apply to. I even have actual projects to show or sell myself with, one for a pretty big company and several of my professors offered letters of recommendations if needed. Its very depressing. Every week and month that passes I lose more hope.

EDIT: 09/16/21

**Abridged Version (TLDR):**

I grew up in a bad neighborhood. Didn't start college immediately. Worked for about 8 years in construction and aerospace (doing quality), before finishing my undergrad. Graduated on June 2021 and most of my friends who graduated with me got jobs almost immediately or shortly after.

I've been applying for about 9 months with my only success being a single interview that led into a follow-up interview, but didn't get the job. Oh yes, and I graduated with a bachelor's in science for mechanical engineering. I have experience in programming and CAD too!

Why is life unfair?

I graduated earlier this year and been working in a company for the past 4-5 months. I like to consider myself as a backend engineer. I love working with Nodejs or Django and databases like Postgresql, mongo etc. I can also do some front end with react and angular. Its not about a preferred tech stack, I can learn basically anything that involves writing code (which I absolutely love)

&amp;#x200B;

So I joined this company as a Software engineer, the JD requirements were something like: 

Nodejs developer with hands on experience in SQL databases etc. (basically your typical JD for backend engineer) 

The Problem is that for the past 4-5 months, I've been solely working on making Canvass apps on Microsoft powerapps platform (its like drag and drop application builder with added logics using excel type formulae), sometimes using the Microsoft Dataverse as DB, using cloud flow. All in all I have not written a single piece of code for the past 4-5 months !!

I Hate it !! I absolutely hate working on these stupid drag and drop apps. And it's not like my company doesn't have coding positions. There are quite a few big clients associated with the company. I asked my PM when I'd get to work on more ""cheesy"" projects to which they told: ""We can only put you in a client side team when your probation period (9 moths) is over"" 

There is so much I want to learn like software architecture, writing clean and scalable code, managing databases.  
I was like ""F\*ck this"" and I started grinding leet code right away looking for a new job.

I want to know, how would this effect my job search ? 

If I am looking for a new job and the recruiter asks me, what did I do in my previous jobs ? Should I tell them my work was mainly building stupid canvass apps for company facing projects ? 

Is it wise to mention this work for a good SDE job ?

Any advice would be appreciated 

Ps: I have quite a number of side projects under my belt relating to Web dev and another Internship experience"

ppitw1,2,2021-09-16,"Sketchy Job Interview - I did some sketches during the interview for a graphic design job, and I'm worried they're going to actually use the ideas, even if they don't hire me.",Girtma,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ppitw1/sketchy_job_interview_i_did_some_sketches_during/,"So, a bit of background - I'm a graphic designer, I've been in the workforce for about a year now, but it was a job that I started out as an intern in when I was in college. I'm currently in Hong Kong, and while I speak limited Mandarin, I know next to no Cantonese. This isn't a major issue, but it does sometimes mean there are communication issues. I'm learning, but it's a tricky language to learn. For personal reasons, I'm leaving the job, so I've been on a job hunt for about a month now. I had an interview yesterday and it was... sketchy.

It's for a music school that's just been set up, and it seems to be a pretty young team, and mainly local Cantonese. But, they're well established, they've got a couple hundred students, and some pretty prolific teachers. They needed a graphic designer, and, as my parents are music teachers, and I learnt a couple instruments when I was young, and had some music knowledge, I thought it sounded like a great fit. 

I went in, and the first lady that interviewed me explained that the boss was in a meeting, so she'd ask me some questions first before he came in as well. It was a pretty standard interview, from my experience. She askes to see my portfolio, then says she's going to talk to the boss and also can she take my portfolio so she can scan some of the works. That was a bit odd, as I'd sent in my digital version the week before and no one had ever asked to scan the artworks before, but maybe she just didn't know I'd sent a digital version earlier. She leaves, comes back, says that the boss wants me to take a written test to get more of a grasp on my skills, but it's in Cantonese. So, maybe I could just do some sketches. 

This was... odd, but I supposed it made sense. She told me they were planning on changing up their logo, and also needed a poster for their Christmas concert. Could I do some ideas for a poster, and maybe sketch some logos? I explained that these things can take time, and I wasn't sure that I would be presenting quality work, but she reassures me it'll be fine. 

She leaves me for about 30 minutes, during which I do some sketches, and I manage to come up with quite a few logo ideas... some of which I was actually quite proud of. When she comes back in, she agrees, and wants to scan it as well, which, sure, I guess.

Then her boss comes in. I can tell he didn't talk to her at all, since he asks the same questions and explains the same thing. He's a bit concerned I don't speak Cantonese, and so he won't offer the full salary I asked for because they'll need to hire a full-time translator as well, which... wtf? I've lived in HK for quite some time, and have many English speaking friends who work at Canto-centric companies, and my own company they mainly speak Cantonese, unless they're talking directly to me. And my Canto isn't that bad, I can talk with printers and manufacturers and what not. I tell him that I can still do the job, and that a translator isn't necessary, especially since my work is back-end. He sort of brushed it off then, and said something about how a class he was teaching was about to start and we would discuss it later. The way he said it sort of made me think that it was a deal-breaker, and I wouldn't get the job. I wasn't too upset though, since it seemed like I wasn't a right fit for the company anyway - they were looking for more marketing than brand development, which is what I was looking to do. So, after an interview that took over an hour, I headed home. 

You can imagine my surprise, then, when just a few hours ago, I recieved a message from them. They were inviting me back for a second interview (great!) but their team was interested in my ""musical background"", and would I please bring in my instruments to the next interview and show off my abilities?

I....

I don't know what to say. First) this is a graphic design job. Second) I told them I played some instruments in middle school and high school, and that I wasn't very good at any of them, I only did them for a year. Third) this is a GRAPHIC DESIGN job. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole thing is just ringing bells for me. I obviously won't be going in for a second interview, I just don't think it's the right place for me. But now, looking back, I'm a bit worried about my ""test"" during the interview - clearly there's some miscommunication, and I just did a bunch of design work, essentially for free. While the logos and posters I did were just sketches, I did put effort into them, and the interviewee did press for quite a bit of info about how they would look with colour, what program I would use, what font, etc... I'm worried that maybe they're going to take those sketches and ideas and actually use them for their logo and poster design. I took a photo of the sketches after I did them on my phone, but I know that it's not proper protection for my design and work. I'm hoping that I'm just being paranoid, and that it's just a weird interview with some weird people, but I want to protect myself against art theft (is it even art theft? I don't even know that much!). 

I haven't sent a response about the second interview yet, I already have a draft declining their offer, but I'm wondering if I should mention the sketches I did, or if I should just wait and see what happens. 

Any advice would be much appreciated."

First-time poster to this subreddit, I recently graduated with a Business Degree this May (many regrets before you ask), not really knowing what I wanted to do with my life tbh. I then got interested in IT because I liked the idea of helping companies with technical issues, not to mention I found out about Business Analyst positions and it seemed right up my alley to me. So I started applying around to help desk positions and any entry IT-related positions in my area after seeing the advice here. I haven't been able to land any, unfortunately, so I decided to start getting some foundational IT knowledge (A+, Net+, etc.) and I found a program that helps get you these certs and an internship at the end of the program usually is some type of help desk role. Currently on week 3, but this morning I got a job offer for a Datacenter technician but if I take it I'll probably have to quit the IT program. The Datacenter job is mostly hardware orientated with no software interactions from what I gather, here is the description:

**RESPONSIBILITIES:**

* Cabling and connecting Cisco routers &amp; Switches to metal racks
* Install, integrate various products/equipment per Build Specifications and/or Configuration Instructions
* Cable Management
* Shipping &amp; receiving. Procurement of materials for project-specific requirements
* Complete physical audit of equipment and accessories
* Rack &amp; Stack
* Perform asset tagging

It's full-time with benefits and pays better than my current job with the possibilitiy of upward movement although I'm a little skeptical. But anyway I guess I'm just seeking advice as to which would be better for future career growth? As I said before I guess my end goal is something like a Business Analyst or perhaps a Cloud support role as I hear that's trendy and I kinda like the idea of more client-support roles."

I was very excited about the opportunity as it would be my first experience in the ""big, corporate world"" if you like. I've already had several years of work experience in brand management under my belt (in a luxury goods startup), but this, of course, because of the scale and complexity involved, was a massive step up and involved a steep learning curve. 

Here are the facts: 

&amp;#x200B;

* When I applied, the position was advertised as an internship.
* The internship description was incredibly vague.
*  I was hired as an external contractor, so my duties were never actually listed in my contract. 
* The only thing my contract said when I was signing it was ""Manager"" in the title. (It was 2020, I had just moved back to the UK after two years abroad and was a bit desperate for a job; hence I signed the weird contract).
*  I do not get paid like an intern. I have a much better salary than many entry-level jobs out there. 
* I was initially supposed to be working as an assistant to two senior managers. Still, due to a sudden wave of redundancies during my second month at the company, one of the managers left, and I essentially ended up taking on a lot of her responsibilities and projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

* My day to day duties are not that different from the ones that are carried out by brand managers who have been there for a while. These include competitor research, creating reports/materials for various senior forums, coordinating big cross-functional teams across different projects, working on building project timelines, ensuring that all deadlines on projects are met, liaising with the legal team, writing marketing copy, preparing consumer research materials in cooperation with marketing research agencies, gathering and analysing competitor intelligence, etc. ) The main difference is that I do not have any authority to engage in negotiations with regional offices and stay out of most long-term strategy discussions since I'm only there for a year/have not been long enough at the company. And I also do not directly report to any of the super senior people who are higher up the food chain. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Because of the workload, I still end up working super long hours on par with the manager I report to. We usually work on the same-ish things, and it's not unusual for both of us to work weekends and late nights. 
* During some more discreet one-to-one conversations with members of other teams, many have pointed out that the brand management team really needed an extra brand manager but apparently did not have the budget. Hence they hired ""an intern"". So it feels like it is almost a bit of an in-joke; even people from other departments seem to know that what I do is not exactly intern-level stuff. Many sound genuinely shocked when they hear me get introduced as an ""intern"" at some external meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*And just a full disclaimer, the manager I report to (who stayed and wasn't made redundant) has been nothing but great to me. She's been a real mentor and really helped me in my professional development. She really didn't have much control over the workload that fell on me once the other manager had left, and I think both of us have tried to make the best out of a tough situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, despite all of this, I still get introduced as an ""intern"" at many external meetings. My contract is running out in a couple of months; I urgently need to start looking for another job (due to the cuts, it's looking unlikely that I will get another job at the same company - and to be honest, I don't think I would want to stay anyway). However, I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to put on my CV. Because of the workload and my daily responsibilities, it feels a little bit strange to put ""intern"" as my title. Would I be justified using the word ""trainee"" instead?  

What would be a smart way of tackling this? Any advice would be appreciated!"

ppome8,2,2021-09-16,I am so stressed about housing,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ppome8/i_am_so_stressed_about_housing/,"So my college does not guarantee housing after sophomore year. 

The general rule around here is, if you do not have a house by the end of October for next year you are going to get screwed. Me and my current roommate have been looking and have some options, but here's the problems: 

First of all, the school no longer has my major. I decided to take a different career path, and they do not offer it here. I am still not really sure if I am going to transfer or if I am just going to finish my bachelor's and then get a master's elsewhere. If I do decide on transferring, I don't want to have signed a lease on a house already when I won't be living here.

Next is who I am going to live with. I definitely want to live with my current roommate. She wants to live with one of the other girls in our current room as well. I kind of know the girl and I don't really have any reason to not like her, but I also don't know her that well. I am not sure I want to sign up to live with a kid I barely know after 3 weeks, especially because my friend did that last year and it turned into a huge mess. She also has a direct roommate right now that we would not be inviting so that could cause some major issues for the rest of this year. I have some other friends that I rather invite to live in the house, but my roommate already invited this girl and I don't want to create problems.

Then comes the big issue, money. I currently pay for my on-campus housing through my student loans. I work 30+ hours a week, but I am saving for grad school so I don't want to spend that money on housing. Rent around here is $700-$900 a month per person plus utilities. Contracts are from June-May, so I am going to be paying for the house for 12 months when I won't move in until August, to begin with. I could get a job up here over the summer, but I was planning on doing an internship closer to home.

Also, I have no clue if I will have transportation. My brother currently has my car at his college due to his internship being 30 mins away from his campus. I don't know if I am getting it back for next year. If I live off campus I have to rely on my roommates to drive if I don't have a car, and I am the only one that would be going to the medical campus. If I live on campus, there are buses to get to there.

I really just don't know what to do at this point because I honestly just don't think living off-campus is a good idea for me, but at the same time, if I do not get a house, I may physically have no place to live next year.  Has anyone been in a similar situation and/or have advice?"

I can tweak my resume, but I can't change the university I am studying at.

So I am wondering--after working full-time for a few years, will my school no longer have any weight? I can solve most all leetcode mediums, but I never make it to the interview room, and I was wondering if big tech companies will still give me a chance after working at most likely a smaller company for a few years.

Or will most still ghost/reject if not working at a bigger name company or having a no-name school?

It hurts being able to solve any leetcode question and never having an interview."

I am looking to do a career change. I am 27/f and have a bachelors in communications. I felt like I was stupid and just got a degree to get a degree, and quite honestly - it has not paid off even remotely and I graduated in 2016. I am going back to school and I want to be very direct about what I want and get internships and graduate with honors. So, I am leaning towards IS because I feel like I would enjoy it and that job security and growth is much better than my field now. The most I've made salary right now is $37,000/ year (Im in a low cost of living area) but don't get me wrong - it's hard to survive on. 

I picked IS because I did research on it and I'm interested in the business side (It's an MBA at my University) and I like working with computers and technology. I also read/heard from multiple sources that IS is the tech with a lot less math and I am not super great at math. I could get through studying hard but I don't want to be taking numerous math courses that I can barely pass.

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, is what im saying making sense?

Also what should I concentrate in?

I was looking towards being a consultant of some sore (IT consultant, Cyber Security Consultant), but in your opinions, what is the highest demand job with decent pay? I just need a specific goal to strive for.

Two full time jobs both at the same time so my workload is crazy. But also it can be flexible because I do work from. However, to maintain that flexibility I have to stay disciplined. So when I’m working, I’m working. Also some days I have a-lot of meetings. This day was one of them. 

**Side note: Prior to this argument we were not officially together. But still living together and acting as if we were. She said she wasn’t sure about me because of how I react to things in our relationship. She’s cheated multiple times with an ex that she’d still been in contact with up until about a week or two before this incident. And she only stopped contacting the ex after the ex got engaged and told her about it. To which she told the ex she was making a mistake. The ex blocked her.

Up until about two weeks ago I would find out she was in contact with the ex at least once a month since we got back together after she cheated back in January. It’s September. When I’d find out I’d loose my shit because how many times do we have to go through this?! She’d make me feel bad for loosing my shit and I’d end up apologizing for how I reacted and her actions were no longer the issue. I would also find out she’d be messaging people on dating sites. Smh when I write this out it sounds terrible. But anyway I still stayed and tried to make things work cause I truly can’t help that I love her. I even started therapy to see why I can’t let her go, or if her arguments are actually valid. My therapist has been validating me.)

Anyway I digress.

It was a Tuesday morning, a busy morning. Didn’t get a break until around 1. At that time I went to go check on my ex because I usually wake her up everyday for internship or class. And though I’d heard her on her phone about 30 mins prior I figured she’d fallen back asleep like she usually does.

As I went to check on her I noticed her dog sleeping by the bathroom door so I asked her why he was sleeping by the door and not in the room with her like usual. She asked if I’d taken him out I said no because I was working. She said “then that’s why.” She seemed perturbed but got up and took him out. When she came back she was like “if you hear him crying you need to take him out.” So I responded “he wasn’t crying, he was sleeping, like I said.” Then I followed that with. “But can you also be considerate to the fact I have two jobs and don’t really get a break until around noon or 1pm.” She was like “you could still take him out. I’m standing on that. You’re just trying to play the victim because I’m telling you about yourself.” I was like “What?! That’s not even the case. I just had a busy morning why is that something you can’t understand?!” She said because I work from home and my schedule is flexible for other things. Which is true but when I flex my schedule I have to work more on other days, and I can’t flex my schedule everyday she doesn’t seem to understand that. I’d also just called off two days the week prior cause I was feeling burnt out so I was a little behind on n work.

Further, she was home as well. She slept in all morning and I heard her on her phone about 30mins before I came in the room. So I know she was up at least for a little while. And when I came in the room to check on her, she was laying in bed on her phone.

This fight ended up spinning out of control because she said she truly feels I should have carved time out of my work day to take her dog out regardless of my workload and the fact that she was home, cause she was “sleep”. 

Usually because I be trying so hard to hold onto her I’ll cave and apologize for everything. But this day I was so tired of feeling crazy I called my mom and and she validated me. But my ex still wasn’t budging. Later that day she said she spoke to a friend and her mom and sister and they all agreed I should have taken time away from my work and taken her dog out while she slept. 

I just need to know, and guys be brutally honest. Was I in the wrong?"

If you're reading this, then I want to say sorry, and I hope in time you can understand why I did this. 

Every day I go to class and I'm surrounded by people, people that have bright futures, that have strong friendships. I see couples holding hands, I see friends shooting the shit and laughing. And I can't help but feel jealous and alone. Every time I see a beautiful girl or a couple, I feel angry at myself. I want to stress that I don't feel entitled, no one is entitled to a relationship or another person's affection. I'm angry at myself for being so pathetic and worthless that I don't deserve a relationship and never will. I'm ending my life so I don't have to face my future alone. The thought of being alone terrifies me. Even when I'm surrounded by my friends and (activity) teammates, I feel alone and sad at the end of the day. 

I feel hopeless. I feel like my life won't get better, I feel like everything I do is completely pointless because I'll never have a good life. I'll never have a fulfilling relationship with my dream girl, I'll never have kids, I'll never have a good and fulfilling career. I just got an internship at a law firm. I've always wanted one because I've always wanted to go to law school and help others. But even as I got it, I felt like I wasn't good enough, I feel like I'll never be good enough. 

I wish I wasn't brought up Catholic. All the guilt and anxiety has ruined my mind. I feel like I'm an awful person. I can't flirt with girls because I spent so long avoiding tempation that just never learned and now I'm behind. I didn't go to parties because I didn't want to sin. I'm behind socially, romantically, sexually. And I feel like I deserve to feel this way. I grew up being told I'm bad, and that I'll be tortured forever if I don't do good, but how much good can I do if I'm an awful person? I've never been a good person, even with all the positive things I do to try and help, I've never been and never will be good. 

What used to keep me going was the idea that (cousin) would die before me. The thought of pissing on his grave gave me comfort, the idea that I could see that bastards lifeless body be lowered into the ground gave me hope. If this is how you're finding out (cousin) sexually assaulted me, I'm sorry. I wish I could have spoken up about it. I wanted to, but (oldest brother) had just died the year before and everyone was already so sad, and I was embarrassed and felt like it was my fault. I was only 12 or 13, how could I have stopped it? (cousin) took my innocence, he helped take my mental health, and I hope he suffers greatly after I am gone. 

To mom, don't you dare blame dad. I know you want to because that's all you do. He deserves it sometimes, but this isn't a situation like that. He wasn't the one that told me life doesn't get better. You extinguished all the hope I had in the future. I love you, but I couldn't recover from that. I wish I could be a better son and recover, but I couldn't. 

To dad, I'm sorry. You've been through so much and I'm sorry. You have done so much for this family, you're the best dad anyone could have hoped for and I'm sorry I couldn't be stronger for you. I promise I'll give (oldest brother) a big hug for you if there is a heaven. 

To (Older brother), I was always afraid of you. I couldn't be the real me around you because I was always scared of being yelled at. You beating me when I was little left me with psychological scars I could never get over. You ruined my childhood. And I know you changed, I'm so proud of what you've done since you graduated High School and it's not fair that my mind couldn't recover. I'm sorry I couldn't change my mind to not be scared of you. 

To my friends and teammates, I'm sorry. The past year has been wonderful, but I can't stop thinking of when it'll end, because when it does, I know I'll be alone again. Please don't blame yourselves, or look for missed signs or mull over what could have been done differently. My suicide has been inevitable for a long time, nothing could be done to stop it. Please don't think any more or less of me because of this. Just think of me as me. As the guy you knew through whatever you knew me through. 

My blood is on the hands of (cousin) and the Catholic church. No one else deserves blame. 

I hate the world, but I love the people in it. I'm sorry I couldn't stay for you.

Several redditors points out that I desperately need to shorten my list. Kindly help me do the same, thanks :)

Intended Major: Engineering physics or mechanical engineering. 

Identity: High school graduate on gap year, Asian Indian, Male, Lives in Middle East, Middle Class and Good EFC.

SAT: 1550+ (not taken yet.)

GPA: 4.0

Good ECs, Essays and REC letters.

Please note that there are NOT many safeties on my list, as I have safeties in my home country. 

My Criteria:

1. University must have a good rank overall and for engineering. 
2. Prestige is imp to this intl student. Doesn't really matter if I get into a no name school that is really good for engineering. I won't go there anyways.
4. Uni must have very good ROI.
5. I don't care about campus looks at all. (But Dartmouth made me question this belief)
6. Nerdy environment, STEM focused colleges are nice.
7. Ideally a liberal and welcoming environment, this should run in conjunction with the city and state.
8. Good placement, good internship, good co-op, all of the usual stuff.
9. Ideally a very small or no small greek life (prolly due to the movies i have seen). Drinking shouldn't be a huge thing in the dorms. (The reason why I removed UW Madison)

The list, in order of preference:-

Long reaches: MIT, Cornell &amp; UPenn (ivy), GTech, Rice, UCLA, UIUC, UMich, USC, Northwestern

Low reaches: Purdue, UWashington, UCSD

Safeties: UMaryland-College Park, ASU

*Please suggest any other uni that you think is a better fit than the ones I mentioned here.*

---

My Explaination for choosing each university. 

*TL;DR: i like every school the same. Look at my criteria and help me decide please which ones to remove and which one to ED*

1.  MIT (Long Reach)
Dream school. Applying no matter what.
""MIT is the IIT of USA""


2. Ivies- Cornell &amp; UPenn (Long reach)
I really liked Cornell but for the most part these 2 were a bit random. I like both of them, campus feel and environment doesn't matter to me at all. They are both good for engineering and I want to ED between one of them (they might give some aid too). Also I didn't stand chance in other ivies for engineering. Please suggest if you think I have better fit at any other ivy.


3. GTech (Long reach)
Best for engineering imo. But don't know if Georgia is the best state. Atlanta is good tho. Really liked the university tho.


4. Rice (Long Reach)
Not super sure of this as it is located in Texas which isn't the best spot for internationals.


5. UCLA (Long reach)
One guy from my school got in. Lol, I like UCLA too.


6. UIUC (Long Reach)
Very well ranked for engineering. Very good ROI rank. Also know a couple ppl who got in. *But I think there is very little flexibility in changing courses. Is that true?*


7. UMich (Long Reach)
Great for engineering. 


8. USC (Long Reach)
I recognize that USC isn't that well ranked for engineering, I am just applying there as I loved their campus and course structures.


9. UCSD (low reach)
Coz it is the other UC I have chance in and ranks well for engineering. 


10. Purdue (low reach)
One guy I know got in.


11. UWASHINGTON (low reach)
Like it a lot. Feel I will get in.


12. UMD, ASU (safties)
They are the only safties i liked and ranked well. Everyone I know got in.


13. Northwestern (Long reach)
I don't really care about this one too much but it has a really good rank.

I cry a lot because I felt like shit and wouldn't find a mechanical engineer job, and sadly hat to start looking for minimum wage jobs. I got pretty far in the interview process with a company like Blue Origin, Lucid Motor, and others, but they all end up rejecting me. However, a finally got a job as a manufacturing engineer with a well-known aerospace company, which the really appreciate my university worked. A pretty happy because now I can focus on other things such as studying for the EIT exam and other certification like the Lean Six Sigma Green Belt.

For those who are still looking for a job and have a similar experience, I can tell you I know how it feels to depreciate, and reading a rejection letter basically telling you are not what there looking for or expecting from an entry-level engineer. Believe me, there is a company out there that is going to see the value and potential you have you need to be persistent with the job search any rejection letter you receive, don't even bother reading them delete them as soon you receive them and focus that time on perfecting your resume and interview approach and try finding week spot that I think that is getting you rejected.

I think it's time I get a new, durable laptop for work.

LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE

Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:

I don't know too much about laptop prices these days but I know I'm not willing to pay above 1000€.

Are you open to refurbs/used?

Durability is a worry of mine, so I'd rather not.

How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?

Build quality matters to me as I plan on using this for a long time.     
I need decent performance but rather than having really good performance, I care about performance that lasts (every laptop I've ever had eventually became unbearably slow).    
A good battery life would come in useful as I would like to be able to bring it to school.    
The only reason I would care about form factor is being able to put it in a bag.

How important is weight and thinness to you?

Don't care as long as it fits in a bag.

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A. 

N/A

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. 

My main activities will be programming (web, software and hopefully game development) and document editing, and potentially some image editing or gaming. 

If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?

I already have a desktop rig for gaming, so games are just a nice bonus if it doesn't add too much to the price. The heaviest I might play would be FFXIV, settings irrelevant.

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)? 

A good keyboard is a must as I'll be coding most of the time ; a good touchpad too, so I don't have to bring a mouse. As mentioned above, build quality matters. An optical drive is unnecessary as I have an external one, but a good amount of USB ports would be good.

Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.

I will be running Linux on this, most likely Manjaro KDE, so it needs to support it well.

Thanks in advance!"

I dont feel I did anything or learnt anything on it.

So I returned to home town. And didnt recieve any clear instructions of what should I do, I was invited in two or three meetings which used to happen per week and thats it.

By the end of the two months I recieved my Internship certificate, which says I worked in ""Mechanical Branch"" of the company. 

Now the problem is, I didnt do anything in this internship, although I have the certificate. I wish to apply for jobs now but what should I tell the recruiters when they will ask about this internship? Should I lie? Should I tell them the truth?

And if I have to lie, can anyone tell me how to fabricate that lie? I know its moral to do this but I am hard working, its just I got stuck in this situation.

I cant hide this internship also as I graduated in 2020 and there is a huge employment gap of one year and all I have is this hollow internship certificate.

I had an amazing internship in high school that made me love the kids, the work, etc. So, I spent my college years studying pedagogy. I just graduated last year so I was excited, even with the variant and mandates (which I am happy to follow and comply with). Due to COVID, I was unable to get certification so I opted to sub this year to see how the schools in my area were without major commitment.

Most of my kids have been wonderful. I absolutely love seeing them come out of a lesson happy. I've had a hard time keeping up with cleaning and discipline, but for the first few days I was able to make it work. The kids can't hear me well under my mask and I'm trying to figure that out if I decide I want to stay a sub. 

I broke down yesterday. It was supposed to be my 5th day, but I left after an hour. I had fallen victim to both my own lack of organization and possibly that new tik tok trend. My phone was either misplaced or taken and moved. I already came into the profession from the beginning with anxiety and depression, so when I noticed that this happened I had a full blown anxiety attack. I just moved to a new state and have to have my in laws drive me to work, so not knowing where my line to them was broke me down. Maybe it was the stress from the whole work week finally breaking me, I don't know.

I really want advice. I've found some other possible jobs to take instead, but I really want to keep trying. I want to prove myself, but my current coping mechanisms are unstable. I sometimes forget to eat during and after work. I don't take enough time for myself. I have a hard time keeping a smile on my face when things go wrong. Am I broken or am I just human?"

I applied to that company as I've thought I was ready. (I know, and it happens to us naman hehe).

To tell you, I haven't applied nor have been to any job interviews that time. I was absorbed when I was an intern. Nung nag-apply ako as intern, hindi ko rin naman matatawag na nagkaroon ng interview since I got referred and got accepted lang, no interviews at all. So parang dumaan lang sa palad but I guess I was really fortunate rin for getting that internship offer :D

Nagtry ako mag-apply sa kilalang company na ito. Dahil nga di ko pa naeexperience mainterview, I thought it was nice opportunity to test and to experience these ""nakakakabang"" series of interviews. Then I got an offer.  Maganda yung unang offer:

1. 65% salary increase;
2. Maganda naman yung benefits, I must tell, halos same lang siya with my current company.

I almost said yes! Kasi naman diba, maganda na yung 65% increase. Con lang sakin ay dapat amenable to shifting scheds.

I politely declined not because of the con, but because I still have attachments. Also, this is the first time na magdecline ako. Siguro attachments sa project ko sa current company kasi I am currently working for this project na I consider as my own (from proposal through development). Ika nga parang baby thesis ko ito hahaha.

Hindi ko na muna sinabi sa boss ko, kasi nahiya ako. I felt sorry sa mga nanginterview sakin, pero ika nga, huwag pumasok sa isang relasyon kung hindi ka pa handa. So I lightly charged that guilt into a lessons learned.

And now, natapos ko na yung project ko na yun. Nakapag-go live na rin sa production (btw, I am a software engineer). That time, I am ready. Then a new company called me. I have gone through a series of interviews *(thanks to the first company I applied for, I already knew what to expect haha)* then got the offer:

1. 156% salary increase;
2. Maganda rin :D Basic benefits are same lang sa old company.
3. FLEXIBLE HOURS

And I got it in very perfect timing! I guess it was really worth the wait.

I want to share this because naging product rin ako ng pagbabasa dito. I really wanted to celebrate this with you. :D

Natutunan ko dito ay:

1. It's okay to always know and test your worth.
2. Let go without guilt and attachments.
3. Good things come at the right time.
4. Explore the good things, have that goal be removed from your bucket list!
5. Always be polite to those people who entertained you from getting that offer.

Thank you r/phcareers, and I am ready for the next chapter! Cheers!"

Undergrad: 8.75 ( Class Rank 7) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from a tier-1 university. ( though my course did cover Advanced and Basic programming, Data Structures and Algo, Computer Architecture and Engineering Math: Including probability and stats). 

I’ve been on the dean’s list and received a merit scholarship for every year of my undergrad study yet. 

GRE: 162V 169Q (331)

Work exp: A 2022 graduate so won’t have any full time experience. But I’ve had a 2 month intern at a FAANG company as an SDE and another 2 months at one of the biggest fintech companies. I still hold an offer for full time employment from FAANG ( Don’t know the relevance of this to my apps though)

Research Papers: Working on 3 papers, 2 of them as first author. Hope to get atleast 2 published but they probably won’t be A* or A level conferences. However one of my papers is with a very renowned medical Center in NYC and I’m working on very meaningful research so I’m hoping that counts for some experience. 

Research Exp: 5 months under a university prof but the research is more aligned to electrical engineering than computer science.

SOP and LORs: Sop will be good but I don’t think my LORs will be exceptional or super strong. I havent been able to interact with my professors due to COVID as much so my LORs will most likely be average.

I enjoyed my previous job a lot, it was really fun, I looked forward to going to work everyday, I got along with everyone and the entire company had a really good energy.

This new job has been a complete nightmare. Don’t get me wrong - amazing pay, benefits, work life balance, everything is really great on paper. But my boss is a complete asshole to me. Every single day, I receive a complaint from her or critique on my work. She’ll message me out of nowhere at least once a week asking to have a private call, and it is always the exact same scenario. “So I’ve been monitoring your work and activity and I’m honestly very disappointed in your performance with the team.” It’s been 8 months now, and have never received a single compliment. She’s so nice and friendly to everyone else, then when it comes to me, she’s a complete asshole. She literally just messaged me right now, out of the blue, saying “I just wanted to let you know that I’m very disappointed and upset with your tonality during stand up today. You should have a brighter and more enthusiastic tone, it doesn’t help you or anyone on the team when you’re speaking with a lower energy.” Like wtf?

Intended Major: Engineering physics or mechanical engineering. 

Identity: High school graduate on gap year, Asian Indian, Male, Lives in Middle East, Middle Class and Good EFC.

SAT: 1550+ (not taken yet.)

GPA: 4.0

Good ECs, Essays and REC letters.

Please note that there are NOT many safeties on my list, as I have safeties in my home country. 

My Criteria:

1. University must have a good rank overall and for engineering. 
2. Prestige is imp to this intl student. Doesn't really matter if I get into a no name school that is really good for engineering. I won't go there anyways.
4. Uni must have very good ROI.
5. I don't care about campus looks at all. (But Dartmouth made me question this belief)
6. Nerdy environment, STEM focused colleges are nice.
7. Ideally a liberal and welcoming environment, this should run in conjunction with the city and state.
8. Good placement, good internship, good co-op, all of the usual stuff.
9. Ideally a very small or no small greek life (prolly due to the movies i have seen). Drinking shouldn't be a huge thing in the dorms. (The reason why I removed UW Madison)

The list, in order of preference:-

Long reaches: MIT, Cornell &amp; UPenn (ivy), GTech, Rice, UCLA, UIUC, UMich, USC, Northwestern

Low reaches: Purdue, UWashington, UCSD

Safeties: UMaryland-College Park, ASU

*Please suggest any other uni that you think is a better fit than the ones I mentioned here.*

---

My Explaination for choosing each university. 

*TL;DR: i like every school the same. Look at my criteria and help me decide please which ones to remove and which one to ED*

1.  MIT (Long Reach)
Dream school. Applying no matter what.
""MIT is the IIT of USA""


2. Ivies- Cornell &amp; UPenn (Long reach)
I really liked Cornell but for the most part these 2 were a bit random. I like both of them, campus feel and environment doesn't matter to me at all. They are both good for engineering and I want to ED between one of them (they might give some aid too). Also I didn't stand chance in other ivies for engineering. Please suggest if you think I have better fit at any other ivy.


3. GTech (Long reach)
Best for engineering imo. But don't know if Georgia is the best state. Atlanta is good tho. Really liked the university tho.


4. Rice (Long Reach)
Not super sure of this as it is located in Texas which isn't the best spot for internationals.


5. UCLA (Long reach)
One guy from my school got in. Lol, I like UCLA too.


6. UIUC (Long Reach)
Very well ranked for engineering. Very good ROI rank. Also know a couple ppl who got in. *But I think there is very little flexibility in changing courses. Is that true?*


7. UMich (Long Reach)
Great for engineering. 


8. USC (Long Reach)
I recognize that USC isn't that well ranked for engineering, I am just applying there as I loved their campus and course structures.


9. UCSD (low reach)
Coz it is the other UC I have chance in and ranks well for engineering. 


10. Purdue (low reach)
One guy I know got in.


11. UWASHINGTON (low reach)
Like it a lot. Feel I will get in.


12. UMD, ASU (safties)
They are the only safties i liked and ranked well. Everyone I know got in.


13. Northwestern (Long reach)
I don't really care about this one too much but it has a really good rank.

Now I’m at a point where I’m too scared to even try new things because I feel like I’m stuck with this career path. I recently moved back into campus and constantly overhear people talking about their ambitions and about how they really like what their studying and it makes me want to crawl into a hole out of shame because how come I haven’t found my passion yet? I also feel so behind with internships and always feel so drained thinking about what I want to do. I developed really bad depression because of constantly worrying about this since I came to ucsd and have been talking to a therapist but yeah I just wanted to rant because going back to school is making my anxiety 10 times worse."

pq7ym3,11,2021-09-17,I'm tired of my job,kovalt96,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pq7ym3/im_tired_of_my_job/,"After scrolling this sub for a while, I wanted to share my experience and thoughts (TL;DR at the end). 

I'm a Biomedical Engineer, and I work at a hospital. I work 6 days a week from 7am to 4pm, but still I'm on call 24/7, luckily in the time that I have been working here I've been called a few times, but still, sometimes I get messages or calls from the staff to my personal phone, because we don't have a work phone. Nevertheless the time off work doesn't feel like enough to feel rested. Regarding vacations, I hate that I basically don't have vacations. The first year you don't have vacations, and after completing one year, they only give you 6 days for al the year, and they increment really slowly, 8 days for two years, and so on, until it reaches certain cap (sadly this is dictated by the country's law). And I don't have holidays, because it's a technical/operator(?) position (but my boss does, because his position is administrative, also he only works 5 days). And in this case they pay double, but I sometimes want the day off, no come here and drain my energy.

Activity wise, mainly I answer calls from the different areas and I go, and solve their equipment related problems. But the problem is, they're usually the most trivial problems (i.e. the device wasn't turned on, it wasn't connected to the electricity, it has a different configuration, etc.), and eventhough I had explained several times, and teach them how to solve this kind of issues, they don't even try to look if the machine is connected, if it doesn't turns on I am immediately called (There are some nurses that go beyond and try to solve this kind of issues, but they are few). 

I hate that in my department there are only two persons: my boss and I, and only one radio, which I only carry. So there are times that everyone needs something, and I get really stressed, because its basically only me. Also, when I started working here, during my lunch break I took the radio with, and oh boy how horrible it is, because usually they need something from me when I'm eating, so I needed to talk to my boss to see if he could have the radio while I'm eating (the thing tha annoys me is that I needed to ask him to do it, because eventhough he saw me struggling with it, he never offered himself to do that). 

Also there are some internal stuff that I don't like, but I leave that for another post.

Salary wise is not that bad, comparing it to other hospitals in the area, I think it's the highest paying I' know, the problem is that it is still not enough, because after all my expenses (housing, gas, food, and random stuff that need to be paid (car problems, paperwork, etc.)) it's barely enough. 

So everyday it is difficult for me to get out of bed and come here, to only drain my energy, because eventhough I sometimes have easy days (in which I pass the time by scrolling social media, Reddit, watching videos, doing homework (eventhough they have a camera pointing at me)), the fact of being here tires me and leaves me sleepy and unmotivated the rest of the day.

You may be wondering, why I don't change jobs, or something similar, and I can tell you that it is because of the job opportunities. Being a Biomedical Engineer where I live, only has three options: hospital, sales, and field service. Sales and field service are two things that I like less than working at a hospital, because they pay less, and they're basically 24/7 jobs. I have been working in hospitals since before I finished my degree, and since then I knew that I didn't want to be in a hospital, but I have been stuck ever since (I worked as an Intern 2 times, one without pay, then after graduating as an engineer, and I basically got fired, and now my positiion is as a technician).

I'm currenlty looking to leave healthcare, and have applied to several engineering jobs, but still nothing. I'm also studying a Masters in Mechatronics to have better opportunities in applying to other positions that (I hope) offers better benefits as well as growth (because in here I can only aspire to become the department's boss, and that's all).

Thanks for reading I just wanted to rant let it out.

TL;DR I hate that there are so many little rest days and vacations, I hate what I do, I hate the job opportunities in my area, I don't like that I get paid barely enough to pay my expenses, and I want to get out this area.

Sorry for the long post, and sorry if it can have some incomplete ideas, I tried my best to express all teh mixture of what I'm thinking and feeling (and I have a lot more that I didn't know how to include). And sorry if I have some grammar mistakes, english is not my native language."

pqahf0,4,2021-09-17,I feel like I chose a major for the wrong reason and I feel like I’ve consigned myself to a career field that I’m not passionate about,Bigbuckrocks,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/pqahf0/i_feel_like_i_chose_a_major_for_the_wrong_reason/,"During college, I was a Computer Science major from start to finish. I chose CS because it makes a lot of money, and I’m used to living a somewhat luxurious lifestyle and want to have as many things as possible, which requires a lot of money. I was never passionate about the field, but I had at least some remote interest in it. Also, apparently girls are attracted to a man who can make a lot of money and have expensive things.

I graduated from college less than 2 months ago. I am currently interning at a company, but only because it was lined up for me by a service that helps adults with disabilities find jobs. I didn’t put myself out there to find this job. My manager and I have a good relationship with each other, so much to the point that my internship has been extended until October. I don’t currently have any jobs lined up in case I don’t get a position here, although I sent in a few applications within the company with an updated resume to show that I have worked for them, but I still haven’t heard back.

I have low confidence when it comes to job searching because of rejections from companies in the past and the fact that my fellow CS majors seemed more knowledgeable and passionate about the subject than I was. If it wasn’t for the fact that this internship was offered to me because of the adult support services, I would have still been working at Wendy’s. Even though it wasn’t glamorous, it was better than the gas station job that I absolutely hated. In fact, I may go back to Wendy’s after my internship because of the low confidence because it’s a very easy job to get.

I feel like maybe my lack of passion for the major I chose has to do with companies rejecting me or ignoring me. Should I go back to school and major in something that I am passionate about (which I don’t even know what I would be passionate about because of my narrow interests), or should I just suck it up and apply for any job that will take me because of my degree, even if I end up hating it, because it will allow me to have nice things? I feel like if I choose a career because I’m passionate about it, I’m going to be sacrificing a lifestyle I want to have. It seems as though we have to have jobs that we hate in order to live lifestyles we want. I’m lucky that I still live with my mother and stepfather, and I’m going to inherit my father and stepmother’s apartment, although that won’t be for a very long time."

**ESSAYS:**

My common app essay's theme revolves around my love for the natural world: how I grew up immersed in the natural environment. I share an account of my experience in the Amazon rainforest, and how I was shocked to see the level of pollution, deforestation, and destruction from illegal miners five years after I had gone there for the first time. I then shift my focus to how the realization of this reality inspired me to act and start the organization I now manage and start my own business promoting sustainable lifestyles. I've also integrated some of my work doing research and my passion for economics/ business to finalize, stating that my aim is to have an interdisciplinary approach to my studies, merging Economics/business and Environmental Science.

APPLYING TO: 

I am currently deciding on whether to apply to Upenn (Wharton), Cornell (Business school), Dartmouth or Duke EARLY DECISION. I would really appreciate if i could get some ratings and perhaps suggestions on where i could fit best? idk.

I kinda went on an application sprint and did as many as I could. I went to all the companies websites I’m interested in and applied to all the positions that were applicable to my field and that I was interested in. However, after, I realized I had sent upwards of 3 and in one case 4 applications to different internship openings at the same location for that company. I’m worried this means the same recruiter may see my application 4 times and either cut me out of annoyance or because they think I just applied to all open positions (not the case, I am very interested in the positions I selected). So … TLDR: Did I screw my chances of getting an internship by applying to too many openings?"

I'm undiagnosed cause the thought of going to a therapist/ counselor is frightening. I'm about as close and you can get to being a shut in without  completely removing yourself from society .I'm able to go to the store and step outside the house to get the mail but that's about it. I talk to my friends and family on the phone on the daily and play like I'm normal. think I've always been socially anxious but it didn't get bad until I was about 12. It was the start of 7 the grade and I had moved away from hometown. I faced relentless bullying for my skin tone , my unwillingness to go to a barber( I'm dark skinned and went to an all black school) , and my inability to really socialize. It got so bad that I believe I devoped selective mutism and just went to school and just didn't talk until I got home. I was ridiculed by classmates and teachers.things got better when I moved away at 15 made friends and was able to be social and build my confidence and got a full ride to college.i found people who accepted my quirks and constant face rubbing when in social situations. i did really well socially and really was able to be more outgoing (hold down a job , go to the gym , attend parties) I ended up in a very problematic relationship when I was about  19 and half she challenged me constantly ( in a bad ways) and embarrassed me constantly. She was terrible with money and overly aggressive consistently. I ended the relationship  4 months ago. I went to silicon valley for internship but regrettably  didn't get a full time job over when I was 22  I had to return to my college town which was embarrassing .My anxiety has spiraled out of control over the last 2 years , I can't drive a car and freak out in job interviews. I flip out in most socal situations when I'm alone .when I go to the store I don't speak to the cashier or go to self checkout I spend all day at home and feel deeply ashamed about how far I've fallen. I have a low paying remote job with 0 human interaction even though I have degree I just want to get better .I was only able to post this because I've been drinking tonight. I wanna escape this hell and panic. My journey with social anxiety disorder has been up down and I want to get better and reclaim my life and leave my state. Im just not sure how to overcome the driving anxiety and my social anxiety .Any help/ advice or stories of overcoming would be appreciated

pqiueo,1,2021-09-18,International student applying to US college (need help),danraha,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/pqiueo/international_student_applying_to_us_college_need/,"Hey guys, I’m a student who graduated from a Singapore polytechnic w a banking and finance diploma (it’s p much the high school equivalent but more specialised; u can take A levels or dip after O’s). I’m currently fulfilling my military obligations and plan on applying to a liberal arts college as I kinda like that curriculum.

After talking to some college admission officers, I found out many schools (excl Ivy) don’t really know or understand what the poly curriculum is like and asked me to take SATs and APs on top of my poly diploma (though optional) to help them better gauge my education level with the rest of the applicants however, I just found out from the local test centre that apparently AP exams are only meant for students whose birthday falls after 1 may 2001. (Although after doing some research there’s no such rule so I’m not sure why this birthday rule exists? Feel free to link anything below which says otherwise as I’ve tried finding stuff)

Anyway, my questions are: 

1) any possible standardised test I can take on top of SAT? (I heard SAT subject test are cancelled sooo yea..)

2) any tips on applying to LAC with international credentials?

3) with my given stats and ECs below anyone know a rough range of schools to apply to? (Not limited to LACs tho, just wondering where I stand against US HS grads)

WRT stats/ECs 

Stats: (I think it’s my real weak point) 
3.1/4.0 GPA (Mainly B’s and A’s but an occasional C/D) as I had a lot of mental health struggles and later found out I had ADHD (after I enlisted) which made me realise that’s why I couldn’t stay focused during exam periods or project submission

ECs (my strong point Ig):
- I have a tech startup with abt 10-20k in funding which works with multiple retail stores in Singapore with plans to continue expanding rapidly once I get stuff down
- part of a Kickstarter project which helps mental health awareness conversations in south east Asia
- founded another startup which was basically a robinhood in Sg (way before other competitors came into SG) but i managed to win a national competition only to realise I was underage… and ultimately gave up bc lack of funding and technical skills  
- winner of a massive insuretech competition and pitched at Sg Fintech festival (largest conference in Southeast Asia) rejected a funding offer as I was still schooling and had military service 
- worked with multiple fintech startups during my poly years (overseas remittance, loans to SMEs to name a few) 
- intern with a prestigious private bank and implemented a lot of solutions which helped process admin workload
- investment club exco (idk what high school kids call it? I think it’s like board member?) 
- ex National Development team for golf
- Varsity top 5 natl tracker 


Anyway, I rly wanted to take these standardised testing a as it was my second chance to prove I can get the grades now that I have my meds and therapy training to plan my stuff so if anyone has any advice please feel free to lmk :) 

* I was rejected by local universities prob bc of my grades and I doubt I’ll enter it Soo yea…

**Ik my grades are p nasty but I’m q confident I can do well in SAT and APs if given a chance as I’ve seen and tried the tests and it’s p similar to what I took for O levels! :)

*** I have a friend who told me I could write random hobbies like bouldering or Paddleboarding or football in my college apps - is that true? Sorry, bc in my local universities we’re only told to write things that are like official competitions or some sort…

EDIT: thanks for reaching out, for those wondering why not apply to Yale NUS Singapore, it’s bc it got merged w NUS! HAHA that was my original plan hence never really cared to take all the other test earlier on…"
pqj0to,146,2021-09-18,My SWE internship experience at Microsoft (Final Round),dolnuea,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/pqj0to/my_swe_internship_experience_at_microsoft_final/,"I had my worst interview ever, and it was at Microsoft. 

It was my first whiteboard interview as well. I was so excited, I've grinded leetcode quesitons everyday until the interview, I've been very stressed and anxious and extremely overwhelmed but I wanted to get an internship offer at Microsoft. The day of my interview came. I was fully prepared. Even though I applied for an internship, I had 4 rounds in my email. I joined the kickoff meeting and saw all other candidates. In the end of the kickoff, 2 girls spoke out and said that they applied for internship but got 4 rounds. The university relations team said it must be a mistake and they were supposed to have only 2 rounds and immediately fixed it for them. I spoke out as well after those girls and told them I also have 4 rounds, but university relations team didn't listen to me, dismissed me to my interviews telling me it depends on my team and didn't help me. Since I was interviewing with Microsoft for the first time, I didn't know much about their interviews either and went along with what they said.

I went to my interview by clicking on the link below in the email, and waited for my interviewer to come. They are using Microsoft teams. I was in ""when the meeting starts, someone will let you in"" screen. It's been 6 minutes and no one came. I started feeling weird about it and started playing with the link, rejoining it etc. Then it's been 8 minutes. I really started getting worried and emailed my recruiter about the problem. She thought the problem was from my end and told me to try rejoining or dialing in. I copy pasted their high lighted number but it gave an error for the phone number. I told her it doesn't work then she sent me a new link. I joined that link and waited for another 5 minutes. More than 20 minutes already passed... Interviews are 45 minutes and I lost half of the time. I finally saw my interviewer and he was also annoyed with it as well. We were both very frustrated and annoyed. Anyways.. the interview went well, with 1 behavioral and 1 coding question and I solved the question but I was rushed very badly and I couldn't even ask him any questions after the interview, and didn't get to have break before my next interview too (There are 15 minute break between each round) .

I went to my next interview, and for that I only waited for 5 minutes. That went normal and ended normally as well. I took a break and went to my 3rd interview as mentioned in my email. I waited and waited... but no one came. It became 20 minutes again.. I was really pissed off and found this ridiculous. I emailed my recruiter saying that the link is not working again. Then she replied me with "" O sorry you only have 2 rounds today, 3rd and 4th rounds shouldn't have been in your email. Sorry for the confusion. "" They didn't even tell me that my schedule changed too.

I always thought Microsoft was such a great company and looked forward to it but this was the most stressful, disorganized interview ever. This experience ruined my image on Microsoft.

A lot of youtubers and articles I read mention them having strong LinkedIn profiles with thousands of connections and several thousand dollars raised through businesses that they started at 14/15- tf!? This brings me to my point, do these users on reddit and youtubers inflate their EC's and stuff? It's extremely intimidating, however, I still have time and I'd only start a LinkedIn if it really truly makes a difference, note that I have A LOT on my plate already and I'm not actively looking for opportunities and internships right now. Is it still worth the time and effort to build a strong LinkedIn profile and do the admissions officers take the time to go and check those profiles? considering my major as well since I get that it may be more important to have connections in a business type setting."

The master's degree is free in my country, so it doesn't cost me anything to get it (besides busting my ass for two years).

BUT, I just got a job (more like a summer internship) in a unicorn company. That comes with all the benefits you'd expect. The best equipment, free lunches, masaages, amazing team buildings, great mentourship and so on. I am thoroughy enjoying myself and they're very impressed by my work ethic and my experience. My boss asked me to actually get emplyed there because I'm doing so well. I declined, saying that I'll pursue my masters degree. They said that I could work as much or little as I wanted during my masters, but it would not count as being employed, but continue only this internship status.

The problem here is that they're ""fine"" with with me working 20 hours per week, but I believe they are not thrilled. I will also not get any stock options in this time, and I am quite sure that the company will IPO within the next year to year and a half, which completely eliminates that. 

The thing is that I don't think I want to get my master's. I feel like I should get it, but I am not too thrilled. The thing is also that this is a unique opportunity because this is not silicon valley, it's a small country in eastern Europe and companies like this one don't just pop up every year. 

I don't know how to figure out what to do. I don't know what extra benefits will masters degree bring me or really how to quantify it. I know a few people that went back to school after a few years of working to get their masters just because they couldn't advance into positions without it. But I also know that I will get a sizable chunk of cash which I will invest and grow over time if I actually get emplyed here. I want to get into product management within at most 10 years."

- I have a tech startup with abt 10-20k in funding which works with multiple retail stores in Singapore with plans to continue expanding rapidly once I get stuff down

- part of a Kickstarter project which helps mental health awareness conversations in south east Asia

- founded another startup which was basically a robinhood in Sg (way before other competitors came into SG) but i managed to win a national competition only to realise I was underage… and ultimately gave up bc lack of funding and technical skills  

- winner of a p big insuretech competition and pitched at Sg Fintech festival (largest conference in Southeast Asia) rejected a funding offer as I was still schooling and had military service

- internship with a prestigious private bank (77bil mkt cap) and implemented a lot of tech solutions which helped process admin workload

- interned with several surgeons and general practitioners to see if I could fit a solution in healthcare tech but did not do anything 

- helped seek funding and managed my brother’s finances within his film company since the star of this year (revenue of about 400 thousand so far; p big for a small country)

Recently just received my return offer to work part time during school for about 28 hours per week. At the company, anyone working &gt;25 hours per week gets benefits. 

That’s great, but I was given an exploding offer with the exact same pay as my internship which was really insulting (80k/yr in Bay Area) since it would be me converting from intern to software engineer 1, I had less than 24 hours to accept- was given an offer letter at 4pm and it was to be filled by end of day, but I asked for an extension so I could think about it over the weekend which they gave me (good sign that I am able to negotiate?)

I’ve interned here for 3 months now, and have 1 yoe in the form of internships.

Currently, we have 1 senior front end engineer, our mid level front end engineer switched to PM and they’re having a hard time filling his role.

So basically it would be me and the senior front end engineer- the thing is, the company is working on a CMS and performance optimization project, but the mid level front end engineer was the one who mentored me as an intern so training another intern/entry level swe is really hard since he’s moved to a PM role and I’m not sure the senior swe wants to mentor anyone.

So it seems I’m in a really good place for negotiating, but how would I approach HR about this?

TLDR; 1 yoe + going to be 1 of 2 front end engineers, how to negotiate same pay return offer?"

pqsf1d,2,2021-09-18,Advice for a non cs fresh graduate keen on software engineering,Miikkiizzz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pqsf1d/advice_for_a_non_cs_fresh_graduate_keen_on/,"Hey everyone,

I'm a recent graduate from a chemical engineering (26 yrs old). However, like most students, I did not truly have a passion for my current field and only took what was offered to me at the moment. At the time, it was the ""safer"" option than to try and do something else.

Currently, I have an internship as a process engineer for a rather well established MNC . Unfortunately, after a month of working there, I realised this isn't something I look forward to. The hours there can be long (shift work, etc) and especially with the current pandemic I don't want to risk the exposure to my family members. I did some research on remote working jobs and being a software engineer was one of those options.

My coding history: Basic C programming

At the moment, I have taught myself the basics of Python from this particular tutorial here:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&amp;ab\_channel=freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&amp;ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

It wasn't particularly difficult, although learning things such as classes and objects were a tad more challenging. I found it very interesting and rewarding but obviously I am simply skimming just the very basics of programming.

Question 1: The benefits of remote working are very attractive to me. Should I consider a career change solely for this benefit? Are there any successful career changes ? (Other than those I see on YT)

Question 2: I've looked up some possible ways to learn programming without a CS degree. Bootcamp or self-learn. I am considering using freecodeCamp website to learn all the 11 \* 300 hours courses there. How useful and what other free resources are there besides YT and freecodeCamp?

Question 3: Although this is too early to tell, I understand many employers would want to see my programming skills/projects that I have, especially for someone that is self-taught. How does one get involved in a project?

Lastly, what are your experiences working as a software engineer? What should I be prepared for? Any tips?"

Recently I got selected into a diversity program at an ivy league uni meant to prepare students from Phd the application process, it involves me being paired up with a current grad student from the department who will mentor me until April, when I will supposedly be deciding where to go, though I am over the moon grateful to be involved, I don't know if I'll ever see myself fitting in western academia.

As a a part of the mentorship program, the program coordinators were really kind to share the SoPs of current grad students, and it would be an understatement to say that I was blown away, I'm from the third world so reading those SoPs it seemed like these people were living on some other planet, the kind of things they've done, the experiences they've had, the people they've worked with, I don't think I'll ever be able to compete with them, I'm in Ecology so most people have mentioned being around nature reserves all their lives and things like going to Africa in high school for biodiversity surveys. On the other hand I didn't even know there was something like Ecology at that age, I've never had any of these experience, I just came across a theoretical ecology paper one day in university and that was it for me, I grew up in a small industrial town and hadn't even been to a proper forest before my first field internship.

At the same time I was able to accumulate decent amount of experience and publications just through contacting enough people in Europe for internships, though the work was not exactly related to what I was primarily interested in, I had to take those opportunities because the other option was sitting duck at home. I've been contacting PIs in America since the last month for Phd positions and have somehow been receiving positive responses, with them not really caring about my previous work being slightly detached from what I'm currently interested in and what they're doing, I don't know how I am in a position to say this but I have multiple Professors at amazing places like UCLA and Stanford who are somehow really really interested in their own words, in the questions I approached them with and have told me they'll do everything in their power to get me into the program.

Since reading those SoPs I'm confused about my position, even if I do end up making the jump from a poor nobody from a poor country to a grad student at an elite university, will I ever fit in with the rest of the people there who come from places and experiences which seem completely alien to my imagination? Would I be just another diversity hire who would struggle to find their place? I did use to think about the fact that I'll never be able to compete with people coming from immense privilege, but today for the first time I was pure intimidated. Is academia for people like me?"

Looking for some advice.,Impressive_Check4396,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/pqvsbg/currently_a_senior_in_college_looking_for_some/,"Hi everyone, I apologize in advance for the lengthy post, I will try to be as brief as I can.

As the title says, I am currently in my last year of college studying Computer Information Systems and it is starting to sink in that I am coming up on some big decisions in the very near future in terms of my career. Over the summer I was fortunate enough to find an internship at one of the top three software companies and they have been wonderful enough to keep me aboard during the school year at very flexible hours. My boss is great and the company is great but the only problem is that I don't really enjoy the job. I find it very hard to get motivated to get started for work and I think it is now flowing into how I perform at school. I think something I may be realizing is that I am studying the wrong field or maybe I am just doing the wrong job. In summary, I have concluded my current options(maybe there's more I haven't thought of):

1. Stay in school until May and work for my current company
2. Pause school now and start working full time for my current company: Someone on my team is leaving and my boss has made it very clear that I would get the job if it wasn't for school. I may not have this position later if I take option 1.
3. Stay in school and pursue a second business degree: I recently learned of this option from my advisor and it would cost me nearly nothing(on a full-ride throughout all of college) and would take just another semester or so. I am thinking supply chain management but would love to hear any recommendations!
4. Start applying for other full-time positions that start after I graduate with my CIS degree

I know this may all come off as confusing but I am confused myself. I don't really know how to find my passion while finding a good job. The one thing I do know is that I do not like programming(although I can do it). I seem to like being around the tech industry but being more on the people/management/hands-on things.

I'm sure I'm forgetting some important info but I really want to thank anyone who shares their thoughts and experiences.. it means a lot to hear from someone who has been down this road already."

Do you guys have any tips to build a compelling cv for applying as a machine learning intern? I'm mostly confused about what level should my cv be, how good should I be at machine learning to have a good chance of getting selected?

How do I deal with the soul-crushing toxicity of getting into ""entry-level jobs""? My portfolio already contains several relevant and accomplished projects, but it seems that every employer is looking for someone with 2+ years of work in the industry (so not entry-level at all.) and who can solve any particular problems in computing that usually don't even reflect the work done in the position even a little bit, let alone needing to do it on the spot (invert a binary tree, etc. things that I don't particularly struggle with but are just not valid identifiers of skill for the job). I am about to graduate with a BS in December from an esteemed STEM-centric university and have as many relevant courses as possible for a student in my position, as well as a number of extracurricular groups and contributions to open source projects, and a GPA of well over 3.0, which seems to generally be the standard. I've worked with our career guidance staff several times to refine my resume and other documents, and have a website portfolio and github link included with all my projects. I have done several mock interviews, and several real ones as well to practice, and I think I'm a fairly good communicator. Even still, I have yet to make a single full breakthrough with any companies, even the ones that claim to be accepting of new/inexperienced entry-level hires or interns. Career fair just happened, and I met with a dozen employers, but I still feel yet again that none have really gone anywhere. The real question that I think I'm asking is: How do I gain experience in the workforce when  'starter-level' jobs require years of experience that I would need to get from a starter-level job that requires years of experience that I would need to get from a starter-level job that..... What can I do?"
pqxrod,2,2021-09-18,Mistake on resume,iZaxer,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/pqxrod/mistake_on_resume/,"So I’m applying for internships right now and made the worst mistake at probably my best chance for an offer down the line. I had the chance to talk with an alum from my school that works in the team I’m looking to join, and it went much better than I could’ve expected. During the call they asked for my resume to forward on to their recruiter, as well as their manager (also an alum). It seemed like I would be in a great place heading into the application process. 

The issue, though, is that I decided to make some last minute changes to tailor it to the role (I hadn’t decided on applying yet) and afterward I realized I made the classic unbelievably stupid mistake of misspelling one of the changes in my rush. Even worse, it was in the skills line on the bottom of my resume, so it wasn’t even hidden in a block of text.

I’m really freaked out about throwing away my best shot at a fantastic role, and to reflect poorly on the alum that was so helpful in going to bat for me. Normally I’d just hope the person reviewing doesn’t spend much time on the resume details, but the personal forward makes me think they’d catch the typo for sure. I feel so stupid and just don’t know how to explain to the alum in a way that doesn’t dig an even deeper hole. 

Would sending an email, just with the corrected resume and a generic message about making a few updates in case they hadn’t already forwarded it, be a red flag at this point a couple of days after? Is it better to just address the mistake outright? Or should I just leave it alone for now and submit the new file with my official submission. I know this is a really stupid situation I put myself in, but I really do appreciate any help."

pqytwc,44,2021-09-18,Can anyone else relate to feeling like they're on a national 'do not hire' list?,BjornReborn,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pqytwc/can_anyone_else_relate_to_feeling_like_theyre_on/,"I'm fed up with everything. I can't do it anymore. I'm tired. I'm stressed out about not being able to find a job. I don't want to work at soulless corporations like Target - I'd rather be broke and homeless than be employed to places similar to Target.

I'm not getting as much interviews as I should and I have done everything. I've posted on r/resumes many times. I've used JobScan for my applications. I can't fucking get anything except scams. It's at the point now where if someone is interested in me, I assume they're a scam or data farmer... It feels like no legitimate places will touch me.

I apply to many jobs. At least 15-20/per day. Sometimes up to 30-40 roles. I tailor applications to the posting to where I'm 90% sure I'll at least get a first round interview. My resume is often viewed, then downloaded, then I'll get a notification that my LinkedIn profile has been viewed ""x"" number of times and either I will or I won't get offered an interview.

I had a really awkward interview for some reason for a job I really wanted with a company I applied to before this time a year ago before the weekend.  I'd say normally most of my interviews have good give and take when I do get them... but for this one I could definitely feel the awkwardness and it seemed like the HR manager couldn't wait to get off the video chat/end the call. It was barely 13 minutes - quickest interview of my life. Most of the time my interviews are scheduled for 20 and last for 30 minutes or longer. I knew in my gut that I didn't get the position/make it to the second round, but it still hurt when the rejection email came in.

I reach out to people via LinkedIn to learn more about entry level roles and possible internships that I believe are in my field and then I get hit with the line of ""you don't really have any experience for this role"" or ""this internship isn't what you majored in""... It's a marketing and communications internship. I MAJORED IN THAT FIELD. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO MAJOR IN? PHYSICS?

In my last position I went through a staffing agency and was threatened by a recruiter that they would make me un-hireable across town when I was quitting my placement. Long story short, I was put in a position that I asked specifically to NOT be placed in and wasn't given any info about it till the day of and rather than quitting on the spot, I gave it some time to see if I could do it, but I couldn't... Any chance they really did make me unhireable?

I feel like I'm done and I don't know what to do. I have a college degree. I have experience in the programs they ask for. I want an internship in my field that will lead to long term placement in my career but I'm constantly told that I'm not the ""right"" candidate or that the 'role' isn't right for me when it's exactly what I majored in to do.

I'm at the end of my rope. I don't know what else to do. If I don't get an offer or any interest soon...."
pqzdf0,3,2021-09-18,DevOps Technical Interview (Python),eldnalp,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/pqzdf0/devops_technical_interview_python/,"Hello Everyone, 

Let me just start off with some context. I'm a third year undergrad student studying Information Systems and pursuing a Finance minor. I will be graduating in three months (Dec 2021). At this point in time, I've interned as a DevSecOps Engineer for a DoD contractor and a Cloud Engineer Intern for a small consulting startup. I have an AWS Solutions Architect Associate cert as well as a Cloud Practitioner cert.

I've spent the last few weeks pumping out applications in hopes to beat my return offer from my previous internship and allow me to live somewhere more suitable to my likings. At this point, I've been interviewing with one company that I find really fascinating. Job Title: Devops Engineering (For Upcoming University Graduate).

My first interview was more of a screening interview with a recruiter and she moved me on to the second interview which was considered the technical interview. I met with an engineering manager and he asked me some fairly complex AWS scenarios but nothing too bad. Mostly going over my resume and asking me questions about it. He seemed to like me a lot and told me I would be moving onto the final stage. He said it was going to compose of 4, 45 minute interviews one-on-one style with a devops or software engineer on the team. An hour later, the first recruiter called me back for scheduling purposes and told me that the third stage was going to involve coding. I asked her about the style of the interview questions and she said it was going to be geared towards python and she said something like ""I think there are going to be algorithm questions as well"" but again she's only the recruiter and I do not know how much of the interview process she's involved with.

My python skills are incredibly mediocre at best as Information Systems does is not Computer Science. I have taken an Object Oriented Programming course in the past but it seemed to be geared more towards business applications. My on the job coding experience has mainly been boto3 scripting/shell scripting/aws cli/Dockerfiles/Buildspec/Appspec etc.

I have done maybe 5 leetcode questions in my life as I focus more on cloud infrastructure than programming. As an aspiring devops engineer, should I know a handful of algorithms and how to do leetcode? I feel as if my degree has let me down in terms of knowing how to program. Does anyone have any advice on how I should prepare for this technical interview? I have about 4 days to prepare. 

Thanks!"
pqzp1m,114,2021-09-18,"Had my first professional interview for an internship position yesterday, where I would be doing EXACTLY what I want to do",turkishjedi21,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/pqzp1m/had_my_first_professional_interview_for_an/,"I'll start where I discovered what I want to do professionally.  For context, I'm currently a junior majoring in Computer Engineering.

End of spring semester last year. My digital logic 2 class had a final project where we had to develop an elevator control system on an FPGA (field programmable gate array). I was already very interested in the class, and it was taught by my favorite teacher (thank you, Vaidy).

I had an FPGA that my brother bought for my birthday a year ago. It was very useful for working on the labs for this class where we used FPGAs. Because of this, I ended up spending 60 hours, total (yes I kept track lol)  working on it. I didn't finish the project

If I recall correctly, only one student in my class finished the project. As such, the grade for the project was curved heavily, so that wasn't a problem.

Once it was over, I ended up finishing the project early summer. Was very proud of myself for doing that, and I really enjoyed continuing work on it. But, this wasn't the peak of my self pride.

Took a couple gen ed classes for a month, then returned to FPGA stuff. Taught myself how to build a UART receiver (thanks nandland). Then built a UART transmitter. Then added a FIFO to the design. Towards the end of the summer, I worked on interfacing the FPGA with an accelerometer, and displaying the acceleration values. I just finished it a couple weeks ago. The next week, I added a part that kind of tied it all together. I ended up making it transmit data over UART to my pc where I plotted the acceleration data in MATLAB.

I learned so much over the summer. So fucking much, and I have only further solidified my interest in digital design/ RTL design / FPGA design. Its so damn cool to me.

I put the project on my resume, and applied to \~50 RTL design internships. Every single one  I could find in America this early on.

This past monday, maybe 4 days after I applied to one of them, I got an email with some technical screening questions. Answered them, and heard back 2 days later with an interview request. I was so happy. It was for a company that builds satellites meant to provide internet access to rural areas, where it wouldn't make sense to lay down physical lines. On paper, it sounds like work that I could see myself doing full time in the future.

Just yesterday I had the interview. I should mention I'm a very socially anxious guy (made a lot of progress recently with it, but I still have it. Not debilitating or anything). I mention this because despite it, I wasn't nervous going into the interview. A little bit, yeah, but I'm more nervous about a first date with a girl than I was for this.

I still think about that fact: I was more nervous about first dates than I was about an internship interview that would have a massive impact on my future career. The fuck?

Anyway I think the interview went very well. I was asked 2 main RTL design problems, and about my major project I just finished. With the questions, despite them taking me a while to come to the final answer both times (which seemed correct), I'm very happy with the knowledge I displayed while discussing them.

I had never before discussed RTL design with anyone who was even vaguely familiar with it. Talking to someone who was doing it full time was, on its own, a very fun and interesting experience. In addition, I showed myself how much I really knew. It was crazy. I couldn't even implement a finite state machine back in May, and here I was, talking to a full time FPGA engineer about all the different steps I'd take to debug a faulty design, comparing the RTL schematics of the design between synthesis and implementation, describing the timing constraints I implemented to get the accelerometer to interface correctly with the FPGA, etc.

It also felt amazing to tell this guy I did the project on my own. He asked ""So this project, this was a group project?""

""No, I did it all myself""

and at another point,

""Did you use an IP to implement your SPI master?""

""No, I wrote it myself""

God that felt great.

Even if I don't hear back from them, it was a great experience, and I'm confident I'll have an internship this summer once more FPGA related internships are posted.  That being said, I expect to hear back. I'm certain I showed my passion very clearly, the guy said he got the impression I was a self-starter, and he really seemed to be having a good time as well (especially when I asked him questions in the end). He was a very cool guy.

It was also very good to hear that because of the size of their team, interns get a lot of responsibility, and their work is often directly implemented on their satellites. Assuming i can keep up, this sounds like an incredibly valuable experience 

Anyway, I just wanted to share my experience up until this point. Hopefully I do hear back for a second interview next week"

pr1ikx,28,2021-09-19,Haunted by this Number.,BillMagicguy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pr1ikx/haunted_by_this_number/,"I'm not sure how to go about this? It's only been a few weeks but it's driving me crazy. I'm seeing numbers in my sleep, numbers that don't make sense. I've reviewed the math, over and over, ran through countless simulations. I'm pretty sure I broke a few laws trying to figure this out. Still, it continues to mock me, sitting smugly on that piece of paper that I stole from the lab. 
I'm writing this because I think I'm in danger, they're onto me and they've been watching me for a few days now. This is my story so that the truth can get out. bear with me, I'm not much of a storyteller but I'll try my best. 

Let me start at the beginning. So everyone remembers a few months ago when we got our first real look at photos of black holes right? It was pretty big news at the time, at least on the news sites I visit. Pretty much a lot of radio telescopes working together in order to get a solid picture of something so far away that our minds can barely process the distance. Well I was pretty busy during that time.. You see, I work at a lab that measures radio waves from space. 

Now I know what you're thinking, ""radio waves from space, this is some weird thing about UFOs and extraterrestrials right?"" Well, no. Plenty of stuff in space emits radio waves and we regularly use what's known as ""radio telescopes"" to measure them. These measurements can tell us all sorts of information on an object's size, composition, what direction it's moving, etc. It's actually pretty fascinating. What we do is we have radio telescopes in strategic areas around the world which we can use to measure these waves and factor in the rotation of the earth and which telescope received the wave to get an accurate measurement. It's a bit more complex than that but you get the idea.

 Anyway I worked at one of these labs as an intern during the time that the telescopes were being used to measure the frequency of this black hole M87. It was pretty tough work, long days and nights of staring at data on a screen trying to make sense of it and factor it together to get a complete picture. 

Yeah, working with space agencies sounds awesome but it can be boring as shit sometimes.

Anyway I was just about to finish my shift when my computer alerted me to an email from my supervisor saying I got an error on my last entry and it needed to be redone. ""Just great,"" I thought. There went my night. This means another hour or two of going through the data line by line to find the one number I copied incorrectly. I was tired and frustrated but this was nothing new. So I relaunched the program and went back to my last entry. 

Well I sat at that desk for half an hour going through the data line by line and comparing results but it matched perfectly. ""That's weird,"" I thought. Why would the computer tell me there was an error in my result when there wasn't. I went through it again, and once more after that to make sure. Sure enough I didn't find any errors in my data entry. 

""Well maybe it's a problem with the computer,"" I thought. Maybe somehow the program was factoring these numbers together wrong. I couldn't leave with this error unresolved so I had to do it by hand. This was going to take forever.

It was around about hour 2 that I finished and noticed something was off. I had redone the math twice by now but the result just didn't make any sense. I get what the computer meant, There was just no way that the result was correct. 

Let me clarify, I like math. It makes sense and had defined rules that make it work. This data threw that all on its head. It's not that the number was any larger or smaller than normal, it's not that the data was any different than normal. It's that the result just didn't make sense. This was a number that shouldn't be (No I'm not going to write it down, not after what I know now). The more I redid the equations the less sense they made, it's like the numbers had a mind of their own and kept trying to lead me to this result. 

I got frustrated and angry. Most of the team I worked with had already gone home several hours ago and I was nearing 22 hours without sleep. So I shot off an email for my supervisor for when she comes in the next day explaining the situation, I was likely just overtired and needed sleep. I'll check it again in the morning. 

The next day I woke up to a few missed calls from my supervisor. She sounded worried and asked if I could come in as soon as possible. I called her back and left a message saying that I'd be in and to just give me an hour or so to get ready. 

When I got to the lab I was surprised to find there were several men and women in suits talking with my supervisor. Another man in a similar suit was sitting at my desk going through my computer. When I walked in I saw one of them point to me and a man walked over and asked me to come with him. 

I was worried, we have some contracts with the government and pretty strict reporting that needs to get done. Leaving unfinished work is highly frowned on. The man led me into an empty office and started asking me questions. He wanted to know my name, what I did at the lab, how long I've worked there, etc. I tried to answer as best as I could but my heart was pounding and I probably showed it as I  stumbled my way through his questions. He then asked me about the entry I completed last night, he wanted to know why the data was incorrect. 

I tried to explain to him that according to my math and the computer, it wasn't incorrect. The numbers just didn't add up. I don't remember a lot of what he asked me after that. I must've been pretty nervous as I really don't have a good memory of it, just that I felt that some of the questions were pretty strange. 

Anyway when they were done questioning my team they left but told us that they would have to confiscate my computer to look for evidence of having been hacked. I know that was a Bullshit excuse though, the computer I worked with was on a closed network. Anyone hacking it would need to have physically accessed my computer. 

This was getting weird, my supervisor sent me home until this mess got straightened out. I felt guilty, our team was going to be behind due to a mistake I made. I had to make this right somehow and I still wanted to figure this problem out so I took the papers I had written my math by hand on yesterday and went home thinking I'd solve it and no longer be holding the rest of the team up.

That afternoon I sat at my desk at home looking over my work, mostly just staring at that number. Why didn't it make sense? What was weird about it? 

The math just didn't add up, no matter what I did, no matter how I formatted or manipulated the data it always came out to that same number. The more I calculated the more the numbers began to betray me. It was like they were hiding something from me, leading me this way and that in the wrong direction. I was obsessed with figuring this out. I barely ate or slept and when I did my dreams were haunted by that number, staring at me, mocking me, almost threatening me. 

What was wrong? This was crazy, I needed answers. 

Our lab has a supercomputer, very expensive to run but sometimes we need to use it to calculate results from thousands of data entries very quickly. I did something very illegal and snuck into the lab after hours. I worked late hours and it wasn't too weird to see me using my id to enter the building late at night. Technically I didn't have access to the computer but my supervisor gave me her password one day so I could run something for her.

It took a while but I entered in the data into the computer and ran the software to calculate it. It took far longer than it should have to come up with a result. Two hours in fact. I was just looking at the result on the screen (that same damn number) when the smoke alarm started going off. Looking back into the room I could see that part of the computer was smoking. I ran to grab the fire extinguisher and by the time I got back the smoke had turned into a sizable fire. The sprinkler system turned on and I ran out of the building. 

They still say it was vandlism, some high school prank give awry. I know they know the truth too. I see him outside my window, a man in a dark suit, sitting in his car watching my house. This is the third night he's been there. Still no word from my supervisor or the rest of my team, all my texts and calls have gone unanswered. 

I think I stumbled on something big here, something to do with that damn number. I don't know what it is but it's not normal and I think it's put me and my team in danger. There's something there that we're not supposed to know about, something that someone wants to cover up about this data. The world needs to know, there's something weird about Black Hole M87. I'll keep working on it but I may need to go off the grid for a while."

 I (19F) have been hearing a lot of varying things about future career prospects from a lot of different people. Some have asked me to learn coding, which I've started (I'm learning Python, I know Java and C (need a bit of brushing up though). Our colleges teaches us R in second year). I've heard that I'm supposed to start doing internships, which seems to be a huge commitment as I'm just getting started in college and I'm concerned that a side hustle will affect my GPA. (I want to know if someone is managing both successfully, I aim to be on the top 10 of my batch academically).

 I ideally want to do a Masters in Stat from ISI or Data Science from CMI,but I'll also be sitting for IITJAM and other exams for Masters. I want to take GRE for Masters abroad as well in Statistics but I don't know if it would be expensive or something (Family income around 12LPA and I want to contribute something so I've started looking for opportunities to tutor kids once a week since it'd be less hectic than a 5days per week internship). Another path would be to pursue an MBA.

I want to know if I'm going in the right path. What do I need to study for Masters and GRE? Is it okay if I start early while the course load is comparatively lighter? Do I need to enroll myself somewhere? What other scopes do I have?

I am that college student.

So we had an interview and they said they’re very interested in me, while, the HR guy does not have much knowledge of Information Technology, so he thinks what he expects is not much to which I really disagree regarding that he told me about what I need to do. I think I’d do great if there was any training -there wouldn’t: I’d have to learn all of the stuff myself and it’s from the previous employee’s work and I have no experience in it.

As for myself, I really want to take this job, it’s like a project and I want to put my ability into learning and getting experience, however I don’t want to waste their time/money if I cannot pick up fast enough to make the project work, I’d also feel soooo bad -at some point I thought I should decline their pay and take the job as an unpaid position because I feel I don’t deserve it if I fail.

What should I do in this situation? Should I decline or take it and try to learn it all by myself ? Should I ask them to pay me minimum wage in case I fail?

TL;DR: I’m not qualified and they think I am, plus they don’t have much choice. I feel bad if I fail because there is no training at all, but i really want to take it. Please tell me your opinions, I appreciate straight forward and blunt criticism."
pr4vmg,1,2021-09-19,Help with Next Step in Life,theshek7,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/pr4vmg/help_with_next_step_in_life/,"So I'm currently starting my third year of university studying computer science, and I'm faced with a tough decision. I'm pretty much dead set on entering the startup world right after uni - in terms of my current experience, I was actually running a startup last year (which ended up failing), and I've also completed an internship this summer to get an idea of the workplace. Ironically, that actually ended up further affirming that I'm not really interested in getting much work experience before entering the startup world - I'm very much determined to work relentlessly to become a successful entrepreneur.

The main dilemma is quite associated with the reason why my startup last year failed - I genuinely struggle very much to balance university work with a startup. My degree has a very high workload, and whilst I can maybe run something small it would be, at least in my opinion, impractical to try and launch something significant whilst getting a decent enough grade to get the degree. This is why I really want to start something after the degree ends properly. The only problem is, when I'm out of university, I'm not entirely sure where I'd be able to meet cofounders/people to work with for the startup, and as I wouldn't have the money to live out etc, I would be a burden on my parents until my startup would actually start earning money. Alternatively, I could actually try and do a masters, but spend most of my time during the masters focusing on networking + creating a startup as I'm sure I'd be able to meet like-minded people. To summarise, here are the options I'm thinking of:

&amp;#x200B;

* Finish bachelor's degree (after the commencing year) and then leave uni to pursue startup, although networking with like-minded people may prove to be very difficult + I'll miss out on all the uni resources regarding entrepreneurship and funding, and may have to be a burden on my parents for a while
* Do a 4th year masters in computer science as well, having a much larger focus on starting a startup and networking - this may be very difficult though as the workload will again be extremely high, so may not be ideal
* Do a masters in business/entrepreneurship - I feel that I could learn a lot about the business aspects of startups from this and gain a lot of valuable knowledge that could be taken in when starting a startup, plus I'm bound to meet like-minded people this way. Plus, I think the masters would be much easier than a masters in CS and so I'd find it much easier to actually start the startup whilst in education. However, I am aware that these masters degrees are often not very useful, and I know that I'd probably be completely fine just entering the startup world whilst gleaning knowledge from free resources and raw experience.

So what do you guys think? I understand that I'm very much a newbie when it comes to all of this so I apologise in advance 😅, but any help would be hugely appreciated."

Again for activities I will mention about debate participation and working for debate club . Ho this should be done ? I went from general secretary to Vice President should I mention both of these ? 

Doing volunteer works for 2 organizations? I was involved with 1 organizations (during HS )for like 3 years until pandemic and other after graduation basically while on gap year . Again should I mention both ?

I did an internship  [unpaid ] as a  content writer and Social media Manager should I mention them together in Internship segment ?

Also to mention I was a content writer and a social media manager (not internships )of two other organizations as well. I am still working for them. I earned some money through my writing work  [freelancing ] basically. My problem is how do I list them actually ? Or should I submit a resume instead.

3. Are they worth it, or I should prefer 2-year programs at other universities like NYU Tandon, NEU, TAMU, UCI, USC?"

No hooks (I have had my own struggles with myself and my stories of coping up with them, writing my essay based on this transition I underwent, from a gloomy suicidal person to wanting to live my life to the fullest!)

17, Male 

No ACT/SAT

Duolingo English Test-155

9th Grade- 80.13%
10th Grade-92%
11th Grade-62% (We were having online classes but the annual exam was declared to be held physically in school premises,on a very short notice of 3 weeks, mostly my fault, I failed to prepare upto the necessary standards)

ECs:

Karate- Classes 9th and 10th, Upper Green Belt, Participated in Kumete, Participated in International Camp, been training for my own self development for more than 11 years. (Kyokushin style)

Recitation- A form of eloquence practised in my area. Learnt Recitation for 11 strong years as well, helped in my transition from an introvert to an extrovert. Did 12-13 recitation shows in my hometown and the neighbouring city all throughout my lifetime. Classes 9th and 10th as well.

Teaching- I have been teaching my cousin and 2 of his friends virtually since Class 9. Even though I have experienced a lot of failure, not being at the top of my class, it is from my failure that I can guide them down the correct path, so they don’t commit the mistakes that I did.

Diploma in Modern Advanced Psychology- Obtained a diploma recently. For the many years that I spent in introversion, I have been observant and curious, trying to understand different mentalities from afar. When I leant about Psychology I was immediately interested in knowing more, more about myself and about others, about how the human mind works, the thought processes, the different philosophies, etc. Class 12.

Internship for 2 weeks at my father’s workplace- (Cannot exactly disclose the kind of job due to privacy concerns, but mostly assisting in copyright infringements). Class 12.

Certificate for Completion of Cryptography and Hashing fundamentals in Python from Udemy. Class 12.

Yoga in Classes 9 and 10.


I would really like to pursue an undergraduate in Computer Science or Psychology. I am not even perhaps 1% of the international “chance me”-s out there, in terms of grades, awards or ECs, but I want to pursue my higher studies from an IVY!

Might sound sarcastic given my stats:

Chance me for Ivies, Amherst College and Stanford. Would appreciate a lot if I am given a list of suitable safeties!

Thank you!

GPA: 3.45 information technology major with a minor in econ at my large state university (US News ranked low 60s) plenty of EC's in undergrad (VP of Greek council/ always working 2-3 jobs/ intern at pharma company in IT/volunteering)

GRE: 167 Verbal Q: 164

I didn't focus that much on school during undergrad,but currently, I'm taking a few classes

\- Spanish Intensive at local community college (pretty conversational,working on fluency, for what it's worth)

\-MIT Micromasters in Finance (thought this would help with showing interest in business)

\-Blockchain course

\-IT/professional certifications (several microsoft, comptia, ITIL, PMP, content marketing)

Work experience- Will be at 5 years work experience since I'm aiming for fall 2023

* Fortune 500 rotational IT Program
* Sales Engineering at a large tech company
* Product marketing at smaller publicly traded tech company (up for promo to senior pmm in the next few months)
* I'm also a personal trainer and sell workout plans, developed an online job board, and have a few blogs (one for general career stuff, one for IT stuff, and one for VC/startup related content)

Additonal EC's: Toastmasters, Volunteer at an Urban Farm, Alumni Board &amp; Mentor at my undergrad uni, freelance writer/resume writer

Diversity: woman, lgbtq, bi-racial

Goal of MBA: Transition into VC, gain broader business knowledge to apply to startups (been absolutely obsessed with everything VC, reading every book, podcasts, newsletters, writing my own investment memos) I know it's hard to break in. As a fall back, I'd at least want to take on start-up leadership post-mba.

Targetting T15 (obviously H/S/W is a dream, may just apply to stanford as a reach) based on cultural fit, was considering kellogg/ haas (bay area is very appealing). Sloan as well since I am doing the micromasters and have a tech background.

In addition to profile review, Any advice on what I can do in the next year to up my chances when I apply in fall 2022? Other programs to consider?"

So having more people use this does benefit me but in return it really is a useful app if you put in the time to enter in the information.

If you would like to keep your identity completely private I suggest signing up with a random email address, the site doesn't ask for your name or anything.  I've set up authentication for the site using a well known third party authentication service (auth0) so anyone can make an account and use the website for free. 

When you first create an account there will be very little information shown and that is because most of the information needs to be entered in the school and scheduling sections first. To start with it is probably best to create a semester in the school section and then create courses, course times, grade weightings and target grades. In the scheduling section you can then set due dates for all of the courses that have been created and they will then all be displayed in order on the dashboard. Once you have created a semester make sure to select the ""current semester"" checkbox after clicking into that semester because this is how the app knows what information to display on the dashboard.

8/5 - Received interview for initial recruiter phone screen

8/27 - Received invite for final interviews. 

9/10 - Completed 2 x 45 min final interviews. Each had a couple of behaviorals and 1 technical question. LC Microsoft explore card is good prep, I got no more than LC med. I got through all of the implementation and analysis during my first interview, and felt really good about it. During the second interview, I only drew up a game plan and analyzed my algo, but had back and forth with the interviewer about small improvements until I had written out pseudocode of the optimal solution. Left that second interview feeling okay-ish.

9/17 - Offer extended. The action center portal for interviews changed to ""completed"" under a new job #, offer was received midday"

Really happy about this, of course.

Would  it be a terrible idea to continue studying for a MSc (1 year) after I  get my BSc? Financially it makes 0 sense to do this (tuition fees,  year's worth of salary), but there are a couple of reasons why I'm  considering it:

* Go  to a better university (Oxford/Cambridge, or Ivy League to get my  ticket into the US) to improve my resume (and boost my ego a little bit)
* Opportunity to deepen my CS knowledge
* I can live in a new city/country while I am still young and don't have any commitments like a mortgage
* I can do another internship (hopefully with a trading firm), which means I can experience another company without any commitment
* I don't have many friends, so I can try to make new friends and expand my network during my MSc
* Maybe  it opens up doors in the future for leadership positions (if they're  considering someone for a promotion, maybe the guy that has a MSc from  somewhere like Oxford has a small advantage?)

I'm really afraid I'll miss out if Stripe goes IPO, though...

prnv8n,3,2021-09-20,How much do universities care about your degree vs research experience for PhD admissions?,AwaythrowSubway,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/prnv8n/how_much_do_universities_care_about_your_degree/,"I'm currently at a bit of a crossroads on what to do exactly but for context, I am hoping to apply for PhD in computer science (optimization in machine learning) somewhat soon.

Currently, I take a healthy mix of pure maths, statistics, cs, and optimization courses and due to this breadth, I may be able to graduate with what is essentially a triple major.

However, I'm thinking of potentially extending a summer research internship to include the term (4 months) afterwards with a reasonably well-known researcher in my field (for context I have spent some summers doing research and I feel that 4 months is usually too short for most research projects). The problem is that, if I did this, I would forfeit the triple major which I have been working on for some time and would essentially graduate with a major and two minors.

On the inside, I feel that the extra research experience + improved reference letter (I assume) + more publishable work would be more useful in PhD admissions, but I also feel bad since I am quite close to a goal of mine (triple major) that I would have to forfeit.

I suppose my question would be: is my thinking reasonable? Or would a triple major be a massive boost for my profile in the admissions process over a single major and two minors? As a side note, do admissions committees take a close look at courses on the transcript? (since I would be missing one or two courses to go from minor -&gt; major I'm hoping that the committee can still tell I am reasonably proficient in those departments)

Apologies for the long post but I couldn't think of anywhere/anyone else to ask about my specific situation. Thanks!"

It's not that I've got anything important here, it's just that I've had a lot of time being independent and on my own.

I've come to realize that my mother in particular was an extremely bad influence and at the end of the day I can't trust her. I do miss my brothers, but my younger brother (18m) in particular seems dead set on being a couch surfer with no job and seems to be heading in a downward spiral just because he can. My second oldest brother is expected to get out of jail in the next 5 years and he really wants me to go back home because he feels like none of my other brothers could responsibly help him reacclimate to society and he wants to be close to his daughter.

I really don't want to return to M.A because it just reminds me of how terrible my environment was. It never felt like home to me, my ""family"" consisted of people who I lived with and who bullied me just because I wasn't athletic (I used to be overweight, I've since gone from 220lbs max to around 150lbs). I'm applying for the TSA soon, hopefully at the start of the next month, and I've even stopped smoking weed in anticipation after smoking almost nightly (I'll be a month clean next Tuesday and I've been taking at-home drug tests weekly). I'll be going home for the week of Christmas because its been so long and depending on how it goes I might not return home again.

As for positives, I miss the snow of MA winters a bit. I miss seeing my nieces growing up, even though my eldest is going through that growing away phase and the younger one will probably start elementary soon. I also had a great internship a while back that paid $18 an hour and I think I could convince them to have me full time if they still want a long-term employee. I'd also like to see my old coworkers for nostalgia purposes. I would like to go back full time but even if I could afford a home it'd be in the 2k to 3k per month range whereas I'm paying 1.1k a month in MD.

Should I at least consider moving back to Massachusetts or a nearby state? Maybe Vermont would be nice, though after living in Maryland I appreciate a lack of snowy winters. I've heard Connecticut has pros and cons as well. Would it be smart to look at surrounding states first given the costs of living?"

However, I don't have any research experience or anything similar. With those qualifications, what kind of GRE score would I want to target to get into CSUF, CSULB, UC Riverside, UCI, and UCLA respectively going through the gamut of roughly local schools in ascending order of quality, and very generally are the odds good of me getting into any of those schools for a Computer Science MS program, and if not what qualities should I try to develop?

Im currently a high school student(17) in Japan working full-time at a SaaS company as 
a web developer(contract) while going to an online school. Im fluent in Japanese and English so school and work is okay communication wise. Im coming up to my senior year in high school and I need to make a decision wether if I should go to college or pursue my career as an engineer. I put a lot of thought to it and it’s a really though call, both point in my opinion are valid.tho I have many many things to learn and will face a lot of hardships I believe I have some skills.
let me introduce you to my background.
I was first introduced to programming when I was in sixth grade(12) when I got my first laptop.
it was a used old laptop but It was intriguing. I loved technology and having a computer was my 
best gift ever. My mom introduced me to a robotics club short after tho I didn’t understand what I was doing I enjoyed making robots using Ardino. After I got into middle school I didn’t do any programming for a while. But I was interested in operation systems and hacking, I watch YouTube videos and had some fun. 
On the last year of my middle school I went to a coding bootcamp. Thats when I learned javascript, I made some cool and simple project as well as doing a little bit of game creation with unity. Since I live in Japan and go to a Japanese school I had to take a test to go to a school of choice. School wasn’t really a thing for me, I didn’t like the system of it so I epically failed. 
After failing my test and my mom very disappointed in me I went to a pretty famous online high school with a good system to give me a lot of free time.So when enrolled I took a lot of web development courses via my school and Udemy. I made many projects and, It was honestly fun and I enjoyed something for the first time that gave me skills. After three or four month I went to a lounge meetup with some engineers. 
There I met my mentor Nate who worked at a FAANG level company. 
He was a really cool guy.
He took me under his wings letting me work as an intern teaching me and helping me build a path for being an engineer while getting paid to help with his project.After a year or so my internship ended so I decided to give it a shot and submitted my resume to a company posted on indeed. And luckily a company hired me. 
I was pretty impressed with my self because I didn’t use any connections and was able to pass my interview at this company. 
And it leads to now. 
I’ve been working little over a month now and I have learned so much. And my adaptability was tested since the framework changed from 
React to Vue and it was a docker based project.
I needed some time but I managed to get used to it. I have gone through a lot and Im enjoying what I’m doing a lot. But I just don’t know If I should go to college. People say its only 4years give or take but 4 years for a person in their early 20s sound a lot for me. Not only that but it cost almost 100k witch is just crazy. I asked on quora and many people answered I should go to collage because my pay will get better or I will get a better role but I wasn’t sure if that applies to the programming industry. Im just stuck here and need advice. Thank you

Edit: I probably confused some people. I’m in Japan because I have dual citizenship, us and japan. I’m Japanese/American. Sorry for the confusion 😓😓 I can go to the USA citizenship wise and planning to go after high school."

So far I do formula student, as well as teaching myself some cad/simulation software, and I've also been learning a second language for many years. 

The thing is, every time I hear about a friend getting an internship or job, it's always 'my dad's friend owns this company' or 'my uncle knows a guy who knows a guy'. I have absolutely no connections in engineering, my entire family are in medicine and health, and it feels like without nepotism the chances are really slim. It doesn't help that in my state the jobs are mostly unrelated to my area of interest, and I'm just a bit lost. 

I'm studying mechanical engineering but really wish I could do aerospace, however my university doesn't offer it, and there's no way I can afford to study abroad.

Here is the ninetieth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

Not sure what the parameters are yet but wanted to do a full stack vuejs app with testing and an api and have it deployed and all that, have wireframes and figma ui design so the app would look very modern and crisp but apparently they don’t mark web apps well not sure yet. This would be something I would be most comfortable with as I have 8 months of full stack vue experience from an internship. (Would also be great on a cv as I would like to go into full stack dev full time when I finish my degree next year.

My other idea is a python game with AI integration or some sort of python AI project. Looking over Udemy courses but can’t find anything quite right!

Any suggestions on what to do? It will be very flexible in terms of what we are allowed to do. Any courses or interesting projects or have you heard of something that got marked very well? Thanks for any suggestions!"

Wrapped up my internship around August 20th last month and was told that the conversion process from intern to full time would take about a month or so.

I did follow up 2 weeks after and the recruiter told me that they are still going through meetings regarding the conversion process. The recruiter said “We will reach out with the result soon, you are a wonderful candidate!”

I performed really well during this internship and even got a banger review from my hiring manager. He specifically stated that they should hire me when I graduate. 

So I guess my question is, should I follow up a 2nd time now that the timeframe has past? Should I be worried or do I assume they are just a bit behind in sending out full time offer results?

I'm just about to graduate in Computer Science, I specialized in Data Science and Web (-Engineering). Compared to others, my grades were always on the better side. No complaints there. In order to graduate, I have to do an internship. I decided to try out my luck in Data Science and got a job fairly quickly.

A couple of months later, here I am now, working at a company simillar to StepStone. I've been there for almost a month and I feel like a complete dumbass, a moron. So many things I'm supposed to be proficient in. Theres a new framework, library, stack, SaaS to get into every day. Last week it was MyDbr to do complex SQL queries for business reports, then it was Data Studio for another report (which I liked), then it was the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash), Google Analytics, Matomo, Bigquery, Airflow, Jenkins, Docker - I just can't keep up with it. I feel like theres new stuff coming every day and its just too much to get good at. I'm used to just do Node.JS or Python with Pandas, Matplotlib and I was done for the day.

Is that normal or is that career just not for me? I really don't feel like working 8 hours, just to read docs when I get home in order to get my work done the next day because I don't have the time to get proficient at all of this during my time at work"

So I have a bit of a situation where I'm not sure what the best option is here. Here's a basic timeline:

* Had web development internship before graduating that I acquired through a personal connection at a non tech company, due to the start of COVID making it difficult to find a more desirable option. Was only developer on a web application hosted on a LAMP server (front + back), interactions with supervisor felt similar to what I imagine freelance to client discussions are like. Project was a modernization of the work order system, from hacked together Excel spreadsheet to a web app. Had several different forms, that once submitted would store the information on the MySQL database. Then the completed form would be saved as a PDF file on the server that could then be downloaded and printed, along with an Admin panel with CRUD functionality for easier editing of table.
* Graduated in August 2020 with an ICT degree (similar classes to CompSci, but less math requirements. Still had some coding, IT,  networking and Info Sec classes. Was originally in CS, calculus was not kind to me)
* Moved home, could not find a related job in field. Ended up doing electronics repair work for about a year, with a promotion inside that company. Got a job offer at another tech company that does similar repair work, with a slightly higher pay (but still just $17 an hr)

That puts us at now, where I have not yet started at this new place. I really don't want to get stuck doing this type of work forever, and I really wish I had put more effort into finding an internship at school that would have led to an actual career. I'd like to get into some sort of development job. So here's what I think my options are:

1. Accept job, continue to work full time doing something I don't like and keep trying to apply for jobs and build a portfolio with whatever free time and mental energy I have left. Likely would take longer, and I'd still probably be living at home for a while. Positives are I would have a bit more money when/if I do find a better job and need to relocate. Another downside is dealing with leaving the job after a short time (ideally wouldn't be more than a year, hopefully there as little as possible). 
2. Not take job, potentially find something part time instead. My family is pretty well off, and I won't have to move until I get a ""real"" job. I have a bit of money in the bank from working this past year, enough for a couple years if expenses don't change, and if I did have to move out probably 6 months to a year. No CC debt or anything like that. This would give me more time to job search and practice coding more. I could also build a real portfolio, and I have permission from my previous internship boss to use a modified version of the web app I made for part of a portfolio. The main problem is that it will take a fair amount of time to modify as I have learned better coding practices since I made it. The downside is not as much money coming in, but it wouldn't take much work to cover expenses each month. There's also would be a slight employment gap, but I suppose a part time gig would mitigate some of that. Plus with COVID going on I don't think it would be a deal breaker anywhere.

Is it delusional for me to be leaning towards #2? Does anyone have suggestions? I want to get into the development field and move out as soon as possible. After putting in the time and money for a degree, I don't want to be stuck working low end jobs that have no education requirement. I really think that having a degree and a portfolio site with 1 - 2 solid projects should be able to land me a job somewhere in the US. Plus any completed smaller stuff would help too.

The problem I have with taking the job is it is harder to stay fresh on programming knowledge, and having the time to search, apply, build things. At my previous job I could program some in the downtime, writing automation scripts, studying, or doing practice problems. During my last few months there things picked up so I couldn't do that anymore. After work I only had time to do one thing with my night (make dinner, code, apply, or sometimes just sleep due to getting off at 7). I'm worried the longer I take to find a job the more stale my degree and knowledge will be, making it harder to break in.

ps3mhe,28,2021-09-20,"Unofficial internship megathread AMA. I work at a Fortune 500 company, and was lucky enough to get an internship during the pandemic. Now, I just got my offer letter today.",txageod,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/ps3mhe/unofficial_internship_megathread_ama_i_work_at_a/,"This is strictly from my own personal experience, and don't claim to be an expert.

&amp;#x200B;

I've interned at my company for 2 years now, as a co-op, working throughout the year. I'm set to graduate in May, and just received my full-time offer letter. I'm happy to help answer questions to those who may have them about engineering students securing internships.

What I *can* answer:

* Defense industry hiring practices
* GPA related questions
* Interview related questions
* Internship related questions

What I *can't* answer:

* Internships and applications not *related* to engineering
   * I can always ask my HR rep, but I can't promise it'll be as accurate as someone with direct experience
* No, I can't get you an internship
* F1 visa (I have no idea)

Please note, I'm not an expert. But I've been lucky enough to get to go through many career fairs. interviews (botched and rocked), hiring process, and working for 2 years at a defense company. I'm now getting to work with my company's campus recruiter, and this is all on my own time (not paid). I'd just like to help if I can :)

&amp;#x200B;

FAQ:

* What is the minimum GPA?
   * Minimum is 2.0 (because you can't graduate less than 2.0 iirc). Many defense companies want to see at least a 3.0, as is their hiring standard. If it's below 3.0 and on their job req, you can't get past this. Just work hard to boost your GPA.
* What's a good GPA?
   * 3.25+ to around 3.5 is a solid GPA. If you're in this range as an engineer, you're very competitive.
* Can I work at a defense company with an F1 visa?
   * I'm not the best person to ask this, as every company will vary. Heck, it may even vary inside the same company depending on the position!
   * Most likely though, the answer is no for engineering positions. Again, this is just broad generalization. Defense companies are literally making things for the government and military, and they try to keep it under wraps. It's most of the time not the company's policy, but driven by contracts to the government that mandate this.
   * That being said, it never hurts to try. Before you go to a career fair, go to their company career site and look at internship job postings, and look at the REQUIREMENTS. If it doesn't say ""US Citizens Only"", you may be in luck. Or their HR person sucks at their job and forgot to put it. But research is always good.
* How do I talk to a recruiter?
   * Easy, treat them politely but not rigidly. They're humans like us. If you're an introvert, practice interviewing with someone. We expect students to clam up at first, but you need to be able to get past that. My favorite professor told me: ""the best engineers are the ones who can effectively relay their ideas"". If you freeze up so hard you can't talk to someone, it will be very difficult to get a job anywhere. So, just practice!
   * Handshakes are discouraged because of COVID, so fist bumps or elbow bumps are cool.
   * Sanitizing your hands before talking to them is cool.
* What to talk about with a recruiter to get them interested in me?
   * If you're CS/CE or do any programming, START A GITHUB. Seriously. Do a project OUTSIDE of class and document it in GitHub. And that means don't just upload something then never touch it again. Some recruiters (like the one I work with) will actively pull your repo and check out your projects. They want to see changelogs, bug fixes, feature additions. They don't honestly expect it to work flawlessly, or even well. What they want to see is you WORKING and LEARNING.
   * If you're not into programming (I strongly believe every engineer should have a bit of experience), you should be working on *something* that interests you in the engineering discipline you're applying for.
      * An example: If you're a EE in IREC, show some mock CCA board designs, and talk about what did or didnt work.
      * If you're a MechE in ASME, show some mechanical design simulations or something you've had a hand in designing. AND BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT. If you just watched someone else build it and have no idea, the recruiter will find out really fast.
* What should my resume look like?
   * Honestly, there's no mold for this. My recruiter and supervisor both have told me that if it's too much text (like a pptx that's all words), they'll just look at whatever is bolded or on the first 1/3 of the page.
   * [This is the example](https://www.resume-resource.com/account-manager-resume-example-2/) I used, and it seemed (to me) to get good results. Try to keep it at 1 page. A recruiter likely isn't going to look at the back unless you're a PhD student or have overwhelmingly wowed them. [Here's a sanitized](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EQWSGLXL6vki2mJ59yvjMjvwpvZlEcxi/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=117111571498737785423&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true) template of mine, if anyone wants it. Sorry if google docs murders some of the format.
* What should I not put on my resume?
   * ""self started"" - everyone is
   * ""highly motivated"" - we'll know at the interview if you are or not
   * ""flexible and dynamic"" - your skills and the interview will tell if you are or not
   * ""proficient with MS Office"" - yea, sure you are. and everyone else who can't edit a word doc without asking IT for help
   * Anything you're not comfortable being asked about in detail.
      * Helped on a club project, but if you're asked something super detailed about something you *should* know, but don't, it'll make you look like it's just fluff and not real
   * Your photo (seriously, don't)
   * Your gender (why would you do this anyways?)
* What should I put on my resume?
   * Specific skills you've learned
   * Any certifications you hold or held
   * Any licenses you hold
   * Any programming language, CAD, or design software you are familiar with
   * Special equipment your field use that you've learned (like an oscilloscope, 3D printer (they love this), digital force gauge, etc.)
   * Hard classes you've finished (thermo, fluids, emag, algorithms, etc)
   * Any tutoring you've done
   * Any clubs you're a part of (and list what you're responsible for)
   * Any volunteer work
   * Previous jobs held (that you can get a good reference from)
* How should I dress for a career fair or interview?
   * Recruiters know students aren't rich. They don't expect a suit and tie (although that's preferred). Clean and wrinkle free polo and jeans/slacks go a long way. And you jeans should not have any holes. Tuck your polo in, and wear a belt.
   * Don't wear pajamas. Seriously. I saw this. Don't do it.

I'll add things as I can think of them. Drop a comment if there's anything else you wanna know.

I was asked Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree (or binary search tree, can't remember) (Leetcode Hard) and Word Search II (Leetcode hard). Barely any behavioral questions. Just asked to talk a bit more about my projects on my resume. Couldn't solve either question. I didn't even know what it meant to serialize and deserialize something. Was at least able to talk about the dfs nature of the word search II and relate it to word search I, but still couldn't come up with shit. In the first interview I spent like 15 minutes just trying to format the input and class structure for a tree and debugging it since they only give you the question and a single visual example input. I think I've been relying too much on how leetcode provides you with a bunch of built in test cases and clear inputs and outputs and explanations and constraints.

Honestly just demoralized. This is my second time interviewing with the company and I fumbled again. I know it's a numbers game but damn, I thought these interviewers would think to ask easier questions. And I guess behavorial questions don't exist anymore. A lot of people of who interviewed with this company said it wasn't too bad and got asked easier questions. I guess I just got the short end of the stick.

This was one of my dream companies and I'm just sad I'm not some rockstar student that is amazing at data structures and algorithms. I guess I have to start doing LC hards for fucking internship interviews. It's just sad that you prepare for an interview for an entire month and fail it in a matter of a couple of hours.

I am currently a junior in college and have been in IT since I was 16 before pursuing school. I moved from entry level help desk position to a position where I did every form of hardware repair and then moved to a entry to mid level software development job. I also have been acquiring general certs during this time. Finally, for the last year and a half during college I have been in a pretty small to mid level assistant project manager position for the same software development company.  

Now definitely feels like it's time to take an internship, going into the future I would really like to go down the path of the business side of IT, IT management and business relations involving IT. But im really lost on the internship path. Do I go for more of a project management internship? or do I stay down the path of IT and take a more technical internship?

It really seems like there's a strong divide in available internships, either strictly technical IT positions or stickily general project management/ business management positions.

I feel like my 5+ years experience in IT is enough to understand  most entry IT management positions but maybe not?  I would really like to take a project management internship but i'm not sure if this will help or hinder me because it looks like it won't be IT relevant? 

I appreciate the read"

I see a decent amount of posts here about people who graduate with their engineering degree at a later point in life, and sometimes struggle. I joined the AF, and hate it honestly. I work aircraft maintenance, but want to get away from aircraft as much as possible. 

I've been doing school on the side while in for as long as I've been able to, to work for my degree in EE, and hopefully an accelerated program into a MS in CompE. I'll be 25 if I just get my BS, and about 26-27 if I go for the MS option. 

Does any one here have any experience with attending college after time in service? Has it hurt you at all, in job searches? Also, has anyone had any experience with getting Internships after? 

Additionally, if anyone has any experience attending full time after being in the military I'd appreciate any tips/advice/anecdotes.

I live in the US state of Colorado, and I've been hearing that some out-of-state employers are choosing not to hire Coloradans in remote-work positions.

1. It's actually a short term internship, 6 months max. Not very well paid, but I could carry out from my hometown, so I would save some money. I do like the topics of the job (sustainability, maritime protection, European projects). After this job? I dont know

2. Open-ended contract, well paid, nice benefits. The job is in another city in Europe, in Brussels. It's mostly administration and I dont really like the field.

I am so lost and I dont know what to do and if I am crazy.
Most people are telling me to go for the second one without any doubt. Few people are telling me to follow my passion and risk.

Do you have an experience to share, a process that helps you take big decisions?
I just feel crazy in refusing the second one, but when it comes to accepting it I just feel crazy anxious and I dont wanna do it.

I came across an option that I had concerning my graduation date. I could get into the workforce one year early, or I could build up more internships and experience in math/statistics for a possible ML career. Will the extra year help me out, or it it worth it to save a year's worth of college?

I think my current plan is to graduate early if I get a good enough offer, if not I'll continue with my 4th year of college. Just wanted to hear people's thoughts. Thanks!

So I recently graduated with a bachelor's in finance back in May. At the time I had been applying to predominantly jobs in the wealth management field, which is really where my passion lies and the place I see my self in the long run. I also applied to a handful of traditional banking positions, I had most of my undergrad internship experience in various banks, and I honestly had known for a while I didn't want to be in banking for the long term but applied to a handful of jobs anyway. I ended up accepting a position at a local bank as an analyst, I heard back from a couple of the other positions I was way more interested in but wasn't getting offers and truthly was nervous and anxious about not having something lined up as soon as I graduated. Fast forward about 3 months later and I definitely have found out I do not want to be in banking anymore. Is it wrong for me to start applying to other open positions in areas where I actually want to work this early? Is it okay to leave a position after only a few months ?

 How would I go about explaining to a potential interviewer why I want to leave. I know any experience is good but I definitely feel like I'm wasting my time since I know I'm not doing what I'm really passionate about. I would also feel kind of guilty leaving since there is nothing inherently wrong with my current position, it's just not what I want to do, and I pretty much knew that when I accepted the role I just felt like I had to get a job immediately, which was probably a mistake. Would appreciate any and all feed back on this, tell me if I'm over thinking it."

I graduated with a Bachelors in Information Technology and Mathematics in 2020. I am planning to apply for masters in Computer Science in Europe for a thesis/ research-based program.

As part of my final year internship at IIT Delhi, I implemented 3-4 recent research papers. Unfortunately, I didn't achieve any good accuracy/ result because of some undefined parameters in the paper regarding the algorithms although I tried an intuitive range of values for these parameters but was not able to test all possible values due to computational limitations. Therefore I was not able to achieve any presentable results but my work/research was good enough to convince my advisor to offer a position as a research assistant under him. Now as I am preparing my CV for my masters' application, I find it difficult to present the results for that internship work in my CV as I don't have any output with any significant result.

I would be really grateful if anyone can give me some suggestions. Thanks in advance."

We are supposed to bring a stack of resumes to hand out. Here's mine...

[https://i.imgur.com/8sP0lHo.png](https://i.imgur.com/8sP0lHo.png)

A little bit of background:

I've finished four years in the military doing intelligence work and am looking to find my niche within IT. I started part-time at my university's help desk while I study full-time for an MIS degree. The linked resume should make it abundantly clear to you that I am professionally illiterate. I did my best to scrap this resume together for a separate call with a LinkedIn recruiter based on [this](https://www.careercup.com/resume) template. 

Intentions:

Like I said, I'm trying to find my niche within IT, but I am barely familiar with working as a help desk technician right now. My position as a guardsman will allow me to attend a school called the Joint Cyber Analysis Course, but I'm not sure I should be tailoring my resume towards exclusively cybersecurity. At this point, I don't even know if I will like it. My goal is to move into a systems analyst role and then eventually a sysadmin role with a longer term aspiration to become an IT manager.

What kind of internships should I be looking for to help me leverage these goals?

What can I do to fix up my resume for this career night?

Any feedback is appreciated - thank you!"

So basically my fingers have been hurting for 3 months. I injured myself from overusing the computer between school, work and videogames. It doesn't seem to the carpal tunnel, my wrists barely hurt but when typing some of my fingers do. I went with a physiotherapist for 2 months but it didn't do much. I also have an ergonomic keyboard (Ergodox EZ) and my setup is ergonomic enough by now.

The question:
I'm already on my last semester of EE and so far I've felt comfortable with all branches I've studied (Embedded, Analog, Digital, SW development, HW development *, communications, Control, computer architecture...). Is there a particular branch or specific job that doesn't rely much on using a keyboard where I could work pain free? 

I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting. Also English is not my first language.
Any suggestions regarding RSI management are also accepted.
Thx in advance.

psqw2v,3,2021-09-21,Talk me out of doing a PhD,larenspear,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/psqw2v/talk_me_out_of_doing_a_phd/,"I am currently a CS master’s student doing research in data mining/machine learning/recommender systems. My undergrad was in computational chemistry with a CS minor. Throughout undergrad, I did research every summer, as well as during the year. I have never had an internship, although this summer I am applying to a ton of possible places.

I really do like research. I love reading papers and I would happily do it all day. I know it’s a bad idea to do a PhD on paper but I think I can make it work for me.

Given my total lack of work experience outside of being a TA and research assistant, I might be able to land a job paying 70k. However, with a PhD stipend of 25k for 9 months and a summer internship of 20-25k, I would be making 45-50k in a LCOL area, while also getting to work on cutting edge stuff. That puts the opportunity cost at about 100k over 4 years. That seems like a low number compared to those who could achieve top tier company positions and might be staring down an opportunity cost 5x the size, and something I could make up in time. The PhD would be at a school ranked around #40.

I would love to work at a research division of some big company (FAIR, Google Brain, etc) but I know the odds of getting a job like that are very slim. 

Any thoughts? How bad of a mistake would I be making? I think it’s unlikely a master’s would get me into a real research role, although there’s no guarantee a PhD would get me there either."

Currently working as software dev with a company in Canada.

My  plan is to get Canadian Permanent Residence after I finish undergrad  which should be around 3-4 years from now if the rules doesn't change so I may be considered as domestic applicant when applying for masters in  Canada. That means I'll be working for 2-3 years before applying to masters program. Looking for CS/CS adjacent masters.

What kind CS schools that  I could aim for in Canada ?. I guess top CS school (UofT, waterloo, UBC  Vancouver) is out of reach (got no publication) and I could always go back to my former school for  masters. Personally, I'm eyeing McGill, UBC Okanagan, Dalhousie Univ ,UofManitoba (in that order).

Also what kind of school I could expect if I choose to go to Europe or US ?

Experience:

1. 2  summer of undergrad research experience, 1 of them under grant. Can get a good LOR from a prof. Topic is related to **application of machine learning** but I'm open to anything for my masters. No publication though.
2. 4 Internship, some at prestigious companies in Canada. Software development.

I am currently in my final year of grad school (entering my 6th year, STEM, US). I have finished enough papers material for a thesis, but I haven't written any words yet. I am applying for the postdoc this year, however, I have been feeling sick and incapable of doing what I am doing for a while, and applying postdoc just because I am scared of pissing off my advisor. I have been trying to see what else I can do, but my coding experience is limited (took a couple of classes, had a bachelor's with a minor in CS). My Machine Learning and Data Science are zero, I mean I understand things and can repeat like a parrot, but I have no business intuition as well as my skills on building model on the computer is limited. I randomly applied to many internships and industry jobs with the hope that they can take me and give me a chance to learn on the job. I did get a couple of interviews but they all told me I don't have an internship or my research seems not fit into their needs, which I understand. 

I got a postdoc offer through connection, where I will be doing 100% things different from what I am doing or my background. I am feeling super demotivated in it now, as hardly feel I can pick up and learn and perform well to get further into my academic career (I don't have any collaborations that could help me push out more paper in a postdoc, most of my works were done alone, hence I assume going into this postdoc, I will not have time to do any of my background research). I feel like I do not want to do this, but super hesitant to say no.

There is one science consulting company that has an interest in me, mainly through connection (they believe in a Professor that I have a close connection with in the past), and expressed interest in hiring me. However, the works seem super hard as it varies on many different topics, each requires complete active research on them. I would say it is not harder than my research, but given the state of my mind and how not confident and burnt out I am, I am super scared of being fired on the job and messed up even further (I am on a student visa). 

Overall, I just wake up every day feeling like a waste, as no matter what I pick among these too, I see 95% of failure and my life is rather wasteful. I feel okay about teaching, not super up-to-date with all the trends of active teaching or fancy method in education to be a hot hire for a teaching position. I have been thinking about going back home where I am from, but finding a job with decent pay is even harder, as I lost touch with pretty much everyone there, and the pressure of ""Oh look at A, he has a Ph.D. in the US, and now he is so terrible, he must be a fraud, blah blah"". I can be okay hearing those, but my parents probably gonna be suffering terribly, and I don't want that."

I am a senior mechanical engineering student interested in getting into the aerospace field. I landed an internship this summer with a large company, and while it wasn't in the field that I exactly want to go into, it was enjoyable and I believe that both my side and their side found it to be successful. Towards the last month of my internship, my manager and I started discussing the prospect of bringing me on full time next summer in their aerospace business (not where I was working at the time). I was surprised at how soon and quick it started to happen, but I tried to make the most out of the connections that my manager got me in contact with.

After initially having a great and promising discussion with the AE contact, the last few weeks of my job were somewhat quiet regarding any progression for an offer, even after reaching out to my contact a few times. My manager also occasionally said that he was working with HR on his end, but he had been notably busy with other things around this time from what I could tell.

Now, a month and a half after my final day (or around 2 months after meeting with the aerospace division), I have not heard back from anybody at the company, and I am starting to get a little anxious, especially with how much excitement seemed to spur between me and my manager about me returning. I would reach out to my manager, but at this point, I am uncertain if this is a good look from my point of view or not. I have started considering applying elsewhere for my own wellbeing and sanity, but I don't want to jump the gun if this is typical. Is this a normal occurrence or should I start looking at different positions? I am not even sure if the aerospace side of the company would be as enjoyable since I haven't had experience working with them, so this has probably factored into my wavering feelings about waiting so long for a return offer.

Hi,
I apologize for the long text. 
I go to school in new york city and I have been having doubts about the school I am attending for a while! The reason being, I feel like I made the wrong choice. For a very long time, I have always believed I would go to an out-state college with the traditional stuff like football games, tailgates, and such. However, during my junior year of high school, I decided that I did not want to do that; I wanted to go to school in the city because I believed I would get more opportunities there. But now, I don't believe that and realized that the location does not guarantee opportunities or internships. The school I attend does not really have a community and since it is in the city, there is no traditional campus. The one thing that i like about this school is that it’s close to home, so I can come home on the weekends. Also, the school I attend is not the best in the field and does not actually have the concentration I want to study. It is accredited but to many companies, it does not stand out. So, I am looking to transfer out but where is the problem. I have made a list of possible transfer schools and it is a very long list. I am conflicted because all the schools are very different from each other.  My major is business management and I want to concentrate on supply and operations management. Can anyone give me advice, which school(s) would be better to transfer to?

I am looking to transfer to a different school for my sophomore year.

Colleges to transfer:

Boston college

Fordham University

U Mass Amherst

Stony Brook University

Penn State University

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

Syracuse University

Rutgers University\_ New Brunswick

Binghamton University

University of Cali-Berkeley

University of Maryland-College Park

But, this is a situation where I can't rely on that (even though I never should be relying on that). I'm in my senior year of High School (about 3 months in) and I've realized if I want to get into college and put in my SAT and ACT scores in, I'd have to register for both of them by this Friday at the very latest. Thing is, I've never had a passion for anything and I don't have a dream job or School. My original plan was to go to college for Computer Science and make good money but I can't see myself working a Part-Time Job and going to school for 4 more years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now looking into becoming a Data Analyst, or something of that sort of thing, I'm stuck on whether or not to apply to colleges and take my standardized tests. My original plan was to earn certifications through courses or boot camps and have some actual experience later down the road but I've been advised against it and now I'm doubting my ability to carry out a plan like this. I was advised to at least take up community college classes in order to say I'm studying for something in order to have better chances at an Internship when the time comes. I also have no experience with coding or any sort of skills needed for this field of work. I have no idea where to start or how long it'll take but if it's possible I definitely want to. I just want to hear other opinions on this matter and what I should do.

TL;DR 

I don't know whether to go to college for a degree in Computer Science or to focus on certifications for Data Analysis and hopefully land an internship or an entry level position in the future."

I am about 2 years in my CS degree (I switched from Business Admin). I wasn’t able to attend school this semester (I had a hold on my account and by the time I paid it there were no classes available), so I decided to join a bootcamp. I’ve been struggling to keep up with school payments and since I switched my major to CS I’ll have to spend more years studying. I really don’t want to spend more years working a regular job while trying to survive and pay for school. I know it’s super hard to get into the field with out a degree and I might be delusional. But hey I’m going to stay positive and optimistic. Im hoping to get atleast a paid internship after the bootcamp and climb the ladder from there and also use my salary to fund my degree ( also I’ve heard of companies covering your tuition so that would be great as well). 
Anyone in a similar situation or had a successful bootcamp experience? Would love to hear your story"

I asked my former manager if it is possible to verify my internship at the company in case my future employers conduct background search, but he just ghosted me and they deleted my company domain email account.

pswfey,1,2021-09-21,[21m] Found out the girl i've been dating [20f] has a sugar daddy,cherry_chocolate_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pswfey/21m_found_out_the_girl_ive_been_dating_20f_has_a/,"I've been dating this girl for just over 2 weeks now, seeing her almost every day. Things were really great and having never been in a relationship, only hookups, I am head over heels for this girl who seems so out of my league. After we got dinner last night I decided to tell her that I was planning to stop talking to anyone else and see what she thought about that. Maybe 2 weeks is a bit short but since we had seen each other every day I didn't thing it was too fast.

She didn't say anything for a long time until she said that she ""lived a sugar lifestyle."" I wasn't sure what that meant so she explained that she was dating a 37 year old man who is her sugar daddy. He takes her to dinner once or twice a month and she texts him. I wouldn't have been surprised if she wanted to give it more time before going exclusive but I really wasn't ready for that answer. I told her I was looking for a girlfriend, not just a hookup or fwb. She said that he paid her $800 a week and wasn't going to give that up, but that she really liked me and wanted me to be her boyfriend. And that she wasn't emotionally attached to this guy, it was just like a job. I said I'd need to think about it.

In a way I understand because I would kill to get rid of the stress of paying my rent, tuition, and car payment. But I can't help but feel so emasculated. I've never been someone who thinks men should pay for everything or whatever. But I thought that buying her coffee or picking up the check for dinner would be a nice gesture. We even split most of our bills. But now I feel like I'm too broke to be worth a real relationship. I know its stupid but its like eating me up. I work a part time internship and still get stressed when I fill up my gas tank and see the counter tick up. How am I supposed to be enough when I make so little.

Maybe I could get used to it. I don't know how much she does with this guy because I haven't asked but I know she probably sends nudes and makes out at the least. I don't think there's any way I could do it if they have sex. The thought of some old dude fucking my girlfriend creeps me out. I'm not sure if I should ask her or if I even want to know.

Is there any way that this can be a worthwhile relationship? I know some people date girls with only fans but they don't really meet in person like she does. And if so how do I overcome my insecurity in this situation?"
pswlmm,2,2021-09-21,"Don't Know what I'm doing with life, help lol",BarbecuedDuckAss,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pswlmm/dont_know_what_im_doing_with_life_help_lol/,"Howdy friends, so I've been feeling like I'm coming to a sort of critical crossroad with what I want to do with my life. I apologize in advance if this is long-winded, I'm mostly typing this as what I'm thinking and feeling pops in my head, and don't really have anywhere else to turn. So, with that out of the way, I thought I should first share a little about myself. I'm 28 years old and graduated with a degree in Nutrition in 2019. I had the initial goal of working as a Registered Dietitian. 

However, somewhere along the way, I grew pretty depressed and struggled severely with social anxiety. It was around the end of my junior year that I began to realize it was a problem, particularly when I would skip class, or avoid school assignments just to lay in bed or play video games all day. I just lost the drive to really care. I played it off as just having senioritis at the time, but looking back, I never really had a plan after graduating, or even during the entire time I was in school. I also failed to develop any real connections with anyone in my cohort, other students, or network whatsoever. Regardless, I still somehow scraped by, and with a relatively okay GPA (3.2).

Yet I still feel as though I've had SO many opportunities to succeed and go on to make something of myself and It's like I'm just squandering my youth, and wasting these chances. What should have been one of the best periods of my life, hangs over my head as nothing but anxiety, self-doubt, and apathy. Yet, I still beat myself up, because I know I should just suck it the fuck up because soooo many people would kill for the opportunity to even attend college. I also have these added pressures like family expectations and beating myself over the fact that I'm 28, never had a real relationship before, and still live with my parents; irrespective of the fact that I have lived on my own for periods of time before. All these things are just absolutely crushing me and I feel so lost. Hell, I can't even really talk to my family about these things because I absolutely KNOW it would do nothing but bring stress and pain. But enough whining and self-pity, the reason I mention these things, is because I recognize them as the entire reason I am where I am in life, but I've also begun to address them.

Over this past year as I've worked on my mental health, I've begun to be interested in different things again and have taken up a lot of old and new hobbies. I've never asked internet folk for advice before, but I just wanted opinions on what people might think is some good life/career advice. The big problem with my degree is, a nutrition degree by itself isn't worth a whole lot. To become an RD, or have a job besides being a basic nutritionist at a gym or something, you have to go to grad school AND an unpaid 1,200hr internship. I initially planned to do this and have been working at a local hospital as a patient caterer in the kitchen. I figured if I ever planned on doing anything with my degree I'd at least use it to pay my 13usd wage to live, and maybe look good on a resume. And like I said, the drive or energy to really do anything with my degree is not there. To be honest, the only reason I even finished was I felt I was too far in my education to back out. That said, I have recently discovered a real interest in computer science, and have been messing around with some basic programming like JS, HTML, and CSS. I really like this stuff, it's incredibly overwhelming and challenging, but If I had to imagine being really interested or passionate about something, this is it.

So lately I've really been considering pursuing a career in the field, but am feeling lost at which direction I should take. I know I can self-teach, go to a Bootcamp or go back to school. I even know about programs like post BSCC degrees with OSU and stuff. I just don't know what approach to take here, I really what to have a good-paying, at least somewhat fulfilling job that pays for me to be an independent functioning adult. I could then go back to school to get a second degree. I just wonder if maybe a Bootcamp would be better, or doing something like the Odin Project. I hear a lot of mixed success with trying to get into the field without a degree. It just leaves me wondering if I'm just fucking about and wasting time trying to learn this stuff and should turn my focus somewhere else. Please internet, help me lol.

\-- I'd also like to point out that I'm pretty shit at math and always have been so please tell me if that's a concern with getting into the field.

**TLDR;** Sad 28 shut-in virgin man, need advice on what to do with life. Has a degree in Nutrition/ Kinda hates Nutrition now; loves CS but hardly knows shit about it."

We met and fell in love very quickly. When we met, he was unemployed and I was employed making about 45K a year. He has had numerous tragedies regarding friends happen to him in the last few years and it caused him to lose his job. When we first met he was hesitant to become official because he felt he had nothing to offer me, but I told him that wasn’t true. He got a job about a month later that looked good on paper but completely sucked. He didn’t graduate college so his options are a bit more limited. We moved in together fairly quickly because of covid and we have pets together (we got them separately and introduced them when we moved in together) 

I decided to go back to grad school and finish my degree. Right before my classes started, he was fired for being late numerous times. He has a sleep disorder and is exceptionally difficult to wake up. That was over three months ago and he still doesn’t have a job. 

Since he lost his job he has been severely depressed, sleeping all day, not helping around the house, etc. I’ve been solely buying groceries, anything the pets need, household items, etc with him occasionally chipping in when he can. He has always been lax about the housework, but it has gotten worse at this point. 

I am on a severely limited income as a grad student and I’m beginning to drown. Having to do the housework, my class work, and an unpaid internship for my program is getting very strenuous and I feel like I’m cracking. Every time I ask him for help he gets very sad about “letting me down” and shuts down. He has promised me numerous times that he will go to therapy and get a job but it hasn’t happened. I love him so much but I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m at the end of my rope and don’t want to lose our relationship over this because I strongly feel I will regret it for the rest of my life. I don’t necessarily believe in soulmates but I couldn’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. The good days are great days. He is so supportive in other ways and I keep hoping this is just a phase we can work on together. 

How can I help him without giving away too much of myself? What can I do here?"

So I decided going to grad school would be a safe option as it would give me a job for the next two years and some additional training. I have a computer science degree but no internship experience (reason mentioned above) and getting a job without prior experience is damn near impossible in this industry. My grad program is a life science program and I had worked in a life science lab writing code for two years of undergrad so I figured it wouldn’t be a bad idea. Turns out I have zero interest in my current field of study. I don’t want to work in the life science industry regardless of pay. I’m terrified of telling my advisor any of this. She was my boss for the last two years and I can’t let her down. My spot in the lab could have gone to someone else. I’m terrified of telling my family any of this. They were all so proud of me for getting accepted to grad school and for getting free tuition and a stipend. I have no job prospects and if I drop out of school I’m afraid I’ll never get a job in software development. However if I stay in my program I’ll never get a job in software development either. I have no idea what to do.

I made it to the top of the proverbial mountain, got my masters degree in EE and found a high paying job with great benefits.  I’ve been thinking a lot of how I got here.  I’ve become incredibly jaded with academia.  Here’s the dirty little secret: it’s all bullshit.  All of it.  I debated making this post because I didn’t want to corrupt the bright eyed and bushy tailed young engineering students who think they are learning cool and awesome things that will help them in life.  I came to this realization 3 weeks before I finished my masters degree.  You learn all this math shit, Calc 3, diff equations, and physics shit like electromagnetism, and for what?  Who gives a fuck if you can solve a surface integral or derive the Maxwell equations.  That’s not gonna help you.  What would help you is learning some practical applications of all this theory bullshit.  But that’s up to you to teach yourself anything practical, or do an internship, or form a startup, not the institution I’m paying all this money to.  My most useful courses were project courses like senior design, embedded system programming, and machine learning because I’m actually doing something practical.  

My grad school education was the most horseshit of all.  It’s basically twice the amount of bullshit theory.  I’m also upset because I really liked all that bullshit theory.  I fucking loved deriving the Maxwell equations.  I found it cool and interesting, only to learn it’s all horseshit.

Also the job search is bullshit.  I have a ton of experience in signal processing, PCB design, and audio hardware from working in a start up company and from my own personal projects, yet I was denied from every company I applied to related to it but hired by a fucking power engineering company.  My power engineering experience is intro to AC circuits from 2nd year of college.  I basically got the job because I have a masters degree and I sounded competent in my interview.  It’s frustrating because I didn’t learn anything in grad school that would actually make me qualified for the job, but I have this piece of fucking paper that companies respect for some goddamn reason.  Now, I can’t be too mad, I’m in a damn good situation, but I’m just frustrated because this isn’t what I expected it to be.  I apologize for this post being all over the place."

I told and subsequently built a basic browsing pc for them for half the price. My mom thought that this was amazing. Now I had been going to college since March of 2016 (mostly taking a couple general AA and multimedia classes since that was were my interests lie) and she heard from an IT guy at the local hospital that they were looking for interns and that my college had classes that would lead to that and eventually a degree. I don't care about the degree but I decided to look into it and started taking some classes (just enough that I could try out the internship and see if I thought it was a good fit, what's a few months of classes right). Well when I finally meet the guy 9 months in and finishing up the necessary classes he told me there was no internship to speak of. My whole reason for taking these classes were for nothing. I wanted to stop there, I had paid good money for this and wanted to cut my losses. But my mom refused to listen and said I needed to continue taking these classes and get that degree. After a heated argument I decided that I would continue for another school year and see how things worked out. Nothing came from that year. Still finding no real reason to continue taking these classes other than to get that degree and say this wasn't all for nothing. Yet I don't feel like any progress is being made. I haven't been able to do college and work together because of how far I live from town and the time to put into everything and since money is tight (and no my folks aren't helping me pay because my mom thinks every cent I own came from Scholarships) classes per quarter have been 1 or 2 at a time. Even my older brother quit after one semester because the amount of work was too much for him to do both at the same time. As a result my mom has constantly been harassing me about getting this degree. Acting like it's my last hope for survival because if she and my dad die I'm screwed. I find it hard to talk to her as more often than not stuff like this devolve to arguments and me unable to focus or even enjoy my day. I felt like I'm in a loop. What's worse is just today because classes start back up is that I overheard my parents talking and that the reason my mom (possibly drunk) wants me to get this degree so badly is because I can apparently get a work from home job so I don't have to interact with people because apparently I am socially inept and that also costed me my previous jobs I know I'm introverted and all my friends are on discord even before covid but I can talk to people in person. High-school was not that bad even if I didn't attend many after school stuff. Hell I even became prom king senior year! And yes I'm been laid off from jobs (who hasn't) but never outright fired and not from lack of social skills. 

Buts that all what all this IT degree has been about? Because of this idea my mom had about me being unable to properly interact with people or something? Because of how little she thinks of me? I honestly don't know what to do or think anymore. All that time seems wasted now. I could have been working or doing other classes of stuff I had interests in. For Crying out loud degrees don't even guarantee jobs anymore right? Wtf have I been doing these last couple of years!?

pt3oab,2,2021-09-22,How would I craft my essays and justify my background story for top colleges as a transfer student?,katelykay,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/pt3oab/how_would_i_craft_my_essays_and_justify_my/,"Hey everyone! 

I'm a 2nd year California CC student and I'm currently in the process of applying to 4 year colleges. While I would have a bunch of great state schools in California to fall back on, which I'm planning on applying specifically to my local school CSULA, CPP, CPSLO, and SJSU and UCSB, UCSD, UCLA, and UCB, I'm more worried about applying for private schools, or just applying in general given my circumstances.

At my Community College I have a 3.929 GPA, with courses completed like Calc III, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Two semesters of Calculus Based Physics, Solid Mechanics, Engineering Graphics, Materials Science, among other STEM courses. I currently have a outside research position as a visiting USC student in Image Machine Learning, and a prior internship working for the government with data analytics. 

Additionally, I do photography on my spare time, I'm the offical photographer, and social media marketing manager / scaler for the football team, I love creating cinematic films with my Blackmagic Pocket camera and post them online, and I am passionate about creating a positive impact in low income communities by working with Pro Bono communities, as I am myself a low income and first generation American, and first generation college student.

On paper I sound like a good student that should have a chance at some top private schools.

The problem is the context.

I am diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, Severe Anxiety, Persistent Depressive Disorder, and PTSD, some since the age of 2 so I've always carried a neurodivergent label.

When the pandemic started, I live in a studio apartment with two other family members and that was extremely difficult for me. I couldn't concentrate at all with academics because everyone would make noise and when the pandemic first started everything was closed and I was honestly scared to go out anyways, so I would have to use the restroom to do assignments or just have time to myself or I would suddenly break into meltdowns.

I couldn't see my friends at all because of COVID when it happened and I felt extremely anxious, I would get constant meltdowns, panic attacks, overstimulated. Then family issues arose and I was pinned in the middle of everything. My close aunt and uncle suddenly got mad at me, my entire family was dividing for something that was honestly trivial at best. I was being told that I was worthless by some cousins. It was painful for me, it was too much for me to render all simultaneously. 

I then tried ending myself one night around July 2020...

But as you can probably tell, that was unsuccessful. 

I woke up in a hospital, and I stayed there for a week. I had to do an intensive therapy and group therapy for at least two weeks where I couldn't leave the hospital at all, and then another two weeks where I was finally permitted to go to my house and be taken to sessions. 

From that incident however, my depression exacerbated. I developed honestly weird fears looking at it now, all my ""friends"" blocked me and kicked me out of their lives because they found out I was Autistic from that incident and one of them told me ""we don't want to be friends with someone weird.""

So I had no friends, no one to talk to, I was stuck in a tiny studio apartment with no privacy to myself, my anxiety was at a all time high, I felt horrible for letting discriminating and abelistic comments like ""Your retarded ass will never be successful"" get to me.

So how does all of this relate to academics and the context?

As you can imagine, trying to juggle my disabilities, experiences, depression, and academics is quite a challenge, let alone in a pandemic. 

For the Fall 2020 semester, I was going to therapy sessions to help my depression and cope with my Autism and ADHD at least three times a week. Even though it was a lot, and I was already going through a lot to begin with, I had extremely, and I mean extremely high expectations for myself and presumed I can manage both of my responsibilities. 

Halfway through the semester I had realized this was horrible idea and I should've prioritized my mental health firstly. I had three C's, a F, and only one A. I had to get a Withdrawal (W) for a class I knew I was for sure failing, I ended up failing my first class ever with a NP, I got a A, and A-, and then I got a C+ for another class but I took it as a Pass grade instead because as many of you probably know, many universities and colleges temporarily expanded the Pass No Pass grading system as a byproduct of COVID.

Spring 2021 semester came and my depression escalated. I now had trouble trusting people (At one point I stopped eating from random strangers, such as restaurants because I thought the food and drinks were poisoned), I still had no friends, I had been virtually home 24/7 for about seven months continously at this point. I now had to do therapy for longer, at least five times a week.

I still didn't know when to give up however. I enrolled in another five courses and thought I could stick it out until the end. I had an option of taking an exucsed Leave of Absence, which looking back I should've taken, but I still decided to start what I eventually needed to finish.

By May, I was finally getting progress done with my anxiety and depression, I found that aforementioned love for photography and film, and I started to for the first time in nearly a year see myself under a positive light; I no longer saw disgust in every inch of myself.

Because I was prioritizing my mental health so much, this came at the cost of my grades for Spring 2021.

I thankfully passed all courses, even the one I retook because I withdrew in Fall 2020 (which was Calc 3). Unfortunately, all my grades were horrible. I had two C-'s, one C, a C+, and my highest grade was actually Calc 3 but just a B-. So to save my GPA, I had to take each and every single one of my classes Pass No Pass so I have a semester on my transcript where I had 20 units, or 5 courses that just have Pass (P) grades.

Additionally, because I had nothing lined up for me besides filming documentaries for clients around Downtown LA in the summer, I decided to take four summer school courses this past summer. I took an introductory Bio course that I got an A on, an intro Macro Econ course I got an A on again, the Differential Equations course I got an A- on, and a Linear Circuits course that was just way too hard for me and I got a B- on and Passed that one (P) instead.

So as you know now, even though I have a 3.929 GPA, it would realistically be a 2.5 or even less if it weren't for Pass No Pass grades.

I feel like I ruined my chances at top private colleges that I'm actually intrigued by because I want to go for a blend of Analytical Business, Financial Engineering, or if no schools have that just Industrial Engineering as a last resort major.

Carnegie Mellon has a Computational Finance major that intrigues me a lot as I'm interested in the field of practical interest in finance, and numerical methods intersected with statistics and computatuonal methods, which I would've used to double major with a Business or their unique Artificial Intelligence major.

Columbia University similarly has a Operations Research, Financial Engineering major that peaks my interest, I would love to double major with their Data Science program and living in New York would be a dream come true for me, even if only for a couple of years.

MIT has a Business Analytics program that encompasses a blend of Business, Big Data and it's purpose in the business scope, and Computer Science, but all of that practically applied with Business which is extremely exciting for me. Additionally, they have a Financial Engineering research lab I would see myself performing research at constantly and their WISE program sounds intriguing to me as a entrepreneur minded person.

USC, where I'm performing research at also has a Computer Science and Business Administration program. While it sounds interesting to me, it doesn't necessarily intersect and applies both of those fields together, it's more of a double major of sorts, but they have a Financial Engineering Masters program and a 4+1 Bachelors / Masters program where I could get the FinEng degree.

Unfortunately, it feels like I can only forget about those dreams of mine because it feels like I ruined my chances. I know as a transfer these colleges have extremely low acceptance rates, but with the staggering amount of Pass grades I had to take, it feels like I have no chance at this point. 

This comes to the question of how would I justify all of this when applying for my transfer.

How would I write my application statements in a way where it doesn't sound like I couldn't handle the academic rigor of my courses? I know I could've easily gotten at least a B, or even A's in courses I had to take Pass grades for or withdraw under normal circumstances, but of course what I had to go through were no normal circumstances, where my grades I earned don't reflect my academic potential at all.

How could I write my essays in a way where it doesn't sound like I don't handle stress well, which I don't, but I don't want the admissions officers to know that part of me because that wouldn't look well at all.

How would I basically be able to most optimally justify, me? I obviously can't say things like ""I tried ending myself"" or ""I had to take intensive therapy to improve my mental health"" on my applications. 

These past one in a half years have quite literally been the most intensive years of my life, where I was pushed beyond my boundaries, quite literally starred death in the eye, but came through and became a better individual for myself.

I now live in a solo studio near my Community College by myself so I won't get simulated by people or noises when studying, I'm working harder on academics, and I'm aiming for straight A's in my courses this semester!

I want to see if there's any advice overall for my application that I can work on or implement in addition to what I already have. I would really love to see myself in a school like Carngeie Mellon or MIT where I'm taking advantage of the breadth of resources that interest me a bunch, and I want to see if there are ways to tailor my application essays in a way that help me and not disclose sensitive information, or if I simply don't have a chance at all."
pt3yn2,3,2021-09-22,Got a job offer (Belgium). Should I take it?,JadedJerboa,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/pt3yn2/got_a_job_offer_belgium_should_i_take_it/,"Hey all,

I graduated this year with a master in comp sci, but with little work experience (no internships).
I've been applying to jobs for a month or so now, mostly for software developer / engineer roles, and most of them through a recruiter contacting me first through LinkedIn and the like.
I've gotten a couple job offers now, all of them from consulting firms.

My best offer so far is 2600€/mo gross with company car and fuel card and all the usual benefits. Also probably wouldn't be eligible for a raise in the first year.

I tried to aim a bit higher in an interview for another consulting company, asking for 2700 gross, but they seemed a bit shocked I wanted that and a company car as a new graduate and said that is usually offered to people with a few years of experience.

Do you think the 2600 offer is a fair starting salary for someone with my profile? Or should I keep searching? I'm having a tough time judging what a fair salary would be. I just want to avoid finding out later that I was actually underpaid, as one of my main motivations for even doing a masters was to be able to get a nice salary starting out.

Anyway what do you guys think? Any advice would be highly appreciated :)"

I'm a 25 year-old Aussie on my first year of a Bachelor of CS. I'm under no illusion that a CS degree on its own is anything close to making me employable since I don't have a lifelong history in computing, so I'll have to put in some extra work to stand a chance.

I was looking for some advice on the sort of things I can do in the next few years to improve my chances of finding work. Obviously internships and personal projects would be good, though internships aren't that prolific in Australia and usually only want graduates or near-graduates so may not be an option for a couple of years. And of course Leetcode grinding seems to be a thing, so I'll be working on that.

But are there more specific things I should look into, that may not be obvious to a CS student? Perhaps certain technologies or concepts I should work with on my own that will make me employable? I enjoy maths so I've been using my electives this year to study calculus, but perhaps there's better topics I should be focusing on?"

Unfortunately, I haven't done any internships at any big companies. I'm an EU citizen. I'm thinking about moving to Berlin (close) or London (English is my only fluent foreign language).

&amp;#x200B;

1. What position should I apply to? Should I look for a new grad opportunity, considering I'll be just after graduation? Or should I go for regular offers, considering my experience?
2. When should I apply? I know that if I wanted an internship I'd have to start applying now. What about new grad/regular offers?
3. How should my financial expectations look like? Currently, I'm making quite good money for my country standards and don't want to downgrade too much.
4. Do you have any recommendations for preparation for system design questions? I'm looking for quality and comprehensive study materials. I'm not sure about my skills in this field and would like something to check and enhance my knowledge. I have a few books on my to-read list, but I'm looking for something general."

pte1sy,2,2021-09-22,Should I negotiate my entry-level offer?,Christian2707,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/pte1sy/should_i_negotiate_my_entrylevel_offer/,"Hi everyone, thanks to this sub's guidance I was able to secure a FT offer for the trading platform I interned for over the summer. The role is a Client Services Associate and it would start after I graduate next June.

Comp: $60k base, 5k target bonus, 4 weeks PTO, Medical, dental and vision plus 401k match(not sure the actual number but could ask).

I currently live in NYC and have a military background, due to this being my only internship throughout college, I don't necessarily know the process behind negotiating for a higher base or other benefits. Does anyone think I should try to negotiate?

I don't have another offer to leverage, but I am in the final round for an Investment Research position at an AM here in NYC. I'm thinking to just accept the Client Services and reneg later if I get that offer, but just looking to get some insight on this thanks!"

I know programming languages, have an app with almost 1,800 downloads and 1,000 accounts made with a link to that on my CV (I figured maybe that separates me? Shows I have initiative?).

ptjlcb,194,2021-09-22,Advice/Guide to New UW Students,[deleted],udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ptjlcb/adviceguide_to_new_uw_students/,"This is dedicated to people that want to maximize their college experience and either come from nothing and/or really just wanna run it up 💰Make the most of all the tuition you’re paying already lol might as well 🤷🏽‍♂️

I’m a senior my final quarter in UW CSE. I’m Mexican and my family EFC is $0 so I come from the bottom of the bottom. This has been the biggest advantage for me going into UW CSE, as I’ve found more doors opened for me than I could have ever dreamed of. I’m a grinder, so I spent so much time maximizing the resources here.

You're gonna meet the smartest people you've ever met in your life, and once you graduate you're gonna have connections to every big company all over the world. Here’s some of the things I’ve learned over my years here:

\*note this is especially helpful for CS/Info majors but doesn’t mean you can’t look into it too :)

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Social + Study**: Use the Pomodoro study technique or find something that works. Talk to as many people in your classes as you can, f\*\*\* being shy it'll pay off pretty hard early on you'll see. Make study groups whenever you can, a lot of people don't talk to each other especially in the beginning so just ask anyone to study w u and they'll almost always say yes. You can reserve some of the really nice study spaces around campus here (not all are open cuz COVID): [lib.washington.edu/services/spaces/study](http://lib.washington.edu/services/spaces/study). USE THE ACADEMIC SUPPORT PROGRAMS! Its free homework and class help from people that know their stuff that can get you through basically every intro class and well into your major: [academicsupport.washington.edu](http://academicsupport.washington.edu/).
2. **More Social:** There’s even a bowling alley, e-sports room, and arcade to hang out at: [hub.washington.edu/play](http://hub.washington.edu/play). Canoes and kayaks at the waterfront: [washington.edu/ima/waterfront/boat-rentals](http://washington.edu/ima/waterfront/boat-rentals). Explore the Ave w someone, find your fav food places.
3. **Fitness:** Go to the gym please. Don’t even have to go crazy hard, you’re already paying for it in tuition so go on the treadmill for 30min after class every day. You’ll be feeling amazing in no time. There’s intermural sports leagues for anyone that wants to play a sport regularly but isn’t pro. There’s rock climbing, swimming, martial arts, yoga, archery, even a golf range, you name it they most likely got it: [washington.edu/ima](http://washington.edu/ima).
4. **Clubs**: There’s an insane amount of clubs so just spend a day going through this directory and find something that interests you: [huskylink.washington.edu](http://huskylink.washington.edu/). You can make electric cars, bikes, your own canoe, and a bunch of other clubs that look insanely good on a resume + there's some just plain fun ones (find people in your niche like Movie Club).
5. **Health:** Use Hall Health’s resources. Schedule times during your quarter to talk to a psychologist, getting your mental on point is key to everything. You also get one FREE checkup per quarter. Also they got free condoms (stay safe y’all)!!
6. **Food:** There’s a really nice FREE(!!!) food pantry that every UW student get access to once a week: [washington.edu/anyhungryhusky/the-uw-food-pantry](http://washington.edu/anyhungryhusky/the-uw-food-pantry). You can also sign up for SNAP benefits (free money to spend on food every month) if you’re at least part time: [washington.edu/financialaid/types-of-aid/food-stamps](http://washington.edu/financialaid/types-of-aid/food-stamps).
7. **Electronics:** You don’t have to buy almost any electronic. You can rent really nice cameras (started me off on my pro photography journey), laptops, lighting equipment for potential YT channels or TikToks, calculators, tablets (including the new iPad Pro), speakers, projectors, mics, and even VR headsets: [stlp.uw.edu](https://stlp.uw.edu). Allowed me to save up enough money until I could get my own (theres also student discounts at the Microsoft and Apple Store among others). I’m a computer expert so lmk if you need help buying something.
8. **Maker Space + Studio:** UW Maker Space ([hfs.uw.edu/The-Mill/maker-space](http://hfs.uw.edu/The-Mill/maker-space)) offers 3D printers, vinyl cutters, computers w free Adobe software, sewing and embroidery machines, and even circuit board stations among others. Between this and #7 you can literally start your own online company. There’s also a **music** **studio** w all the equipment you’d ever need to record songs or just mess around in. Pretty crazy.
9. **Credit Card:** Drop whatever you're doing and get a credit card (start once you’re 18), get this one its for people that don't have credit yet: [**discover.com/credit-cards/secured/**](http://discover.com/credit-cards/secured/)
10. **Coding\*:** Literally spend your free time on [**leetcode.com**](http://leetcode.com/) just practicing coding questions, the earlier you get an internship the easier it'll be to get future ones. Look through Harvard CS50's course to get a good start on fundamentals. Sign up for Dubhacks even if you don’t know s\*\*\*, I met a bunch of really cool juniors and seniors that guided me my first year even though I didn’t have experience: [dubhacks.co](http://dubhacks.co/). Also CS kids use the labs pls they have 4K monitors, nice ass chairs, remote desktop, snack bar (not free but cheaper than the rest of campus) and FREE printing (unfortunately it costs money on the rest of campus).
11. **Research:** Find a field you're interested and find the contact info of faculty members and ask for research positions in their labs or w grad students they know. The earlier you do this the better but you might struggle to find a position early on, just keep trying.
12. **Student Jobs:** You can do work study and you'll get extra money every quarter (you can work up to the amount that's included in your award letter under the work study section), an example is working in Local Pointe. There's also jobs that are on campus but aren't work study, they're limited to UW students and its separate from work study so you don't need to have that offer in your aid letter to apply, an example is the Allen School Ambassador position.
13. **College Tax Credits**: American opportunity tax credit, can get extra money from the gov for two separate years during college (as long as you're full time), worth filing your taxes even if you don't have a job for this reason.
14. **Internships\*:** Find a list of freshman internships/opportunities on Reddit and apply to all of them, they're specially designed for people just starting college so you have a higher chance of getting in + you'll meet dope ass people. Check out Microsoft New Tech especially I did that and it was a great experience.
15. **Financial Aid:** You can get enough financial aid/scholarships/grants that UW pays YOU every quarter for your expenses, I started off with receiving $2k every quarter and got all the way to $6k/quarter. There’s a cap on this (I think 8k for in-state but I could be wrong), so apply to every scholarship that you can. APPLY TO EMERGENCY AID WHEN YOU’RE IN FINANCIAL NEED: [washington.edu/emergencyaid](http://washington.edu/emergencyaid) (will open when quarter starts, can usually apply a couple times a quarter).
16. **Finances + Investing:** Once you start making money start making your money work for you, forget about spending it. Move all your money to an FDIC-insured high interest savings account (bankrate.com/banking/savings/best-high-yield-interests-savings-accounts/). Or spend it on niches/things that will retain value. I wasted a lot of it on video games and other things that didn’t hold their value. If you play your cards right you could easily have 50k+ before you even graduate (I didn’t have loans). More financial advice at the bottom of the post if you’re interested. If you're interested in **options trading** check this video out: [**youtube.com/watch?v=SD7sw0bf1ms&amp;t=1588s**](http://youtube.com/watch?v=SD7sw0bf1ms&amp;t=1588s)
17. **License + Car:** Get a license even if you're not planning to get a car, it'll drop your insurance rates by hundreds when you got that 🔥 internship money to get one. Use Zipcar to get around Seattle, theres a discount for students so you don’t even need to get your own car.
18. **UW Student Discounts:** Here’s a website that lists all the discounts UW students receive: [thewholeu.uw.edu/tag/discounts/](http://thewholeu.uw.edu/tag/discounts/). You can go to the zoo for cheap and visit some of the museums around Seattle on a discount.
19. **Textbooks:** You don’t necessarily have to pay for textbooks (especially in your later classes), you can find plenty of links online just search Reddit. Some classes unfortunately tie their participation grade to online versions of the textbook so just take the L on those.
20. **Scholarships:** You can get scholarships for study abroad so you can basically go for free, checkout the Gilman Scholarship, also the Allen School has a lot of scholarships (some departments offer scholarships for in-major students, usually starts your second year as the application period is during the summer).
21. **AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, for everyone but especially the bros**: Up your fashion/general glow game i see too many damn people rocking sweats and tech t-shirts for all 4/5 years they’re at UW. Go to H&amp;M or Pacsun or literally any decent place at the mall, GET A BEARD by using minoxidil (i went from baby face to full facial hair) OR LEARN TO TRIM IT PLS get a Philips Norelco ($50), use teeth whitening strips, go to the dentist, (**GIRLS** wash your hair yes we can see the oil + fix your **anterior pelvic tilt** (Google)), look up videos on fixing your posture, use chapstick, PLS USE DEODORANT, find fashion YTers, cut your damn nails, get basic skin treatment products, go to the barber at least every other month, get your eyebrows done, GET A TONGUE BRUSH, use floss, get separate body wash and shampoo (i’m looking at you Irish Spring 5000 in 1), get a Korean body scrubber or loofah (you’re welcome, no your hands are not enough it helps w body acne), get a nice perfume/cologne at Sephora, use moisturizer. I found all this info cuz i was sick of lookin like a scrub, looks aren’t everything ofc but these are the basics and they’ll help get your confidence up.

Bonus: Apply to this [**foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/undergraduate-entrepreneurship/lavin-entrepreneurship-program**](http://foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/undergraduate-entrepreneurship/lavin-entrepreneurship-program), which is now OPEN and closes October 24th, its a program that lets you meet CEOs around the Seattle area and meet a bunch of amazing people, also consider doing the Entrepreneurship minor they give you money to make your own company.

This isn’t a definitive guide but it should help you navigate UW and set you up for success. Also don't drink too much alcohol it makes you sluggish and will decrease your physical wellbeing (I notice even one glass in the gym the next day) but remember to have fun every once in a while (finding a balance is key tbh you're prob gon struggle for your first few years w this).

As recently as last quarter I was an Allen School ambassador so I’d be down to schedule some relaxed office hours to answer any questions y’all have. Thanks and good luck y’all! DM me here or on IG if you have more questions: [instagram.com/geov.cas](http://instagram.com/geov.cas).

Edit: More bonus stuff, if you gotta gaming PC use it to mine Ethereum, or better yet look into crypto lending exchanges, you basically lend whatever crypto you own and earn interest off it. Look into registering an LLC and you can start your business credit score if you're ever thinking of opening up one in the future.

Edit 2: For those interested, here’s the approach I took to financials. What i’d recommend is: 

1. I transferred all of my money from BECU (0.5% interest rate up to $500) to Varo Bank (this gave me a rate of 1.5% up to 10K, which was considered high during the pandemic, there’s probably better ones out there now) 
2. Learn about stocks and options in general ofc but especially learn the Greeks (youtu.be/SD7sw0bf1ms) 
3. Learn technical analysis (youtu.be/eynxyoKgpng)
4. Develop a trading strategy (mainly for long term stocks)
5. Get some graphing software (I recommend Trading View)
6. Stocks: Place 80% of your whatever amount you’re comfortable investing into long term stocks
7. Options: Once you’ve learned your stuff place 20% in options. I chose to implement a 20% gain target and a -20% stop loss (tune to your risk level)
8. Remember time in the market beats timing the market after all. At the end of the day I know jack shit compared to big investors but this is what I’ve been able to learn during the pandemic, educate yourself and hopefully the concept at least piques your interest!"
ptkjkq,2,2021-09-22,Job offered for Internship but unsure if I want to accept?,sxbrii,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ptkjkq/job_offered_for_internship_but_unsure_if_i_want/,"Hi guys, I’ve been having trouble on figuring out if I really want to accept this offer for this company, but I feel almost desperate at this moment. I’m a recent college graduate with a B.A in Media Studies and I have been in the stressful and dreadful job hunting period in my life. I recently had a phone interview with a start-up type company, which was followed up with a video interview with the founder of the company yesterday. I received a phone call that I was offered the internship, with a $16 per hour wage. Yet I’m iffy about the option because I was not given time to think about this much. To preface this, the job is in the Bay Area of California, and I reside about 45-50 minutes (without traffic) to this location. (I believe it’s about 1.5 hours with the daily morning commute). The founder/CEO of the company called me herself and said I would need to accept the offer by the end of day today as they have an event coming up in 8 days, and want me to start work tomorrow. She did she would send me the contract as I email her my acceptance, but I was not sure what the contract would entail as well. Is it possible to accept the offer and ask for the contract before fully committing?"

I am conflicted between two offers. Both places I have worked at before as an intern and I think I would enjoy the work more at F500.

**Offer 1: tech company in SF**

TC: $180k first year, then $160k recurring.

Pros: Well known name would be easy to jump to other Bay Area companies (Networking opportunities better). Office would have better perks.

Cons: SF is VHCOL, I have no family in SF, I would have to share room or rent small studio apartment, work would be more niche.

**Offer 2: F500 company mid-level position (Remote/office in my local area LCOL/MCOL)**

TC: $140k first year, $125k recurring.

Pros: Familiar with area, family nearby, existing support system, can actually afford a house (plenty of houses under $300k with good school districts), I can also live rent free with parents. Can visit grandparents and extended family.

Cons: Not as prestigious company. Would be harder to jump to top tech companies later down the line even if I went to top school?

Other benefits are pretty much the same for both.

I'm am leaning towards offer 2 but I don't want FOMO for offer 1.

Would not working at a top tech company look bad if I interned at one if I decide I want to get a job at top tech or hft?

Has anyone been in a similar situation and what did you decide and did you have any regrets?"

Positives:

- Money

- Strong name + work with talented people

- Fast-changing code base so good design patterns are key (whereas in startups code often gets super hacky)

Cons:

- Legacy/Proprietary stack doesn't necessarily yield very transferable skills

Had the first of my technical interviews on Monday, and thought that it went so bad that I would never be able to show my face in public again. It was actually so terrible and I was berating myself about it - I didn't get nearly an optimal solution for either of the problems and the interviewer was speaking so softly that I was frequently speaking over him and having to ask him to repeat himself. It was embarrassing, awkward, and I wanted to die.  I got off the call thinking that he must have been wondering how I had even passed the resume screen.

Today they emailed me saying they want me to come back for the final interview, and I am genuinely shocked. So I just wanted to get on and say this: **no one will be harder on yourself than you**. I was picking apart everything I did and said in that interview and telling myself it was terrible. I wish that I had just relaxed and been a bit less harsh on myself.

But hear me out. So far we are not using any Java in our company   
(I am pioneer BI manager there and all data infrastructure was defined by me)  
So my choice of tool was obviously Python. 

However I see that many people are using Java for more advanced stuff. 

What I noticed so far: 

pros:  
\+faster data transformation in case of big data, complicated things,   
\+MLops is much more achievable (doing ML decisions in real time, is not as bloated as in python)  
\+Kafka, Jenkins and lots of other tools are Java native, so interacting with them should be easier if I understand Java

cons:  
\-Java employees/ data interns need more time to learn, ask for higher salaries compared to python, so its harder to scale   
\-coding takes longer than python, you need to define everything in more detailed way  
\-if transformations are mostly done in ELT way, Java speed is not that impactful anyways. 

Another thing is that at manager level, I should probably focus more on softskills slowly instead of other programming language (However I guess more technical, DE managers are paid 1 level more). 

Other thing that is fascinating me, and I barely understand is Kafka, that I cannot even deep dive into that much without knowing Java.

So, would you say that its worth to learn for me? Did I miss something from pros/ cons?"

But by his offer I feel like I’d be taking an easy route again, I feel like Im so privileged to even get this opportunity all cuz of my brother who worked hard to be in that position. Now, I wouldn’t be getting the intern simply, no, I’ll have to study and pass the interview but I can’t help but feel a bit upset, I feel so unsure in myself cuz I’m so lazy and stupid. I cant do anything by myself and I fear that if my bro doesn’t help me, I’d prolly never succeed anywhere.

I'm just in such a hole where Im not confident in anything I do , and no matter what i’ll have my family to help me out :( I guess I just want a different perspective to look at things, I just feel so guilty, cuz other people struggle and succeed while I’m a fake who cant do anything on my own.

(I’m not here to gloat Or show off, I’m genuinely upset, I have no one else to ask except here. )"
pu4gpq,1,2021-09-23,Is it better to stay in my current job or take this new offer?,AshGotKillz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pu4gpq/is_it_better_to_stay_in_my_current_job_or_take/,"Some background to the position I’m in: after months of applying after finishing my cs degree I finally secured a software engineering position. The interview process with this company was long as they eventually told me after a few interviews that a contract fell through and they didn’t have a position for me anymore, but then turned around a few weeks later saying that they figured something out for me. My interviewers seemed to really like me and I liked them so it was a very happy moment when they finally offered me the job. I accepted the position at 70k without any negotiation because I was fresh out of college and was happy with that number. I’ve been working at this company for a little over a month and so far it’s been great, I’ve been learning a lot, they have great PTO and benefits, and my managers seem to like the work that I’m putting in.

HOWEVER, out of the blue a couple days ago an old supervisor of mine from an old internship I had reach out to me saying he wants to offer me a position with the company he works at. Pros for this job are the pay would be closer to 115k, there would be a couple people there that I’ve worked with before, and it would be fully remote (the job I’m at now is remote for now but may go back in person next year and would be an hour long commute for me). I still need to ask more questions about the position, benefits, and what working there is like but it seems like a great company as well.

So, is it a bad thing to leave a company after 1 month when they were working hard to find an open position for me and I am actually really enjoying the job? I keep thinking about the 115k salary though. I’m not sure if that is a good enough reason to leave a job that I already know I really enjoy and that I haven’t been working at that long. My supervisor also said that it’s a good possibility that if I wanted to join them in like 6 months instead, that they’d probably still have a job for me then too. Which is making me think maybe I should stick to my current job for now and try to switch sometime next year.

If anyone had any advice or ideas please let me know!"
pu5ais,3,2021-09-23,Coding Exercise Preparation,Due-Pin3487,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pu5ais/coding_exercise_preparation/,"Hi, y'll. I am new to Reddit. I hope to know more CS people or STEM people here. I joined Reddit because I heard back from Google. Because I applied for Software Engineering Internship Winter 2022 and Summer 2022 positions. The email mentioned about completing two coding exercises. It is to give them a sense of my coding skills in this 90-minute exercise. I’ll have to solve two problems using your choice of C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, or Python languages. So, personally, I am confident with JavaScript and Python. I have little experience in other languages. I am not fully good with JavaScript and python either. I struggle with solving leetcode problems.

This is my first CS coding exercise interview. I just started applying to internships. So, I don't have much experience at all besides college projects. I will appreciate it if any of you can share your experience with google coding exercises, or where did you practice it. Or if you can recommend to me what to do to be fully prepared to solve the coding exercises? I have to be prepared by September 28th. I will really appreciate your help."
pu5d9z,5,2021-09-23,0.X to hero.X,Curious_Display1322,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pu5d9z/0x_to_herox/,"So here's my position. It's incredibly rare how much of a disservice I've done my whole career. I am employed right now but probably don't deserve to be. Many of you may think I'm doomed and you may be right in thinking so.

-start college abroad at a difficult tech school

-didn't make it there, transfer back to a below average state school here

-take a year off in between for an Android internship with a great company.

-graduate, great company doesn't want me (they said they would, oof but looking back they made the right decision)

-get a job in the legacy java / retail POS  sphere 65k + full benefits.

-don't realize it but I have bipolar disorder. This is where things get interesting.

-act a complete fool of myself in company-wide meetings, delusions of grandeur and dunning-kruger take control

-quit after 5 months of complaining for my friend's start up (unpaid, sheesh).

-find another job within 2 months. Contract to hire with technology wing of a major grocery store (63k, no bennies til conversion)

-chill internal inventory project, I demonstrate some knowledge of the platform and show potential in code reviews.

-8 months in a massive manic episode uproots my whole life. I throw my job away RIGHT before conversion to FTE (dang it)

-try to move across the country with no job and no plan, I'll figure it out when I get there.

-didn't work out, come back after 5 months literally losing everything down to my clothes. Unbelievable depression and social isolation ensue.

-sketchy recruitment firm doctors my resume (yes, I know) and manages to score another Android contract gig with a financial company.

-goals of project very convoluted, barely anything expected or delivered.

-I'm really depressed, doing next to nothing but it doesn't seem to matter for this role (75k  WFH no bennies)

-3 months in, 2 reviews down but no mention of performance. There seems to be a shortage of out of work developers who can answer an interview question so I guess I'm in luck there.

I'm 26, at my age plenty of people I know have matured into senior level / full stack roles. There's even been time for people to switch careers and be ahead of me. My colleagues from that tech school are working for top startups and it was never more apparent how different we are now.

Do I need a time machine to fix my career? My resume is broken but surely hard skills will outweigh that in the future. I have next to no skills right now, 8 years after starting school. That's my biggest concern. How badly would I have to want it to get somewhere I could be proud of?

I figured most people on this sub can't even fathom being in my position. It's completely miserable and I serve as an example of how not to be. But what would you recommend someone like me? I have to work with what I got... I don't think I'd make a good plumber lol."
pu5fmm,14,2021-09-23,"[Advice] As an average college student, all I know is how much I don't know",mochi_the_cat3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pu5fmm/advice_as_an_average_college_student_all_i_know/,"I am not that great at programming, I don´t spend my free time programming, and I am very often reminded that I have no clue how this career works outside of school besides the fundamentals of a few languages.   


Am I the only one? I (a woman) am surrounded by men who seem to love what they are doing, breathe programming, and have a straight path. I do my work and try to get by (I am studying in another country and learning in a language that isn´t English)  


When looking at intern descriptions, job descriptions, and mock interviews, most of it flies over my head. This may partly be due to being in the fourth semester, however, I feel that there is so much information to digest, so much lingo to learn, and so many people willing to fill these jobs that are, quite honestly, more qualified than me.

I like programming, I find it interesting, and I take comfort in the fact that my interest in tech and strong soft skills provide me with the opportunity to do many different roles, not just be a programmer. However, it isn´t my passion, and I don´t have any real applicable knowledge or projects under my belt.

Has anyone else dealt with these feelings? How do you get past them, and more importantly, how do you learn what you need to learn, or better yet, understand how to sort through the pile of information in order to tailor a path that doesn´t end in failed interviews after graduation?"

If I’m unable to get a SWE internship, and instead apply to the masters program in CS at UT, how likely is it that I get in (with a pretty good GPA and CS work)? On the website, it claims that I need to have an undergraduate degree in CS to be competitive for admission - is this actually true?"

He said yeah and that i could consider myself his intern. I haven’t done anything yet for him but the idea was that i help develop his businesses website or something. Do I have to be formally hired or need paperwork to show proof just in case colleges check to see if my internship is legit? Because technically I do have one but it’s just not on paper and I haven’t done much yet.

I was waitlisted for UIUC, but ended up not getting in.

I'm am indian male, 19 years old.

My major is CS, 31/36 ACT, and 37/45 IB score

My  work experience include 2x  one month long internships at start-ups as a  web developer/software engineer, and 1 full time work experience  (around 10 months) as a software developer. I do have some side  projects, mostly mini web projects, and an app on the play store and app  store

I also have some community service, which I did as a part of CAS for the IB.

Has anyone from Northeastern gotten in to UIUC as a spring semester transfer applicant? Do you think it is worth applying?"

pu7tvs,84,2021-09-23,My horrible experience interviewing at a FAANG company - a rant,CuriousGeorgeIX,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/pu7tvs/my_horrible_experience_interviewing_at_a_faang/,"I just had an interview at a FAANG company and without a doubt, it has to be one of the worst interview experiences I've had, second only to one interview I had a few years ago, at the same company. This experience made me decide I'm done with this company. I've never had interviews go this wrong and the only two exceptions were with the same people.

Admittedly, I did not do my best and was not as prepared as I should have been. However, looking back, I'm unsure how I could have prepared for the kinds of useless 'imagine...' and 'what if...' questions I was asked. The company was great about recommending prep materials and a rubric on which skills they were looking to assess but I could not for the life of me figure out what the interviewer was trying to assess.

Furthermore, he was awful at actual interviewing. I'm not sure how much training interviewers are given before they sit down with candidates but some of the mishaps that happened are simply common sense practices to avoid. Dude straight up questioned whether I had the experience I 'claimed' and 'alleged' (his words) to have. He looked so uninterested when I was talking about my experience and even yawned at some point.

He gave me a technical question that was on the hard side for the new grad position, then sat back in silence as I first of all tried to figure out what he was even asking as it was so badly phrased, then tried to talk through a solution. He cut me off multiple times to pivot to completely different questions or move on and I left never having solved a single question from start to finish. He kept saying 'Obviously you should...' and 'Well that's wrong...' to hypothetical scenarios questions even though the end result was same. It was clear he had already made up his mind within the first 5 minutes of the interview as his tone and word choice implied I wasn't going to get the job right off the bat.

This interviewer made me question every single class and internship I've done and whether I was in the right field. Then thinking about it a while later, I realized that although I did not do my best, his communication skills and prior decision had a lot to do with how the interview went. He let me know the person who got the job would be working with him and I decided almost immediately to withdraw my application as I don't want to work with such a personality in the event he has a change of heart and decides to move me forward.

Some advice, keep your head up. Sometimes you'll crush an interview, other times you'll get questions you have no idea how to answer and sometimes, everything will go very very wrong. Just keep your head up."
pu809h,6,2021-09-23,Advice for well paying IT internships or entry level Jobs?,HeLlAMeMeS123,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/pu809h/advice_for_well_paying_it_internships_or_entry/,"This feels like a weird place to ask this, but hey, if anybody would know, it would be yall.  I'm a 19yr old college student, I'm 1 year into my Cyber Security degree with 3 certifications, and I'm looking to get started in the IT field for the much-needed professional experience.  I currently have experience working IT for a Texas Youth group hosted at a church, and I'm working under contract at Texas Instruments.  So I think that I have the experience, but every place I've looked at asks for 5 years of experience and a bachelor's degree for an ENTRY LEVEL JOB.  Does anyone on this sub have any companies that will hire an intern still in college with no degree for decent(ish) pay?  needs to be stationed in TX or remote.  I'm just kinda lost here.


Edit:  I got more help than I thought I would from posting here, thanks for all the ideas!  Hopefully I’ll get somewhere in IT soon."
pu88us,1,2021-09-23,"I don't have a good experience with home office, and got a paid internship offer in a big tech company, but i'm afraid if i leave after 3 ish months will be bad to get a job in my city. What should i do?",ManyObligation73,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/pu88us/i_dont_have_a_good_experience_with_home_office/,"The tech companies here in my city (in Brazil) aren't that big, but offer presential work, what i'm looking for, because i didn't like my experience with home office (12th grade in high school and a low income/stressful job). But those companies will only open it's internships probably in march or april.

And I got a offer for an internship (that after 3 months ish I will be effectivate as a junior) in a tech that pays more than my city tech companies, but the money is not the point, it's the experience. I'm pretty sure i will learn more working in the job that is home office, but i think it will be really bad for my mental health, which is not in a great shape lately. And to move to the city that the company has an office is kinda expensive, but it may be done after a while.

So the question is: if i accept the job and leave after 3\~4 months to try another one here in my city, will it be seen as something bad(especially when applying for a new internship/job)?

And if you guys can tell yours experiences in home office would be great either."
pu8ebm,9,2021-09-23,Why would they ever want me over others?,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/pu8ebm/why_would_they_ever_want_me_over_others/,"My high school graduating class is extremely competitive. I have a 4.92 GPA and I can't even guarantee that I'm top 5. Probably someone has above a 5.0 GPA (we use a 4.0 weighted scale). There are many students with higher SAT scores than my 1510 and someone even has a perfect 1600. There are many students who do sports and have leadership positions in clubs. I don't lead any clubs (but I expect to lead a club starting next week). The guy with the perfect SAT even has a job (I know it's common to have one at this age but it hurts me a little extra since I can't find any weaknesses in him...). I have an internship directly in my field of study (computer science), though. I do music. He does music. I do clubs. He does clubs. He has better grades than me. The worst part is that all of my competition wants to major in a technology/STEM field.

Today during lunch I had a discussion with a friend about college. After screwing up my ACT, I told him that I have decided to go with my SAT and he told me that his honest opinion is that I have no chance. I don't care about criticism; I will take it 100%. I wasn't offended. His reason was that they (not just Mr. Perfect) have better grades than me (there are possibly 5 others who have above a 4.95 GPA). My subconscious hope is that my competition will get cocky and not try on their college essays and interviews (I thought this because they seem to effortlessly beat me, so why should they try on these parts of the application?). My friend told me that it is not the case, and that they are trying their hardest. That actually made me happy -- that I was not losing to people who didn't have to try to beat me. So then, what makes us different?

I have thought this over for a while and I really cannot think of anything that can set me apart from them. At this point, I see this as a numbers game. There is one difference, but I won't go into too much detail about it here (because it's against the rules). They are all Asian, and I am white (I'm actually, white, black, and Asian, but I look white). To be honest, I don't see how this can benefit me, but you can tell me if you have any ideas.

Anyway, my thought is that if I make it to the interviews, I can win with my personality. I believe that I am a funny guy and I am genuine. My competition is quiet and *could* come off as cocky (I'm not betting on it; they have great faking skills). They do have nerdy humor, though, and I believe colleges like that. But none of that matters! Before I make it to an interview, admissions officers must like my application. But why would they ever choose me over the big numbers? You wouldn't know; you don't know me personally, and neither do the admissions officers. What makes an admissions officer want me? I say it's statistics and grades. Only one student in my high school has been accepted to MIT (my top choice) in the past 7 years. Of course, this competition is far beyond anything the other grade levels could comprehend (when we were freshman). We all knew calculus in 9th grade!

What can I do? My dad calls Mr. Perfect (by the way, he is a Korean boy, if that helps) ""gifted"" and ""a different kind of human"". How can I compete against a robot with emotions? If I had gone to a different high school, this would have been over already. Colleges compare me with my graduating class, so this is extra hard. Why the heck would anyone see me as special?

I’m required to do the general coding assessment for an internship and would love to hear your thoughts about how to get prepared for it."
pu9qfc,8,2021-09-23,"My entire ""education"" has been a series of lies.",BlackSpidy,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/pu9qfc/my_entire_education_has_been_a_series_of_lies/,"I (27M) always had some grievances with how my schooling was done. GCP Grey said it best when he said ""School is a daycare center, crossed with an endless game of trivial pursuit"". It really was like that for me, memorize useless stuff, do all my useless homework and classwork, while not getting to rowdy with my palls and I wouldn't get in trouble  (with precious few exceptions in between). I would rarely say ""Why are we memorizing a bunch of random and useless stuff?"", the response was a cointoss between ""It's general culture, you *have* to know this stuff"" or ""this is completely useful, you'll get to college and suddenly it'll all make sense"". I was happy when I graduated highschool, ""Here comes my real education"", I thought to myself... Oh, how naive of me.

There was this one course about image manipulation that I got in school, that I absolutely loved. They showcased a tool, told us the basics of how it's used and then prompted us to use it in a way that expanded a little on what they showed us, sometimes it was even a little bit of a challenge. That was in 8th grade, and was the last time I was completely in tune with how useful and important a class was made out to be. There was a time when I was convinced that a bachelor's degree was the ""Now we teach you how to make things happen"". I had a little bit of programming knowledge at the time and I thought to myself that a computer science degree would suit me perfectly (well, a ""system's engineering"" degree, ""ingeniería en sistemas"" to be exact). Man, they just really left me out to dry. ""A thread is like, doing a single thing. So a multi-threaded process is doing two or more things at the same time. Go program a little multi-thread racing game on Java from scratch. Using libraries gets you a zero"". Long story short, I was banging my head against the wall for 3 years. 

I switched to Industrial Engineering, and at that time I had just completely given up on the practicality of the courses I was passing. And pass the courses more easily I did, I fell back into a pile of useless short-term memorization, useless classwork and useless homework. It was tough, but I had a serious case of sunk cost fallacy and my family giving me shit for not having graduated from Uni yet. So, I knew that at the end, to finally graduate, I needed a Thesis, an internship (well, supervised professional practice, ""Ejercicio Profesional Supervisado"") or 1 year's worth of a master's degree in engineering. Turns out it's pretty much a false choice. Ether way, you're stuck with a panel of old self-important assholes that will pick apart everything and anything you present to them, with the pretense that it'll make you a good engineer when you write down a bunch of useless and unnecessary bullshit. And before I start, I have to justify why. The worst part of the ""education"" I received in college was the constant demand to justify the reports that they themselves asked me to make. ""This display of the gravitational effects on this ball bearing is an illustrative and important to document. Newton's formulas- [one paragraph's worth of blablablablablabla]"" I wrote while thinking to myself ""the justification is **you** make me write these reports, to pass the class!! I  don't give a shit about this ball bearing, **I don't give a shit about this report proving that we experience gravity as an acceleration of 9.81 m/s^2**, DONT GIVE A **SHIT** ABOUT THE ROTATIONAL MOMENTUM OF THIS SPHERE, **I DON'T GIVE A** ***SHIT*** **ABOUT THIS ESTIMATE OF MEASUREMENT ERROR YOU'RE MAKING ME DO!!** It makes no sense that I and 30 other classmate make this same report that's been done by hundreds other people with minimal change. It doesn't prepare me to be an engineer, it's not even for any furthering of academic study. It's completely useless... I just want this stupid fucking degree so that I can get a living wage. God. Damn.""

My entire internship (Ejercicio Profesional Supervisado) is 6 months' worth of homework. 36 hours a week minimum. I have to document, graph, ""analyze"" (god forbid I analyze it in a way they don't approve of), present information about the company to a panel of engineers that have built their entire career in academia and wouldn't know a lathe if it bit them in the ass. Oh, and I'm not allowed to include my actions within that company as part of the internship. Documenting electricity usage? That counts. Actually changing out lightbulbs in order to not get kicked out for ""being on the computer all day""? Fuck you, that's not an engineer's work, it's not part of your internship. 

None of this makes sense, my whole career as a student has been a fucking lie and I still have to put up with these assholes for at least 10 more months. But knowing these pieces of shit, there's a bunch of hidden goalposts that you only get to know about once you've missed them. I suspect there's some sort of quid pro quo going on with getting a heads up about these arbitrary standards that randomly materialize, but I'm too scared to offer a bribe to the woman in charge of supervising my internship and giving a pass/fail on each of my reports. Good thing is that I actually get a few chances at submitting these things. It's a double-edged sword because I can fail a bunch of times and spend months just spinning my wheels, but it feels a little better than the typical ""pass this class or repeat the last 5 months' worth of classwork and exams!"".

So, anyways, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk."

I’m currently a front-end developer intern working at a slightly chaotic (but healthy) startup. I’ve done some pretty good work and learned a lot but lately i’ve been pretty sluggish. I was assigned a somewhat difficult task of reworking some things in the front-end for our mobile web app and it hasnt been going well. I haven’t really been assigned a deadline but everytime I’m close to making some progress, something magically stops working with 0 expanation which pushes me back (Welcome to RN I guess). Our codebase is super disorganized which is typical for a company our size, and this also means the engineers are too busy to help. These have all contributed to a lot of stress.

I think it would be in both mine and the companies’ best interests if I hand it off to a more experienced dev who can complete it much faster. Im just afraid to ask because theyre going to realize not much work was accomplished which may or may not make me look bad. I also feel like a bad developer for not being able to complete a task I volunteered to take on….

Im going to be very honest ive made some bad decisions but at the time it seemed like it was right. Here goes nothing:

I did a bachelors in Computer Science, barely passed. Hated coding and was not interested in any class i had taken. (I chose CS because i thought its the future and theres lots of opportunities for work and good money). I worked as a graduate android developer but my performance was below average (because of my weak base knowledge of coding and my lack of interest to improve that skill) so they transferred me to manual quality assurance.

After some time, I decided to get back in the game, this time motivated to learn coding the proper way and wanted to focus on AI. So I did a masters in artificial intelligence and machine learning at an average university (because my low GPA in my bachelors ddnt allow me to apply to top universities) and got very good grades. After I finished I started to practice coding on leetcode etc... but found it very hard to motivate myself to code and learn coding! I got accepted for an internship at an AI startup and was working on machine learning and deep learning tasks. I was really struggling with everything related to coding. (I later on found out from my manager that my performance was less than average in coding... obviously). Halfway through the internship I told them I do not want to sit behind a screen coding all day (I cant tell them that I hate coding and suck at it) and wanted something more business oriented or whatever. So they recommended Id work with the senior product manager and see if this is a good fit for me. I liked how a product manager doesnt dive too deep in the technicalities of the product and that hes more of a CEO of that product. BUT I hated the whole agile/ticket scrum system. Also I have severe stage freight and social anxiety and have a hard time doing presentations. Every time my manager calls me, in my mind im thinking please god dont let him ask me to prepare some slides to present . So, again manager says my performance is below average... So I quit. Here I am stuck with no idea what to do. I am hard worker but i am struggling to find what I want to do! Im not even applying to jobs because I dont know what to apply for!

My passion in life is cars and anything automotive related but im not sure how to move to that industry and get a decent job there .I dont want to lose all that investment in my education and the chance to land a high paying job!"

pughsl,6,2021-09-24,Quant as an Economics major,Captain_Doofus1,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/pughsl/quant_as_an_economics_major/,"Hi,

I'm an Economics major at a target school in Singapore. I'm interested in quant, but I'm unsure about whether I have a shot at it, given my non-Math/CS degree. My question is: is it reasonable for me to try to break into quant? I'm also considering doing a Master's in something STEM-based like Stats/CS/Financial Engineering, but I've come across a lot of people saying that not having a STEM Bachelor's is a huge handicap.

Here's some background on myself:

* I have a flair for math and coding, and I pick up concepts quickly. I have a high CGPA as well (3.91/4), and I have consistently been performing well academically and on standardized tests.
* Coursework:
   * CS: I'm doing a minor in Computing &amp; Data Analysis, and I've taken classes for data structures (C), object oriented programming (Java), and data science (Python).
   * Stats/Math: Within my major, I'm taking a specialization in Finance, which has a lot of statistics-heavy classes. I've taken classes in probability &amp; statistics, econometrics, econometric modeling &amp; forecasting, and mathematical finance (which had basics of Stochastic Processes and the BSM model). Additionally, I'm also overloading credits to take two Math classes: Calculus III (got a waiver for I and II), and Linear Algebra.
* I was a Data Science Intern at a start-up (non-Finance) for this summer, where I worked on time series analysis and forecasting. Learnt about LSTM models and implemented one that performed well.
* I also managed to get myself a Quant Dev internship at a Singapore-based hedge fund this winter.

I'm worried that I'm aiming for something that isn't possible because I'll be competing with equally smart people but with a STEM background. Is it reasonable to put time and energy into this? Will getting a Master's help equalize this handicap?

Thank you!"

How to solve?,catsrmyidentity,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/puimqg/might_lose_internship_over_unexpect_change_and_a/,"I (F21) fucked up. I have this great intern opportunity with a old but known studio in the animation industry.  We were planning to take advantage of a government program to finance 70% of my salary. 

Originally this was supposed to happen in August but got delayed to October due to covid. During this period a friend of mine that was also going to intern there asked for a job so she could have some money I got roped in but refused due to a family issues, she eventually also refused the job for personal reasons. 

Now we are close to applying for the fund and that friend said to the employer she found a job in another studio and will quit on the intern position. Because of this the studio asked if I can go there ASAP but i wasn't planning on going mid setember more like mid October so i came up with a lie and said I had a small freelance job at the moment but will go there mid October when we mosty likely we will have the gov fund.

The studios reply to this was very worrying. I think the studiohead is lossing trust in me now. I shouldn't have lied but the studio is very far from home (300km) I rly wasn't expecting going there in such a short notice (specialy alone) before we even applied to the government fund.

I am really worried he will call it quits on me. What should l do? 

I'll also be honest and say a big reason I wanted to stay is because my boyfriend is working under a contract and can't go up with me so soon. He is in a very demanding job and usually doesn't react well in long distance relationships.

I haven't been able to go to school for years, due to a variety of issues, but reading this sub for the past few years made me knock out any obstacle in my way, and try to get a BS in Software Development.

I'm halfway through my degree. I knew how hard this was going to be. I knew it before I did it. I realized it was way harder than I thought once I started to do it, and I've come to terms that I don't think I *can* do it. Hearing about my peers not being able to get jobs after a year of graduating is awful. Hearing that you need to do 7-8 medium/hard LC questions for intern positions that are unpaid is heartbreaking. I legitimately thought that what I'd learn in school would be enough. I accepted that I'd need to know more, and worked hard to atleast get an internship, and I spent about 3 months grinding it out to try to get my resume/portfolio up to par with projects and a personal website. Not even unpaid internships got back to me.

This is hard. Very hard. The only friends I know in person that got a job within 6 months of graduating are from ivy league schools, or sociopaths that enjoy coding more than breathing and constantly push things onto github 24/7. I don't think I have the mental capacity anymore to learn enough to answer hard LC questions on the fly for internships that aren't paid for. I don't think I have it in me to make massive projects to be considered for an interview for a 45k a year junior position. I'm honestly devastated that I have to spend atleast a few months self-teaching once I finish school to even be at the bottom of the barrel for jobs. I really wanted to enjoy being in this industry, but I feel more heartbroken than before I was in school. 

Am I just lazy? Is this really the norm? The job hunt seems hard, but I know getting any other degree is not viable. My friends with Accounting, Business, Marketing Degrees, etc, are struggling even harder to find jobs. I'm not sure what to even do."
pum27d,1,2021-09-24,Brain rot,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/pum27d/brain_rot/,"When I was in high school, my parents were pretty strict with my studies. I didn't own a smartphone. I did have an iPad for school and a desktop my mum used for her work (which was in my room for some odd reason). I could only use my iPad for school and play games on it sometimes. They used to restrict wifi access; when I was home and they were at work, they would take the modem with them and they would always switch it off at night.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but I wish it was like that again.

When my parents used to restrict that for me, I used to read books. Hours and hours of books. I've demolished the Harry Potter series; the Hunger Games; the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. I've read sci fi to historical fiction to crime fiction. 

Reading so much gave me an authorial talent. I'm extremely good at writing stories. I've impressed many English teachers with my creative writing skills. A teacher once told me she gave me 97% for a creative and not 100% because my handwriting was terrible because it was rushed (and I agreed with her lmao). So I began writing a sci-fi book and I've written 130 pages give or take.

I also used to watch so many movies and TV series. Could binge watch them for hours. Now I don't even have the ability to do that.

After I finished high school and came into university (in 2020) I got a job and got a new phone. Now I have unregulated access to my phone and the internet. The entire time I scroll through Instagram, Reddit, Youtube and whatnot. It leaves me feeling empty; I don't have fun and I certainly don't do anything productive. I'm somehow doing relatively well at uni, and I know it won't last for too long.

It also doesn't help that we've been in lockdown for TWO YEARS here in Melbourne and only saw a few weeks of freedom. That's another topic altogether but seriously - I'm losing my mind.

I don't want to be some senile zombie that's going nowhere with his life. I want to publish my book; I want to get a new job in bookeeping and secure an internship at a firm; I want to get back to reading or have some sort of normality back in my life before I graduated from high school. 

Any tips or advise?"

I wanted to ask this reddit a few questions. Do most credits transfer over from NJIT to Rutgers? Do you think I can still graduate on time (spring 24')?. The classes I have taken so far are 

Calc I, II, III

Physics I,II

Physics Lab I,II

Chemistry 

Humanities I, II

20th Century World History 

Econ 

CS 100 ( Which is python so Im sure I probably won't get credit for this since it isn't offered at RU, but still glad Im taking it for the knowledge tbh)

CS 101 ( C++)

Fundementals of Engineeering Design

I have not taken Intro to Programming because I just recently changed my major from General Engineering to CS, So Ik I would be in the same spot at RU as NJIT. But will my credits transfer and is it possible to graduate on time? Also I read on another thread that I could possibly take 2 math classes that also count as credit for Discrete Solutions I &amp; II. Im also taking CALC 3 rn so I heard I could possibly finesse a math minor which would be dope.

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone in RU CS, how do you guys like it? Are there any internship probabilities ?

&amp;#x200B;

Would you guys recommend transferring for the spring or wait till fall?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly I am in the EOF program at my school, I read somewhere online that it is possible to transfer schools and still maintain your EOF status. If that is true how do I go about doing that ?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance to anyone that helps."

I have a 2.1 physics degree from oxbridge, 3.5 years software exp in c++ and python, and currently earn on the lower end in london. I have studied ml academic texts as well as applied ideas via projects. Its not industrial standard but its a solid foundation. I obviously havent contributed to a professional ml pipeline for example.

I would have thought this bg would be fairly good for a higher end swe/ lower end data science role.

I have never gotten past cv stage for swe at faang, higher paying tech companies, nor any data science/ machine learning engineer job despite being advised from friends at such places that with my bg i stand a good chance. I put this down to just bad luck but i see others on here and on linkedin who get these jobs with less, i.e less than 2 yrs exp or none. I do get to leetcode test rounds for hft and hedge fund companies but never pass them and am not particularly keen on them.

Does this sound odd? Or is it the lack of a computer science degree or a data science masters that's holding me back? Is there just too much demand to stand a chance without internships?

puor0x,5,2021-09-24,Trouble with a very tough 6th grade class,Lucyfer_66,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/puor0x/trouble_with_a_very_tough_6th_grade_class/,"Hey all,

I'm a music education intern, currently teaching two kindergarten classes and a 6th grade class (in my country they're the same school, 6th grade being the highest). I go from class to class, and have each for 45 minutes, while their regular teacher watches over and evaluates how I do.

My kindergartners are great. They're so sweet and really have fun. They're a bit rousy ofcourse, but they're ver well managable. My 6th grade however....

The supervising teacher tells me she's only had a class this bad ONCE before, in her 35 year career. She only has them on fridays, but has had them weekly for 2 years now. This is my second internship, I've only taught one 2nd grade before, so I am clearly not experienced enough to deal with this. They are loud, they are rude, they are not just disrespectful to me but also to each other.

Today it hit a breaking point. On advice from my teacher (the one that teaches us how to teach basically) I started the class with a talk about how things went last time and what we could do about it.  On her advice I also asked them to offer consequences if things went wrong again. They offered a punishment another teacher had used with them, being to activate a timer whenever they were rousy, which would add up to an amount of time they'd lose from free time by the end of the day.

Well, that was a bad idea. Not only were the same students as before super loud and disruptive, the rest got mad and started yelling at them because the timer was running up. And I get it. Eventually everything was such a mess, one kid left the classroom without a word, slamming the door behind him, on his way home. The teacher's assistant went after him. Then the crying started. First one girl, who very politely asked if she could leave the classroom, then more and more. A couple had panic attacks. The supervising teacher went out with those, because ofcourse those kids needed to get out of the situation, and I was alone.

I still had students crying that hadn't left yet. I had students yelling and fighting, between the disruptive kids and the kids standing up for me. Worth mentioning, some that had been silent before were now disruptive, and some that had been disruptive had decided it went too far and now stood up for me. Also worth mentioning, I don't need standing up for, I'll survive. It's the students I'm worried about. While I was trying to get through to a girl who was locked down in a panic attack a student asked me how I was doing because I was visibly shaking. I'm not sure what I answered, but it wasn't my priority AT ALL. Sweet of her to ask though.

Eventually a kid who had been one of the most disruptive started loudly mocking, laughing at and immitating the crying/panicking students. I snapped. I've never been mad in class before, I didn't know I had it in me, I kind of scared myself. I recounted what happened as well as I could to my classmates and they all think I didn't overreact and got an appropriate amount of mad though. Well, this got the class quiet for a bit, until said kid got rebellious because he didn't ""understand why they were being such babies"" and why he couldn't laugh about that. At about that point the supervising teacher came back and took things over.

She has proposed she tries to get me transferred to 5th grade, since this is such a difficult class I wouldn't be able to learn here. Initially I had decided I also need to learn how to teach the messier groups and to stick with it, but after today, and her telling me she's only seen something like this once before, I'm starting to doubt if this isn't a too big step to be realistic, no matter how much preparation time I put in.

When I was in 5th/6th myself we were one of these classes, our teacher was on pregnancy leave and we bullied away every substitute in every city around us. I tried thinking about what they could've done but I've come down to nothing. They could've done *nothing*, we would've been just as bad either way. So what do I do?

Personally, I'd love to swap classes. But I'm worried about disappointing or indirectly punishing the kids that did work along. More than half try to come along, even if it's clearly more difficult for some. One of last time's disruptive kids REALLY tried today, I was so proud of him. I dont want to let the willing students down. But at the same time, after today I worry staying would be to let them down, having seen how much this crap affects them. And ofcourse I worry I won't learn here, since I'm never able to finish my classes and am only busy desperately grasping at control. 

I guess I'm looking for advice. My teacher in college just keeps mentioning punishments that I've implemented from the start and just. don't. work. I've tried a positive angle, doesn't work. I've tried everything I and everyone around me can think of short of sending all the disruptive kids out, but I don't want to reward them for their behaviour. Should I see if I can indeed swap classes, or should I stick? And how do I deal with such a class? They're kids that deserve teaching too

Sorry for the long post

Edit: spelling, few small additions and the change from ""problem kids"" to ""disruptive kids"" in a sentence. Shouldn't have referred to them as ""problem kids"" in the first place, glad I caught it before anyone could point it out"

I'm currently working as a SWE intern at a mid sized company in the Boston area. Got the internship extended into a co-op so I will continue working here until the end of November. I'm on the last year of my MS CS program and will be graduating in May 2022. I also completed a BS in CS prior.

I received an offer from the company of $88k base pay. Total comp with bonus and stock is around $99k. I feel like this might be a bit on the lower end. Currently I see three options:

1. Reject the offer, grind leetcode, and hope to land something better.
2. Accept the offer, but start job hunting after 6 months and plan to change companies after 1 year.
3. Accept the offer and stay put. One thing to note is I know I received very positive intern evaluation, and my manager says I'll likely get promoted to L2 within 6-12 months after starting full time.

I'm not sure which of these options is optimal. The potential cons I see with each option:

1. This might be the best I can do.
2. Might be harder to land a job since I will technically no longer be a new-grad.
3. I may be settling.

One last thing to note is I generally do enjoy the work and culture at the current company. The work environment is pretty relaxed and everyone seems genuinely friendly/helpful. Also, the company has very low turnover.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

Will my chances at getting these jobs become significantly more difficult after I graduate? As it stands, most internships I've seen so far only test leetcode easy/medium questions, and go through a fairly simple behavioral interview or assessment, with some other technological aspects that I think are pretty doable so long as I can get a response to begin with from my application. And internships are always a thing that's open. I feel like without having interned prior and getting a return offer, or knowing someone in the company, it's next to impossible to enter these big companies."
putoog,2,2021-09-24,Dealing with imposter syndrome,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/putoog/dealing_with_imposter_syndrome/,"This is tough and I doubt many know how to fix it

I’m about to graduate with my electrical engineering bachelors degree 
Here’s the issue. I’ve been applying like hell to my 2 dream companies Nvidea and AMD who make computer chips like processors and graphics cards 

The problem is that these companies are the strictest in the world when it comes to hiring. 9/10 jobs require a masters degree (or PHD) with 5 years experience and if you’re lucky to find one that accepts a bachelors then they want a 3.5 gpa (I’m barely at a 3.1) and it’s SUPER discouraging.  Same goes fir internships, they require expertise or a masters degree which I don’t have.  I understand they need the best and brightest, it’s just tearing me apart I can’t fit into that. 

Many professors and my parents have told me jobs like that aren’t really for my first job out of college and I understand. My problem is that these companies are the entire reason I did electrical engineering in the first place. I only did this major because of making pc hardware. I knew I wanted to do this since I was 15 (I’m 22 now). Now that I’m faced with the fact I can’t work there, I’m beginning to feel like a failure. I know it’s silly but I can’t shake the idea that if I can’t make graphics cards, I’m a crappy engineer and I feel I failed and shouldn’t have gotten this degree. It’s called imposter syndrome. I don’t know what to do 

I did 2 different internships at companies in my home town and  sure they’re  offering me nice positions with solid ~70k salaries and benefits (I’ll be 23 so it’s a little low but still fine) 
I’m not worried about having a job. I’m worried about having  my dream job that’s my passion.

putuhe,4,2021-09-24,What does life as a computer scientist look like?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/putuhe/what_does_life_as_a_computer_scientist_look_like/,"I'm currently in college majoring in computer science.

In life we practically have to make a choice on what to do - we can't just do nothing. We could choose to be a nomad with no money, or go to college, or learn a trade - but ultimately we have to do something. Most of us can't afford to do whatever we want without working.


So, college is a good route because it allows us to select a career better than Burger King.

And, ideally we also draw a sense of satisfaction from our work - instead of simply clocking in and clocking out, cashing the checks and counting the days till retirement. The latter, to me, sounds like a surly existence.

After much time undeclared, I calculated that computer science is likely a good fit for my personality type - balancing income and career satisfaction.

But, the interesting thing about college is that we often declare a major without ever seeing what working in that job actually looks like.

Junior year is normally when a co-op or an internship is entered - and that would give an indication of what a certain career role could look like. But I've been focused on simply passing my classes and completing my degree, and have yet to have any internship experience.

So, my question to you is what does life as a computer scientist look like?

I know the answer to this question could vary depending on your role.

Keep in mind that I am banking on my degree as a source of satisfaction (keep me out of dead-end jobs), and income (help me to get out of poverty). - so, if in your experience the reality hasn't matched up to your bright-eyed expectations in college - please try to deliver those words with a spoonful of sugar. Nonetheless, I do want your honest position of your career.

I know that your mileage could vary depending on the day, and job that you're currently in.

Thanks!

I look forward to hearing about your reflection on your career as a computer scientist up until this point.

It may also be interesting to know your background. Did you come from a wealthy family, do well throughout school, and now you have a cushy job - or were you flipping burgers and decided to go back to school and now you're a software developer - and everything in between. Feel free to share what you wish. I'm simply interested to hear what your experience has been like so far."

Why not just stick to html and css? I don't see myself using it for my personal projects."
puuyo0,7,2021-09-24,Engineering graduate wanting to quit my electronics technician job after being in this job for over a month and a half. Advice?,victor007546,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/puuyo0/engineering_graduate_wanting_to_quit_my/,"(please note I am being vague about some aspects of this job. I don't want to damage the reputation of the company that I'm working for at the moment).

I moved over to Australia from NZ back in July to pursue better graduate engineering opportunities (I graduated with an electrical engineering degree last December). My sister and my brother-in-law suggested to me that while I am here in this country, I should look for a part time casual job to do while applying for engineering jobs. They told me that having a casual job while looking for graduate jobs for me right now is so much better than sitting at home all day applying for jobs.

Which led me to this electronics technician job. Initially, I was pretty excited to be applying for this job because a) I could apply some of the skills learned during my degree and b) I would at least have something to say during my engineering interviews in terms of the technical questions asked. Also, the fact that I could earn a commission on top of the salary I made was exciting as well because who doesn't want to be paid for all their hard work.

During the interview, my boss said that he wanted me to pursue a training period because he wanted me to learn about all the aspects of repairing the electronics equipment (It's not complex to learn how to repair the equipment, but there's a lot to understand). The training period is 14 days and after the 14 days, I would begin to earn commission based on the hours I worked. Each batch of electronics would earn a certain amount and I would get a share of the money made based on how many hours I worked compared to others. During that 14 days, I would earn a training allowance of $20 for each day I was there.

Initially it was great. The work was enjoyable and I got to meet some great people who came in weekdays to work on repairing the electronics. I mainly learned about the faults that could be found and how to go about repairing them.  As each day passed, I felt that I was learning a whole lot.

However several red flags popped up over the course of the month. Here they are:

1. The salary that was advertised for this job was kind of bogus. From one of my co-workers, I was told that I was still going to earn $20 per day for each day I was there once I got a commission.  I also heard about how much commission she got and I was appalled by such a low amount (I won't say anything about her total commission, but she said it worked out to about $10 per hour). I mean, how can people survive on that kind of money?


2. After the first week, I decided that I should begin to follow the work schedule of my fellow co-workers and work part-time because we were on casual hours. My boss at no point did not raise concerns about me working part-time and so I pretty much did this for two weeks without letting him know. When my two co-workers quit, which I will explain next, my boss basically told me that I still had not completed the training period satisfactorily because I had to work full days (i.e around 8 hours each day) to accomplish the training period. He needed me to know ALL aspects of repairing the electronics, and that I had only completed the equivalent of four days of training. While I was embarrassed that I had screwed up the training, part of me wondered why he didn't raise concerns about me switching to part-time earlier? I thought he cared whether I got on commission or not. Apparently not.

To take responsibility for the blunder in my training, I showed up full-time (5 days a week, 8 hours a day), which I have diligently done for the past three weeks. However, even during those three weeks, he still hasn't shown me all of the training that is involved because he still hasn't put me on repairing motherboards. He has spent all this time repairing motherboards while I have been stagnating assembling and repairing the mechanical issues with the devices themselves for shipping. I have told him to put me on repairing motherboards and he says he wants me to do so, but he hasn't done that at all. He didn't put me on motherboard duty during the first three weeks I was there. It just makes me question when I will complete my training and whether I am being strung along for cheap labor.

3. The process of repairing the devices is tedious and not very efficient. Since it is a home-based business (they used to be based in a warehouse before the pandemic hit), we don't have a lot of space. It takes about three weeks minimum to get a batch of 1000 devices sent to the insurance warehouse, and that was with four people working weekdays. My two co-workers had tried to work with my boss to make the process efficient so we could pay our workers. However, they decided that the process of repairing the electronics was not getting any better and that unless more people were hired, the process wasn't going to get any more efficient. When the first co-worker left for another job, my other co-worker left immediately after her. That, on top of the interns being at Uni at the moment, has meant I am the only one who is working on the next batch. Since I am still new to this process, I am so slow at doing things. So the increased workload, along with the uncertainty of the training and the salary expectations, has me realizing that I hate this job. I would rather spend more of my time applying for real engineering jobs and working on my physical fitness, even if I have to take the hit financially and be miserable for a couple of months until I find a job that I really like.

So I'm contemplating leaving the job after this week. My former coworkers are telling me to leave. I'm just worried that employers will look at me negatively for leaving this job early. Plus, I am in a country where I can't claim any benefits. I am basically relying on the goodwill of my sister and brother-in-law to help me along. So if I leave this job, I won't have any pocket money haha.

Sorry for the long post. I just felt I needed to get these thoughts off my chest."

I am currently majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in cybersecurity meaning I take security classes for my free electives. I am still not sure if I want to do cybersecurity or software engineering after I graduate. I am going to do this cybersecurity internship and I also was a software developer intern last summer at a different company. Will it be harder to land software engineering jobs after graduation if I do cybersecurity next summer?"

Representative Bontu Hreiðunn hurried down the concourse. She didn’t have to hurry. She had plenty of time. However it was a very exciting occasion. This was to be the first time in the storied two hundred thousand history of the High Council of Humanity that it actually passed a law. That was by design of course. When it had initially been formed by the systems of Eridani, Centauri, and Sol none of them had been eager to give up even a sliver of sovereignty. But at the time the first alien signals had just been detected and some sort of unified response seemed necessary just in case.

So the charter that those three systems had drawn up was very clear. The laws of the council were absolute, but required a ninety five percent majority to pass anything. Only a threat to the whole of humanity would ever goad it into action. Over the many millennia of the council’s existence such a threat had never occurred. The orchids proved to be just like humans. Which is to say aggressive and belligerent at times, but not unreasonable. And in all the galaxy neither species had ever found a third space faring species.

So the High Council fulfilled a largely ceremonial role. Every thousand years it met to see if anything pressing had come up, but nothing ever had. It’s only real purpose was to host all of the millions of subcommittees where the two hundred and eighty four thousand representatives of humanity met, argued, and established trading deals among themselves.

Bontu was a veteran councilor. She had been in more of those sub committees than she could remember, and represented her star system through ten entire sessions of the council. She liked to think of herself as somewhat jaded to the grandeur of it all. The historic meeting rooms where wars had been started and averted. The cavernous council hall designed by the best architects out of trillions of candidates and evoking awe in every sense a human could feel, taste included. Even the planet Sanctum itself. Only the third shell world ever completed and designed as a final bastion for the human race. She took it all in with the serene grace and dignity befitting her millennia of service.

Not today though. Today she was running down the halls like a junior intern. This was the two hundred and thirty fourth session of the high council, and it would be addressing the only resolution likely to ever pass the full assembly. She had drafted it herself as chairwoman of the subcommittee for the Response to the Analysis of the Devourer Incursion of the Galactic Core and Environs.

The only other item she could even think of that had even come close was when the supernova storm had devastated the Orion Cluster. And the relief resolution had still failed with only eighty percent support. Of course it helped that seventy three thousand representatives only had ghost status. Their systems now dead and gone.

With a quarter of humanity’s systems lost to the thousand year rampage of the Devourers even the most recalcitrant representatives had finally been forced to admit that maybe, just maybe, something should be done about the problem.

Bontu slid into her council booth out of breath from the unexpected run. She could see that many of her colleagues in the neighboring booths were arriving in a similar disheveled stat. At least for the few seconds before their metabolic implants adjusted and they were once more pictures of serene dignity.

The attendance submind chimed signalling the start of the session a full five minutes early. She couldn’t remember that ever happening before. It certainly was a day for firsts. But then she pulled her attention back to the center of the room where the Ancient and Honorable Speaker From Sol was reading through the opening minutes. “And now is there any new business for the council?”

Hundreds of thousands of eyes turned towards Bontu, everyone knew what was coming. Finally it was time for what would likely be the most important act of her life. “I, Representative Bontu Hreiðunn of the Heimdall Conclave, propose a motion to vote on the Resolution for the Unification of Command, Production, and Research for the Containment of the Species Known as the Devourers.”

Her good friend Thom from the neighboring Burned Confederation quickly seconded, and soon a wave of green lights appeared as representative after representative voted yes. And unfortunately a few red lights. Bontu thanked her ancestors that the founders hadn’t required unanimous consent in the charter. Some people were contrary beyond all reason.

The Ancient and Honorable Speaker From Sol waited for the vote submind to confirm that the resolution had the required numbers and then spoke once more, “Then the Resolution for the Unification of Command, Production, and Research for the Containment of the Species Known as the Devourers has passed. From this day forward humanity will fight as one.”

Star Commandant Nevukhadnetztzar Asun dreamed of vast ships and mighty fleets. His sleeping mind breezed through virtual projections of fortification numbers and projected energy outputs of the three stars at his command. His subconscious absorbed the information and sorted it so that he would know the details of his command down to his very instincts.

At last his implants judged that his cortex was sufficiently rested and released a cocktail of chemicals into Asun’s blood causing him to snap awake. Adjutant Davis was already waiting with a stimulant drink and even more reports. Sometimes Asun felt that his body must be subsisting on data rather than food as his army of subordinates tried to stuff five systems worth of information into one human brain.

And this was just the summaries of the summaries. The reports of millions of fleet admirals on billions of ships. Even with his enhanced brain Asun literally couldn’t count them as more reinforcements decelerated into the system every second.  Because this was the front line of the war with the Devourers. For one hundred years humanity had turned its collective will to turning the system into one massive fortress.

Hyperion was a trinary star system was exactly one thousand and one hundred light years from the supermassive black Sagittarius A\*. Three separate dyson swarms provided unimaginable amounts of power. Four other systems ten light years further out were sending all their own considerable production towards the system on vast beams of light.

All those ships were the product of trillions of minds analyzing every aspect of the reports that had come out of the wormholes. The scientists still hadn’t cracked exactly how the devourers did what they did, but enough anomalous energy readings had been detected and analyzed that they had devised countermeasures.

Star Commandant Asun's battleships were vast twenty five kilometers ovoids with crew dispersed throughout them. They employed kugelblitz generators for offense, and their armor was steel composited over much of the circuitry that the digital crews resided in. The ramming ships had been optimized to the best ratio of armor, engines, and minimized crew to ensure hits without wasting lives. They were little more than crewed missiles now and his battleships stored racks of them in internal hangars.

Billions more sentry ships formed a Carter sphere at the periphery of the system. Covered in ice and rock, their frozen crews waited to catch the enemy supply ships no matter where they ran. To assist them, entire fleets raced through the system on exit trajectories. Having gained speed in their decades long voyages they only needed final course corrections to hit any point on the system’s periphery. Most of them would uselessly exit the system hitting nothing, but if even one fleet was able to close on one of the gargantuan supply ships it would be worth the loss of all of them.

Trillions of lives had been lost in the war so far. By far most of them had been civilians. Asun himself was a ghost warrior. A survivor of a system that had fallen to the devourers centuries ago. And it was for their sake that Asun had poured decades into reaching this point. The reason why he tried to absorb more information than even the best human mind could hold.

The devourers had consumed a sphere ten thousand light years across. Nothing human or orchid had ever stopped them. But they weren’t invincible. They had been slowed and bloodied before. And now Asun would take the next step. He vowed to all the souls of the departed that for once the devourers would be stopped. He would fight them here at Hyperion and crush their advance once and for all.

Hierarch \*(#!\^ was clutching a bowl of nurta slugs when his harvester fleet tore free of their flux envelopes at the target system. He was not in the Archon’s good graces. He hadn’t been since the start of the invasion. And because of that he kept getting sent to the systems the seers predicted would be hard targets. Which caused him to lose more ships, or use up flux, or take centuries to finish. All of which caused him to fall further from the Archon’s favor. It was a vicious cycle.

Now if his luck held. Yes, of course this was the most fortified system so far. His viewing pool couldn’t even distinguish the primitive ships as individuals anymore. Some of those defense fortresses were the size of a world ship. Hierarch \*(#!\^  slammed the entire bowl into his mouth and chewed angrily.

As the calming nurta venom flowed into his veins he slumped over to the command pool and started issuing orders. First a praetorian guard for each of the wellships. Next he tasked his fleet’s seers to analyze the fortresses and determine which one was the most weakly defended. That was sure to be a trap. Best to choose point that seemed to be of middling strength.

But not exactly in the middle. That would be a trap too. He’d learned that the hard way two systems back.

Admiral Kassandra Carter was screaming. Profanities, threats, and just random thoughts. Anything to distract herself from the cacophony that surrounded her. Voices, shrieks, and moments of silence that were all the more jarring for the contrast seemed to burrow directly into her mind.

She couldn’t feel anything around her. She could barely tell that her limbs were moving at all. All she could do was hear the unending noise and stare into a void so black her mind was hallucinating shapes of different shades to overcome the monotony.

Wait there was a light in the darkness. She reached for the light. Instinctively she felt that she would get out if she could just reach it.

=======

The Resplendent bore through space at thirty percent the speed of light. Built into an asteroid it’s three hundred kilometer bulk was pitted and scarred by the five decade voyage from the Colom star system. It had only recently passed Hyperion A and was now being redirected by massive dyson lasers towards the next projected landing site of the Devourer supply leviathan.

Commodore Nurul ordered her subordinates to begin deploying the outriders. The Resplendent had carried an entire fleet with it on its journey. Hundreds of destroyers flashed out of the hangars and took up escort positions while a dozen battleships spread into a ring around the Resplendent to extend its web of mirrors. The Resplendent had weapons of its own, but it’s real purpose was to act as a focal point for the very dyson lasers it was riding.

Ahead lay a wounded leviathan. Eight of the Resplendent sister ships had already made runs like this. Five had missed entirely as the leviathan managed to warp away. Three had managed to score progressively deeper wounds on the amalgamation of flesh, metal, and warped space.

“Adjust focal length to point eight arcs and fire missile arrays five through sixteen.” Commodore Nurul ordered calmly. As the two massive vessels neared each other, fire flickered between them. The devourer leviathan wasn’t alone and its smaller guard vessels leapt to protect it from the approaching human fleet.

Space boiled as redirected beams of light met eldritch energy formations. The thousands of missiles and acid globules being exchanged were reduced to a mere sideshow. The human dreadnought was larger and had the power of a star behind it, but it was outmatched by the (@%!)&gt; wellship’s massive flux reserves and aegis constructs.

In the end however the battle was indecisive. Commodore Nurul’s dreadnought was simply traveling too fast and the two forces blew past each other before either could score a decisive hit. Which wasn’t to say that either had escaped unscathed. The Resplendent was battered with deep gouges in its armor and the majority of its escorts were simply gone. The wellship had suffered relatively less, but the Resplendent had focused its fire on the previous hits in the wellship's armor and now the alien leviathan bled from an abyssal canyon that reached nearly to its core.

“Recall the outriders, and deploy the solar sail. Make adjustments for Copernicus Beta.” Commodore Nurul and her command were out of the fight. They would never slow down in time to rejoin the battle at Hyperion. But they weren’t out of the war. She would rendezvous with the myriad other dreadnoughts that had already made their attack runs and a few decades from now they would hit the Copernicus system. Then the devourers there would have a bad time of their own.

=======

Herald &amp;\*## nervously examined the viewing pool. Her wellship had beaten off another attack, but these damned primitives just wouldn’t quit. Still things looked quiet for the moment. The godmind predicted that the nearest primitive ships would follow vectors ten of millions of kilometers out.

They would still try to fling their primitive projectiles at the wellship. But at that range they were easily dodged. Feeling a bit more cheerful Herald &amp;\*## ordered the vat tenders to begin preparing replacement armor and organs for the wellship. The primitives would try again of course, but it would be months before they could revector their sluggish vessels close enough to threaten the wellship.

=======

Captain Stela Edwena floated in space. Her body was one and a half kilometers of iron rod. It was a cheap, easy to build, and stealthy design. Humanity had sent Captain Edwena’s ship and trillions like it towards Hyperion. Her velocity was such that the entire decade-long transit had only taken five point six years from her perspective.

In all that time she had been blind. Her instruments and receivers folded up to protect them from interstellar radiation. She herself had been submerged in simulations. Mostly training exercise to sharpen her piloting skill for the final crucial phase of the mission. But also enough entertainment sessions to keep her from going crazy.

Now a laser pulse from Hyperion A had alerted her that her final task was at hand. Telescope unfolded to peer into the darkness ahead. Relativistic effects contracted everything into a narrow cone, but she had precisely calibrated computer systems to unravel the background noise, and she only had one target. One of the massive alien supply ships.

Then it happened. From the dark nothingness of the void where no stars shone she saw the devourer approaching. It made her skin crawl. Nothing should be there. Nothing could be there. She switched off her emotional responses. She had a job to do however.

With great care and precision she detonated rows of antimatter charges on her iron skin. They were the only thing powerful enough to change her vector in time. She watched as the cone of her vision aligned on the devourer leviathan.

She laughed. This was so much easier than the simulations. It felt as if she had all the time in the galaxy to make her adjustments. It was just too bad she would never get a chance to tell anyone how satisfying this had been.

Hierarch \*(#!\^ was in a calm reflective state. He had already cursed everyone involved, and all their ancestors to ten generations. It was cathartic, but not actually very helpful in resolving this situation. Three of his wellships were gone. Just sludge and flux radiation dispersed in space. Now he had to figure out how to protect his remaining seven from the Human flotillas that just. kept. coming.

Fortunately he had taken the time to reinforce his fleet at his previous conquests. If he still had a standard harvester fleet complement he would actually have been forced to retreat by now. The very idea nearly drove him into convulsions.

Hierarch \*(#!\^ considered the system layout. The obvious solution was to move his wellships to the other side of the system. He discarded that immediately. The humans were sending that stream of ships from outside the system anyway. They’d just hit the wellships from the outside instead of the inside.

Perhaps he could hide them in the shadow of something. But no, the only thing sufficient would be one of the three stars, and they were well fortified to prevent him from getting close enough. By the time he cracked them open he’d have won the system anyway.

\*(#!\^ slapped some tentacles against the side of the pool. There weren’t any perfect solutions. Pulling back outside the system would drastically reduce the time his warships could safely engage. The only marginally good solution he could think of would be to put his wellships into polar orbits perpendicular to the Human line of assault ships. They would still be somewhat vulnerable, but it would take the humans time to adjust. When they did he would move his wellships back to the other side of the system forcing them to adjust again.

He’d probably still take some damage as his wellships trundled back and forth. The amount of time wasted in transit would definitely make resupply more difficult, but he should be able to keep his wellships safe at least. First he issued orders to that effect to the Praetorians guarding the wellships. Then he began composing compelling enough arguments to convince the Heralds to carry out his plan.

Pausing \*(#!\^ considered for a moment and then drafted a seer conclave to consider the problem further. He couldn’t see a perfect solution now, but (\*\*&amp;\^\*\*\*) if he would let this happen again. There had to be some method he could employ. Then he braced himself and started calling the Heralds.

Star Commandant Asun frowned as he read the report Adjutant Davis had delivered. The Devourers were realigning their supply ships into polar orbits of the primary. There were already a few dreadnoughts headed those ways for just such a contingency, but it was simply infeasible to cover the entire set of possible vectors with them.

“Well thirty percent target destruction is acceptable. Not as good as we hoped, but we could have missed entirely. Any surprises in the data, Davis.”

“A statistical fluke sir. All three kills were scored by Pilot-Captain Stela Edwena,” Adjutant Davis projected the possibility of one pilot out of hundreds scoring every kill. It was low, but not freakishly so.

“Huh, well put her in for a medal and keep an eye on her. Maybe something will come of it. Time to turn our attention to the main battle however.” Star Commandant Asun considered his forces. The devourers had already chewed through a few million of his battlegroups, but they had taken several months to do so. A significant decrease in casualties from the start of the war. It looked like the new networked armor worked after all.

The most significant threat was at Hyperion C. The Devourers had knocked out a trio of defense planetoids, and were making increasing numbers of attacks there. It made sense. Hyperion C was the smaller of the companion stars and boasted less powerful lasers as a result. The devourers were likely attempting to clear a breachead so they could use the star as a base for their operations in the rest of the system.

Well he had anticipated such a scenario, and there were plans in place to deal with it. “Divert power from the claymore ships to the intra system mirrors. Send orders to ramp up production of the kugelblitz mines.” Each side had made their opening moves. Now it was time for the midgame.

Kassy was screaming.

I am a Chinese male student from Malaysia who aspires to study computer science at top universities in the US/UK. After looking at exemplary applicants both in this subreddit and on YouTube I’m increasingly concerned about my chances at these colleges. Here are my stats and I’m looking forward to valuable inputs from y’all as to how I can further improve my chances. This is because I still have like a year before having to apply for colleges which I’d like to make full use of in order to increase my probability of success.

Universities I’m striving to get into (reach schools):

Stanford, MIT, UC Berkeley, CMU and (ik this is a US oriented sub) Oxbridge/Imperial college. 

Academics:

Class ranking- I have been consistently topping my entire school in terms of academic excellence, getting a gold or at least a silver in this regard

GPA- Secondary schools in my country predominantly use the grading system as opposed to GPA. Throughout the years I’ve consistently gotten A\* across the 11 subjects that I had taken, with an occasional A. 

Test results- For some context: the Malaysian education system, high schoolers take an exam known as SPM, which is equivalent to the IGCSE/O level in the UK. In this examination I had obtained an A+ (highest distinction) in all the 11 subjects that I sat for, making me the collective top 7 nationwide as only 6 other students had 12A+ according to statistics. Currently I’m studying for the A levels and I think I can expect to get an A\* for the 4 subjects I’m taking (physics, chemistry, maths and further maths). Furthermore I’ll also strive to obtain the “top in the world” award in mathematics which is not infrequent at my current institution (but it’s far from guaranteed lol so take it with a pinch of salt)

\*regarding SAT: I have yet to take the SAT but I plan to do so next year and use my time during the semester break to prepare for it. As for the predicted results your guess as as good as mine lol

Awards and accolades in descending order of prestige (or at least in my opinion):

\-Malaysian Brain Bee Challenge (neuroscience competition) - top 3 in my state

I managed to be one of the National finalists but unfortunately did not win the competition

\-International competition and assessment for schools (ICAS) by the University of New South Wales: 

1 gold medal in the science subject which is awarded to the top scorers in the nation

1 or 2 high distinctions (top 1%) in science

And multiple distinctions (top 10%) in maths, science and English 

\-Academic excellence award (as stated earlier):

2 golds 2 silver throughout 4 years 

\-School-level writing competition Gold medal

\-Student of the year finalist

\-School-level general knowledge competition finalist

Participated in a few math competitions and Olympiad like SASMO and one by the university of St. Andrews but unfortunately did not win 

Charity/community service:

Not sure if this counts but I was an active member of the fundraising group for my school’s sports house. We’ve raised around 3k MYR or around 750 USD over 2 years by walking around selling beverages and snacks.

Sports:

Ah my weakest area as I don’t play sports competitively , only thing of note is that the cheer squad team I was in won second place in the schools annual sports competition. 

Extracurriculars ie the reason I’m writing this post. Admittedly I am indeed more of a bookworm but I do try to participate in various activities to increase my chances:

Vice President of the Mathematics club

Member of the multimedia club, tech club and business club.

Contributed at least 1 article to my school publication/magazine every year for 5 years

Additional programs/courses:

Attended a course on university-level neuroscience at the International Medical University

Completed the Cambridge ICT course and obtained multiple certificates such as “Multimedia for a purpose” etc

Skills:

\-Learned and played the drums at an intermediate level and obtained qualifications from “Rockschool”

\-Learned to code using Python through freecodecamp.org

\-Learned Unreal Engine 5 out of my own initiative

Note: the primary reason I’m writing is is coz I don’t seem to have a really outstanding feat that many strong applicants have such as international Olympiad gold, having started a nonprofit and having done internship/research with an institute. The latter 2 I’d say were extremely difficult to achieve in the past 2 years as my entire country has been in constant lockdown and companies are already scrambling to lay off employees, let alone hire a high school student as an intern. Now that the pandemic is getting better many sectors are expected to open up soon should I utilize my semester break at the end of this year to do an internship/research if possible? I have relatives and family friends in the tech industry that might increase my chances of getting an internship (can’t be sure tho)

Conclusion: That’s all I have on my mind right now and I’ll be sure to add more stuff if it comes across my mind. Thank you so much if you have read all of the above I really appreciate your time. I’d be grateful if you can give me any suggestions on how to further improve my stats and the areas I should focus on. Perhaps I should try to join and win an Olympiad? Or should I apply for internship or research with my limited time? Thanks once again."

I began to think about my future career. There are so many fields in computer science that it's just easy to get confused. Here are the specialties that are most interested in:

1) **Artificial intelligence and machine learning engineer.** Because I'm just interested in the topic of artificial intelligence, I would like to work, but it seems there are few options in the market, especially for juniors.

2) **Mobile Developer.** Because I like smartphones, write programs for smartphones. Also, it is easy to find a job in this field and they pay high relative to web developers.

3) **Web developer.** Because it seems to me that it is slightly easier than programming and it is very easy to find a job for a beginner and freelance, but they pay little relative to the remaining specialties.

I like web development because it's easy to find a job and earn money for juniors and that's it. But, in the future, machine learning looks very promising and entertaining. But, it is difficult to find a job internship. *What should I do?*"

I'm a 25 year old Swiss citizen.  I would like to emigrate to the UK, it's been a dream of mine for quite some time, and have several worries/questions on what to expect and how to proceed which I would really appreciate your feedback on.

I'm still a student with some internships, but no work experience, so I would be emigrating to the UK for an entry level position (if that is even possible?).  I have a BSc in Physics from EPFL and I'm currently enrolled in MSc at ETH Zurich in a degree very similar to Computer Science.

I'm two years in and about 8 months away from completing an MSc, but I'm in a pretty questionable state financially, and very mentally exhausted.  I can power through, but I will not lie, stress-wise (mostly because of the finances) this would be the hardest year I will have ever endured, so I'm just questioning if it's worth it putting myself through this, if I can directly enter the UK job market with what I have, and I'm hoping to get some insights here.  For context, in Switzerland a BSc from a Polytechnic is not considered a complete degree, so I would not be very employable in CH if I dropped out.  I wonder how much of an added value an MSc is considered in the UK though, salary and career progression wise, if completing it is necessary, and an absolutely miserable year would be worth it.  I'd like to point out, that despite how difficult COVID has been for everyone, the root of my problems is not actually related to it at all, and if anything, my mental well-being improved during the past year and so.

Regarding my skill-set, I'm a decent C++ programmer, and would ideally be looking for a job to do with numerical methods, i.e. physics simulations and so on."

Are there companies that would accept my offer if I apply next year? What do you think is my best course of action here? Thanks!"
pvcxnh,1,2021-09-25,Transitioning Veteran,openwater44,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pvcxnh/transitioning_veteran/,"I grew up in a small town in South Carolina. My family are the type to be born, live, and die in the same place working blue collar manual labor for their entire lives. My parents are both 8th grade drop outs and can barely read or write. The rest of my family are addicted to drugs, alcohol, and other substances and probably wont ever do anything impactful which is very unfortunate. Growing up we were quite poor. I remember my grandfather burning down our trailer and having to live in a pop up camper until we could get another home. I can also remember Inviting friends from school over to my birthday party in 1st grade and watching the cars pull in then pull away all because ""We lived in a trailer"" and the parents didn't want their children to be associated with us. (That one still really messes me up all these years later). Looking back I've never really shared a deep connection with anyone other than a few girls I've dated. My father is an alcoholic as was his father before him. He was a very mean drunk and extremely manipulative. He would start drinking at Noon and I can remember regularly cleaning him up and carrying him to bed after passing out in the floor from a young age.

By the time I was 19 I had moved into my own apartment and worked my way up in a small company in my hometown from a seasonal employee to operations manager making $15 per hour. That was more than both my parents were making combined. I was proud of it and my family and I had thought I really ""made it"". I was engaged to be married and was content with where my life was heading until I read a book that made me rethink that decision. It showed me what I was missing in my life, purpose. Not long after my relationship fell apart and I was forced to move back in with my parents. Things got really bad for a while and I just wanted a way out. I didn't want to end up like the rest of my family. So I joined the Army.

Fast forward through the years and now I'm a Junior at an exceptional university on a scholarship that I competed for and worked my ass off to win. I still believe I had a learning disability that I had to overcome to get here considering how challenging a basic education was growing up. I do a lot outside of my course work. I've TA'd for Python courses, been involved in a lot Volunteerism for veterans and kids around campus and the community, been captain of a few sports teams, and I work full time as a VA work-study. All thats great but since I left the Army around 2019 its been a hard and lonely experience. I don't have any friends that check up on me, ask me how I'm doing or to to hang out, or genuinely get to know me. My family mostly disconnected from me because Im a first generation college student and they have bitterness that I left. I'm terrified that when I graduate Im not going to amount to anything because I can't get a real internship like other kids a few years younger than me here. In the Army I had brothers who I could talk to about life with but I haven't had that since I left and the majority of them are busy with their own lives scattered around the globe.

I just finished reading the book Tribe by Sebastian Junger and man did it hit hard. I've had a few failed S attempts over the years because I've felt so alone on this journey after getting out. I guess to put a long story short I had purpose when I was in the Army. Even if I didn't get along with some of the guys in my unit, they still needed me and I needed them. I contributed to the tribe and I had a role. Here it feels like I don't have that. I've done all this in an attempt to rewrite my family history and I try to stay focused on that. My nephew is also a big part of why I'm here. I need to do this so he can get out like I did. However, I feel like none of what I'm doing is ever enough to actually do that. And if I fail at that I feel I will have done all this for nothing and that would make me a failure. I don't even have any real friends/brothers here and that makes it even more difficult. I feel completely alone while surrounded by people who arnt having this problem at all. They have a support system, great friends, and community. My question is, have any of you ever been in my shoes? if so where are you now? What advice would you give yourself then after knowing what you know now?"

**2017-2019**

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science a few years ago and then got a job as an application support engineer. It was not fun being evaluated by the number of tickets I solved every month and I hated debugging. I felt like I was withering on the vine so I left after two years working at that job.

One saving grace was that during that job, I discovered I'm much more people-oriented and socially adept than my coworkers who were stereotypical introverted engineers. I found I was happiest when I got to interact/collaborate with other employees in the company, and most miserable when I was debugging code by myself while glued to a screen. I also do magic tricks as a hobby so that helped a lot with building connections with other employees.

**2020-2021**

A few months later, I decided to go to grad school to study for my masters in Human-Computer Interaction. It's been about a year now and I am looking for the next adventure.

I admit that I have trouble envisioning myself as an engineer yet I still force myself to study LeetCode and to practice HTML, CSS, JS everyday because finding a SWE job seems like the safe/responsible thing to do--even though I don't have any real development experience. But part of me is saying I should go look for other kinds of jobs, especially ones that have more human interaction. Here are some that I've been looking into:

* Frontend Engineer (because on paper I have B.S. in computer science but otherwise I'm rather unqualified. In terms of knowledge, I'm the equivalent of a new grad SWE even though I graduated many years ago)
* Product Management internships (out of all the options on this list, this has been the most appealing one to me but I know how competitive it can be to get one)
* Associate Product Management (same thing with PM internships)
* Product design internships
* Product Operations Analyst

I really wish I didn't have to LeetCode and to write JS all day but quite frankly I don't know what else to do. PM internships and Product design internships are really competitive and I don't bank on getting one--or perhaps I'm a bit too defeatist.

I would love to hear everybody's thoughts and other ideas for suitable jobs"

&amp;#x200B;

Hey guys, I'm trying to jumpstart my career and discern whether or not academia is for me by getting a masters, ideally with research. I'm looking at CS, Cognitive Science, and maybe Bioinformatics programs because I think I'd like to apply CS to healthcare.

I have a 3.3 from Texas A&amp;M in Computer Science minor in math, graduated spring 2020. My performance gets a little better throughout the 4 years. I have a published paper for the ACM ICMI 2020 conference in bio-behavioral signals. I also helped start a new hackathon at A&amp;M. After school I accepted an entry level SWE position with Dell, and I've realized I am not super excited about SWE or the company's mission. My GRE was 165 verbal, 163 quant, 4.5 writing.

I applied to UT in 2019 and was rejected, but that was before my paper and with a slightly lower GPA. I have 2 glowing letters of rec (one was my research prof, another my boss at an internship) and one where I don't really know how great it was (prof for much less quality research I did, didn't know him that well). I'm thinking of asking my current boss for a letter of rec.

I'm most interested in Johns Hopkins MA in Cognitive Science, CU Boulder, UC San Diego, UT. Chance me? Are there other colleges I should look at?"

But, I took the great advice I was given and I kept going forward. I passed Core 1 of the A+ exam (going to retake Core 2 before next year) and I started volunteering with a non-profit organization. Well, the director and the I.T. Specialist I was working under liked my work so much that they set me up with a paid internship. I worked there all summer and I was just approved to continue the internship through spring 2022, when the Senior Director of the I.T. department called and asked me to take over for a specialist that she is promoting to her Security and Networking team. 

It's a lot of responsibility. I don't officially start until Monday, but I have already been thrown into the middle of a major issue during my transition/training period last week. People are already calling and emailing me to help them out. It's not a lot of money, but it's actually more money than I have ever made. I can't even describe how grateful and amazed I am at having this job.

Thank you to the members of this sub who encouraged me to keep going. To anyone else who feels they don't have a place in I.T. due to age, life circumstances, past choices, I say it is never too late and your life experiences can be a good thing. Keep going!

I seem to be able to get interviews occasionally, but ever since covid hit, I can't get past the first interview for a 2nd interview.

The quick summary is: I graduated in May 2021 with 2 degrees, worked 3 jobs (tutoring math and robotics) during my time in school, wrote an undergraduate thesis paper, and now work full-time as an auditor at one of the Big 4 Accounting firms. The full breakdown is below.

Overall Undergraduate GPA: 3.98

Degrees:

1. B.A. in Mathematics (concentration in Applied Mathematics and 3.97 GPA)
2. B.S. in Business Analytics and Information Systems (concentration in Cybersecurity and 4.0 GPA)

Undergraduate Projects:

1. Designed an app
2. Built a database for a soccer tournament

Research Project:

1. Wrote an undergraduate thesis paper

Work experience:

1. SAT/ACT math tutor (2 years)
2. Algebra and Geometry math tutor (1 year)
3. Robotics instructor (6 months)

Internship experience:

1. Two week internship at one of the Big 4 accounting firms

I now work full-time as an auditor at one of the Big 4.

The schools I’m aiming for are:

1. UC Berkeley
2. Columbia
3. Georgia Tech
4. UT Austin

My concerns are:

1. I went to a state university and these are some really tough schools. Idk if I stand a chance.
2. My technical background isn’t great. The programming languages I know are SQL, Matlab, Maple, and C#. I’m teaching myself how to code in Python now. A lot of other candidates are gonna be coming in knowing Java, C, and Python; I feel intimidated not coming in with the same background.

I think it might be helpful to mention that ¾ of the programs I’m planning to apply to are online. Columbia’s the only one in person. Hopefully if I get in, the plan is to work full-time and get my masters degree part-time online.

Just about anyone who has browsed this subreddit has surely seen this Jedi Master in action. For [nearly 2 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/djzj1g/the_cfaman_the_myth_the_legend/), u/CFAman has sat atop the all-time leaderboard of ClippyPoint awardees. But 3,000 is a truly remarkable achievement. To put this into perspective, this badass got his first point 5½ years ago, has steadily earned on average 1.48 CPs a day ever since, and he’s speeding up too -- his last thousand were earned at a rate of 1.69 a day. The next closest user on the all-time list is u/excelevator, who himself just notched his 2,400th, and that in addition to spending more than his fair share of time taking care of moderator duties.

How about some more interesting sub facts? With 420,000 subscribers, we’re [on pace]( https://subredditstats.com/r/excel) to top a half mil in 4 or 5 months. We’re now getting 32,000 new posts a year (about 88 a day), where close to 50% of posts looking for solutions are solved (70% with ClippyPoints awarded), and these two stats have barely changed for many years, which means the supply of givers of quality answers is keeping up with increasing demand by answer seekers. It’s truly awesome that this subreddit remains one of the internet’s top go-to places for Excel help, and it’s all because of you – a phenomenal five-star community.

Back to CFAman, though. We barraged him with questions and here’s what he said:

&lt;interview&gt;

***Q:*** Thank you for agreeing to answer a few questions. Let’s start with where in the world do you live?

***A:*** Indianapolis, Indiana, USA

***Q:*** How did you stumble upon this subreddit?

***A:*** I think a Google search for some other Excel problem I was trying to solve? Hard to remember after so many threads lol.

***Q:*** What does you username mean?

***A:*** I really, REALLY like the Chick-fil-A sandwiches. Probably my favorite sandwich. So, just took that acronym and combined it with my gender to make a nice nickname/username.

***Q:*** When did you first start to learn Excel?

***A:*** Started back in 2002 as an alternative to buying a graphing calculator for school. Started using forums when I was an intern around 2005, and have been hooked ever since in trying to help others with their questions.

***Q:*** What's something really cool you've done?

***A:*** I’m married with three kids, which is pretty awesome IMO. My oldest boy is currently 7, with my two girls being 5 and 2. To them, I am the epitome of “cool”. In other area of life, I have over 170k gamerscore from achievements in XBOX.

***Q:*** Favourite alcoholic beverage?

***A:*** Amaretto sour. Not much of a beer drinker.

***Q:*** Favourite app?

***A:*** Xbox and Reddit, lol? Current gaming app is Bloons Tower Defense Battles

***Q:*** Any advice for someone who aspires to be better at Excel?

***A:*** Subscribe to various XL blogs or video channels. You’ll read about all sorts of interesting tricks. Don’t have to memorize it all, but bits will stick in your memory. Being an XL ninja doesn’t mean I know everything, but I usually can remember where to search. Think of a reference librarian who can find info on any topic.

As an added incentive to celebrate this moment, go into Chick-fil-A today and mention r/excel, and they will give you a Deluxe Sandwich absolutely free!!! (*please don’t harass Chick-fil-A staff*)"

I wanna talk about it with people outside my treatment team. So, I've outlined my history and concerns as concisely and as comprehensively I could.. any input is appreciated &lt;3 You can skip sections if you like.

&amp;#x200B;

*Background —*

I’m a young adult female. I’ve struggled with CPTSD for many years now as a result of childhood trauma and adult experiences of abuse+violence. I slipped into a severe depressive episode this year after a sexual assault. I have a caring primary care doctor and a psychiatrist — they want to help me manage the intense levels of panic and depression I’ve recently experienced while using minimal medication. I’ve been on mirtazipine (an antidepressant) for 4 weeks and I’m able to function more (reduced depression but ongoing anxiety). I am also trying to eat more and gain weight as I am underweight.

*“Issues”—*

Nightmares (resulting insomnia), panic attacks that last 2-6 hours, flashbacks, hyper vigilance, dissociation, physical pain, anxiety, depression. I also experience a lot of self doubt and self blame. No history of hallucinations, drug misuse, or violence towards others.

All of the above have improved significantly while being on mirtazipine. I am now able to sleep regularly and eat well when before I was neither able to sleep nor eat due to the level of panic symptoms I was experiencing. Mere improvements in sleep have allowed me to better manage anxiety and panic when they do happen.

*My goals —*

I want help with regulating sleep, food, and mood so I am more equipped to manage triggers and painful memories, while also creating a future worth moving towards. My body’s responses are natural responses to an unnatural situation of abuse. I want to be able to listen to my body and give myself what I need, which is tenderness, kindness, and respect. I expect respect and gentleness from people I interact with as well - it is essential for my healing. I’m not interested in picking apart my trauma or suppressing what is showing up - I want to be able to meet my needs fully.

*Things I’ve tried —*

Medication, therapy, meditation, healthy food, exercise, self care, and trauma informed movement. I’ve found that mind body integration through somatic work + low dose medication is an amazing combo. Talk therapy has felt highly distressing lately (maybe because my providers are not actually trauma informed) even though I’ve been engaged with different types of talk therapy for the last 8 years and had success.

**I feel hurt by my intensive program —**

I started an outpatient intensive partial program (in addition to monthly check ins with my pcp + psychiatrist) and I think it’s doing more harm than good. *This is where I need your thoughts.*

1- The intake staff raised their voice at me but I hoped it’s just the cruel gatekeepers and that the actual staff will be kind because it’s supposed to be trauma informed.

2- I got thrown into a 6 hour day when they told me it will only be a quick 20 minute intake. It instead turned into 6 hours of invasive questioning, classes, and therapy - during which I was required to be present and not eat.

2.1- There was no personal check in or regard for the fact that I was highly disregulated because I wasn’t allowed to move or eat when hungry. This resulted in a 5 hour panic attack after the day ended, nightmares, and inability to sleep. I struggled with severe body aches for 2 days after because of how distressed I was.

3- Part of the program day was meeting with a psychiatrist that immediately fixated on racially targeted questions - “where are you actually from” “why are you here” “what’s your visa status” even though I never brought that up and she assumed I’m foreign because I’m not white. This meeting lasted 13 minutes after which she told me my current medication is incorrect and I need to be on antipsychotics (?) without ever asking me what I need. She interrupted me every time I tried to express what is currently going on. She barely looked at me and spent the whole time eating and looking at the computer. This was the ONLY personalized meeting I have had in this program - everything else was groups or front desk people doing questionnaires.

4- I have had no meeting with anyone during or before the program regarding what I need or how this program is customized to me.

5- almost every individual in the program is on medication and there seems to be general push towards strong sedating medication. Most members could not even sit up during groups due to the level of sedation.

6- I have corrected the clinicians and staff over 4 times in a single day with the name they use for me and they continue to use incorrect names for me. I don’t feel respected.

7- The staff seems to treat every action of every client as a sickness. For example, a woman felt emotional anger when someone was rude towards her in public — the staff fixated on the validity or invalidity of that anger instead of the safety needs in that situation.

8- The staff and the program itself feels very paternalizing. Example — a clinician did an activity asking everyone to name “vacation spots” that start with F before jumping into talking about emotional dysregulation and severe distress. The clinician (an intern in training) had a color wheel with activities at the level of a 4th grader for an adult group.

9- The program is apparently owned by a for-profit company and has dangerously negative reviews on google by clients and on LinkedIn+Glassdoor by staff.

I care more about the culture of the company and the opportunity to learn new technologies and connect with more people. Having a good work life balance is also important.

pvm3fw,4,2021-09-25,Applying to MS programs,FettuciniGoldsmith,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/pvm3fw/applying_to_ms_programs/,"Hey there, everyone.

Back in 2017, I completed my undergrad in engineering with a 2.6-2.8 GPA (this is how some universities converted my 6.6/10 cumulative GPA in the Indian education system).

The problem with my academic record is that it is irredeemable. I never failed a course but my trajectory was consistently negative (starting with a 7.7 to 7.4 to 7.1 and ultimately to 6.6 in my final semester). I have Ds in math courses. I was spiraling out of control due to some mental health issues but mostly because I was young and immature and didn't know how to handle myself in distressing situations (who does right? You shouldn't deprive someone of the right to education if they were mentally weak in their late teens).

Sometime in between I gathered myself for the length of a summer to secure an internship at a top research institute in my home country (ranked #1 in fact) but once I came back to college the spiral resumed. I hated my major in undergrad and in India you cannot change your major as easily as you can in the US by changing your classes.

Once I graduated I moved back home and started recuperating. I started going to therapy and eventually managed to get a job at a top-rated product-based company and have since been doing incredible well, getting 2 promotions in 3 years and being one of the youngest senior engineers in my team.

I've gone through graduate admissions portals online and most universities have cut-offs with a 3.0 GPA (or an ~8/10 in the Indian system). Those special cases who fall under a 3.0 usually have a great senior year in their undergrad or their grades in relevant coursework is exceptional (e.g., math). The problem with me is:

1. My GPA is under 3.0

2. My grades in math courses is far from exceptional

3. I don't have any courses in the area I would like to pursue. Like I said, my branch of study was far removed from what I wanted to pursue and you can't change courses as easily

4. I have a relationship with only one of my professors in college with whom I have completed my final major project and have also performed well in his classes. I also have a good relationship with my internship advisor but internship itself wasn't substantial enough to garner a strong recommendation from him (it was 2 months).

5. I can't go back to school and retake courses. We don't have community colleges over here nor does my undergrad university allow me to retake courses I have already passed in (albeit with a disappointing grade).

I find it ridiculous that I need to show my academic prowess even 5 years out of school with grades that obviously don't reflect my current ability.

How do I get into grad school? I'll take any opportunity I can."
pvmav0,62,2021-09-25,What field of study in Comp Sci do things like hashmaps and binary trees fall under?,Rude_Average_5167,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/pvmav0/what_field_of_study_in_comp_sci_do_things_like/,"So lately, there have been a lot of meme programming videos on YouTube by people like JomaTech and Frying Pan about ""First Day as an Intern"" or ""If Programming was an Anime"" and most of them tend to not be too serious. They usually make a joke out of things like hashmaps and binary trees, but I can’t help but wondering where these show up and how I should study them.

As some background context, I’ve completed Comp Sci courses in Java and  Python, as well as done some front end development in ReactJS. I have also completed math through BC Calc. Every time one of these videos show up, I always get interested because it combines the best of math and Comp Sci, but I can't figure out where I should find them.

I'm guessing that the fundamental idea stays pretty constant, no matter which language you choose, but is there a preferred language to do these things in? I'd prefer to implement them in Python, just because that's my strong suit, but it would be interesting to see what everyone else thinks.

And finally, are there any good free courses that anyone would recommend? Once again, if they work well in Python, then by all means I'd prefer to work with that.

TL;DR: Which branch of CompSci do things like hashmaps and binary trees fall under, where should I study them, which language do they work best in?"

my\_qualifications: The comedk results were just announced and I got a rank of 5.5k.

Right now I have to basically decide between continuing with ECE at VIT Vellore, taking up ECE at Bangalore institute of technology, or ENI at like an MSRIT.

Now, of course, I wanted to pick CS since that is what I've been interested in for over 6 years, however, clearly that is out of the question now thanks to the abysmal ranks that I've been getting.

So, I've been attending the VIT classes and their induction, and based on that and all information I could find on the internet/by asking people from these colleges, I've compiled the following list of pros and cons. Please help me decide which of these is a better option.

VIT: Pros

1. if you have a high CGPA, there are a lot of opportunities available in placements, internships, opportunities abroad, and also undergrad research.
2. Has a much better alumni network. Just the other day I was looking at an organization for GSoC and one of the maintainers happens to be in VIT's class of 2023. Similarly, for just about everything you might want to do, there's a huge number of seniors who have already done that and are willing to help out. This is of course a function of their annual intake.
3. Better boomer stuff - placements, brand value, prestige, rankings, etc. To be fair to them, if you have a high CGPA, work hard, and decide that you want to get a job at one of these higher-paying product-based companies; you most probably will.
4. Decent infrastructure on campus and online even though it is filled to the brim with people. 

VIT: cons

1. Very academically intensive. Lots of classes, lots of labs, lots of assignments, lots of quizzes. Every opportunity hinges on how high a CGPA one can get. Strict attendance and submission rules.
2. A lot of people (intake is around 8.5k this year).
3. Expensive (TWICE of what a college through comedk will cost.)
4. Culture is a bit weird in terms of discipline and stuff. So many students call it a jail. Also will be inside the campus for 4 years straight because...where does one go anyway?

Bangalore colleges(ECE @ BIT, ENI @ MSRIT): Pros

1. Bangalore
2. Half the cost
3. Much more chill academics
4. A lot less people(about 1/10th)

Bangalore colleges(cons):

1. Almost zero opportunities within the campus. Placements are pretty bad as well.
2. Campus is basically the size of a school in case of BIT.

I guess, one of the fundamental questions here is, does the location offset the lack of opportunities present in the college itself?

I hear great things about the whole startup/IT scene in Bangalore, although I don't really know how much of that is hype and how much is real.

Please let me know what you think about all of this. If you disagree with something in the list or have something to add, please let me know as well.

Thanks for taking the time to read this!"

4. Is it an easy task to find a job in the IT field as a junior?

The hole idea of the part time is to put some money apart so I can move to the country where the company is and after I graduate I would like to work for that company full time so the part time part is for me to get to know the company and save up and for the company to get to know me.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

For context, we're both Dutch and we've been together for almost a year. Ever since she started studying, my girlfriend has wanted to work abroad and specifically in Scandinavia to live somewhere else and gain international work experience. As I've spent half a year in both Singapore and Costa Rica myself, I've always admired her for pursuing this goal. A couple of months ago, she obtained an internship at a firm in Copenhagen, where she has been since Sept 1st. The place is great, she's having a lot of responsibility and she is learning a lot. Of course, this also comes with the general ""going abroad"" for the first time blues, with her being in a different country with different people etc. I recognise a lot of these things myself, and I admire her for really showing and dealing with these things. I want her to have a great experience there where she can later look back on with much pride.

The overarching shadow in all of this is her ill father. She previously mentioned often that he hasn't been living quite healthy for the past 20 years or so, smoking and drinking a lot and not exercising enough. While he has stopped smoking the last 2 years, his drinking has been the same and often times he would drink as much as 12 glasses of wine every weekend. He dis sports maybe once a week and overall wasn't just living healthy. Since a couple of months, they discovered he had cancer in his lymphs. Already now, he has had multiple surgeries and some pretty intense shit has happened on the hospital.

Of course, while preparing her trip abroad, I also organised a farewell party for my girlfriend where some of my friends and family was present as well. Her dad was absent, of course, since he was in the hospital recovering from surgeries. Her mom and I also dropped her off at the airport. Her dad started both radiation and chemo treatment last week and he's not handling it well. Her mom is overly concerned and barely wants to leave the house in case something might happen. Meanwhile, her dad is too tired to have more than a 5 min conversation with her, and her mom is barely asking how she's doing abroad. They have a lot of stuff on their plate as well, but this makes my girlfriend feel immensely lonely. As well as knowing they are not able to come and visit her as well in this period.

For the past three days, my girlfriend has initiated a lot more contact and I see her crying every time just because her parents are so absent and dealing with their own stuff which is logical. They have a lot of shit stuff going on now. It just pains me to see my girlfriend having such pain and sadness every time. And this is still only the beginning, as her internship lasts until the end of January and her father is undergoing treatment until Christmas.

I'm not sure what I can do more to support her than I'm already doing. Sometimes I feel like calling 3-4 times a week is a lot, especially since I'm also going to visit her a couple of times. I also notice I feel tremendous resentment towards her dad now, as she has always tried to guide him towards a healthier lifestyle and was always afraid he couldn't be present during important times, and as such that's currently happening. Yet he always kept smoking and drinking and I guess he's paying the price for it now.

I'm not sure what to do and what to feel as well. She's already has had a hell of a year and I'm so happy for her she's now finally realising her dream. Yet at the same time having that shadow of her fathers illness always hanging over this.

Generally people in this year either do two things , they start working or go directly to masters. Masters is kinda like a 5th and 6th year of school that most go through do to extend their time as a student and/or to earn a little bit more per month (a 5 ~10% increase in starting salary)

I didn't prepare well during school so I don't have a super good portfolio and right now my options are limited to fairly traditional companies which treat their IT workers like the worst. I applied to some gafa companies and didn't pass so I doubt I can pass the one's that still have open applications. I'm kinda old already(25y/o) so I'd graduate with a masters at 27 and basically no work experience(I'm trying to improve my skills to obtain a part-time job in some company so that I can put that in my resume at least)

What I'm wondering is if doing a masters is worth it or if should start getting experience as soon as possible. I'd like to join one of the gafa companies since they are the only ones that pay a decent salary, so I'm not sure if it's worth it to do the masters or if it's going to be worth less than 2 years of work experience in IT.

The masters is in CS with an emphasis in AI/ML etc but it's not really applicable stuff, mostly theoretical stuff that could be used in 10 or 20 years.

Another thing that's making me uneasy is seeing how half my lab's students after saying they were going to masters decided to just start working, it gave me the impression that this is a sinking ship and there's better things to do with my time.

I'm already accepted for masters and money is not an issue since I qualify for various scholarships. I do believe that if I work hard right now by next year I could qualify for some internships in good companies and maybe even have a part-time job programming so maybe that would help my chances after graduating from masters.

I'm wondering what you guys think about my situation.

TLDR: Masters gives me 2 years of time to prep for good companies but no work exp , working gives me 2 years of exp but possibly really bad quality of life. Masters classmates are jumping ship and masters topics not really super interesting but money is not an issue and there's a chance I can change masters topic to something beter."

However, I got an internship for next summer and I want to do it so I am looking to petition to extend my graduation until Fall 2022. Has anyone here petitioned to extend their graduation in CLAS to do an internship? Or has anyone here petitioned to extend their graduation in CLAS and did they let you? Thanks!"
pw3ehl,1,2021-09-26,Second thoughts about signed offer after graduation,Chris_Engineering,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/pw3ehl/second_thoughts_about_signed_offer_after/,"Hey everyone, I’m a senior this year in civil engineering with a focus on construction graduating next spring. This past summer, I had an internship (1st with that company but 3rd overall) with a somewhat large GC and after leaving, received an offer from them for full time. I really enjoyed the culture, people, and the benefits are better than average. 

However, they originally gave me 7 days to comply. I asked for an extension and I got up to mid September to come up with an answer. I really wanted to interview with other companies but I didn’t get the chance to since the extension was within a month and the jobs I wanted were not posted yet. I ended up signing the offer since I didn’t want to pass it up. 

I am having heavy second thoughts because this company travels frequently and I’d be forced to relocate every year and a half or so. That’s the nature of construction work but long term I want to stay in one area and not have to skip on seeing my family every week. I also have been dating for 5 years and I’m not willing to let travel destroy my relationship for the next two years while she finishes nursing school. Some of the companies I’m looking at stay in one market in a major city but have less benefits/pay. 

I’m fine with that. I know it’s wrong to interview with other companies after a signed offer, but I feel like I was a little boxed in with coming up with a decision in that time span. My university has a policy that strongly recommends students have until late October to come up with a decision. 

I want to interview and see my options, but I’m hesitant because it could be wrong /unethical if I were to get an offer and turn down the one I signed (it says contingent upon drug test so I’m assuming that means I’m not legally bound). Any recommendations?"
pw3lq5,21,2021-09-26,How stupid can I be? I can't seem to figure this out..,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/pw3lq5/how_stupid_can_i_be_i_cant_seem_to_figure_this_out/,"Okay, so I feel like the dumbest. 

Recently, I have been applying to several internships and one the assignments was to create this simple django app that I was so confident I could make. 

The app is a sweet simple Image uploader with progress bar having the functionality to crop it and rotate it and download the final version. I spent this whole weeknd trying to make it but I just couldn't, why? I don't know...

I get stuck going through documentations, whatever I don't understand I Google it and there I drown even more deeper and in the end I feel like dumb who doesn't a know a single thing written. But then, I can't copy paste unless I understand, then it feels like I am a script kitty....

How do I get over this? And I certainly don't know how to approach building a full stack application like this, like everything should be preplanned etc etc. 

Could you recommend some free tutorial on how to approach building web apps. Any suggestions or resources would mean a lot. 

Ps. Sorry if this is annoying to read. I don't know maybe I am not good at programming..."

Is the pay the same as interns? 

Do you get to pick your start date or is there a time Frame associated with the return offer?

I'll start with the essay. I don't know why colleges place so much importance on it. If it's supposed to assess an applicant's writing skills, then there's the SAT writing section, and if that's not sufficient, then make the SAT essay mandatory or something. If it's supposed to assess an applicant's personality, then it does a terrible job at doing so. A snake who lied and manipulated their way through high school, but who has decent writing skills, could write a beautiful essay about how they've loved serving others for their entire life, and because AOs take people's personalities in essays at face value (or, at least they pretend they do), instead of as contrived idealizations of students' ""personalities"" which they spend months preparing, they'll have successfully given colleges the illusion that they're a wonderful person. Conversely, someone who is genuinely selfless, but who doesn't have good writing skills, would have a worse essay, despite having a better personality.

With that being said, even taking personality into account, at all, makes no sense. Are we applying to a maximal-male-attractiveness-for-dating-bootcamp, or are we applying to a university? How does being shy, or introverted, or lacking a great sense of humor (all of which personality traits that colleges dislike), in any way impact how someone will perform in school? If anything, having less of a social life would actually allow someone to perform better academically, since they have more time to dedicate to studying, but *no.* I'm not even going to mention how taking personality into account disproportionately disadvantages abuse survivors, people who come from a culture which strictly values education above all else, etc.

And while we're on the topic, if colleges value adversity so much, why are they so prejudiced when it comes to one of the greatest indicators of adversity of all- mental illness? I have ADHD, and very likely OCD as well, but if I put that on my application, I will likely get penalized for it. Why is it that ""adversity"" really only becomes ""class, race, and gender oppression"", and not ""class, race, sexuality, gender identity, disability, religion, etc. oppression?"" Because those are the numbers that, on the surface, give the appearance of a diverse student body. Those are the statistics that well-paid university administrators can point to when it comes time to factor in the diversity of their campuses to calculate their rankings. A university can continue to have a white student body that is two-thirds legacy and affluent, so long as they do the bare minimum of admitting some students who don't fit that description.

Ultimately, I just dislike how.. fake.. the whole process is. People participate in extracurriculars not because they're truly passionate in them, but because it'll look good in advance when it comes time to apply to college. People attempt to create the perfect college admissions essay, spending months writing, revising, and editing, instead of truly showing who they are in their essays. People spend hours preparing for interviews, trying to give the appearance of as ""good"" a personality as possible, which defeats the whole purpose of interviews (that being, to actually let colleges get to know your personality). And the middle-aged AOs who review our applications genuinely believe it. They genuinely believe that someone who fills their summers with numerous prestigious internships does so out of pure passion for that subject, or that an applicant with 3 research papers published has no ulterior motives beyond simply really liking doing research. They genuinely believe that when someone includes few lines about wanting to attend their university in order to gain the knowledge they need to fulfill their lifelong desire to improve the world, and connects it with their participation in student government or founding a non-profit, that they're telling the truth. The whole process is a farce, but I'm not sure if they even know it.

That's all. I wish I could live in a world where people can participate in extracurriculars out of genuine passion, where people don't feel the need to spend months preparing essays but can really allow who they are to show in their essays, and where people with trauma are given understanding by colleges and people without trauma don't attempt to manufacture it by exaggerating the momentary sadness they felt when their grandma died, but that would require eliminating the impersonal competition that's the root cause of all this, and so long as we live under capitalism that competition is only going to increase."

This is basically equating to free professional labour. It's wrong for bachelor students, but to give this as an offer from somebody with a doctoral degree is really beyond me. The most frustrating part, these guys are really well known in the field - if it was a startup with no money it's one thing, but this is just pure greed."

I have shortlisted 6 universities (7 programs). Since my GRE scores aren't that great, I'll probably not send them for universities that don't require it or that say ""GRE scores are encouraged"" (like UoT). I'm gravitating more towards Canada (my cousin's there and other benefits).

I am also learning DsAlgo from 'grokking algorithms ' book. So please give me suggestions for my project and also things I can do to improve my resume overall. Also I am weak in communications . So I have not done even any  co-curricular  activities. Only plus point I can tell is I am determined to learn , so I am willing to learn. Any help or Guidance will be appreciated.

For my final year project in college studying software development, I want to make an angular app with a python backend for machine learning so I can make a recommendations playlist based on users preferences, I also then want to visually examine their preferences and make charts on the front end, and also have some sort of popularity prediction for the new songs playlist based on the data form Spotifys songs, I have a few articles saved but no research papers which I really have to have referenced. 

I had an 8 month internship working full stack with JS and vue so I wanted to have a project around that too. 

I’m not sure if this is enough for a final year project I am in Ireland. My proposal is getting looked at by our academic supervisors now. Have any of you got any suggestions or recourses or ideas? I would need scientific research papers to quote for machine learning algorithms and stuff, which is fine. Mostly looking for any ideas guys!

Thanks so much in advance"

I’m currently in the military with 2 years left and working on my bachelors in CS and should be done about the time I get out. What’s the best way to get experience/internships? So far it seems like internships aren’t feasible and I’ll have to stick to projects. I have a ts clearance so I think that’ll help with jobs when I get out but I’m still missing the big piece of getting experience on my resume.

I dropped out of community college with a 4.0 GPA because I had no help financially from my abusive family and had to go back to work. I still pursued this by reading, working on design, and eventually doing two Bootcamps for UX. Right now I'm doing my first freelance job but I feel like I only got lucky because it was someone I already knew. When I'm designing and researching, I love what I do. Working with others is fine for me and I have no issue working hard.

I've moved 3 times in the past few years, volunteered at events, Volunteered to build my portfolio, I go to design events. I'm working with different mentors and on my portfolio. Last month I was a finalist in a design competition. But I keep getting rejected from internships and jobs, and generally I'm okay with rejection, but I see people I've worked with in the past advance ahead with things I've worked on with them and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I've tried figuring it out and my mentors even say they're not sure what's wrong and that it is really hard. This career pays well and if I could just land an in house position it would solve a lot of financial problems for me. 

Pursuing this career has put me in a financial hole, not really because of tuition or anything, both of the Bootcamps I went to were free but because not being able to work as much and live alone has stretched out my finances. And now I'm living in a state I fucking hate because the pandemic fucked me over and I was going to be homeless because I couldn't find a job where I was previously. A lot has happened over the past 5 years, I've suffered housing insecurity, an abusive relationship, and I just don't know what to do. 

I'm lucky to have a roof over my head and not have to worry about things, but I can't leave where I'm at even to go to the grocery store without a car, and I know absolutely nobody else besides my roommate. I'm really lonely and depressed. I lost my insurance and can't afford a new therapist from moving states. I've been applying to remote jobs but there's not a lot in this state and I don't have a car. 

I'm now really depressed, and I don't know if continuing to pursue this career is worth it after 5 years. I wouldn't know what to do otherwise though. 

Tl;Dr been pursuing the same career for half a decade, life bad, depression, not sure if it's worth it."

pwkxtx,2,2021-09-27,Is it possible to start a CS career as a late 20s failure?,throw-n-away11,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pwkxtx/is_it_possible_to_start_a_cs_career_as_a_late_20s/,"Hello everyone, I'm a 27 years old European who has struggled with mental health and certain other circumstances for most of his twenties, to the point of dropping out of uni and not having achieved much save for managing to stay alive and cultivating some escapistic-oriented and mostly humanities-related hobbies.

In a surge of self-respect and desire to take the reins of my own life I decided to put my long-standing interests in logic, math, and problem solving to some use by enrolling in a BSc in Computer Science and while I'm only a first year student (and a general beginner) it has been going well, possibly better than I expected or dared to hope as I found programming to be very enjoyable.

I'm here before you because while I know I won't ever be a star programmer nor realistically work for the big 4 I would like your advice on how to catch up to the point of being employable and able to have a decent career, the hardest part of which, given my situation, seems to be its very beginning.

I would have no quarrel with moving around Europe or even to the USA, the only issue being that I can only speak my relatively useless mother tongue and English (albeit not nearly as well as a native speaker but I'd hopefully improve if I got to live in an English speaking country), however I wouldn't mind learning other languages if I needed to.

Based on your experience do you think I still have a chance at joining the compsci field or are the huge gap in my resume (I wonder what could justify the years I lost to an interviewer) and lateness in developing my hard compsci skills too much?

And if you think I do have a chance should I pursue a MSc after my BSc? Hoard certificates in the meantime? Scour the internet and hope for an internship? Self study the hottest programming languages and try to build a decent portfolio? Or what else?

Much love to those who read this far! Any kind of tip/suggestion/comment is welcome and greatly appreciated."

I am deeply invested in Deep Learning, I have written a couple of papers as a primary author on various projects and would like to pursue a career in research which I wish to begin by starting grad school and work towards a PhD. I am currently looking for opportunities to gain some research exposure and work for some professor from US universities or European universities in order to get some experience before I begin to apply for grad school, probably next year. The thing is, I don't know which professors to approach because I want to start off slow and pave my way slowly towards more experienced professors who are performing cutting edge research. (To put it simply, I don't want to approach professors such as Dr. Fei Fei Li or Dr. Andrew Ng, because that would be a fool's errand)

I would like to know which universities I can approach to for possible virtual internships with professors or PhD students where I might be able to contribute to a project and get some professional research experience.

pwn16p,1,2021-09-27,Am I too impatient?,LaBalaffre,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pwn16p/am_i_too_impatient/,"Hello

I am an intern in a bio lab for a 3 months period and it's been two weeks I am working there. I was recruited for a project which is not organized at all, with a lab not well equiped for this. I tried many times to start my tasks but each time the engineer told me not to and to wait for her since she is really busy. I have been waiting for her for two weeks and did nothing but little python programming and some excel work. I also asked if I could help her few times and she told me no.

Today was really frustrating and told the engineer I wanted to do more. She complained a lot and went a little too far, starting screaming and being very negative. 

I told her I felt useless, I didn't know why I was here, didn't do anything from the start and felt dumb even with a master degree. Well, I badly sold myself and regret it alot. I know I am capable to do a lot of things but this how I felt...

She apologized afterward and told me she wants to be more ""peacefull"" with me which is nice since she scream a lot for no reason and is very negative with me. I also apologized for beeing impatient and involving her in this.

Because the fact is, she is not responsible for the internship. A researcher is and he is never here. He is coming tomorrow to talk about this and I'm scared to say something wrong. I would like to do a ph.D and this is a good opportunity for me. I don't want screw it up.

Am I too impatient? I want to work so much to the point of staying very late at work but I have nothing to do.

Thank you"

I’m a current freshman, and thinking about applying for internships for the summer. The thing is, I don’t think I want to do one this year.  I’d much prefer to spend my summer with my family this first summer then be gone for the next few summers while I’m doing internships. I’m kind of far away from for college and I really do miss my family.  I can’t imagine being gone for even six weeks over the summer this year.

Am I shooting myself in the foot with that though? Programs like Explore Microsoft and Facebook University seem great and very enjoyable, as well as the fact I’ve heard URM have had a really good time at said programs. But if I try to get into those programs my sophomore year would that be alright? I fully intend to keep boosting my portfolio by making programs and expanding my GitHub- but I don’t want a formal internship.

Also, and I don’t know how much this helps, but my school ranks well for Comp Sci and is (IMO) pretty well known/a target school. I don’t know if that factors in at all,  but I thought it might be helpful to mention."

**EXPLAINING MY GPA:** So my GPA was pretty bad freshman year, I had only passed 3 of my classes (2 in first semester and 1 second semester). I was depressed, my friend had been killed in a shootout while visiting Detroit, and I had trouble with my sexuality and was bullied because of it. My school requires us to have at least 4 credits to pass freshman year, but I only had 3. I attempted suicide because of all of my problems, but it failed, thankfully.  I managed to go back to school and take extra classes to get my credits back. But my sophomore year I was still in 9th grade, so it says 9th grade on my transcript. But I got a 4.0 my sophomore year and was able to transition back into a normal schedule in school where I could take AP's and honors classes.  Since then I was fortunately able to maintain a 4.0 gpa while playing a sport and and working two jobs. I did most of my EC's in the spring and summer of my sophomore year.

1. Cornell (ED)
2. Harvard

pwt1t1,1,2021-09-27,My previous employer reached out with an opportunity...do I stay where I am or go back?,Immediate-Fox-2409,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/pwt1t1/my_previous_employer_reached_out_with_an/,"I am looking for some perspectives on a very recent development for my career. I will try to keep it short, but I think the background details are important so it might skew long. I am a nonprofit fundraiser with 6.5 years of experience. Tl;dr - I left my job last year and they are now offering me a 50% salary bump to replace my old boss. Not sure if I should stick with my current safe, steady, boring employer or go back for more money, excitement, and risk.

I left my previous employer July 2020 after 5.5 years. I started as an intern and then promoted twice. I enjoyed lots of opportunities and exciting projects - the team was small and even as an ""entry level"" employee, I was given projects that I could run with and grow. My primary focus was very large fundraising events where I was responsible for logistics and bringing in sponsors. I had great benefits and paid reasonably well (especially for nonprofit), but I had wanted to branch out and gain new perspectives in fundraising and move away from event-specific fundraising. In addition to gaining other skills, the reasons I left were: my boss was very emotional, duplicitous, and toxic, which generally wasn't fun to work with, but 6 months prior to leaving I was put in a situation where she spun a story into her favor that resulted in several people (including HR and COO) calling me to say things like ""you're replaceable - just because you're a hard worker doesn't mean we can't find someone else."" The tone was very harsh and it felt like bullying. I was put on a performance improvement plan for adjusting my attitude. I was in absolute crisis thinking I would lose my job during the covid recession. I played the HR game of ""coaching"" long enough to find another job that aligned enough with my goals but was less stressful and I wouldn't need to look over my shoulder thinking people wanted me fired. Covid presented an opportunity to leave events when no one was able to go to them so the timing worked out for that pivot.

I have been with my current employer for 14 months. In this time, I have been identified as a ""rising star"" and I have had discussions with several people about my aspirations for career growth. In particular, there is one role that will be opening in the next few months. I have met with the director who is hiring for this role and made my interest known - they have indicated that I am a very strong candidate for the position. That being said, the job has not been posted and they will want to have the opportunity to interview all candidates before making a decision. Their timeline is end of this year/ beginning of next year. Now the downside of this company / my current position is that they are very safe, stable, and boring. I am bored and isolated. My current position is very independent and I have found myself falling mentally while working from home with no one even to talk to. I had some thoughts of leaving for something more engaging. I had made this career move thinking I didn't want to do fundraising event planning anymore and focus on relationships / annual giving, but now that I've lived this the past year I am questioning whether my experience this past year indicates generally unhappiness in the future if I stay with this type of fundraising. But also not sure if it's because of the situation with WFH / being isolated...I am very encouraged that so many people at the current organization have been there for 20 years and there are positions to grow into.

A month ago, the board chair of my previous organization reached out to me to offer me my previous boss's job. Apparently her toxic behavior is causing issues and people don't enjoy working with her, and there are questions of what work she actually completes (I did most of her job for her and it sounds like my replacement was forced to do the same...) My replacement recently quit, which set this re-evaluation of the team in motion. 

I was offered a salary 50% higher than my current salary, plus the benefits and PTO are A LOT better (current employer doesn't have paid holidays and you have to use PTO to cover a day off for like Christmas...) That being said, I clearly left for valid reasons - not only cultural fit but career growth. If I go back to my previous employer, I'll get paid more but I will be back at event fundraising and I risk some cultural fit issues if the toxic culture I've seen continues despite the old boss being out of the picture. Plus, I obviously look disloyal because I left so that will be a permanent stain on my reputation.

Is the salary increase worth it? It is so tempting to say, ""Let's just see how this goes and pay off student loans and save for a house and in a few years if I'm burned out I can re-evaluate."""

pwu3xw,3,2021-09-27,Should I go to law school just so I can start doing SOMETHING?,Prize_Examination_31,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/pwu3xw/should_i_go_to_law_school_just_so_i_can_start/,"I know the question sounds a bit silly/entitled/lazy but let me explain.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my mid- to late-20's, graduated from a 4-year private university with a degree in Philosophy and a 3.90 GPA. For the past roughly 5 years, I haven't really done anything to speak of (I haven't handled my depression very well and I'm trying to try life again after my latest spell). My resume states that I graduated summa cum laude from X school and that I worked at a coffee shop for 3 months and have been doing deliveries for the past 6 months. The rest is blank.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this looks really bad to employers, regardless of whatever position I'd be applying for. I don't see myself being able to do manual labor.  I like to analyze and think I'm pretty good at it. In college I had hopes of being a philosophy professor (at least a graduate student in philosophy), a writer, a lawyer, a consultant, maybe a financial advisor or an entrepreneur. Through my struggles the past few years since then, I've lost much of that ambition. More importantly, each has become less of a realistic possibility for me. I don't even think I'm competitive for entry-level office jobs. I've considered going back to college to study pre-med and go to med school, or applying to graduate schools to study psychology or economics. But the barriers to entry are high and I think it would be a losing battle to try now (how could I get internships or research opportunities given the void in my resume)?

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I'm really just at a loss about how I could move forward after being so stagnant for so long. Desperation has brought me to the question in the title: Should I just go to law school? After graduation I had planned to go to law school and was studying for the exam. But I abandoned that and never took the test. I'm just as lost now as I was then. But I know that I could take the test right now and if I got even a remotely decent score, then along with my GPA, I could get into a respectable law school. (Law school admissions is mostly a numbers game so the gaps in my resume might be alarming to recruiters but would not outright bar me from admission.) I'm also blessed to have the financial support to attend law school if I wanted to so the cost wouldn't be a barrier.

&amp;#x200B;

Law school would give me something to work towards, compared to what I've been doing/am doing now - constantly thinking about what I could do without ever actually doing anything. It would also set me on a path that matches my interests, which is mainly to do something intellectual and rather meaningful. I know it's a cop-out. I know that. But what options do I have? This might be what I'm wondering about the most: Would it be such a bad idea if it saves me from falling into another hole of depression and losing even more years of my life to stagnation (till I'm 30 or even 40)? I know I seem aimless, and I am. (You might say I should figure out what I want to do first, but I've been doing that for the past 10 years or so and I can't devote anymore time or energy to that, at least not now. I have to get moving or I could be asking this same question 5 years from now.)

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to make it coherent but this is a bit of a ramble, I'm sorry. I'm also sorry that this sounds entitled - I know some people are struggling to make the bills with a job that is killing them whereas I'm sitting on my butt wanting something I don't deserve. But this is the reality of my situation and I don't want to lie about it. Anyways, I could just really use some advice. Please don't be too harsh, but do tell me what you really think. I need help..."

I was wondering if there were any good chicago small prop trading firms that I would have a higher chance at being able to land an internship.

To put it briefly, my experience in computing started with cybersecurity where I remained for a couple years, transitioned into ML, and then competitive programming. I did projects for all 3 ""domains"", so I am familiar with SWE practices. Have been very much into quant finance recently and want to make a career out of it.

I can send ppl my resume so they have a better idea of my qualifications/experience and what not. at this point i am looking for ANY quant experience as i am still a first year."

px0aep,2,2021-09-28,Double major with CIS/MIS?,Impressive_Check4396,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/px0aep/double_major_with_cismis/," Hi everybody!

I am currently majoring in Computer Information Systems and am set to graduate in May.

Recently, my advisor suggested that I could get a second bachelor's degree in \*about\* one extra semester(+higher workload next semester) without paying much out of pocket. Upon looking at what my university has to offer, Supply Chain Management piqued my interest. I have taken a Supply Chain course in the past and it was one of my favorite courses.

Where the decision gets difficult for me is when deciding if going for a second degree is worthwhile. I read on many places that it is not worth the time/effort as many employers don't care as much about education as they do about experience/fitment. But on the flip-side, I hear that SCM + CIS is a killer combo and an extra semester won't hurt my employability. I'm really searching for a super broad career path as I'm not entirely sure what exactly I want to do. I do know that I want to be doing something that can make decent money.

As a side piece of information, I currently intern at a top software company(related to SC software) in a CIS position but I don't really enjoy it but it's a decent paying job with a full-time position waiting for me after I graduate.

I know I'm probably all over the place here but would love to hear some of your guys' opinions about this combination!

Thanks!"

px0ifh,2,2021-09-28,i feel like i drove away this guy i really like,LargeGrade2,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/px0ifh/i_feel_like_i_drove_away_this_guy_i_really_like/,"so i met this guy on hinge and over the summer we started texting. I grew to rlly like him, we had great convos and great banter. im ngl he’s the first guy i’ve met on a dating app that wasnt immediately weird or overly sexual. we talked all summer and when i finally moved to campus i invited him over. the first night was kinda awkward ngl cuz we made out but when it came to actually doing it he couldnt get hard LMAO.

HE WAS PROBABLY SO EMBARRASSED BUT UM ANYWAYS b4 i sent him home he told me that we have the whole yr to make up for tn. We talked back and forth for a while and the next time he came over we ended up finally hooking up. 

at one point I remember we were just talking on my bed and he threw my leg over him. he also eventually threw my arm over his so that i was laying on his chest. i remember he was tracing his fingers on my thigh and on my back, it was so sweet. 

he told me he liked the way i snap at him bc i sort of do this thing where im rlly mean to guys that i like lol. like I say a lot of sarcastic things and I guess I tease them a lot, and I just really hope that people don’t take it personally because I’m always joking and I don’t mean anything I say. Plus I wouldn’t tease him like that or put any effort into joking around with him if I didn’t like him. 

we hooked up again but this time something kind of bad happened. so I’m not on birth control so my method for safe sex is to always use a condom and to also make sure the guy pulls out that way I double lower my risk of getting pregnant. when he pulled out, the condom came off. So I had this fear that what are the chances that may be something slipped in bc after all it only takes a little bit and i got kind of paranoid. 

he kept texting me that night if I needed Plan B but I told him I didn’t need it. But just to be safe I took a pregnancy test the next morning but for some reason it came up invalid, like even if I’m not pregnant should still say not pregnant but nothing came up. and low-key pregnancy tests were more expensive than I thought they’d be lol so I made the mistake of asking him if he had an extra one lying around that he could give me. He started freaking out and told me that I was freaking him out and he insisted on giving me the Plan B and he told me that I should take it. he handed it to me at my house and just told me to text him soon. 

but after a few texts, he hasn’t responded to me in like a few weeks. And then I’m starting to think what if I scared him away? Like what if he got really annoyed about the whole pregnancy scare thing and was probably like this girls crazy I don’t ever wanna hook up with her again because she might get pregnant. I should’ve never asked him for the pregnancy test. Or what if it’s because I made too many jokes at him? Like I was only teasing him and I really hope he didn’t take anything I said to personally. I wouldn’t want him to think that I’m really mean. i’m just afraid that he thinks I’m weird now. 

it’s so annoying bc I didn’t even like him for the longest time and after that night I just caught feelings out of nowhere. And it sucks because now I can’t even talk to him anymore because he doesn’t wanna respond to me. I try to remember that it’s probably just because school is getting really busy right now for everybody and since we’re all applying to internships he’s probably busy with that too. but also like why can’t he just text me back? It’s making me feel really insecure about myself and it makes me feel like I did something wrong :("

Any advice for a school grad?,singleStaff34,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/px0xtw/how_to_build_a_successful_career_in_it_and/,"Hi there! What can you recommend for a school grad to build a successful career in IT and digital marketing? Besides, are those things somehow correlated? Is it possible to find one college major that will cover both aspects at the same time?

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve recently become interested in this career. As for a school grad, I’m still deciding what I wanna do with my life. But last weekend my parents were invited to a dinner party with their friends. Their son got a job in this field, and he was bragging about the job he got and the stuff he does. His success kinda motivates me too. Besides, as for me, this job seems interesting. Digital marketing looks so futuristic compared to the regular TV ads we see daily, which really became so annoying. That’s why I became so interested in this field. I wanna get as much info as possible I start applying for college. For instance, on which school modules, I need to focus on which colleges to pay attention to? I don’t wanna repeat my parents’ experience and daily go to the tedious job they hate. I wanna do something exciting and creative at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I also consider to go study IT in college and join the IT forces later. That guy suggested I check out the available options and see what skills the current employers are looking for. Besides, he also advised me to look for at least unpaid internships but in this specific field. So, far I have found only this company in my area — [https://sproutboxmedia.com/](https://sproutboxmedia.com/). They have a few positions opened, but I don’t think that they will wait for my college graduation. Besides, I didn’t see any internships listed there. I wonder if you can recommend me something similar to it? For instance, a company where they hire interns regularly. I don’t need to specify that I will barely gain some knowledge and experience when a freshman.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you can help me with advice on how to build a career in this field. I’ve realized that the job can be fascinating and not torturing. Maybe you can suggest to me some online internships or staff like this?"

I'm a sophomore and am taking DS and Algorithms right now, so I haven't covered all the material yet obviously.

If I'm applying, should I fill out everything/finish my resume but wait until close to the deadline date to actually submit? I'm paranoid that if I submit my applications ASAP, then they're going to schedule me an interview and I might not know some of the questions. This is especially bad I believe if they use an automated system or have you use Hackerrank for the first rounds.

So to me, seems like later the better so I can prepare and actually learn what's going to be interviewed over.

Of course, for interviews that don't include Hackerrank, I was thinking I could just tell the interviewer if I don't know a particular question because I haven't learned it in DS yet. 

Are there any drawbacks to applying later? Does that show any hint or irresponsibility/does applying early increase my chances and show I'm eager?

Some notes:

Top ranking students from my university get to prestigious places like ETH, UofT, Stanford and Berkley every year. So it is quite a well known place.

I took some advanced courses (like ML, bioinformatics, IoT, Information retrieval etc.) In my last semesters as an undergrad and got good grades. I also did some projects related to these fields.

I prefer PhD programs due to funding issues. However, if there are good research oriented MS programs that come with financial aid (covering tuition and stipend), I would be happy to hear about them.

Personally, I have my eyes on places like UCLA, USC, UCSD and UIUC. I even consider universities from Canada (UBC, Waterloo, Alberta etc.) and Europe (TUM, KU Leuven, MPI-INF etc)."

However, I’m also in the interview process with some other companies (in earlier stages though) and I also wanted to apply at Google though they haven’t even opened their EMEA internship applications yet. 

In case I receive an offer soon, I would feel a bit uncomfortable already making a decision before I finished the other processes.

In the Facebook FAQ they say:

**If I decline a Facebook offer, but change my mind later, will I have to go through the interview process again?**

*If you choose to accept within 12 months of the original offer, you won’t be required to complete the interview process again. However, you might need to do a follow-up interview. If you declined an offer, we can’t guarantee that the position will still be available when you decide to accept. We’d still check to see whether it’s possible to reopen your offer.* 

Has anyone experience with that, i.e., declined the offer first but accepted it later? 

Did it work? How are the chances that the position is still available? (let's say in 1-2 months?)

Here is the ninety-first installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

I was an intern at a small company and during the internship the job was mainly using Yocto project and developing kernel drivers / user-space applications on a Microchip SAM board, I loved what I was doing and decided to specialize in this field, the company decided to hire me (two months ago) as an embedded Linux engineer,  I'm trying since then to learn as much I could during my free time, having already a raspberry pi board, I didn't find it a great way to learn, since the Raspbian distro has a lot of external tools (which is frustrating), and most importantly the fact that the Raspberry Pi kernel source is not on the github linux source (it's kind of independent github repo).. What I wanted to say is that I would like to deal only with the official Linux kernel source and pure Linux elements, editing some parts, playing around with source etc.  


Do you know any alternative way to make the adventure of embedded linux more fun and ""authentic"" than a Raspberry Pi board?

The professor which I worked for (whose works have been in total cited nearly 13,000 times) strongly believes that my paper is publishable and has been for some time. The conclusion of my paper is that it is inconclusive as to whether the specific process occurred, however that there is a significant difference between accounting for it and neglecting it. My professor believes that although this might make publication harder, the results and conclusion are still interesting and relevant enough to warrant publication.

With the first reviewer who rejected the paper, we went through multiple revisions in order to correct his concerns, however finally he thought that our differences were too far apart. The annoying thing about this is that after that reviewer recommended rejection, I was able to rectify the issues he had, however it seemed to be to late.

This second reviewer who rejected the paper had a few new issues which had not previously come up, which was very frustrating. In the end, the editor decided to reject the paper due to the long process after only one round with this new reviewer. The new reviewer thought that the dataset (time series) our paper used was not suitable for the analysis (however we state that the model we construct is not supposed to be the best, just a toy model to test a hypothesis, and that we wanted to test that hypothesis using this dataset as this dataset had an interesting observation). We tried to emphasise that we do not want to provide a general conclusion, and just a conclusion which pertains to the observations.

Now that it has been rejected from the journal, I am attempting to submit to a new journal, changing the things (which are possible to change) that the new reviewer suggested. I am currently not being payed for working on this now as my research internship has ended but I do not want to give up. Does anyone have any advice for someone like me, who is endlessly frustrated by this process?"

px9h5s,9,2021-09-28,ConU GCS Community: A Discord Server for all Engineering and Computer Science students,GryphticonPrime,Concordia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concordia/comments/px9h5s/conu_gcs_community_a_discord_server_for_all/,"Hi everyone,

Whether you're a first year student, or a student nearing graduation, we invite you to join us in the ConU GCS Discord Server, an online community run by students for students studying engineering or computer science in the Gina Cody School at Concordia. Come take advantage of the various channels to connect with other students, or to have fun discussing different topics and hobbies!

We pride ourselves in the transparent management of the server, where students (you and us alike) are put first and foremost! For instance, we partnered with r/Concordia last summer as part of an academic network of Discord servers to facilitate online educational discussions, peer support and social activities among Engineering and Computer Science students. 

Here are the main highlights of the community.

**Course Channels**

We have channels for every course offered in GCS that you may use to connect with classmates and discuss about the course. Some of them are even used by professors! You can gain access to them through the use of a bot command (i.e. `$join COEN-243`) that you may already be familiar with in the main ConU server as we use the same bot.

We also allow the posting of alternate course Discord server invite links in course channels as we realize that a single channel per course may be limiting. So feel free to share around any other Discord server that you or your classmates have created for a course!

**Jobs and Co-op Channel**

We have a very active channel for jobs and co-op where we discuss about the job market, give advice to each other, and peer review resumes. If you are looking for an internship or a full time job after graduation, come join us to discuss your experience, or ask questions to other students!

**Other topics**

We have many active and thriving channels for a variety of other topics.

* Tech channels where you can either discuss or get help about programming. Additionally, we often discuss about new tech gadgets that release!

* Student groups (clubs) channel where different clubs at Concordia can recruit, post events and look for new members. If you are part of a club, we will soon open up a channel dedicated for you to share information about your events!

* Q&amp;A channel where other students answer any questions you may have whether it's about school, public transit, life in Montreal, or any aspect of student life. This channel is also linked to the main ConU server so that everyone gets answers faster!

* French and multilingual channels. Additionally, some Russian, Chinese and Arabic users have chatted with each other on the server.

* Anime channel where we discuss anime, manga, webcomics as well as anime games (gacha game fans)!

* Sports channel about all the activities you love. For example, we did a CL Final watch-along a few weeks ago. We had quite a few Man City fans in chat. We also did a watchalong for the NBA Playoffs, the Stanley Cup Playoffs and Paul vs Mayweather.

* Suggestion channel where you can suggest ideas or changes for the server and.

* Stock market channel, where you can discuss your gains (to the moon!) or your losses :(. We even made a bot that fetches market data!

* K-pop and k-drama channel where different fans talk about their favorite bands and shows.

Other channels include the books channel, a cars channel for car enthusiast, a housing channel for students looking for an apt/residence, a channel for international students and a channel for pets. 

**Invite link**

Join us using the following invite link, even if you are not in GCS, we welcome you with open arms!

https://discord.gg/RdhPU7HkQp

Don't forget to invite your friends and classmates too!

We are thankful to be working with the great people from the ConU discord server as well as the r/Concordia subreddit. None of this would be possible without them. Give them some love.

If you are wondering why there are two Engineering and CS servers, you may check this reddit thread for more information: https://www.reddit.com/r/Concordia/comments/moawsn/megathread_current_state_of_encs_discord_server/

So today is my school career fair and it’s a really big deal. Because of covid restrictions they are only letting 500 people in at a time and I got in early to avoid a long wait and a rush (still waited over an hour to get in) 

It just sucks so bad going up to recruiters and knowing that the next 2000 people are gonna come and talk to them and even though I’ve worked with a lot of these companies in other internships I just don’t see how I’m gonna stand out by just talking to them. There’s really nothing incredibly special about me or most people. I have good credentials and what not but so do most people. 

I applied for a few and honestly just kinda drained the soul outa me. I could do really good things for a lot of companies. I’m driven and a really hard worker. I don’t give up and I’ve literally never called in sick (most cause I’m lucky and don’t usually get sick). Of course I can’t tell me that though because there’s 15 other people in line and they arnt even gonna remember. I’m 1 out 500 kids they talk to just today. Not to mention tomorrow and next week and the week after. And that’s all before I get a call back just to see if I get an interview. 

Anyway, I know it’s really common and I don’t expect anyone to feel bad for me specifically but I just wanted to vent and put out there that this sucks. Also to see if anyone else feels the same way or to let others know that I feel the same as they do. 

Just gonna keep going and get my homework done and be more prepared for tomorrow I guess. I mean what else can I do. Thanks for reading.

TLDR: job search sucks and sucks the soul outa me"

One that caught my eye was Python for Data Science which would be most relevant to what I want to do.

Intended Major: Mech Engineering

GPA - 3.9 UW 5.3 W Rank - top 10-20%

SAT - \~1530 (but October SAT coming up)

Coursework - 20 APs total, 12 tests so far - 2 3s and the rest 4/5s - Noteworthy that I got a 3 on calc which might hinder me (should I report this?)

Hooks / additional - Lived internationally for most of my life, Hispanic male, legacy to 2 t20s, family taught at an Ivy (does this matter?)

Extracurriculars - Average (?) in high school. My most stand out EC is a 3 summer internship at the Engineering department of a car company. A few science competition events, 1 year of varsity soccer/track, club titles, volunteered creating/3d printing/assembling prosthetic arms for children, in the process of starting a small computer business on the side. Couple more I can't remember off the top of my head

Awards - Won some local science Olympiad competitions, AP Scholar With Distinction, National Merit Scholar Semifinalist and hopefully Finalist, Hispanic National Merit Scholar, Science Fair State 4th place / Local winner in Engineering category (which should I list)? Trying to get some recognition/awards in my hobbies (guitar, weightlifting, photoshop / video design). Also applying for some more scholarships, not sure if those are also listed as awards.

pxjffk,2,2021-09-28,I'm turning 30 this week and I've been a shutin NEET for a decade and I don't know how to get out. Please advice/help. (Longish post),neetthrowaway1235,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pxjffk/im_turning_30_this_week_and_ive_been_a_shutin/,"Disclaimer: I know the easiest answer is to a job. I almost might post some variation on another subreddit if you see it pop up again.

I've had anxiety issues my whole life and they reached a boiling point when I close to finishing college, there was a mandatory internship + presentation at the end and this, on top of struggling through 2 other internships before this, caused me to just outright drop out of school and start shutting myself off from the outside world. My parents (and important: I don't blame them for anything, my decisions are my own after all) were very lax on pushing me to stop so I just kept going, lost track of time and ended up spending about 4 years like this. 

The problem was that at no point I really felt an urge to stop, I had some money saved up so I could spend some on games (which was and is still my only hobby), food was provided for and I just went about my day barely coming out of the room, I've never had interest in much else, I've never been in a relationship and simply never felt the desire to be in one either. In a way this lifestyle was far too comforting to me and it made it harder to stop, and going back outside became a taller ask basically every day, I still don't feel comfortable being outside.

Eventually after about 4 years of that I did, mostly after talking (online) with some of my friends (and parents) I had to change so I decided to get a job. Being an adult with an empty resume and no papers or anything obviously limited my options severely so I ended up with a basic order picking job at a large warehouse. 

As dramatic as it sounds this was probably one of the worst periods of my life period, the environment was too loud and social for me, my anxieties and social insecurities came back worse than ever before, on top of just the raw monotony and fairly hopeless outlook on life I had at this point made it hard to sleep and eat and I was pretty obviously not in a very good spot, which kind of scared my parents. I ended up getting fired after about 8 months because I outright fell asleep on the job a few times and started making lots of mistakes due to exhaustion, I then went back to being a NEET till where we are now, which is about 10 years total.

However these last couple years, especially months haven't been as comfortable. I can tell I have very few if no opportunities left, time flies by so insanely fast I'm struggling to keep up and I have physical health issues I cannot afford to fix, knowing I'm probably spending another 35 years doing something I hate makes it hard to imagine my future being any happier even if I do get a job. I've never been suicidal because I'm incredibly scared of dying, but my outlook on life is pretty bleak too.

What really got me in the end was my grandpa passing away somewhat recently. Partly because I was pretty close to my grandparents, but also because I (being home all the time) saw all the things my own parents had to take care of at that point and realized I wouldn't be able to do shit for them if something were to happen to them. I'm still completely reliant on them and basically cannot support them.

So yeah, the tl;dr is what a good way to try and possibly salvage my situation. I realize I must sound like a massive weakling here but that's fine, I just want to change. This ended up being way longer and ramblier than I wanted so I might edit it later down the line. Feel free to ask any inquire about anything I'll reply to most posts."
pxk9gg,30,2021-09-28,"May 2021 Graduate w/ no internships, difficulty finding jobs. Would appreciate advice on improving and not getting overwhelmed and panicked.",csbx25,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pxk9gg/may_2021_graduate_w_no_internships_difficulty/,"(This is a throwaway/alt account; also, this post will be somewhat unstructured)

Hi, I graduated in May 2021 with a Master's degree in computer science (3.5 GPA), albeit with no internships. In my Master's I focused primarily on AI/ML, and for my bachelor's I focused more on software engineering. I've been struggling to find a job since then, having only gotten two interviews since graduating (I did get one in my last semester, but I was wholly unprepared for that, so that one doesn't bother me as much). Given the pandemic, it shouldn't be surprising that I would be having trouble finding a career, especially with no internship, but it becomes depressing given how long it's been, and how I've felt I haven't made enough progress, and it's been quite depressing and frustrating. 

I have been working on things such as refreshing knowledge of past concepts and networking with others (e.g. ideally fellow alumni and others I know personally), but I feel I have not made as much progress as I'd like. Granted, I see making not enough progress as better than making no progress. I normally struggle to make progress or work on things due to perfectionism and fear of not making any tangible progress, leading to procrastination and a self-fulfilling prophecy, though I am working on fixing that. Regardless, I am worried about not being able to get a job before the graduation gap becomes too big for me (e.g. greater than 6 months) and it becomes even harder to get a job, which is something that terrifies me (unless I'm worrying *way* too much about that given the COVID pandemic has made it more difficult to get a job in general). I'm just like ""I want to study all this, but the gap seems too close that I'm better off doing something else rather than waste time I could have used either doing another comp sci-related task or just relaxing"", which causes me anxiety. Generally, I'm struggling to figure out what to even focus on and how to devote time to all these tasks.

As for personal projects, while I've heard it's great to do them and put them on your resume, I find myself very unmotivated to work on one since it feels overwhelming and I have zero idea what I would like to work on in that regard. It would be nice to do one, but at the same time I am very afraid of devoting large amounts (e.g. weeks, months) of time to working on a personal project only to run into issues that I can't solve or become unwilling to solve, a worst-case scenario that results in all the time spent working on it and learning everything needed to work on it being for nothing. That scares the daylights out of me, to the point of not being willing to start in the first place.

All things said, it can ***really*** get me down and keep me from making progress and ensuring a work/life balance. I'm not sure how to properly handle all this and ensure I'm able to progress toward becoming a better programmer and getting a job in the field, given this situation."

pxkziy,3,2021-09-28,I'm turning 30 this week and I've been a shutin NEET for a decade and I don't know how to get out. Please advice/help. (Longish post),neetthrowaway1235,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/pxkziy/im_turning_30_this_week_and_ive_been_a_shutin/,"Disclaimer: I know the easiest answer is to a job. I also might post some variation on another subreddit if you see it pop up again, I wasn't sure what subreddit is most suited to this sort of post.

I've had anxiety issues my whole life and they reached a boiling point when I close to finishing college, there was a mandatory internship + presentation at the end and this, on top of struggling through 2 other internships before this, caused me to just outright drop out of school and start shutting myself off from the outside world. My parents (and important: I don't blame them for anything, my decisions are my own after all) were very lax on pushing me to stop so I just kept going, lost track of time and ended up spending about 4 years like this. 

The problem was that at no point I really felt an urge to stop, I had some money saved up so I could spend some on games (which was and is still my only hobby), food was provided for and I just went about my day barely coming out of the room, I've never had interest in much else, I've never been in a relationship and simply never felt the desire to be in one either. In a way this lifestyle was far too comforting to me and it made it harder to stop, and going back outside became a taller ask basically every day, I still don't feel comfortable being outside.

Eventually after about 4 years of that I did, mostly after talking (online) with some of my friends (and parents) I had to change so I decided to get a job. Being an adult with an empty resume and no papers or anything obviously limited my options severely so I ended up with a basic order picking job at a large warehouse. 

As dramatic as it sounds this was probably one of the worst periods of my life period, the environment was too loud and social for me, my anxieties and social insecurities came back worse than ever before, on top of just the raw monotony and fairly hopeless outlook on life I had at this point made it hard to sleep and eat and I was pretty obviously not in a very good spot, which kind of scared my parents. I ended up getting fired after about 8 months because I outright fell asleep on the job a few times and started making lots of mistakes due to exhaustion, I then went back to being a NEET till where we are now, which is about 10 years total.

However these last couple years, especially months haven't been as comfortable. I can tell I have very few if no opportunities left, time flies by so insanely fast I'm struggling to keep up and I have physical health issues I cannot afford to fix, knowing I'm probably spending another 35 years doing something I hate makes it hard to imagine my future being any happier even if I do get a job. I've never been suicidal because I'm incredibly scared of dying, but my outlook on life is pretty bleak too.

What really got me in the end was my grandpa passing away somewhat recently. Partly because I was pretty close to my grandparents, but also because I (being home all the time) saw all the things my own parents had to take care of at that point and realized I wouldn't be able to do shit for them if something were to happen to them. I'm still completely reliant on them and basically cannot support them.

So yeah, the tl;dr is what a good way to try and possibly salvage my situation. I realize I must sound like a massive weakling here but that's fine, I just want to change. This ended up being way longer and ramblier than I wanted so I might edit it later down the line. Feel free to ask any inquire about anything I'll reply to most posts."
pxl3bn,2,2021-09-28,Switching to Software Engineering,try040,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pxl3bn/switching_to_software_engineering/,"I am a junior in studying computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity meaning my free electives are security classes. During my sophomore year, I was a software developer intern at a small company building Windows applications. I recently accepted an information security internship for next summer at a large company. I am still not sure if I want to do cybersecurity or software engineering. With me taking this cybersecurity position, how hard would it be for me to get a software engineering job after graduation if the cybersecurity is not for me?"

They all got great experience and achievements (ex IB, PE, etc), they are essentially the ppl that I want to be eventually. 

We just met for the first time (virtually), and I thought I should reach out to them on LinkedIn to connect as I believe network is part of the internship plus these connections can potentially open some doors in the future. 

Ps: most of them are mid to late 20s, so there isn't much of a age gap.

The question is, should I do it now or wait till the end of the internship?"

What do I expect for final round technical interview?
pxmo1e,2,2021-09-28,"After 100s of apps, I finally got a written offer related to my field! But I think I've been lowballed b/c they know I'm a fresh grad trying to switch career fields.",bl4ckCloudz,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pxmo1e/after_100s_of_apps_i_finally_got_a_written_offer/,"For some more info, this offer is for an Associate Data Analyst role based in DC. Although I currently live in LA, the job is remote. The salary is 52k and below the average of 65k (DC and LA averages are pretty similar). To be fair though, I have no idea how accurate or reliable Glassdoor or similar websites are anymore. I can try to negotiate for something higher, but I'm almost certain there's no way they'd go higher than 58k, which is still below average.  
  

If I had no other options, I would've just taken it right away. However, I literally started my Database Engineer internship the day before. Clearly, there's no benefits and only a max of 10 hrs per week, but it does pay a whopping $40/hr. Also, this internship is supposed to be a pipeline to a full-time offer at the end. I understand an offer isn't a guarantee, but I'm feeling like this internship would be a better career move right now.  
  

What would you all do in this situation? My friends and family suggest I do both jobs at the same time since the internship is only ~2 hours a day. This way, I get the most amount of experience and pocket some extra cash. Not against this idea, but I feel like this is a dangerous game I'd be playing. Or I could just take the analyst position and cut off the internship. It's definitely the path of least resistance, but I'm kind of burnt out from applying and interviewing every single day at this point. Dealing with the bad pay for a year or so and jumping ship to a better opportunity after gaining more experience doesn't sound too bad. A lot of the more desirable analyst jobs I've applied to so far want more experience from me and/or proven record of delivering results while WFH."

pxnd9x,3,2021-09-28,Mid 30's about to change careers into STEM. Not sure if I'm making the right choice. How does one decide?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pxnd9x/mid_30s_about_to_change_careers_into_stem_not/,"I'm (34M) looking to switch gears from education administration into STEM. I've been unemployed due to covid for the past year now and it's been nearly impossible to land a job in my current industry (education admin). I used to work at a college helping with registration and internship placements etc. I have a Bachelor's in Education and one in Arts. 

I never truly liked what I did and decided maybe it's time I considered going back to school. 

I've been accepted into a few programs at a local college:

* Computer Engineering Technology (3 year Adv. Diploma)
* Computer Systems Technician (2 year Diploma)
* Computer Programming (2 year Diploma)

I don't know if at this point in my life going back to do a 3 year (or 2) program is the best option, for various reasons: 

1. I feel like I'm ""old"" . My mind isn't as ""sharp"" as it used to be and I'm not sure I'll be able to keep up with the younger gen/program requirements (assignments, hmwk, studies, etc). *(Not interested in doing ""part-time"", why? Because I ""feel old"")*
2. I'm not in the best spot financially and having to take out a loan/pay back something worries me. (*Though it's doable and I could survive that but it's just another obstacle I would need to take care of*)
3. Math. I'm simply not good at it and I'm frankly surprised that I got accepted into these programs. (*Though I was assured by a few program coordinators that the level of math wont be ""too hard"" and it'll begin from an entry level and move gradually*) 
4. Am I making the ""right"" choice? As in, which program/industry do I dive into ? How do I know ? I've looked at the curriculum for all three and there are ""minor"" variations, it's a bit confusing. The career opportunities are abundant no matter from which program I graduate but I want to finally *enjoy* what I'm doing. 

I think what worries me the most is not ""knowing"" what to commit to. For example, do I want a more ""IT/Help Desk"" focused role (Computer Systems Technician). Do I want to be a coder/programmer (Computer Programming). Do I want a bit of both at the cost of one extra year (Computer Engineering Technology)? *How does one decide??*

It's literally driving me mad at this point trying to decide and weigh all the pros/cons of everything. 

*(I have set up an appointment to talk to an admissions advisor, maybe they can help clarify)*

Lastly, maybe I should just be looking at a ""micro-credential"" (1 year or less) ? Though with these, I feel like an employer expects you to have some sort of relevant background (experience/education) to accompany that credential, no?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated at this point."
pxnwj1,1,2021-09-29,So my manager had a talk with me today…,kodominator,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pxnwj1/so_my_manager_had_a_talk_with_me_today/,"…and he was telling me that the company is expanding and wants me to get promoted to do a role that I’m not comfortable taking.

I currently work as a warehouse associate // tech assistant. The promoted role is, I believe, a warehouse manager role (based on what I remember).

I’ve been at this current role for 3 months now and it was actually my backup plan to work at this place. He was telling me congrats and how much I improved from the first couple of weeks til now, how efficient I was, etc.

However, I identify myself as a UI/UX Designer &amp; I truly believe that is where my calling is at. That was my original plan was to find employment as a designer after my summer internship ended in 2019. 

But because of circumstances in between, this warehouse job was sort of the resort I had to come grips with for the time being. My first ever job was working at a warehouse so it’s sort of like a homecoming.

I was about to go full on attack mode and see what’s out there since I took this summer off to recalibrate, but because of what happened today, I’m not sure how to proceed forward.

Maybe this is a subtle way for my manager to help gain necessary skills that I need for a UI/UX Designer role. I wanted to bring up to him that I don’t plan on working here forever and I identify myself as a designer, but I was very PC about it and kept it straightforward instead of shooting myself in the foot. 

All I said was that I’ll keep this mind. That was all I said to him since he did a lot of talking and I did a lot of listening.

Any thoughts on what I should do? I’m thinking this ‘promotion’ could be good for me just to try it out, but I’m feeling  conflicted the more I think this through.

Here’s my original post from yesterday:

pxo0bl,61,2021-09-29,Would Anyone be Down to Sign a Petition to Get the IT Department Heads to Resign?,FaithOfAMustardSeed,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/pxo0bl/would_anyone_be_down_to_sign_a_petition_to_get/,"Hello everyone, I'm sure we're all aware at this point about the absolutely atrocious job that the UCSD IT Department is doing this year. I've illustrated some of my grievances here ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/pxc8xt/comment/heo1n30/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/pxc8xt/comment/heo1n30/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) ), but in case you are too lazy to look, here are my points:

\-UCSD Internet should not be down campus-wide for several hours or more in three consecutive days. Much less the third day being the first day of class. I was scrambling to connect to my first class on Thursday with my computer, tablet, and phone, only to have my tablet work just in time with the Internet and be able to connect to my Zoom meeting. I'm sure many others here have had similar experiences even after Thursday. As I've said in detail in the comment above, there need to be contingency plans for when these Internet outage emergencies happen, and the first priority in such cases is to get the wifi running again in any capacity. The failure of the UCSD IT Department to do this in a timely manner represents a flaw in their response procedure or overall planning on the network. Either way, that is a failure on the leadership's part for not having a better plan in these situations.

\-Related to the first point, sure, maybe there were last minute updates to the routers or access points that caused issues. But it should not be difficult, if the network is correctly set up, to roll back those network devices to an earlier working version such that the network does operate as expected. Again, if this cannot be done, it signals a severe infrastructure and planning issue. Stuff breaks on new software releases all the time, and there have to be plans in place to quickly recover from such emergencies.

\-How in the world did the UCSD IT department fail to get enough server capacity to handle all of the concurrent connections throughout the day? That is a catastrophic failure and cannot be blamed at all on Cisco. UCSD is not some small business that has to watch spending on everything. It is a possibly billion (okay, maybe hundreds of thousands) dollar school that should have no issue with getting way more server capacity for concurrent logins than what would be conceivably needed with the largest freshmen class yet. This all just looks like the IT Department assumed that the network would be fine and just made last minute upgrades when they realized that things had gotten far too out of control. Never mind that they had the entirety of quarantine to stress test and plan for the upcoming in-person fall.

\-And of course, I'm sure no one needs any reminder about how the IT Department disabled Ethernet under the statement that very few people used it, when that could be explained through a variety of factors (people in general not knowing what Ethernet is or how to use it, people liking Wifi as a more convenient connection option esp out of dorms, etc.). New access points getting added in place of Ethernet? Don't make me laugh. The network hasn't gotten better from my freshman year two years ago, it's gotten worse. What the hell are you doing, UCSD IT?

Anyway, I've been quite frustrated with how UCSD administration has been handling these first weeks, so I assume (some, most) people are with me here. I just want to see how many people are interested in potentially signing a form to get the heads of UCSD IT to resign. Because truthfully, they should've gotten fired after what happened last week immediately. No IT department in the corporate world would have gotten this much slack. Even if the petition doesn't go anywhere and Kholsla doesn't listen, it's better than doing nothing. We need to let our voices be heard loud and clear about how irredeemably terrible the situation is at UCSD right now.

Also, just as an endnote, I am a Cisco Certified Network Associate and have been since 2018 or so. I've been working in network engineering since I was in my freshman year of high school, and I have done about two and a third summer's worth of network engineering internships. Please trust me when I say that I know what I'm talking about here. The UCSD IT has shown time and time again that it does not learn from its mistakes and does not make any more of a reliable network every year. It's time for a leadership change. "
pxp839,2,2021-09-29,Bad thoughts and PTSD,elcottthenextstep,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/pxp839/bad_thoughts_and_ptsd/,"Hi all. This will be a little wordy. Also this is a throwaway account, as I’m not ready for this to be seen by people I know, nor am I ready to discuss this with my therapist. A little about me. My father, although very loving, had BPD and alcoholism. So he had his moments. I did not realize this until I was about 22 years old. I was a intern for the fire department from age 15-18, and EMT from 18-23, and a police officer from 23 until 26. I’m 27 now. I medically retired per a doctors orders with general anxiety disorder, ptsd, adjustment disorder, and panic attacks. The reason for my medical retirement was my blood pressure. On a work day I would have between 20-30 anxiety attacks per day, although, until the doctor advised me otherwise, I thought this was normal and that I was just ‘nervous’. My blood pressure during these attacks was around 175/150. It’s a miracle I didn’t have a stroke or a heart attack. Anyways, doc listed me at 66 percent disabled, so I was able to marry my girlfriend and move out of state, away from all the nasty childhood memories and the death and pain I saw at work. I now live in a rural community of less than 100, on over a hundred acres of beautiful land with wildlife, weather, and most importantly, dead quiet. Along with 200 mg of sertraline daily, things are improving rapidly.

On to my problem. Since I live in a rural setting, with coyotes, wolves, moose, bears, mountain lions, and rattlesnakes, I am always carrying a gun. It’s really not practical or safe for me not to carry one. This is very normal and legal in my state/community. I have started to have some very strange thoughts recently. My ptsd, childhood, and law enforcement career have contributed to a pretty significant hyper-vigilance response. I can’t even begin to describe how annoying and tiring it is to notice everything about everyone at all times. My head usually is formulating where there is cover/concealment, the position of friends and family relative to myself, and exit routes. This has been pretty standard for a couple of years now, but it’s this new symptom of my hyper vigilance that I don’t like.  As my brain is scanning everything, now sometimes a movie starts to play in my head of me shooting people around me. And not just random people at the supermarket, but people I know. My friends, my neighbors. women, children. Everyone. I would absolutely never do anything to hurt anyone! One of the main contributors to my work related ptsd was going hands on with people. I despised having to fight or be physical with people, despite it being a regular occurrence. I hate seeing the movie of me unholstering my gun and just shooting people around me. People who I love and care about. I could be alone talking with my neighbor about cattle and suddenly my mind will shoot him in the head. I hate myself for these thoughts and they are occurring more frequently. I am nervous to discuss this with anyone who knows me, as I am afraid of being institutionalized or having my freedoms taken away. I want to be clear, I never have acted on these thoughts. I’ve never put my hand on my gun or had to stop myself from anything. They’re just movies that play out in my head at random times. However, if I was on duty and someone told me this, I would give them a 72 hour vacation because that would be a risk factor for “a threat to himself or others”. Can any professional weigh in on or maybe other people that have experienced this? I can’t stand seeing people, even in my head, being this victim of gun violence. It’s messy and disgusting and I just want to forget all of the horrible things I’ve seen in my career. The more these movies play out the more I want to isolate from people. Thanks for all of the help and advice."

In that time, I feel like I have not gotten any real onboarding or training. I still don't have a job title or job description. I 'think' I am a Network and Systems Admin but don't have access to any of the hypervisor, switches, or network hardware. My boss will ask me questions and I just have to remind him I don't have access. He is still 'working on it'. I have not gotten access to any sort of network diagrams, polices, HR info, or anything of the sort. I feel like I am being treated as L1/2 helpdesk which is not what I was told the job would be. I was a Network Admin for a small bank for 5 years and IT Manager there for a few months before I came here. I interned here about 10 years ago and was told my new job would be the same role as my intern mentor, which was basically 'all things IT'. I have not seen any of that. My direct supervisor is somewhat in the same boat since the company got acquired by a large corporation a few years ago and no one really knows what their role is. Would it be rude of me to go above him and talk to our manager? I really shouldn't be complaining since I am making good money 15 minutes from my house but I was hoping for more challenge. I guess I should have asked more questions in the interview but when I asked 'So I would be taking over Sam's old job and doing the same things he was responsible for when I worked here in 2011' and they confirmed that was the case, I figured that was sufficient. Come to find out, Sam's job was watered down so much since corporate IT has taken over a lot of it."

Gpa: 3.1 out of 4.00

Ecs: barely any 💀 I'm joining a volunteering club this school year so maybe I can add that. I was going to do a veterinary internship but I had to move schools so that's out of the book. Idk if you can add caring for a family member as an ec.

Test scores: don't have one rn but I plan on taking the ACT in December and I'm hoping for like a 29-31 

Awards: in my home country I got best overall in arts and humanities twice in a row but idk if I can add that since it wasn't in the US 

I live in Texas and would prefer in state universities, I'm just looking for a uni that I have like idk maybe a 30 and up percent chance of getting in. I already have UNT in mind but I'd like to add 2 more. Idk what to major in yet, but Its between vet medicine/comp sci/comp ENG or electrical engineering. Thanks in advance!!"

**Awards:** Won two prestigious international hackathons related to my field.

**Academic performance:** Average student, I have good grades in the subjects related to my research field. Bad/average grades in other subjects.

**Extracurricular:**  Founder of an association related to my field, giving talks and conducting workshops.

Do you think I have any chance to get into Ivy league schools ?

py1r52,48,2021-09-29,A Suggestion for College Freshmen: Apply to internships Now,captainAwesomePants,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/py1r52/a_suggestion_for_college_freshmen_apply_to/," One of the surest paths to a software engineer job is through internships with large software companies. Most college kids know this, but they often don't start considering it until their junior year or later.

But here's the thing. Several of the biggest employers offer programs specific to college freshmen and sophomores, and most students aren't even thinking about that as an option yet. And to make matters worse, applications are usually due in the fall of the year before the summer internship would start, and that's right now. So my advice: consider it! They're easier to get than the more competitive internships later, and they flow naturally into more internships and a good software engineering role down the line. Even more important: if it turns out that you don't like programming in an office, now is the time to find out.

Here are some options:

* Google's STEP program -- applications just opened, applications close on October 31.
* Explore Microsoft -- Applications open now
* Facebook University &amp; Facebook Internships
* Twitter Academy Freshman Engineering Internships
* Google Summer of Code -- not quite an internship, but you do get paid to write code over the summer
* Khan Academy -- applications open now, close in Novembebr

There are many others. But the thing that they have in common is that their deadlines typically close before December. So consider them today, even if you don't think you know a whole lot of programming yet."

I’m a graduated student with bachelor degree and currently trying to find a job or internship as junior fronted-developer. 

I have received an offer from company that related to the gambling industry. This company develops betting games and web apps for online casinos since 2006. They offered me a good salary, way above the average salary for junior frontend-developer in my country. And i think its a good opportunity to start a career in web-development. In addition their activity seems to be legal and didn’t violated any law in my country. 

But my friend told me to stay away from this. He says that working in gambling industry is a black mark for any web-developer and i might have a problems in future, when i want to switch my job. 

I want to hear a stories/an opinions from the people that related to the/worked in such companies or currently working there about their experience. Is this a really bad starting point and do you had a problems with changing a job after working on an online casinos/a betting games.

py66nt,72,2021-09-29,I'm turning 30 this week and I've been a shutin NEET for a decade and I don't know how to get out. Please advice/help. (Longish post),pekoralover55,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/py66nt/im_turning_30_this_week_and_ive_been_a_shutin/,"Disclaimer: I know the easiest answer is to get a job, I'm trying to to prepare for this as I wrote this post.

I've had anxiety issues my whole life and they reached a boiling point when I close to finishing college, there was a mandatory internship + presentation at the end and this, on top of struggling through 2 other internships before this, caused me to just outright drop out of school and start shutting myself off from the outside world. My parents (and important: I don't blame them for anything, my decisions are my own after all) were very lax on pushing me to stop so I just kept going, lost track of time and ended up spending about 4 years like this.

The problem was that at no point I really felt an urge to stop, I had some money saved up so I could spend some on games (which was and is still my only hobby), food was provided for and I just went about my day barely coming out of the room, I've never had interest in anything I can't do in my bedroom. In a way this lifestyle was far too comforting to me and it made it harder to stop, and going back outside became a taller ask basically every day, I still don't feel comfortable being outside.

Eventually after about 4 years of that I did, mostly after talking (online) with some of my friends (and parents) I had to change so I decided to get a job. Being an adult with an empty resume and no papers or anything obviously limited my options severely so I ended up with a basic order picking job at a large warehouse.

As dramatic as it sounds this was probably one of the worst periods of my life period, the environment was too loud and social for me, my anxieties and social insecurities came back worse than ever before, on top of just the raw monotony and fairly hopeless outlook on life I had at this point made it hard to sleep and eat and I was pretty obviously not in a very good spot, which kind of scared my parents. I ended up getting fired after about 8 months because I outright fell asleep on the job a few times and started making lots of mistakes due to exhaustion, I then went back to being a NEET till where we are now, which is about 10 years total.

However these last couple years, especially months haven't been as comfortable. I can tell I have very few if no opportunities left, time flies by so insanely fast I'm struggling to keep up and I have physical health issues I cannot afford to fix, knowing I'm probably spending another 35 years doing something I hate makes it hard to imagine my future being any happier even if I do get a job.

What really got me in the end was my grandpa passing away somewhat recently. Partly because I was pretty close to my grandparents, but also because I (being home all the time) saw all the things my own parents had to take care of at that point and realized I wouldn't be able to do shit for them if something were to happen to them. I'm still completely reliant on them and basically cannot support them.

So yeah, the tl;dr is what a good way to try and possibly salvage my situation. I realize I must sound like a massive weakling here but that's fine, I just want to change. This ended up being way longer and ramblier than I wanted so I might edit it later down the line. Feel free to ask any inquire about anything I'll reply to most posts."

py7ec9,6,2021-09-29,Feeling clueless about my Product Management internship. Am I in the wrong place?,ComicRelief86,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/py7ec9/feeling_clueless_about_my_product_management/,"Hey Reddit,

* I am a Computer Science undergrad, currently on my first year of college.
* I have just recently started out a **Product Management internship** at a tiny startup. It's my first work related experience.
* I'm still very new to tech, but I figured that a product role might suit me because I've always been interested in tech entrepreneurship and in the business side of things. Picking up a product internship sounded like a good way might of learning the skills I will need when developing my own ideas.
* They're developing an app and are still pre-launch.
* I went thru onboarding during the first week or so and got to learn a bit about their complex web of business requirements, stakeholders, etc.
* My first assignment was to **write user stories and epics,** which later evolved into **documenting functional, non-functional and business requirements**, associating them with the user stories, writing briefings for tasks on our sprint backlog to **make devs' lives easier**.
* I got stuck several times developing the documentation. I chose to change platforms halfway through, thought that getting stuck was due to knowing too little about information architecture (IA), started reading material about IA and product in general and had no luck finding what I needed.
* At times, it feels like they needed to hire a technical writer and not a PM Intern — though I might be wrong.
* And the icing on the cake: during the first couple of weeks, I *reeeeeally* missed coding — obviously, I have had much less free time to code lately.
* Although it's still pretty early to tell, after 1 month on the internship, it's still hard to point a finger at what I have learned. I'm learning a lot about what a company looks like from the inside, for sure, but product management still feels like a huge question mark — **was this it?** Is it just tedious documentation work? I thought there was more strategic work.

That said, here's the advice I'm looking for:

* I don't know how to tell if this internship is being worthwhile. Were they just looking for a technical writer? Do product internships usually look like this or is this one a little off?
* Most of the times, what I am supposed to do is unclear, especially when it comes to docs — I had never done something like it before. I thought that the best way to get past feeling stuck was reading more, but I can't seem to find great resources. Any advice?
* Most product managers I know came from SWE backgrounds and transitioned internally. Is it bad to hop on product so early on, without previous software engineering experience?
* Do Technical/Engineering PMs code? Although I really enjoy programming, I don't like the idea of building stuff that business people tell you to. I really wish there was a career path that balances tech and product/business, and thought of TPMs. Am I on the right track or are there other roles/company models I don't know of?

Thank you all in advance for the advice!"

I’m a GIS major in my second to last semester of undergrad. I was recently offered two job positions and I’m unsure which is best. For reference, I hope to be a GIS programmer and work in the private sector. I plan to go to grad school down the line for Data Science.

Option 1: Undergraduate Research Assistant underneath a professor at my university. She was recently granted funding from National Geographic to do a study that involves the effect of readily available spatial data for high school students. Many prominent figures within the Geography/GIS community would be working with us, so it’d be good exposure. Workload consists on gathering data/making web maps, talking to stakeholders, coordinating events, public speaking. 

Option 2: GIS Intern at an emergency communication research center at my university. I would also be working with industry and government clients within this position, so it’s still good exposure. The workload consists of map creation, site selection through analyzing datasets, managing social media, and running a conference that’s held annually. 

Both positions are paid (thank goodness) and would count for credit. Any and all advice needed!"

I am a female in my 20's beginning the final year of my CS bachelor's degree with a high GPA. I had an internship this past summer at a small company that met a lot of my criteria for what I want in a job:

1. It had a nice work environment with nice co-workers
2. There were multiple female software engineers and none of the men were creepy or anything (no offense meant against men here, I am just writing this after reading a bunch of comments on a post about why many women leave tech 35 so that's on my mind I guess)
3. It allowed me to work from home (I loooove working from home. I love online classes for that reason)
4. It allowed flexible hours where the employees get to choose their hours as long as they are working 40 hrs per week on weekdays
5. I enjoyed the work (although it was only an internship so I don't know if it would get really boring after a while - plus I was only part time so maybe it would be more bleh if I was full time)
6. It wasn't high stress and the tasks/work was organized
7. The software is for ethical purposes (Doesn't involve violating people's privacy or selling their data - although I guess that can be kind of an ethical gray area... I don't know - not the focus of this post though)

However, it is a small company that serves a small client base because of the type of software it is, so they would only be able to pay somewhere around 70-75k (I asked). They said they would be interested in having me work there in the future if I'd like to, but I don't know, because I had imagined working for 6 figures. I was also thinking that I'd probably get my Master's after I graduate, but I wouldn't need that to work at this company. 

My question is, should I just work there or would there be somewhere better that meets all of my criteria (as listed above) and could pay me 6 figures (and good benefits)? What are your experiences? I am especially interested in hearing from women as well.

Edit: I live in a high COL area, right by a major city (Portland, OR). Also now that I look back at the message, I realize he said that 70-75k is what they would pay a skilled senior level software engineer so I’m not sure if that would actually be my starting pay."

py9xqb,3,2021-09-29,How do you view success?,[deleted],ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/py9xqb/how_do_you_view_success/,"Edit: I’m beginning to feel the deck is stacked against me. I feel like my feet are glued to the floor of a burning building. 

Made some posts earlier, TLDR my dreams are not achievable and I need to deal with reality

I guess this mainly goes to you top dogs/hot shots out there who developed your career and made something of yourself. How do you define success?

Im 22, about to get my BS, and im already feeling like entering the workforce a failure. I want to try to salvage whatever I have left.

I have a co-op and internship with 2 companies and a 3rd i applied to that all look good. Im expecting offers from all of them. Problem is, the positions (in addition to only paying like mid 60s which is a separate issue) are in positions like PLC programming and like system eng/IT stuff. 

Now for some people this is great, and more power to them, not trying to downplay or diminish anything, but for me, idk It feels I got this degree for nothing because Im not doing any innovating or being at the forefront of technology. 

My question is how do you define and measure how successful you are? How do you go from a nobody to being respected? Id love to hear from people who also are currently not doing what they'd call their ""dream job"". I want to believe I can still salvage success even if it isnt my dream role."

I'm (F20y) in college to eletrical engineer(ing), here we count the semesters, so I'm in the fourth semester, I was supposed to be in 6th but didn't went well in 2 disciplines so now my schedule it's a mess with subject from 5th, 6th and 4th semesters. 
But in my country the economy its shit, the president its a fucking clown and I think that there is no future in here, but I can't move out to another country cause I wouldn't work as a engineer but as ""cheap labor"" as servant or craftsman (nothing wrong with it but I didn't wanted to loose my mind studying and work with that) (and I don't know of the terms were correct) 
The point is, it is really hard to find a internship, or a Job, i have another courses like administrative or logistics and can't find a job with that either. 
I'm 20y, and the pressure to have a job it's insane, and I don't think I could handle if I didn't ""see"" in the future and ""see"" it will get better. I'm really looking for a job, to do anything I just need the money to help at home and have my own stuffs without asking mommy and daddy to pay to me, and it's kind frustrating have to study something really hard and didn't get any ""results"" with it.

It will ever get better? Will I get a internship and them a job doing what I choose to do???"

pycmss,3,2021-09-30,Google/Facebook AI swe -&gt; Stanford MS CS part-time. Chances? Worth it?,f_max,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/pycmss/googlefacebook_ai_swe_stanford_ms_cs_parttime/,"Hey all,

I'm a software eng at one of F/G AI, working on taking research to production. I just graduated from ug, and I've recently felt that I'm missing a lot of ML knowledge in computer vision, nlp, etc that would make me more effective. I saw that Stanford HCP was a thing, which would let me work and take classes part time. I'd like to ask 1. Do I have a good shot? 2. Is MSCS even worth it or should I just learn on my own. 3. Which mix of recommendations do you think is best based on the ones below?

On to stats! My biggest concern is recommenders and relatively little research. More about that below.

UG: One of Stanford/MIT/CMU CS

GPA: 3.8

GRE: Not taken yet. For the purposes of this evaluation just assume that it's above average for Stanford MS CS but not top tier.

Internships: 4 internships, all at good companies (F/G tier) covering a wide range of areas like hardware compute systems, cloud systems, full-stack, and ML/AI.

Research: Part-time ML research with one prof for \~9 mo. No publications.

Recommendations: Basically my internship ones are good, but my university ones are meh.

* Absolutely for sure rec
   * Junior year f/g internship - I worked on Ads ML systems - my mentor says I performed at senior eng level and solved a lot of big issues. 
* Could be decent? 
   * Prof 1 - I did part-time research work with one prof. I chugged along and did reasonable work that elucidated some new directions for the prof to go in, but no publish-worthy results. It was definitely a part-time 8 hours a week kind of thing. Got As in all of that profs classes (3 I think?). I feel like he'd evaluate me as top 30-40%ish. A reasonably good student and researcher but nothing outstanding.
   * Could get a very good rec from freshman year cloud internship but that's long ago. 
   * Sophomore year hardware-focused internship recommendation would be reasonable, like top 30%. 
* Kinda meh but open to suggestions
   * Prof 2 - took a single economics modeling class. Helped sort of TA and support other students. Good presentations and got an A.
   * Prof 3 - took a bunch of his stat classes (3-4). Got As in all of them. Didn't really talk to him much though besides the odd office hours question.
   * Current mgr rec is out because I've worked with him for only a month.

I'm essentially banking on my work experience and my genuine need to learn ML stuff to be a better engineer at work (and maybe eventually do great things idk). I feel like my university recs will just go ""yeah he's good and did good research and did well in these classes"" but not rave about my greatness. Maybe I could do 2 industry 1 uni rec? I'd appreciate help a lot - deadline's on Dec 6th so I need to get cracking quickly on these apps if I decide to do it."

pydcqk,14,2021-09-30,Impoverished childhood left me ill-prepared to compete for internships at my T20 CS school. When is the latest I can comfortably apply to internships? (I'd like to maximize my time to 'catch up'),confused_af_always,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/pydcqk/impoverished_childhood_left_me_illprepared_to/,"Hey, thanks for taking the time to read this!

I'm a freshman CS major at a target school. My family income has been around $20,000 for my entire life, and while I have some solid work experience tutoring CS/Math and coaching for cash, my resume just can't compete with the majority of my classmates, who are Bay Area kids with FAANG parents who went to private schools. \*\*My classmates are incredibly talented and hardworking, I have no ill will toward them, just saying I think I could have done more with more resources, although I know many have done far more with far less than I.\*\* Other than poverty, and an illness that classifies me as disabled, I am not a URM, and I don't believe poverty is considered at all in the application process, (I'm not advocating for it to be, either).

I took APCSA and APCS principles in high school, along with 13 other APs, making me technically a sophomore, and allowing me to skip the first programming class and go straight into programming 2 and discrete math for CS, with DSA next semester.  I also joined a competitive club that develops quant algorithms, and got a job with my school tutoring low income k-5 kids CS. I'm doing slightly above average in my classes, perhaps in the 60th percentile, but the top 20-30% is far far better than me.

The large hole in my resume is a lack of projects, and while I am working on two that should be relatively strong additions, it will likely take until the end of the semester to complete them. 

1. What is the latest I can apply for summer 2022 internships, and still have the most options available to me? I'd like to complete some projects first and have time to improve my LC ability. I'm thinking around December, but is it still common to apply next semester?
2. Should I apply to the freshman oriented programs such as STEP as soon as possible, or wait to pad my resume first?
3. Should I even bother applying for freshman internships? I understand they are not necessary, but I'd like to if I can, and I must admit I'd love to be able to give some money back to my family more than just a minimum wage job. 

Thanks so much! I really appreciate any insight you can offer."
pydqp5,0,2021-09-30,Should I apply to a job with barely a portfolio?,loxagos_snake,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/pydqp5/should_i_apply_to_a_job_with_barely_a_portfolio/,"As someone who has been checking this sub for quite a while, my immediate answer to my own question would be 'yes'. But please bear with me.

I'm 29, and my life circumstances are rather complicated right now. To make this as short as possible, I got into university to study physics as soon as I graduated high school, but got sucked into the food service industry due to my family's dire financial situation. I had to freeze my studies for the better part of the decade, and am currently a year away from getting that degree. 

During that time, I developed an interest in programming, which ended up in me getting into game dev. I now have around 4 years of experience making games in Unity, experience that I supplemented with studying generic programming concepts on the side. While I mostly do game programming, I have dabbled with pretty much every part of production -- design, writing, modelling in Blender, texturing in the Substance suite, project management in personal capacity, some sound effects etc.

To cut to the chase, I want out of the industry I'm in. And, from the numerous posts and conversations here, I fully understand that game development is not the most viable career choice, *especially* in a country like mine, where it barely exists. So, I started focusing my efforts towards improving my general software development skills.

Out of nowhere, I stumbled upon a position for a Unity dev in a small start-up. The job is posted as both an internship and regular position, with no specific requirements -- just an email to send resumes. I've checked out the studio, and they've released a few VR games, specifically horror, which is a genre I'm incredibly enthusiastic about and have worked on in personal projects.

There's one small problem: I didn't 'eat my vegetables' and, due to the fragmented nature of how I self-taught in my beginner days, I don't have anything resembling a portfolio -- I've only fully released a small jam game so far. What I do have is a ton of unfinished projects, some of which would most likely tick a few boxes, but are not polished enough to show off. During my experimentation, I have worked on things like inventory systems, networking, IK, zombie AI, different kinds of character controllers, shooting mechanics, basically anything that could make a modern horror game. In essence, I'm confident in my ability to work on games like the ones they work on, but have no way to prove it, which is quintessential.

The way I see it, I could just shoot them an email and see where it goes. However, as I said, game dev jobs are few and far between in my country, and I could blow my chance with them for nothing, instead of working on my portfolio and waiting for later. Do you think it's worth taking a chance?"
pye021,2,2021-09-30,Is it normal to be constantly asked to work (unpaid) overtime as an intern?,elizabeth31095,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pye021/is_it_normal_to_be_constantly_asked_to_work/,"Hi everyone,

I've been working as an **intern** in the same multinational company for about 8 months. My schedule is supposedly 9 - 6, but ever since my second day on the job I have been asked to clock in earlier and/or clock out later *more than once a week*. 

I know it is normal for this to happen sometimes and I am okay with it, especially if it is my fault for not having finished a task. I am also okay if there is a very important deadline, I know that can happen and it is normal to work overtime in that case. 

However, I do not think it is normal to be required to do that *almost every day*, even when nothing is particularly urgent.   
It is also very common for my boss or colleagues to send me new work at 5 or 6 pm and require me to complete the task by the end of the day, a task which obviously does not require only 1 hour to be completed properly. This obviously forces me to work overtime even when I was efficient at completing all my previous tasks and I met my daily objectives. 

After all these months I am starting to get extremely tired and kinda depressed because I do not have a decent work-life balance. I cannot even schedule a coffee with a friend after work, because most of the time I would have to postpone it or cancel. I do not get paid enough for this and I don't think it is fair that I have to ask to go home (or disconnect, if I am working from home) and justify myself about why I am leaving **after 6 pm**... not when I have already worked 10 hours and there is nothing extremely urgent that can't wait until the next morning... 

All the colleagues in my team seem to find this normal and they clock out late every single day, but is it really normal? I wonder if they are happy with their lives. Should I just put up with it or should I just quit and look for a different company culture elsewhere?"

I get along with both very well, however A is typically a more serious/stoic kind of person, and B is very chill and a crowd favourite.

I was tasked to prepare a fun meeting with the whole project and had to host some ice breakers. B asked me to add some material into the meeting which basically went along the lines of ‘guess who?’ And then he described someone hounding people for work to be completed, basically implying my manager A. 

He said it was in good fun, but the meeting was in front of 100 people, with leadership too.

I wasn’t sure how to reject him, so I included it with other questions to not make it so noticeable. I jokingly said I’m gonna lose my job but he said ‘don’t worry just say that I helped you make this.’

 I’m not sure if manager A took offence or not, he did mention he was glad we were all laughing and having good banter.

tldr: one manager asked me to poke fun at another manager in a meeting with 100 people, saying it would be funny and it’s okay.

Do you think I made a mistake? What should I do to avoid situations like this? Or am I overreacting?

Any feedback is appreciated.,Tgunner192,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/pyjlff/first_network_job_and_a_bit_scared_any_feedback/,"I finished my undergrad degree in IT management last June. Since then, completed ITF+, A+ and am currently studying for Network+.

Last week I was contacted by a headhunter/hiring agent for a position. During the interview, she indicated a client is looking for someone to upgrade/install new network devices &amp; assign IP addresses. I asked if she could be any more specific about which type of devices. She responded that she doesn't really know what a network device is, but is reasonably certain it would be just normal-usual type of devices. I asked if the IPs would be dynamic or static. She asked what the difference was. When I tried to explain, she got overwhelmed or bored real fast &amp; ended that line of questioning.

Today, she called me back and offered me the position. In making the offer, she indicated that she thought I might be over qualified. I reminded her I graduated from college less than 6 months ago, the only position I've held was as an intern that turned into a job-but it was more data-processing than anything else, this was my first IT/Network job, so how could I be over qualified?

She responded that even though she doesn't know what a Network device is, nor does she know the difference between static and *that other thing*, the fact that I asked those questions was a strong indication that I was right for the job.

So, now I'm supposed to start a job next week. I don't know what it is I'm going to be doing, what I'll be working with and have no real world experience.

If anyone knows-does it happen that hiring agents can send a newbie to a job in which they are in way over their head? Or it is reasonable to believe the actual employer would have at least glanced at my resume and have some idea that I'm going to need structure, support, supervision and guidance?

If I go thru with showing up next week and it turns out to be a disaster, would I be risking a black mark on my reputation?

If anyone with a similar experience, or maybe an idea of what I should or shouldn't expect, that wants to weigh in, I can honestly say at this point I need all the help I can get."

I will try to keep this succinct like the other posts on here; any and all help is appreciated, looking for outside perspectives. I am a econ/finance (math minor) student at an average state school in the south, trying to get into quant research. I know I am already far due to being at a state school, but I have a demonstrated passion and sharp technical skills (lots of math coursework, proficient in Python for finance and data analysis).

I have a full time offer with a fairly new family office/fund (200MM or so) that I have been working with for a year. The job is basically a watered-down Quantitative Analyst, so I am responsible for researching strategy ideas, implementing strategies, creating backtesting engines, etc. However, it is for a medium-ish family office, so the high-level experience and name recognition is not there for me to easily land a QR internship at a bigger firm. I do have high hopes for the firm expanding to new clients, so I am excited at this startup-like possibility, but obviously there is a risk of everything falling apart. Thus, I am still applying for bigger QR internships but am having limited luck, and am leaning towards taking the (handsome, especially for the south) full time offer. My question is: are there still paths for me to get into the mainstream QR type roles if I start with a state school degree and a family office job, or am I kind of stuck?

I am willing to pursue MQF/MFE degrees (i.e., UWash or WorldQuant), and I suspect my employer would be willing to help fund this. Would this be enough to be competitive at either sell-side or buy-side quant roles down the line? If not, is there another realistic path for me to start at a ""baby"" quant role and move up to work for a bigger firm?

Thanks so much for any help available, happy to provide any more information, was trying to keep things brief."

My options for MS in CS - Fall 2022 are admittedly ambitious but I wish to give it a shot. Would love your thoughts on whether I stand any chance at all. Thanks in advance for your time and insight!

**UG:** CS at Tier 1 Public College, 8.3/10 GPA

**Publications:**

* First Author Publication in an International Journal (7+ impact factor)
* Paper presented at KDD Workshop
* First Author Publication in Indian Conference

**Work Experience:**

* Internship and 1 Year Full Time as SDE at a major tech MNC
* Open Source Contributions, Tangible contributions to CS research focused non-profits

**LoRs:** 3 Academic from UG university, 1 Professional - all with very good involvement

**GRE:** 327 (Q165, V162, AWA5)

**Misc:**

* Headed a technical club and a non-technical club at UG level
* Certification from Stanford Centre for Professional Development
* Several projects and other kinds of involvements that could potentially add up to a good SoP; can in certain ways make the CGPA more explainable.

**Options:**

My rather ambitious set of universities are,

* CMU
* GaTech
* Columbia
* UIUC

If my chances for these colleges are too slim with my current profile, I have the option to wait another year and improve (ongoing research work, improved work exp, improved quant). MS is expensive, and I wish to do it at a top school.  


Welcoming all suggestions and thoughts.

Thanks again!"

pyutcy,2,2021-09-30,I hate tests - I am a project teacher,Stew819,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/pyutcy/i_hate_tests_i_am_a_project_teacher/,"First year second grade teacher, 7 years in education; two is a substitute - two as an instructional support staff in a kindergarten classroom, 3-year masters degree with internships every semester in almost every grade level. This is essentially a copy paste of a letter I sent to a family member about how I wish I could spend more time with my son and pregnant wife right now at this transitional period (implementing guided reading). I have been doing a great job with my students, I have some students tell me ""I love you!""  when they leave for the day.

So right now with work there's a whole new bundle of things to be incorporated (guided reading and differentiated instruction for one set of 5 groups based on one DIBELS, And then another 6 group based on F&amp;P reading levels using running records (all in all there is about 20 different components that need to be organized and planned and implemented simultaneously. And that's after I go through this initial preparation stage of getting the dozens of activities and the logistics of center rotations down first). And then all of that is on top of the work I've been doing so far which I have felt I am barely keeping up with. Of course of this is something of a nightmare has been making me pretty depressed because it literally takes up all of my time to prepare for it, working from 6:45 to 8:00 (of course all this work won't be permanent - mostly just getting the groundwork set up). Taking almost all of my time from my baby boy and pregnant wife (also teacher - high school).


But then today they just introduced a whole other task due by the 12th (setting up a canvas page) that will take not only a significant time for me to learn but then a significant time to implement, I've had two students out for 10 days (One student was 12 days neither parents took me up on my offer of creating packs of materials to help them keep up with lessons. And I had a chat one mother at car rider duty who asked if I am teaching the material before sending homework, to wish I answered yes I am teaching every part of the material but your student missed more than 2 weeks of lessons) and so the canvas page requires constant updates with materials and lessons, and has to be active by October 12th. However like guided reading, after the initial work is done then I won't nearly have as much to do. Hopefully it won't be more than about a week, hopefully less if I have a super productive Saturday. Once the foundation is laid then I won't have to spend nearly as much time with it because it will just be back to lesson planning instead of printing out, laminating, cutting, organizing activities and center rotations In addition to purchasing yet again more materials for those centers. Just to name about a couple of 100 things that need to get done first. 


And I haven't even touched on the fact that some students absolutely require testing accommodations because they are just unable to engage with material in a testing environment, they're independent work is on pont and so far from the results of the tests because they get so overwhelmed (today I did your strategy of going through the class and getting everyone to share things that they are really good at and proud of doing and everyone was in such a good mood about that and I positively introduced ""hey this is just like what we do in independent work, y'all do such a great job with that and I know that you all are so smart and I've seen such great work that you've done and so just think of it like that) And yet I have the regular students still shut down, some of my higher ups were showing tears because of how stressed they were even after that positive priming and getting them into such good places). I always ask them if they're proud of their work and then affirm that they should be because I could tell how hard they are working and with the materials that they have shown me in other tasks that they should absolutely be proud of the persistence and effort that they put into it but has no effect.

I am trying to complete this preparation as fast as possible so that I can spend more time with baby and pregnant wife but the pressure from admin is overwhelming and I'm very behind (even among my grade level team) and I'm dreading an eventual walkthrough / observation that admin have said they will be doing this week and next.

Tomorrow I'm going to be meeting with the vice principal and literacy specialist to get some answers because they want to use guided reading lesson plan templates based on F&amp;P reading levels, but with groups formed using DIBELS lexile equivalent (which is a basically useless correlation, especially with the lowest levels), I've done a couple running records that have students at levels between one and three higher than the lexile correlation equivalent (which in some cases puts them in a different category of skill level). 

So how can I possibly be effective in addressing the skills and areas of improvement that students need if I'm using shit data to form groups that are comprised of inaccurate levels of skill when using a lesson template based off a completely different type of data set. 

Well the answer would be to rely either on only doing DIBELS skill-based interventions using their benchmark assessment results but that's incompatible with the F&amp;P lesson plan templates they want us to use. 

Or I could get accurate reading levels via running records which take time that I don't have and that they don't want to give me. But afterwards I could do both: DIBELS skills based instructional groups one day, F&amp;P small group instruction another day. 

I was promised two academic coaches to assist with ELA and guided reading. I have not had a single one. I have two students that perform well on individual work, small group work and whole class instruction but just freeze up with any test, I try nurturing their engagement, I try a more stern ""this is the expectation of everybody so I need you to do your best effort"" but it doesn't work at all, he clearly needs either small group or one-on-one accommodation with tests but I can't do that and I don't have a coach to help so his scores are essentially zero across the board.


Although they did announce that they knew academic coach was going to be joining to help with guided reading so hopefully that will alleviate some stress but they won't be starting until the 12th.


The discrepancies between evidence of skill among students in independent, small group, and whole class participation, is light years apart from their performance on tests. I hate tests so much I'm a project teacher that utilizes student interests in the context of real-world application where I have seen students just take off with the materials and skills that we are teaching connected with the standards, created on a metric instead of pure accuracy across a pen and paper test. And yet this school allows the zero flexibility on this issue.


Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love and adore my job and I am excited every single day to go to work and it gives me so much energy being with the kids and I love them so much. I just wish I could be more effective but I'm so restricted by the requirements of our curriculum specialists and the inaccuracy of their required assessments and I cried for the first time tonight and I'm trying to compartmentalize the difference between assessments and the skills they are learning that I witness in every other part of our instruction, but it isn't easy. 

It also doesn't help that I have two students that can't identify every letter of the alphabet, much less read more than about 20 of Fry's first 100 sight words. So essentially in every subject I have to differentiate between a mid kindergarten level, up to two high flyers that are at the end game of a third grade level of skill.
