Question",didntknowwhattoname,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/88muwo/super_generic_should_i_take_job_x_or_job_y/,"Currently have two offers on the table for an internship. One of the offers is 8 months at a startup that build electronics working with data systems and that would require me to relocate. The other is 8 months at a very large company working in security data systems close to me. 

The way I see it, the major pros to the startup is it's a startup and that it pays better (~30%), but it's in a less related area to what I want to do and also it requires me to relocate. 

For the big company, the pros are that its more related to what I want, but it pays less and has typical big company policies which I'm not a fan of.

Any advice here would be appreciated. I honestly hate these kinds of ""career"" questions, but I feel like seeing what even more people think than people I've already asked might actually help."

So right now, I've been focusing on applying for entry level positions with the hope that I can get one before graduating, which is going to be at the end of this summer.

Just kinda wanna prepare myself for the worst case scenario, that is, I won't get any offers after graduation, is there any other way for me to make money as a programmer?

I tried to do research on my own about this as well and I found out that I can do some freelancing. TBH, this sounds pretty good for me. 

Does anybody have any experience with doing freelancing? Or if you've done some other things related to programming that earns you some money, can you share what you did and why you did it?"

Do I have any rights?,Thrownmeaway2018,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/88oi1h/pa_kicked_out_of_house_after_fiance_of_five_years/,"I recently discovered my ex-fiance had cheated on me with several women over the course of our relationship and was fired from his previous job due to the fact he continuously sexually harassed women at work. Needless to say, I was crushed. I informed his best friend and his mother of the situation in hopes they could help him pull his life together, because I wasn't strong enough to do so. I made it clear that I was left with no choice, but to end our relationship due his behavior. I advised I would start the process of moving my things in with my mother. 

The house we have lived in for two years is owned by his stepfather and we pay for utilities. My ex and I have a dog that will stay with him as the apartment my mother wants and the future one I intend to rent does not allow dogs (apartment choice made due to location, price, etc). I was actually okay with this as my ex stated I could stop by when I was free to spend time with our dog in order to feed him, walk him, and play. I have moved most of my things, but the larger furniture we agreed could stay put until I can move them. 

Today (we broke up Tuesday), his mother told my ex to get my key back, make me remove my furniture, end contact with me and not allow me to visit our dog (she's not a very kind woman). I feel that I have been more than reasonable in this situation. I advised my ex he could keep everything in the house (aside from my pc and some other personal items) if he would still help me move. He agreed. I have been the breadwinner in this relationship and have paid for majority of everything. The value of what he would owe me in furniture would be in the thousands. I told him that despite being hurt, I didn't want to wipe his savings (couple thousand). However, I feel threatened by his mother and am not sure what my rights are and what my next moves should be?

I will be temporaily staying with my mother for about a month. I will then move to another state to work 3 months on a summer internship (ex would help me move). At the end of the summer, I will move back to an apartment in the same complex as my mother and hopefully end all contact with my ex and his family (ex would help me move back).


Honestly, I don't want to start any trouble. My ex is willing to let me use his key to visit our dog and leave my items there until I am ready. However, it's his mother who is making me feel threatened. I'm worried I'll find my stuff trashed, my other car towed (it needs a new belt and is sitting on the street in front of the house), or anything else she may be capable of. Please help me understand what I should be concerned about and what my rights are."
88oovj,0,2018-04-01,How much competition is there to CODO into Computer Science from the Polytechnic School?,[deleted],Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/88oovj/how_much_competition_is_there_to_codo_into/,"I got admitted to Purdue for a web design major in the Polytechnic school. My stats were low and I knew I'd get rejected if I applied directly as a computer science major, and well, I'm passionate about web design too, so I just jumped at the opportunity of applying to an easier major that I am equally passionate about.

Recently, I was speaking with some people and they said a computer science major would be a lot better for my future. For one, the web design major doesn't go over data structures, something that is apparently crucial in software engineering job interviews.

Therefore, I am seriously considering CODOing to a computer science major in the college of science if I attend Purdue. I've received a ton of rejections, and Purdue is the most ""prestigious"" university I've gotten into. The other universities I've gotten into either aren't a fit for me, or don't have a strong computer science program. They also don't have the same name brand as Purdue. therefore, I am inclined towards committing to Purdue. (Unless I get off waitlists for other schools - which I don't see as likely - I'll most probably be a Boilermaker this fall.)

The CODO requirements aren't too hard. 

See here: https://www.cs.purdue.edu/undergraduate/codo.html

I spoke to a current Purdue student (direct CS admit) from the Purdue discord server and he said he took CS 18000 with no prior programming experience and got an A. Well, I have tons of programming experience, and am willing to put in the work if it ever gets tough. I am also going to take the AP Computer Science A exam this year, and assuming I pass with a 5, I might be able to use AP credits to skip out of the course. 

As for Calculus, I got a 5 on Calculus AB last year and can hopefully use that to fulfill the Calculus requirement for CODOing to a computer science major. If not, I will work hard and be proactive to secure a B or higher.

Maintaining a 3.0 shouldn't be too hard, either. Web Design is stupidly easy and I'm sure I'll ace most - if not all - classes in the Polytechnic school, making my GPA pretty high.

My only concern is the competition.

Purdue is a top 10 (or top 15 at the very least) computer science school in the nation. A lot of spaces will be filled up, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were others in my position.

So my questions are:

* Once I've met the prereqs, how tough will it be to CODO in to the Computer Science major? I spoke to some Polytechnic advisors in a live Q&amp;A they did and will be visiting an admissions advisor on April 6 (he is hosting some Boiler Brew event) and the Polytechnic advisors told me it will be extremely hard. I'd like some validation or more specificity. 

* They said they do hollistic review. Does this mean, they will also look at high school extracurriculars ( I hope so, I have online CS classes, software engineering internship, community involvement, etc)? High school grades (I hope not, my grades were fucked in 10th grade)? Or do they only look at what we accomplished at Purdue? Meaning I'd have to join clubs and get involved in student activities?

* Besides meeting the prereqs and getting involved on campus, is there anything else I can do to bolster my chances of getting in the school of science for a computer science major?

* Could I potentially CODO and get into a computer science major by the beginning of second semester freshman year? if not, when is the earliest I could CODO?

* Is it even worth it for me to go to Purdue if my goal is to ultimately major in computer science, based on how competitive it will be to CODO in?

Other acceptances I have right now are SF State and UT Dallas, but both either aren't a good fit or don't have the same name brand as Purdue.

Appreciate your insights!

Let me know if it would also be appropriate to email these questions to some computer science advisor at Purdue, and if so, who.

Thank you so much!

Where do I begin to learn things that actually matter in a field that I’m interested in? I just feel so helpless as I think I can land an internship but if I do, I wouldn’t know what I would do as I only know c++. I took data structures but my professor was new and he ended up giving the whole class A’s when we really didn’t learn anything. I’m just ranting for my own fuck-Ups of not taking school seriously.

While I was in college, I wanted to be a teacher and I took steps to pursue that route - I focused on classes and have experience teaching. I entered graduate school last summer, but it was not working out and I decided to leave.

I chose to study for actuarial exams to teach myself some finance and passed the first two and I also reapplied to another graduate school for education which I was accepted into.

But at this point, I don't know how much I want to teach. All things equal, I think I'd choose to teach, but it's nowhere near equal and I can't justify ~500k over the course of a lifetime to teach (including student loans and future salaries) versus a career as an actuary (or almost any office job). Unfortunately, because of when I left school, I have no relevant experience (no internships, no office work, etc, just teaching), in addition to an already saturated job market. I've been applying for a couple weeks now, and while I know that's not very long, I'm very scared that I won't be able to ever find a job, regardless as an actuary or accountant or (I'm pretty much applying for anything that I meet the qualifications for)...

Complicating this further is how to respond to my graduate school offer, which has a mid April deadline. Saying no is a huge risk with no job/experience and I also declined their offer last year (although I don't know if this would have any impact in the future), but I'm afraid saying yes will lock me into this path, that or I'd end up leaving a second graduate school.

I'm looking for some advice on how to handle my grad school offer, especially in the context of the job search."

Most of the questions were pretty standard, except one asked what level of pay/compensation I'm expecting for the position. 
           
For some background, I'm a sophomore at Cornell University studying Information Science and minoring in CS. The company is a small startup in the blockchain/crypto trading industry. This would be my first internship in software engineering/ IT.
          
Looking around online, the average pay for entry level software engineering internships seems to be about $20/hr. I don't know if I should ask for this though since the startup is rather small (&lt;10 employees). 
      
Overall, I don't wanna ask for too much and turn them off to hiring me since the position seems very interesting and I'd love the experience, but I also don't want to ask for too little and end up being underpaid for my work. Right now I'm thinking about asking for $19/hr to start with but saying that this is very negotiable.

I started working at a lab in october of last year. I was so excited because I had been out of the science world for about two years (not by choice; I had worked for a pharmaceutical company that went under and I had to take the first job I could get, which was in tax management. ) After I accepted the position, my manager (the lab director) told me: ""If you get to a point where you are going to walk out, please do me a favor and just talk to me before you do so."" Of course, I knew this was odd but I didn't want to let it get to me.

I had gotten a position in the mass spec department. The first week of the job ended up being pretty brutal. I was working with a coworker who had his Ph.d. He gave me a difficult time over everything that I did. Some examples: he told me I wasn't allowed to sit in the 'good chair.' When I was weighing acid on the scale, I was doing it too slow. He criticized me for taking notes and told me I was not to write anything down when he spoke. He also told me it was clear that I had absolutely no experience working in the medical field. This was completely untrue, as I had participated in paid internships in college and published research papers. In my interview, I was very clear about my prior experience and was upfront in admitting that I would need to learn the precise methods practiced in this particular lab. When my manager asked me how everything was going, I told him that I did not believe that it was going well and I felt uncomfortable. When my manager spoke with my coworker, he immediately stated that I must be making everything up and that he refused to work with me. My manager told me that I should go back and just wait until things blew over. 

And so I did. But no one in the mass spec department would speak to me or even make eye contact with me.

After this ordeal, my manager moved me to another department with a few twenty-something girls. Within a few months, these girls started spreading a few different rumors about me. 
1.) I was sleeping with my boss (NOT true) 
2.) I was doing school work during work hours (also NOT true) 
3.) I was making more money than people who outranked me ( I don't know if this is true, but I never told anyone at the company how much I made).

I spoke with my manager about the aforementioned rumors because I was really upset and because I didn't want any of the stupid office politics to impact my job. I was busting my butt, working 60 hour weeks...doing everything I good to be a good employee.
So, the thing is, my bosses are not quite appropriate either... About two months after I started, My manager asked me, point blank, if I had a specific mental disorder (I'd rather not say which one). And the truth is, I do. I felt really awkward because I'm not typically open, especially about that, but I also felt obligated not to lie. So embarassingly, I admitted that I did. I don't think my manager is a bad person. But some of the things he says does hurt my feelings. Once he said, ""a lot of people have things wrong with them, but you, you're clinical.""
The assistant manager is worse. He lies a lot and thinks that he more intelligent and all around better than everyone else. He makes things difficult and fines a way to argue that whatever I do is incorrect. Once, he told me that ""email is not an effective mode of communication."" Even though the company policy is to utilize and check company email daily if not more frequently. Another time, he said, ""we have to stop hiring all of these Indian women who cry all the time."" After he said that, I felt really uncomfortable and talked to my manager. Nothing was done.
My manager, in the past, has commented on how different I look without makeup. The overall tone felt negative. The one day I did wear make-up, he said, ""You didn't look like that last week.""
Today, the assistant manager told me that I sometimes look like a cake-face and ""go too heavy on the eyeliner.""

There are more little instances, but this job is really making me feel awful. I've tried to mention that these things bother me, but when I do it ends up being my fault because I'm ""too sensitive.""

I don't know what to do..."

I'm a computer technician with only A+, but years of knowledge with working on anything computing (self-taught). I got the cert as part of an intern position at a local IT support firm, but I knew basically most of what A+ teaches you before I even started it. Now I am not part of that firm anymore and want to start something on my own.

I do know how to help out people who have basic issues such as a printer not printing, no internet access, viruses (very basic examples, but it's issues many people face) and I can perform some more advanced work such as complete disassembly and maintenance of laptops, all-in-one machines and desktops (provided they are out of warranty), OS installations, data migration from one machine to another (including programs), hardware troubleshooting, hardware upgrades, software troubleshooting etc. I even do mobile device-related work.

I have helped quite a few people in my area with great success (no callbacks), so I want to expand and tackle larger areas and gain more clients. Everyone has been very welcoming and appreciate my services massively (some even ditching their usual IT guy/center for me), but I do have a unique way of helping people. I go to them and either fix on-site, or retrieve the hardware to work from home. I treat the clients as if they are friends, and some have even become friends of mine (they respect that I am a service provider and still pay for my services in full, which is nice). I also don't charge an arm and a leg for my services, which I'm hoping can act as an incentive for more clients to ask for my services, and if I do raise my prices they'll happily accept it because they know how I work and trust me (this is all in-theory type stuff).

I want to know if this is something I must build upon, or must I stop wasting my time and focus on something with more “prestige” in the IT world? I love doing what I do since it’s things I do in my spare time. It’s a hobby of mine and something I'm passionate about. I’d like to hear your opinions from you men (or women) on this.

I also have had nervous breakdowns and anxiety attacks all my life and I only found out in the past year that I'm on the autism spectrum. My social skills are not on par with most, and if I get too stressed out my brain basically shits the bed (can't think, talk coherently, rageflailing and tears). I never tell employers this, and try to hide my issues, because:

One of the first print shop jobs I've had, was initially a three person operation (boss, production manager and me). Production manger quit, a replacement didn't work out, so instead of getting another one the boss dumped the PM's responsibilities on me. I tried to juggle everything, failed, and told boss we need another PM and I cannot handle all the extra responsibility. 

He promptly fired me and replaced me with two interns from the local vo-tech. Since then I've had other jobs, some of which I also lost due to not being able to pass as neurotypical.

I've moved on to a new print shop, I've been there over a year and while it has problems it's the best job I've had since graduating. It was also a three person op.

The boss had medical issues and was gone most of the time last winter, and with just me and the PM, plus a change of location, business plummeted. Not long after boss came back, the PM left, and her replacement didn't last as long either. So guess who gets to handle PM duties!

Now in addition to my old responsibilities, I'm now expected to take orders, handle the customer service, and do the screenprinting when boss isn't there. Which the latter I didn't think I'd have a problem with it- until I found out running the machine is sensory and anxiety hell. (the million steps! how easy it is to mess up the shirts! that fucking air compressor! that fact that my boss is constantly absent and can't teach or guide or critique!)

Last Thursday I was left by myself to finish a big rush order I didn't know how to do. I had multiple breakdowns, one in front of a customer that came in. And I know this is going to happen again, probably with the boss witnessing, and then it's curtains.

What do I do? I know from experience what happens if I share my concerns with my bosses. Is there a way to gently suggest she try to find another PM and I go back to things I can handle?"

Last semester I was a computer science major. I did fine, but I despised it. I couldn't imagine doing this as a career.

The problem is, EVERYONE is either mocking me or judging my major. When I told my parents, they were silent and completely disapproved. The next day, they told me they were going to cut how much they would pay towards my tuition. My previous Computer Science friends have literally laughed in my face for switching. I even met a Computer Science major whose first words to me were ""What do you even do with that major that's pointless"". Even my friends have told me it's a wasted major.

 Options as I see them:


 1) Keep looking for internships: Experience and possibly decent pay. Problem is this is pretty late for summer internships and longer-running ones I may have to leave once classes begin.

 2) Part-time work: Not going to pay well, or be hugely career relevant at best. But I won't have to leave once classes start, so can count on consistent pay.

 3) Full-time work: Try and get something more applicable to my career path. Not sure I'd be able to continue full-time work while pursuing grad school full-time though.

 4) Others I missed?"

Thing is I've also really come to the realization that I'm not really interested in computer science at all. I chose this course of study because I knew it was a good field and I knew I could do it (and it was about as preferable to me as any other option), I just have no drive to really pursue it on my own time out of class. I don't work on personal projects, I've half assed any attempts I've made to get internships (still haven't had any), and I only once looked through example interview questions when I managed to get an IBM interview a couple months ago somehow. I really have no idea how I'll find an actual job to pursue with my lack of skill outside of what I learned in school. I'm fine working for my hobbies, but right now I'm not sure whether or not I'll even have work. 

Is this normal/fine? Is there like something I can be reaiming for that's slightly connected like QA where I can build up professional skills more and perhaps later transition into software engineering roles? Am I still employable as a fresh grad even if I don't have internships? Everything about what awaits me in the near future is just putting me on edge because of how I don't know if I can, want to, or will do it even if I can. "

Trying to figure out what to do post graduation in about a year or so (before anyone says an internship, I have a few offers for this upcoming summer).

Long story short, I have dual citizenship (USA and Poland), and for those who are unfamiliar, college in Europe is practically free. I either have the option of paying $20k-40k+ USD here in the USA for a year of school, while an entire Master's program (2 years) in Poland is less than $5k USD.

My main options would be (in this order):

1. Warsaw University of Technology

2. Tadeusz Kościuszko University of Technology

3. AGH University of Science and Technology

4. Poznań University of Technology

5. Gdańsk University of Technology

What I am mainly worried about is how employers would view a Masters in CS from any of these schools, or Poland altogether. I hear stories of people getting degrees (not just CS) overseas, and then when they come to the US, the degree is invalid or only partially recognized. I do not want this to happen as 1.5-2 years of studying is a lot of time. I am also open to getting a degree in the UK, Switzerland, France, etc as I know their CS graduate programs are also very impressive -- it's just that Poland would be easiest and cheapest option as I would be able to stay with relatives for free.

In addition, I'm waiting on an email from the CS advisor from UCSB to see what she thinks. A friend of mine who goes to UCI who majors in CS told me that the hard part is getting the classes and not really petitioning. I'm kind of shying away from UCR because I feel as if I wouldn't be as happy as I would be at UCSB but then again I might not get a degree in CS which begs the question of how impactful is it to have a CS degree when pursuing a career in software development? I hope to become a software developer and I know there are developers without CS degrees but I would like any advice that could potentially help me whether it be what major I could pursue or have as a sort of ""backup"" if I do decide to try to petition , what I might do concurrently while I'm in college (internships, hackathons, etc), or anything else relating to the topic."
88u4os,4,2018-04-01,Commuting to Mississauga from Scarborough by public transit or car,full0fmyself,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/88u4os/commuting_to_mississauga_from_scarborough_by/,"Hi, I am starting a 10-month internship in Mississauga (near UofT Mississauga) soon and I am trying to decide what would be the best way to commute there everyday. Since the position will pay very little (but I need to do it -- assume there is no alternative), I can't afford to move to Mississauga. I am going to have to live with my parents in Scarborough until I finish the internship and find another job.

So far, for the interviews, I have been doing the following: TTC subway, GO train and one MiWay bus. This takes about 1 hour and 50 minutes each way, so about 4 hours in commute everyday. And based on the fares listed online and the GO transit calculator, it would cost me about $500 a month for transit.

I don't own or have access to a car but I do have a driver's licence and I'm wondering if it would be cheaper to buy a used car, drive to work and back for 10 months, and then sell it. I have savings and I could afford to buy a used car under 10k in cash.

I don't know much about how long it would take to drive to Mississauga from Scarborough in rush hour (it's a 9-5 job) but if I could save enough time compared to transit, then I could use that time to work a part-time job, probably minimum wage, for a couple hours in the evenings. Maybe even Uber/Lyft? And if the job is in Mississauga, then I wouldn't have to drive back home during rush hour either.

Do you think buying a used car could potentially be a better financial decision than using public transit? I would have to pay for all the costs, including insurance, maintenance, and gas, so please factor all that in, including expected depreciation for an average car."

My most recent quarter, I took Assembly Language as well as Data Structures. I graduated in 2015 with a degree in Biological Sciences to initially go into the healthcare field, but once I worked in the field, decided that it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

I've tried applying to a lot of the freshman geared internships such as Microsoft Explore, Twitter University, and Facebook University and got rejected from all of them. I haven't heard back from a lot of the other ones I've applied to(local+big companies), and at this point I'm not too hopeful about finding an internship for summer 2018. I currently work full-time while taking 2 classes a quarter, so it's been difficult to find time to work on side projects while balancing everything else.

I have always had problems focusing in school but managed to push through them to get into college. Half-way through this semester I finally went to a doctor after prompting from a school counselor and was diagnosed with ADD and was put on meds. I saw success in the meds soon after and my grades improved a lot. 

My roommate, who I have never had problems with before, isn’t doing so hot in the same classes. She was super suspicious about my using medicine and if I even had ADD or was just faking it to get drugs. We got an exam grade back and she did poorly while I did way better than I have before. She made some snide comment about “performance enhancing drugs” but I just wrote it off as her being sour at a bad grade. 

However, my sorority’s standards chair called me Friday to tell me that I was being reported for academic dishonesty by my roommate. The same day my academic counselor emailed me to come talk to her, which ended up being a lecture about how serious it is that someone is reporting me to the school for cheating. She said I might have go in front of the Honor Council at my school for a formal review. 

My school is very serious about academic dishonesty, and because this relates to controlled substances I’m at risk for expulsion from the university, which would end my sorority affiliation, my internship, and essentially my chances of working in the secure field I hope to work in one day. All because of her false reports. 

My questions are as follows:

- Can I get into trouble for academic dishonesty even though I have medical documentation regarding my ADD medication?

- Are there any possible repercussions my roommate can face for trying to sabotage my academic career by making false claims? 

- Is a lawyer necessary given that none of the “charges” are in a real court of law?"

**Cast of Characters**     
$CTG: Crazy Tech Guy       
$Me: yep, me, the helpdesk leader      
$Boss: my boss       
$OSHA: OSHA guy

Around this time I am in charge of our merry band of helpdesk techs. I've also been charged with crafting a yearly budget for hardware, which resulted in The Dell Game. During all this, I've been working on a couple of other things. 

One was to get all our department in close proximity so that we can at least talk to each other. Something that may not matter in other departments, but is *very* helpful when you're doing tech support. 

Being the red-headed stepchild that IT always is, we didn't have an assigned area of the building. Instead, we all worked in a cubicle farm used for admin assistants, interns, and temp personnel. Our cubicles were assigned on a first come, first serve basis. Whatever cubicle happened to be empty the day you started work, that's where you sat. Forever. 

I worked behind the scenes to get us all concentrated in one area. When a nearby cubicle came up empty, I'd get some admin person to let me change one of the techs seating assignment.  

So now we are all in one spot. We can share tools, set up some shared storage space, set up a software library, etc. All that good stuff.

$CTG **hated** this. Before this he could hide in his cube. No one around him understood his job, so he couldn't be caught slacking. Now that all the people around did exactly the same job, his incompetence was glaringly evident. As was every time he disappeared for hours. 

Taking advantage of The Dell Game satisfaction of my boss, I lobbied for a couple of real, professional work stations. Made for IT. With KVMs and power strips. All the perks. 

I got it! Yeah!!

The only IT designated space we had was the server room. It was decided that was where the workstations were to be placed. Mostly because it was behind locked doors, so security. 

This wasn't a problem. The server room was large by most standards. Think the size of a large living room. It had 3-4 server racks, a desk for doing log entries, and lots of empty space. 

Work stations are set up and we now had the capacity to work on 7-8 computers at a time. Plus no more tools and computer parts spread out in our cubicles. Everyone was pleased. 

Except $CTG. Because now, not only was he absorbing passive disapproval for goofing off in his cubicle, getting noticed each time he disappeared, but other techs could look over his shoulder and offer advice when he actually decided to work. This could NOT happen! 

&gt;$Boss: You need to find out how noisy the server room is.        
&gt;$Me: Ummm...it has servers. There's some computer noise, but it's a big room, and there's not that many servers.       
&gt;$Boss: Contact our OSHA guy and find out what acceptable noise levels are. See if he's ever measured noise levels in that room. Find out if putting the new workstations in that room has increased the noise level.    

I call the OSHA guy. He laughs at me. Noise levels have never been measured in that room. It's not necessary. You can tell by listening that the noise levels are no where near where safety levels need to be considered. 

Back to $Boss. 

&gt;$Me: OSHA guy says there's no need to measure noise levels in that room.       
&gt;$Boss: We have to do it anyway. $CTG has filed a Worker's Comp claim. He says the noise levels have permanently damaged his hearing. He can no longer work in that room, so he can no longer do tasks at those workstations. 

Back to OSHA guy.    

&gt;$OSHA: That is a complete waste of my time.       
&gt;$Me: It has to be done.      
&gt;$OSHA: Okay, you can borrow my equipment. I'll give you a quick training.      
&gt;$Me: Fine. I guess.      

Which means that $OSHA taught me to use some cool tools. I spent a couple of hours learning how to use them, and I ended up with some minor certificate that says I know how to operate them. (Which also means that in the future I spent some time with the $OSHA guy helping out. Not bad. Not bad at all. I love learning new shit.) 

While this is happening, $CTG is back to slacking off. He refuses to enter the server room. He doesn't have access to tools, so he's basically only clearing paper jams and resetting passwords. He's shoving off any serious work to other techs. 

Back to the Boss. 

&gt;$Me: I measured the noise levels in the server room. Not anywhere close to concern. $CTG should be clear to go back to work. Here are the reports.          
&gt;$Boss: Okay, I'll pass them on to HR.      

......

&gt;$Boss: $CTG has refused to return to the server room. He says it's not the noise level. It's the continuous exposure over time. Are there any OSHA limitations on that?       
&gt;$Me: I'll check with $OSHA.     

.......

&gt;$OSHA: Are you fucking kidding me???        
&gt;$Me: Nope.        
&gt;$OSHA: (*sigh*) Okay. For that, you need to take readings every xx hours over xxx days. Plot them on a graph. Look for peaks and valleys. Use these algorithms to determine average noise levels. And use these charts to see if the noise levels go out of bounds at any point. 

So now, I am randomly measuring noise levels at different times and recording them on a sheet. If I remember correctly, I had to do this for a couple of weeks. 

Meanwhile $CTG is slacking off....still refusing to enter the server room. 

I get all the testing done. Do the charts. Everything looks good. Turn it over to $Boss.     

A few days later...

&gt;$Boss: All the noise levels are fine. Worker's Comp has dismissed the claim.    
&gt;$Me: So $CTG has to work in the server room again?     
&gt;$Boss: Yes and no. He's now saying that no matter what the legal levels are, the noise in the server room interferes with his ability to work. The noise gives him headaches and earaches. He doesn't want to work in there.      
&gt;$Me: (*hopefully*) Does that mean we can lay him off now?      
&gt;$Boss: No.      
&gt;$Me: Well...shit.       
&gt;$Boss: Can we move some of the equipment around so that he can use part of it?       
&gt;$Me: We could, but that would interfere with everyone's ability to do their jobs.       
......         
&gt;$Me: Since this is a comfort thing now, and not a legal thing, can we simply give him ear protectors?      
&gt;$Boss: Go ask $OSHA if that's acceptable.      

.....

&gt;$OSHA: Yes, you can do that. I keep ear plugs in stock, but not ear protectors. You want some?     
&gt;$Me: Can you keep us supplied?     
&gt;$OSHA: Sure. I have these nice little boxes that are mounted outside any area that might need ear plugs. I'll just add one outside the door to the server room.       

The next day a box of ear plugs appear mounted to the wall beside the server room. 

You would think that would be the end of it, right? But $CTG has to have one last try....

$CTG still tries to pawn his work off to another tech, since he can't go in the server room. The tech tells him to use the ear plugs and do his own work. 

&gt;$CTG: I can't use those generic ear plugs. They hurt my ears. I need specially designed ones that will work for my super-special ears.      
&gt;$Me: Oh, yeah? That's too bad. When do you think you can get those?     
&gt;$CTG: Me??? The company needs to buy them for me. They are necessary for my job.      
&gt;$Me: We've supplied you with perfectly acceptable, accredited ear plugs that everyone in the company uses. You are more than welcome to supply your own. Until then, use what's here.       
&gt;$CTG: But they hurt my ears!     
&gt;$Me: That sounds like a personal problem to me. I'd recommend you see your doctor.  


The ear plugs stayed mounted on the server room door. No one used them. $CTG went back to the server room.

So I'm in a bit of a pickle in terms of what I should do about my internship this summer. Sorry for the wall of text...here's the situation:

I interned at a company (Company X) last summer. I didn't quite enjoy the work as it was a lot of desk work and not as much interaction with those we were working with as much as I wanted. I think the company knew, though, and tried to make it more interesting by allowing me to sit in on conference calls, meet with team members, access pretty important documents, etc. I really enjoyed the people and the culture, though. I got along with mostly everyone, and the company really welcomed me with open arms. I technically have an offer from them for this summer, because my supervisor reached out to me at the end of my internship (and between last summer and now) to let me know that they would love to have me back this summer. The nice thing about this internship was that it wasn't too far from home (so I could drive home every weekend if I wanted to), but still far enough where I had to live on my own and commute.

That said, I'm not sure if I want to limit myself by staying with this company. I applied to about 10 other companies this week and have yet to hear back (it's only been about one or two days since I submitted my applications). The work sounds more interesting and engaging than what I did at Company X, which is why I'm drawn to these other internships. However, many of them are pretty far from home (6+ hours, some out-of-state). While I wouldn't necessarily mind the distance, it is pretty scary to think I wouldn't have that option of going home when I want to. Additionally, some of the internships are either unpaid or only part-time, whereas ideally I'd like a full-time, paid internship (which I would have at Company X).

Now...the dilemma. Company X reached out recently asking if I'd like to return and that they'd love to have me. While I feel like I can probably buy about a week's worth of time, I don't want to push it off for too long to respect their process in seeking summer interns. I'm not sure what to do! I don't want to burn any bridges by contacting my previous supervisor, tentatively taking on the internship, but then later backtracking and declining the internship for another one.

Should I wait for these other companies to get back to me and move forward with that process in hopes that I'll land one of those internships? Or should I just play it safe and ensure that I even have an internship this summer by going back to Company X?

**To recap/TL;DR**

Pros of Company X - I know I like the company/culture, it's a good distance from home, it's paid and full-time, could build my network and work there post-graduation

Cons of Company X - the work wasn't as exciting as I would have hoped

Pros of other internships - work seems more exciting, could expand my network

Cons of other internships - I may not even get them (leaving me with nothing for this summer!), I may not like the culture, I may not get along with the people, I may have to be super far from home, it may not be paid/full-time

Any advice on what I should do? After typing this out, it looks like the pros heavily outweigh the cons to go back to Company X...but I'm not sure. Any advice? What would you do? Thank you in advance for your insight!"

I'm currently studying at Uni to get an IT degree that is on a software track. I take all of the same programming classes a CS major would just without the math and theory. I guess you can call it something like a hybrid. 

Originally, I was a CS major because I loved programming but I just couldn't do the math a CS major has to do. I always knew I wanted to study something related to computers/programming so I figured it would be logical to switch to IT especially since I don't have the money to take the same class two or three times if I fail it. 

I have about a year left before I graduate and I don't feel confident in my abilities at all. I feel under prepared for work in general. I've applied to a lot of internships. Got declined for two and got a pre-screening for one(waiting to hear if they want a interview, nothing yet), the others I haven't heard from. Most of them have been for Software Dev Intern positions, which I don't think I'll get since I'll be competing with CS majors.

As I get closer to graduating I feel like I'm becoming more clueless about what I want to do. I also feel like I might let my parents down because they always trust me that I know what I'm doing and think I'm gonna land some job paying 70k - 80k right outta graduation and I don't think that's gonna be the case...
They've been very supportive otherwise.

Everything has just been so up in the air and it's kinda frustrating.

Sorry about the rant. It just helps me to write things out sometimes and I figured the benefit of getting advice wouldn't hurt. 

I guess what I'm really looking for right now is peace of mind.

Thank you for any advice."

To clarify, I am someone who is very bad at any sort of interviewing, but consider myself a decent programmer. I do not have professional experience to back this up--only academic projects and an interest in development. I've been applying and interviewing for full-time(and internship roles in the past) for the last 5 months with little luck. I'm growing extremely disillusioned with the entire process and would like to begin working soon. And also because I'll be kicked out of the country otherwise.

88whwp,5,2018-04-01,Is another internship always beneficial?,programmerintheworld,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/88whwp/is_another_internship_always_beneficial/,"Hi CSCareerQuestions!

I am currently thinking of finding an internship in the fall of my senior year to further add to my work experience in any (and preferably new) domain of development. 


The only thing that is holding me back is the fact that many of the tech companies in my city are not exactly the ""cream of the crop"" in terms of prestige or the work that they do - with many of them being small consulting firms. While I certainly think that I will learn something by working for these companies, I don't think that I will be as proud of my experiences there as my experiences in my two previous internships.

Would another internship or work experience of this kind be beneficial when applying for jobs (especially jobs of higher repute)? While I would certainly benefit from the experience (and the pay), I am afraid that my experience there would detract from my other internships. If so, would it be a reasonable option to leave the experience off the resume? "

So my situation is a little special, I did an undergrad in Liberal Arts and Sciences, majored in science. Yes this sounds really vague and it was vague. On top of it only a 3 year degree. So I know a lot of different stuff but Nothing properly. I really enjoyed coding and had an interest in Neuroscience and Machine Learning. My advisor at the time though, recommended me to do a master in a specific field rather than an interdisciplinary one. So I ended up doing Computersciene. Here comes the catch, I’m doing it in Korea. And the struggle is real.

Courses here are basically completely useless, both professors and students seem to just take that as a given. So all the work and learning here happens in a laboratory. Now in my lab, normally one should at least intern for a semester before entering. Whilst doing that one is working with a Master/PhD student and learns from them. In my case this didn’t happen, because I entered through a scholarship. As soon as i entered the lab I was assigned a really vague project of which I am the leader. But up until today the data hasn’t come out, but I’m supposed to come up with some kind of research idea etc etc.
But basically I have just been ignored and literally spent most of my time doing pretend research. At some point the professor assigned one of the PhD students to guide me (on another project) so that I can learn coding and research methods. But this guy doesn’t do any guidance but ignores me for weeks to then bombard me with expectations of the form “try and do all these things and submit a paper for the conference”. But considering my level just doing one of those things takes forever because it’s completely new to me, there is a lot I need to learn to understand it etc. And I get 0 guidance or help from that PhD student.
Just yesterday evening I received a message from him telling me to prepare a presentation including a paper survey and my research objective which I was supposed to hold in front of the professor. Well that was too short notice. I haven’t really done much research recently because I was busy with the other project, which i am also doing too slowly etc etc.
On top of that I get constantly sick but I am sure this is because of the stress. Also I have no idea what such a presentation would look like.

Basically I am incredibly frustrated because I am expected to do things and know how to do things which I at my level can just not do. Especially not by myself.
I struggle extremely to even sit down and attempt doing stuff because I am so overwhelmed that there is not much more than giving up. I see myself just turning into an alcoholic and being super stressed everyday. 
It’s just so pointless because the way I am working and studying now doesn’t require any university. I literally just study from the internet. Classes are useless, also non existent. Especially the ones in korean I don’t take much out of them. 

Also I feel like my brain isn’t working anymore either. If I look at the interns working together with other people, they are super enthusiastic and have questions and ideas.  Honestly I’m at the stage where I am reading stuff or working on my code and I don’t even know what to ask myself or others anymore, Its like i can’t think for myself properly anymore. My brain turned into a desert.

When I adressed this with the student who is supposed to work with me, telling him that the tasks I have aren’t matching with my level at all, all I got as a response: “ can’t be helped”.
Yesterday to when I was working on the presentation and realized I don’t actual don’t know how to make such a presentation, it took ages to get some useful advice from my senior. I even asked right away if he could give me some guidelines, but apart from “show examples and state your objective” I got nothing. My senior also ended up scolding me that I should be able to do it all by myself.

Then there is the language barrier. We have seminars, they are all in Korean and I am just not at that level yet to follow the content. Also o don’t have any mental strength so my brain just switches off immediately. When they are discussing amongst themselves I can’t really follow either. It’s close to impossible to be motivated and inspired in this situation. 
I can speak simply daily korean but not on their level. So basically I’m a little ghost in this lab, doing pretend research but so incredibly stressed because I feel I am not learning and doing what I’m supposed to be doing. I

By now I’m at the stage that I stress cry quite a lot and lost all hope. I feel like I’m absolutely failing at grad school. But if I quit I’m left with not much, my lousy vague undergrad degree and that’s it. Just don’t know how to keep going through this while maintaining my mental and physical health.

My korean fellow students would just think, study more work more sleep less. But I am not willing to go to such lengths again, I burned out before and also slipped into a depression. So my health comes first. Also as I said my Brain isn’t working well anymore anyways, can’t focus for longer than 5 minutes. And it’s just a desert anyways.

Just how on earth do I get anything worthwhile out of this degree??"
88wlas,4,2018-04-01,Unimpressive soon-to-be grad looking for advice,runningcool,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/88wlas/unimpressive_soontobe_grad_looking_for_advice/,"So I'm graduating in about a month with a bachelor's in CS and I'm looking to work as soon as possible. Problem is, I haven't had an internship or really any projects/experience outside of classes. My GPA isn't great but it's not bad either (3.5/4.0), but I'm afraid my lack of experience is going to make companies just pass me by without a thought.

I've been applying for positions and practicing for coding interviews but I've only managed to get one interview so far. 

So, my question is this: If my goal is to land a full-time position as quickly as possible (preferably software engineering), should I just send out as many applications as I can while continuing to practice coding problems, or would it be more worthwhile to put a hold on looking for jobs and spend some time trying to build some sort of portfolio?

Also, I realize that I should have been much more proactive these past few years, and I have no excuses. I also realize that there are no short cuts for this. I'm just looking for opinions on what may be the most efficient use of my time before and after I graduate.

tl;dr: Soon I'll have a CS degree but no experience or projects outside of my classes. Will my degree be enough to land interviews and eventually a job, or should I work on building a portfolio first? (I'm not looking to work at a Big 4, just anywhere I can get experience and some money I can live off)

**UCSD:**

Pros:

* Second best CS of the UCs (I think)
* I was admitted directly to the CS major
* Regents (not enough money to make a difference though)

Cons:

* Socially dead??
* Not as prestigious as the other schools
* TBH, don't really want to go after I visited (it just didn't really click with me)

**UCLA:**

Pros:

* Nice campus, food, girls, etc.
* I was admitted directly to the major
* Not as cutthroat as UCB and Cornell (I think)

Cons:

* Weakest CS program out of all the schools

**UCB**

Pros:

* Best CS Program
* Best for startups, internships, future job opportunities, etc.
* Best meme page

Cons:

* I was admitted to the College of Letters and Science so I risk not being able to actually become a CS major.
* A B.A. in CS is not as good as a B.S.?
* Cutthroat, stressful, grade deflation, etc.

**Cornell**

Pros:

* Ivy league prestige (barely lol)
* More resources, office hours, better student:faculty ratio, all that private school goodness
* Second best CS program of the schools I'm considering
* Nice campus and food.
* Easier to double major (something I might be interested in)

Cons:

* Tuition is about two times as much as the UCs
* Location
* Depressing?
* Also cutthroat and stressful?

I have very little experience in other Csci related internships and/or engineering internships.

So far we’ve met once and they offered me a position for an internship at their company in Osaka headquarters. I meet again with another lead engineer or executive (many can’t speak English and my Japanese isn’t at the fluency level to hold an entire meeting/ interview in Japanese) to go over the expected responsibilities of my position and I’m sure pay and other stuff.

I have experience of 3 years of CSCI Engineering and have done well in all my classes. The core of my interest was based on c++ and c and then some in python. 

Since I came to japan last fall as a international student, I slacked off on programming and started working only on my japanese so I forgot not a ton but specific little things of the languages I knew how to program well in.

Lately I’ve been doing leetcode and reading a JavaScript and core concepts of object oriented language textbook to go back over things and refresh my memory. (I still am pretty competent in python and I’d rather pick up a dynamic language like JS than go back over c++ which I don’t see myself using much in the near future...)

Now, the QUESTION I got for you guys is this:
This company asked if I could do matlab, which I do have 50 hours or so on and I told them that is all I had and it was based solely on a linear algebra class... but I am very nervous for this internship as I am the only foreigner in the Osaka headquarters and I am not too worried about Matlab but more about what might be expected of me at an actual internship in Japan...

Has anyone here had an internship/job in CSCI in japan who can tell me a little about how they do their training/ how they incorporate interns into the workflow/workload of their teams and overall your guys’ experience? I’m just very nervous!

Sorry for long read!

EDIT:
I should say also that I already know plenty about the culture, the working hours of most Japanese office workers etc... I’ve lived here a year and am friends with many Japanese graduate students who are working in these companies.

My question is how interns are incorporated into teams etc... in Japanese companies and for those experiences.

The horror stories and other things like “be ready to be overworked” are kinda untrue, it depends on the company nowadays. The Vice President of the company is who I’ve met with and he’s stated there’s no use of keigo, any extra formalities and/or expectations of staying here after work hours. They want to be modern and that’s a huge reason why I took the internship as well!

I still thank everyone for their responses :)"

TL;DR: Got a job offer after a week and one (admittedly extensive) web interview. Is it a bad sign?

I recently received my bachelor’s in computer science and have been searching for my first full-time gig. I’m in a good internship right now and am more than knowledgeable enough for an entry-level position.

Two weeks ago I heard back from an HR rep from one of the companies I’ve applied to asking to set up a short phone interview. I agreed, and the interview took about 30 minutes of last Tuesday afternoon.

The HR rep emailed me afterward to set up a video interview; since the company is in a city a couple of hours away, she didn’t want to make me drive the round trip. That interview was Thursday and was the whole nine yards: almost three hours long, coding and OOP practical tests, team lead and engineer participation, etc.

On Friday, the HR rep called me to offer me the job. The reason she gave for the speed of the process was that one of their lead engineers who participated in my interview would be out of the country the entire month of May and they wanted to get the hiring done with before then.

They seem like a good company, have good Glassdoor reviews, and are located close enough for me to stay in contact with friends and family.

The rapid interview process with no in-person meeting is the only weirdness, but hiring horror stories have made me nervous. Is this a red flag, or did I just get lucky?"

Although obviously 400k isn’t enough to retire, blockchain is way overhyped and I will need to find a real job at some point. 

I have 2 decent internships (not companies you would probably recognize but I have good refs and the work itself is fairly cutting edge), and a less than stellar academic resume. 

TLDR; how long of a break post graduation is acceptable to recruiters? Would it be better to lie and say I’m freelancing? (Which i have done to a limited extent)

 I am currently a freshman in a decent computer science program in the US and this past year I have really been trying to get any sort of job experience in the CS field by applying to dozens of paid/unpaid internships. My first semester grades have been really good and my second-semester grades seem to be following that pattern yet, I have been rejected by almost all of the positions I have applied to (I know this is normal for freshmen). 

I have found out through a family friend that she would be able to put in a recommendation for me to work as a paid IT intern for a large (but not tech oriented) company the summer, and that it would be very likely I would get the job. This seemed good at first but I was informed that the position would be 2 hours from my home. This may seem more of a personal predicament rather than a career one but I really wanted to find an internship somewhere near home so I would be able to catch up with friends/family that I rarely get to see due to distance. I do not know anyone in the state where the internship would be and would probably spend most of my day sheltered in an apartment browsing Reddit and playing video games. It seems if I get this internship I would only be able to spend a few weeks of the summer actually at home. Other than that my options are to commute or live near the job location. I am pretty sure my parents would be ok with paying for any living expenses and/or a car as our financial situation is secure and they want me to gain work experience, but I worry if the cost is even worth the experience. My last concern is whether or not getting an IT internship would help me get a future CS internship or if companies would look past it.

Hopefully this isn't a question where the answer is obvious and I haven't wasted anybody's time. Thanks ahead of time for any and all replies.

Edit* seems like I would be programming in this internship

891bop,1986,2018-04-02,"End User deletes $5,000 and asks us to pay up",DatIzzy,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/891bop/end_user_deletes_5000_and_asks_us_to_pay_up/,"**Inciting Incident**

*December, 20XX. Client is having an error message on their registers, caused by a corrupt file. This is solved by deleting a specific file, one that, by chance, stores offline credit card transactions! Since this is actual sales, it's important that a copy of this file be made in advance, just in case there are sales to replay. Due to timezone difference, time constraints, and the end-user not wanting to do a phone call, a brief back-and-forth discussion happens, ending thusly:*


&gt;$DatIzzy: ""Hey, so I know you're having $Issue again. I've emailed you the instructions on how to do this, though I'm sure you're familiar with all the other times we've done this. Please remember to copy that file onto a flash drive! Those are important sales information, and will be lost if a copy isn't made.""  
&gt;$Aurelia: ""There's nothing in the file anyway. I'll just delete it.""  
&gt;$DatIzzy: ""I'll need a copy of the file regardless, for record purposes.""

*March, 20XX+1. Sitting in a small meeting room, $DatIzzy is leaning back. His internship was almost up, and he had to deliver the unpleasant news that $HospitalChain was canceling their support contract with us. $BigCompany was still going to offer other services, but they effectively used us to test out the system that they insisted on, that was never deployed before them and no one deployed after. The thing was undocumented, unique, and not even the $DeploymentGuys had a solid idea of how to troubleshoot.*

*Which meant this was fun...*

&gt;$Coworker: ""Right. So, I've got a ticket for $Hospital. They're having some credit card reconciliation problems...""  
&gt;$Manager: ""Well, maybe $DatIzzy should look at it...""  
&gt;$DatIzzy: ""Coworker actually knows there stuff here. What I can say is that their POS' haven't sent out the sales. They've been having some trouble in the past with them, but they've stopped contacting us. What site is it, and when?""  
&gt;$Coworker: ""$SpecificLocation, back from December, and they say they're missing $5,000.""

-------------

**Context**

I work at $BigCompany, offering support for Point of Sales (POS) devices. We also end up supporting peripherals (scanners, scales, receipt printers, etc.) as well as related websites. However, I've managed to wiggle into credit card reconciliation, which makes me feel like a low-risk Sherlock Holmes. Back then, it's because there was a sort of a thrill to the chase, so-to-speak. Now... well, now it's because I can diagnose most issues at a glance, and be insufferable about it.

This is a tale from my early career in IT, around the 6-month mark. I still wore dress shirts, though had dropped the tie. I had dress shoes. I worked hard to get here, and I was gunning to be brought on full-time!

**The Cast**

$Me: $DatIzzy. Yours truly.  
$AU: $Aurelia, manager at two properties for $HospitalChain. Since they both had the same issue, they're just getting lumped together here.  
$MA: $Manager. Nice guy. Didn't entirely understand what I was doing, but knew to trust the people that were actually doing the jobs.

-------------

**The Issue**

Missing funds are a serious matter, but my group isn't responsible for making sure the field properly reconciles. At least, not anymore. Back at the time of the story, it was my job to reconcile for them as part of the troubleshooting process. At the time it was only about three month's worth of information, for two properties. The information collection process is, well, slow. First, I need to go to $ReportingWebsite to find out what the registers actually recorded day-by-day. Then, I need to go into $Program to see what was actually sent out. Finally, I need to go to $SettleWebsite to see what actually got sent to their bank. Between those three, I can manage to find some trends. If $Program has more or less money than $ReportingWebsite, then there was an issue with the registers for instance. If $ReportingWebsite and $Program are the same but $SettleWebsite is off, then either transactions were rejected (if short) or there might be duplicated transactions (if over). $ReportingWebsite takes the longest, due to some clunky UI, website instability, and that, to make sure I don't need to pull this information again, I save a copy of every day for each location. Needless to say, it took me most of the workweek to get this done, because, of course, I still have other issues to work on...

Lo and behold, they're missing... less than $5k, but close enough that I can excuse it being a shorthand. And I can pinpoint days as well. The problem with the high-level view, of course, is that it's high-level: I can pinpoint when the issues are, but not what the exact issue is for each day! So I dig in. This takes me about another day.

It's a full week after I've looked up all this information. I've got hundreds of reports saved, some text documents and others PDF's. I've got my spreadsheet looking... well, passable. I call $Aurelia.

&gt;$Me: ""Hi, this is $Me from $BigCompany. I'm calling in recards to $Ticket?""  
&gt;$AU: ""Oh, thank god! I've been waiting! So, you're going to write us a check, right?""  
&gt;$Me: ""We need to find out why the funds haven't transferred, first. Now, I can see that there are a number of offline transactions...""  
&gt;$AU: ""Our transactions are always online. We wouldn't take any offline!""  
*This is not an uncommon reaction. The term ""offline transaction"" does conjure up a certain scenario, but the truth of the matter is that it's a shorthand term. In reality, a transaction is taken in an offline state when the registers are offline, the credit card reader is offline, or when there are sufficient delays in communication.*  
&gt;$Me: ""As we've discussed before, your network isn't really up to snuff. Have you contacted $LocalIT to investigate the matter?""  
&gt;$AU: ""They said everything's fine! No problems. So, when can we expect the money?""  
&gt;$Me: ""Right, so there's a large number of offline transactions that make up almost the entirety of the loss. These don't seem to have been replayed...""  
&gt;$AU: *She sighs in annoyance, the sound of someone begrudgingly going with the flow to say ""I told you so"" later.* ""Fine. What do you need me to do?""

*A call is scheduled during their slow time, which, coincidentally, is when my day is almost over due to the timezone difference. Still, I'm more than happy to provide this service. Some extra effort getting this missing money will be a boon! I wasn't even thinking of what would happen if the sales got declined or, worse, if transactions actually made it through...*

&gt;$Me: ""ALright, now I just need you to follow $Step1, $Step2...""  
&gt;$AU: ""I've already done it. It's not there.""  
&gt;$Me: ""Not there? Huh, that's wei- Steps? Oooh, right, I provided you those steps!""  
&gt;$AU: ""Oh, you did?"" *Her voice, for once, warms up, as if appreciative.* ""Yeah, these worked great! Really helped us resolve our issue, since you guys took too long, and weren't fixing it anyway.""  
&gt;$Me: ""What other issues? Did you open tickets? Did you ever send in the copies of those files?""  
&gt;$AU: ""Oh, no, you guys always took so long. And they were always empty! So we just started deleting the files every day.""  
&gt;$Me: ""I... you... What?"" *Smoke comes out of $DatIzzy's ears. This would ruin his chance at a job! A good job! Not in a kitchen! A desk, and air conditioning, and a livable wage he could move out on!* ""We... we need to look at all of the registers. Period.""  
&gt;$AU: ""But this one-""  
&gt;$Me: ""Every. Single. Register.""

*Each property only had a couple of POS' each, so it was quick per site, with the major delay being the drive between the two. As it turns out, $Aurelia had indeed just been deleting the files. Now, that wasn't the end of the world, because instead of using compact flash memory and a modified version of an older windows like the rest of our POS', theirs had Windows 7 and an HDD. This meant that deleted items actually went to the Recycling Bin...*

&gt;$Me: ""So, is anything in there?""  
&gt;$AU: ""No! I didn't want those files corrupting anything else on my register!""

*Knowing this was a situation of one person's word against another's, $DatIzzy considered himself to be up a well-known creek without a paddle. The only way to get in front of this potential storm was to fess up, throwing myself at $Manager's mercy.*

&gt;$Me: ""Right. So, they were having $Problem, but they started to get impatient. I sent them written instructions on how to fix it, and gave them the $Warning. Instead of opening up new tickets, they handled it themselves. It also seems that they cleared their Recycling Bin, and since those files are deleted it means the only record has been wiped, so they can't recover their sales.""  
&gt;$MA: ""And they admitted this?""  
&gt;$Me: ""Er... yes, actually. I don't have it in writing, but-""  
*My manager calls $Aurelia up immediately. It runs through the same sort of conversation flow: we need our check, this is your fault, you need to rectify this...*  
&gt;$MA: ""So, $DatIzzy told me that you deleted those files and didn't send them to us. Is that correct?""  
&gt;$AU: ""Yes.""  
&gt;$MA: ""$DatIzzy also told me you didn't open tickets for those times. Is that correct?""  
&gt;$AU: *She's getting increasingly annoyed, wanting nothing to do with silly things like confirming details.* ""Yes!""  
&gt;$MA: ""And you didn't send those files into us to check them?""  
&gt;$AU: ""For the last time, **YES!**""  
&gt;$MA: ""Alright. So, we're going to close this ticket because we can't help you. You deleted those sales without informing us of the problem or letting us confirm, so we're afraid this is your responsibility.""  
*At this point, I was waved off as my manager's manager was brought into the fold, and a liaison, and I got to walk away only slightly less worried than I had been.*

--------------

**The Aftermath**

$Aurelia and $HospitalChain did continue to pester us to write them a check. The latter does make sense -- it was a $BigCompany employee that was the cause of them not getting their sales, although, to be honest, I'm not sure if they were given the full rundown or not. From $Aurelia's standpoint, I like to imagine that she was on the hook for it all. She kept opening tickets up in an attempt to get something done, but we simply referenced $Ticket and closed it out, stating that a decision had been made. It's bad enough that $BigCompany wasn't going to get its cut of those sales, but to write out a check for the missing funds on top of that would've still been worse.

I was ultimately brought on full-time as well. I don't know if this incident had anything to do with it. Honestly, I'd like to think that it was my hard work that brought me on. Though, this even did teach me a couple of important lessons at the end of my internship:  
1) An end-user armed with knowledge isn't always better.  
2) Keep everything documented.

I was considering setting my mind to getting java certified this summer and then applying for unpaid/paid internships. I’ve also considered doing a mix of self learning and then registering for a coding boot camp in the fall. If anyone has any advice for me I’d really appreciate it. I’m a much better self learner than a student, but I’m worried that I won’t be able to find a job.

I'm stuck deciding between the two and i have 48 hours to decide. The QA position is with a big company and the other a small to medium sized company with only a handful of developers. My near sighted goal is to be a rich applications web developer, would it then be a smart idea to jump right into the web development offer?

So now how do you tailor your resume to the job application when this is all you have done and you have nothing else you can add/change? Is the solution to do a project in each major technology (react, ios, android, java, etc) and put on your resume the projects most applicable to the job?

I had no trouble making friends in high school. In fact in my 12 years of grade school I never once had to try to make friends.  Friends came naturally, I fell into a group naturally.  

All my friends from high school then went to go live at 4 year colleges, and had no fucking problem making new friends because they're at school together, it's natural for them to be able to make friends in an environment like that

But me? I don't get those opportunities to make friends. I am so far away from an environment where I can make friends it's not even fucking funny.  After high school I stayed in the work force. I was already making good money as a barback/busser in high school, and after I graduated I got promoted to be a full time waiter.  It was nice, I was able to get a taste for supporting myself, paying rent, built some credit, bought a car.  But I was working all the time, 40-50 hours a week at times, and not by force, I just liked making money.  So I never had time to make new post-high school friends. 

And then working in the service industry just became too demanding.  I was constantly angry from the shitty customers, on top of the stress from just that industry in general. I was also now working as a bartender too so I would work 12pm-9pm as a waiter, then put on an apron and hop behind the bar till 4am.  It was not a healthy lifestyle despite the money being very good.  So I quit and decided to go school.  I had enough money to put me through school but not while living on my own so I moved to my parents house in Tenne-fucking-ssee.  So I move, and start attending college while living at my parents.  Great! I'm in college now, just like all my old friends! I should surely be making new friends now!

Except wait:  I commute an hour each way to school, I live in a very rural area now (30 minute drive just to get out of my town of nothingness), and I'm a fucking mid-atlantic kid living in a stars and bars redneck hellhole. 

Like fuck. 

I don't have any fucking opportunities to make friends in my life.  Since high school the closest thing I've had to a friend have been my coworkers and the classmates that I swap notes with at school.  If I lived at school it would be a lot easier to interact with my classmates outside of the classroom, but when I finish my classes, there's no reason for me to be at school because theres nothing to do, so I just go straight home.

And its not like I can go out and fucking find friends.  I've tried.

Going to a bar alone sucks.  You sit there and watch all the people that came with their friends get drunk and laugh and have a good time, while you suck down a beer and make pointless small talk with the bar tender.  Occasionally someone at the bar may strike up a conversation with you but thats about it.  

I have some hobbies I participate/have participated in to socialize and entertain my self but it usually is one of two scenarios

- The hobby is very fun but mostly attracts older people with jobs and families and this is their escape from that but they don't have time to do anything else

- The hobby attracts extremely toxic people (DnD, Gaming)

The 2nd one is the worst. I tried to join a DnD group, and it was just awful, when I played DnD in high school it was fun, we took it seriously and listened to the DM but we weren't afraid to have fun. These fucking people were way too serious about it.

And the gaming groups at my college I've tried to join were just awful. The first one was a fighting games club.  I'm pretty good at fighting games, but not near what these kids.  They were super rude to me when I played with them because I sucked compared to them.  Then I joined a general gaming club that I figured would attract more casual people.  I joined and it was one of the most dramatic groups of people I've ever been a part of.  They couldn't go a week without some members getting in some huge argument over nothing.  Like I just want to play video games and socialize.

So I still game but just by myself now like I always did

And its fucking annoying, not having friends is a HUGE red flag for people, like people just assume I'm so psycho when they find out my entire life for the past 5 years when I wasn't working/going to school is just me by myself on my fucking computer playing video games.  Thats been my entire life for the past 7 years.  Not by fucking choice, thats just all I have to fucking do.  

I can't call someone up to go downtown with me, I can't find some buddies to go to a concert that I really want to see, I can't take a fucking vacation to the beach, I can't even fucking DRINK without being looked down on.  The guy who drinks with his friends and gets wasted is alright cause he has friends but I drink by myself to just take my mind off this GRUELING FUCKING EXISTENCE and thats looked down upon.  

My ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE is just wake up, go to school, come home, say hi to my parents, do my fucking homework, and then drink and smoke weed so I can be numb and content with this GOD DAMN BORING FUCKING LIFE

SORRY I DIDN'T FUCKING GET PUT INTO A FUCKING SITUATION WHERE I CAN EASILY MAKE FRIENDS, LIFE.  

Like seriously, what the fuck is wrong with me

In 2 fucking semesters I'm about to finish my degree, I start my internship this fucking summer. I'm about to step into a well paying job after school, where I'll be able to buy a house, nice car, etc.  and yet I still don't have a single fucking person I can call a friend.  Whats the fucking point of having all that shit if I don't have friends.  The only fucking difference this makes in my life is now instead of being bored and depressed in my parents basement, I can be bored and depressed in my nice house after I get home from my nice job.  That just sounds fucking miserable.  

Just fuck off life, you torture me enough with this BULLSHIT"

I've been coding since middle school and have years of experience building broad skills in every tech that intrigued me. I can do stuff from building apps front-end to back-end, developing games, VR shit, robotic software, websites or webapps, etc.



Since I've no internship to prove my worth, should I start up an idea or attend a boot camp, stay in school and finish coursework, get certifications or etc?
I obviously learn new tech constantly regardless of whether I have school or work. I'm sort of socially awkward and usually just spend all my down time coding anyway.

I hope that you can give me some wisdom and advice:

I'm 22 years old and a Student living in Belgium
Over the course of the last year, i feel that i've been bumping into a few brick walls. I've allowed myself to slip into some kind of procastination attitude that has led me to feeling bad/stressed because i often have many things to do whilst still prefering to surf on the net/ read or make up games and stories... 

It has led me to fall behind on graduating (Have to re do an internship), getting my drivers license (making progress on that one) and I'm guessing it's also one of the reasons why my ex girlfriend left me. This did also have a great impact on my mood.
Right now, i just feel that i can't do anything right, I'm motivated to get my degree but i just want to get through as fast as possible. 

As for being single again... this was my first real relationship, We were together for 2,5 years during which she lived with me and my folks for a year so she wouldn't have to travel 2 hours a day to attend college. We never had any real fights, often preferring to talk things out even if it meant talking for hours. When we broke up she told me that i'd never given her any reason to leave me (never cheated, hit her, ...) but many amounts of small frustrations undermined her feelings for me until they were gone. 

Nowadays i often feel frustrated and lonely (especially after living together with a GF)... I have lots of friends but i don't like to complain to them... i don't want to bother them with my feelings. Yet there are times when i'm feeling like an emotional wreck... I know that i shouldn't give up, that i shouldn't be seeking a new GF everywhere (If i feel that things wouldn't last wouldn't last, i immediatly stop seeing someone as a potential partner. Figuring this would be counterproductive on the long run. However it sometimes feels like forcing me through a tougher time than it should be)

Sorry for the long post... I guess my core question would be: how can i deal with these short term periods of sadness/loneliness?

Thanks in advance

I recently accepted a full-time administrative support position at a well-known hospital. My start date is 4/16/18. I am also a part-time student in the middle of my Master's program.

I was so happy to finally get an offer after three months of applications and interviews, but I have just had two more internship interview offers and a chance to interview for a full-time position that I feel I am vastly underqualified for at an IT company.

Both internships are part-time in the summer, so it's definitely possible that I could work my way around that, but I'm not 100% sure of the logistics. All I know is that I'm not taking summer courses, but would a part-time internship really be feasible alongside a 9-5 workweek if they want any more than 15 hours or so? Furthermore, both internships stress the IT side of things and data analytics, which I am interested in but have little experience with. 

As for the other full-time position, the salary would be better and the training seems extensive since there's a process for obtaining certifications, but other than that the benefits are pretty similar to the job I'm about to start, so...is it even worth it to go to the interview or do I decline? If so, is there any way to word the email to indicate that I have already accepted a job offer elsewhere but would be interested in hearing about potential positions that suit me? Or is that generally frowned upon?

Any answers would help, sorry I asked 50 questions in this."

89631z,15,2018-04-02,TIFU by convincing my friend's girlfriend that he's cheating on her with an intern,Troutcandy,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/89631z/tifu_by_convincing_my_friends_girlfriend_that_hes/,"This didn't happen today but last Thursday. One of my uni friends and I have been working at the same company for a couple of months now. For the sake of this post, let's call him John. To make our workdays more fun, we sometimes play common office pranks on each other, such as sending an embarrassing email from the other's account or 'accidentally' leaving a phone in the office kitchen with an awkward lock-screen wallpaper. Last week, John's pranks got a bit more extreme, making me start planning my revenge.

To celebrate the start of the long Easter weekend, I asked a couple of colleagues to go out for a beer after work. Obviously, I also invited John and his girlfriend, who I have known for years. Let's call her Jane. I had planned to make this night as uncomfortable as possible for him with the help of one of the female interns. She was excited to participate in a harmless prank as she knew that John and I are good friends.

At the pub, John and Jane arrived early (as planned) and we started chatting. After about half an hour, my accomplice enters and heads directly to our table. Before she could say anything, I immediately introduced her to our small group and stressed that John was here with his girlfriend. I tried to act nervously and made very obvious attempts to separate the intern from John. Jane immediately noticed my strange behaviour and was like: ""WTF are you doing? Who is she?"". As John was still confused by the whole situation, I just started laughing and told her that it was a silly attempt to make John feel awkward and that she was a random intern who wasn't in on the joke.

After the first success, we continued with our plan. The intern joined our little group and started to talk about her experience working at the company and how great a mentor John is (she doesn't even work in his team). I could see how John got uncomfortable with the slightly over-the-top compliments and Jane was starting to question the whole situation. Obviously, the compliments were all professional as I didn't want to ask the intern to flirt or do anything remotely sexual (no need to get HR involved). So, to get Jane suspicious, I shared with the intern a few intimate details about John that he certainly wouldn't tell a regular intern (e.g., the first holiday with Jane, his brother's recent wedding, his secret addiction to chick flicks). To make it more incriminating, I replaced Jane's name with the name of John's sister. The intern was able to bring up all these points and John, who was already slightly drunk, was confused how and when he told all these details. Jane got more and more irritated especially when she noticed that in his stories John apparently replaced her with his sister. After an hour, she snapped and pulled John out of the pub demanding answers from him.

At this point, I noticed that my joke might have gone a bit too far as I only wanted to create an awkward social situation. I honestly was surprised that at no point he tried to stop the intern and noticed that I had to be the one behind it. So the intern and I followed them outside and explained everything. While John looked relieved and seemed to get the joke, Jane just got angrier and accused me of trying to cover up for John. After then she quickly left alone crying.

On Saturday, it was the first time I heard back from John after the incident. Luckily, he was able to convince Jane that it was all a stupid joke and that he did not cheat on her. Unfortunately, they both appear to be super pissed at me and do not want to see me or accept my apologies. I guess, tomorrow, is going to be an awkward workday.

TL;DR As a joke, I tried to make my friend feel uncomfortable by making his girlfriend slightly jealous of an intern. The intern was too convincing and made her believe my friend was cheating on her. Now, both are angry at me and don't want to speak to me anymore.

**Update: I am surprised how critical some of your comments are. While I agree that it was a stupid joke that went a bit too far, I also want to point out that it was never my intention to convince Jane that John was cheating on her. Some of the facts that were mentioned were so detailed that I expected John to figure it out after a few minutes. Anyhow, I talked to John today, and he accepted my apology and offer to pay for a romantic dinner. Now I'm wondering if it would be funny to invite the intern secretly (just kidding).** "

I was admitted to Cal Poly for CS and it would cost about 34k a year. My parents can cover that fully with no debt. They can only cover Berkeley for 2 years fully. I'll have to get internships and attempt to cover the 3rd year, but I'll probably only be able to scrape up around 30k. So best case scenario I'm looking at 90k of debt for a Berkeley CS degree.

Is Berkeley worth it over Cal Poly? Both are great schools obviously but I've wanted to go to Berkeley since I was very young and it's renowned across the world. I'm also OOS, in case that wasn't clear. "

However, I had a talk with my parents who are helping me pay, and they said over the last year I've accumulated $30k in debt (an inflated figure, probably closer to $20k, but that's what they said). 

I just don't feel like the education I'm receiving is quite worth that much, especially compared to online courses I could pursue with a much more concentrated focus towards what I'd actually use in my career ([specifically I'd take this course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala), I already know Scala for the most part but I'd like a proper education in it).  

In my regular courses I'm taking, I'm not learning very much. Not because it's bad content or poorly taught, it's just not at the level I'm at right now. (currently have a 102% in CS 240). 

However, I am doing an independent study with one of my professors from last semester on blockchain technology / cryptocurrencies. I have learned a lot from that, and it's a nice connection to have. 

Over the summer I'm staying at my friends place with him in New York City, where I'm planning on getting an internship (I live in the middle of nowhere, no opportunities by me), and I'm planning on going back to school next year. After that I'm not sure though, I genuinely want to stay, I'm having a great time at college, but online alternatives seem to make so much more sense."

I’m a sophomore taking 5 science/technical classes, and I’m trying my best in each one of them. I was really close to an A- in only one of the classes but that got screwed too (probably getting Bs or lower in the others). Here’s why: we have lab reports due for a certain chemistry course. We are expected to turn them in both online and a hard copy. My hard copy was fine but for the online copy, I ended up turning a draft version of it my mistake (I keep switching between the school computer and my own computer a lot while doing lab reports). The professor considers this plagiarism, and downright gave me a zero. This whole thing bumped down my grade by two grade points from an A- to a B. How can I convince the professor to atleast just grade my draft version instead of giving me a 0? Throughout my university experience, my professors have been extremely non-negotiable even on the simplest issues. 
I’m also going through a lot of personal issues right now and I’m just so sad about everything. 
I’ve already had a very rough semester with several all nighters, and haven’t had the best results. I feel like I’m just drowning in everything right now. I have no motivation left. I have reached a breaking point. I have also been applying to internships and not received any replies. I have quite terrible grades even in the past semester, but I thought I would turn it around this semester and show an upward trend, but all my efforts went in vain. I’m too stressed just thinking about finals that’s a month away. I’m really really scared my mental situation is going to affect my grades. Help!"

I'm looking to work for a production company as a creative producer. I most likely will have to begin as a production assistant / runner despite freelancing for 2 years on smaller projects. 

I've already worked in house at a boutique company producing videos for a year. Also been working as a videographer for the past year taking on any kind job. Wedding, Social Media, Corporate to pay the bills. 

Must have done over 25 jobs in 2017.

Worked on a couple short term contracts at other companies too. So I'd say I've made around $50-55K in the past two years working. However these jobs are quite small scale in comparison to the projects big production companies take on. 

AND. I don't have the connections I want and in the industry I'm trying to get into, you really need them. So for the jobs I want, the fact most of my work is quite scattered and with small businesses (mainly) it means I nearly invisible within the industry and have to cold call (which doesn't really work for this industry)

The thing is, I've heard from a few managers that they'd feel it was a bit weird if a prospective intern had reel or a decent portfolio (which I do). I'm just wondering how to steer my application in the way of not looking like I'm only there for the big name on the resume. "

Only downside is that it's in IT and i'm currently a 3rd year in computer science major. This company has huge connections, as everyone loves their internship program because it helps them gain connections with other people and companies. However the downside is that I'm going to be working in the IT field, along with that is the fact that the pay is going to be $23 an hour.

Now the tech health company is asking for an interview with me next week and based off of the reviews, if they ask you for an interview their basically offering you the job. This job is under the cyber security team which is what I'm really interested in. But, the only downside is that I don't have any cyber security experiences, maybe overthewire.com stuff, but that's it. On the plus side, this is the is maybe the second or third time that they've ever offered an internship as I've looked all over the internet for reviews about their internship program. Plus, its a $30 an hour internship in a field that I will really like and probably pursue if given the opportunity. Heres the downside, it's a big company, but based off of the reviews, and the new program that their offering, there is not a lot about connections or any reviews about internships or work life as an intern as I'm afraid of this. 

The distance from my place to either one is equal as they are both in the same business area.

Any advice? "

I have 12 months experience from an internship doing level 1 and level 2 work at big companies. 

I've put my resume out there but I'm getting lowball bites for minimum wage to be a helpdesk jockey. These jobs are pretty much just working for a giant IT company, hourly and no road to advance from what I see. Nothing against that but I'm looking to be happy and helpdesk made me super depressed.

So I don't know what I'm looking for. I like working with Linux. It's fun. Not many users use linux so I'm not sure what I'm doing. I have some savings so I can take another year off as I graduating to study.

But like what should I study? I have a CCNA book and a Security+ book.

If you ask me what kind of job I want, something relaxing and good culture that doesn't have a looming fear of people being fired everyday (my internships were toxic). Ideally something like a 9-5 with limited overtime. Again, the ideal but who knows maybe I can get lucky. 

Didn't like databases or SQL work. I don't get programming, some reason my brain doesn't click with it. Powershell was a nightmare to get through but maybe it was taught wrong. I'm interested in learning Python just to have in my back pocket but it's so hard to understand how it works. 

I don't know. Just looking for direction, what can I do to jumpstart my career and get out of the helpdesk section of indeed?  Alternatively, is there any project based self study? I literally have no clue what to do with a linux server or a windows server. I can just create a bunch of users in window sand have them sign in. That's it. I want to learn more but I have no idea where to start. Even on linux. Preferably with a how to guide as a fallback. "

I'm a second year CS student and I really am not interested in web dev. However most internships seem to always want HTML, CSS, JS, React, etc. I assume this is because interns are given web dev positions. Where could I find jobs that aren't web dev?

As an aside, my interests would be in lower level programming as I prefer C/C++. I'm also interested in ML, is there any kind of job that utilizes both C++ and ML? Because that would be a dream job of mine. If any of you has this kind of job, could you share your experiences?

TL;DR Thoughts about attending grad school for CS from a music performance undergrad with self-study of CS topics.


I’m a music performance student at one of the top conservatories in the US. My curriculum is mostly music oriented with some very non-rigorous liberal arts coursework. No math/science (although I’m looking to cross register at a nearby university to take CS courses). But my GPA is great (3.96).

Over the past year, I’ve become really interested in CS. It’s the end of my junior year, so it’s a bit late to change schools, especially since most of my credits wouldn’t transfer and would basically require me to restart school. 

On my own, I’ve become pretty proficient in Python, and am learning C and C++ on my own, as well as studying algorithms/data structures and working through a lot of concepts that a CS undergrad would learn (networking, databases, etc.) through MOOCs or textbooks.

I am currently working as a SE intern at a local startup as well, and my work mostly involves web scraping and basic database work. (Essentially I scrape real estate data, and qualifying properties are automatically sent out via email and stored in a database, and eventually I may transition into some more web dev work as well.)

I have a lot of free time to study on my own, so I think I should have a pretty strong CS foundation by the time I finish my undergrad, at least with respect to the topics I talked about above, plus I hope to brush up my math skills (having already done up to Calc 2 in high school and self-studying discrete math for CS). 

Basically, I feel like a CS degree will help get my foot in the door at a lot of places, especially through an alumni association since my school doesn’t have one. I could do a post-bacc, but most are really expensive/would take too long for what I think would be little benefit. It seems like a Master’s degree would be more beneficial since I would have the fundamentals under my belt.

With all that said, what are everyone’s thoughts on attending grad school, online (like Georgia Tech or UIllinois) or in person? Would I be qualified, and if not, what could I do to become qualified? What are my chances for admission? Is it even worth my time?

Thanks everyone!"

I have to share it with my coursemates soon so I need a way to get it from my Photo library to my PC or whatever cloud storage service.

89g1w1,8,2018-04-03,No SWE internship offers but managed to land one as a QA Engineer intern. Is it still better than some complex side projects?,ClickingMouse1234,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/89g1w1/no_swe_internship_offers_but_managed_to_land_one/,"Hello again /r/cscq,

I couldn't manage to land an offer on any SWE internship for this coming summer. As the title says, I received an offer as a QA Engineer Intern.

Not to bash on anyone, but I did testing as a part of a class assignment at my university, and I would say that I'm not too happy doing it. With all that said, if this intern position is still better than side projects, then I would absolutely take it. It's just that I don't want to be rejected when applying for SWE positions.

I did my bit of Google Search and found previous posts saying that I shouldn't put anything QA related if I want to avoid doing testing for the rest of my career, as switching out from QA to dev is very hard (but not impossible).


Also, I don't know if this makes a difference, but I will also be doing an accelerated MS program as I mentioned in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/86g64h/i_have_the_option_to_get_a_masters_degree_by/?st=jfjwyged&amp;sh=48ce6cd9). I've decided that I'm doing the Data Informatics MS program.

I have no previous internships and I will be graduating with my BS in Computer Science May 2019. I will finish the MS December 2019.

Given my current conditions, should I still accept this offer? If I'm applying for a Data related field, will a QA affect my career path as much as it would if I was applying for a SWE?

I know for a lot of employers if you have a BS in CS that's good enough, or if you have projects/experience, that's good. However, I didn't realize this early enough and I have no demonstrable projects.

I have educational experience in Java, Python, C, C#, SQL, R, basically everything related to GIS, and Good Coding Practices™. I've also been trying to teach myself HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

Basically, I'm trying to figure out if I can get a more general CS job out of college, and what kind of titles I should be looking for. I'd like at some point to do software or web development. I figure data analytics would be pretty transferable but I'm really not interested in that."
89g9uk,7,2018-04-03,slipping back into suicidal thoughts,AppropriateDingo,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/89g9uk/slipping_back_into_suicidal_thoughts/,"I'm not entirely sold on the idea yet, I would have to see just how bad my life is going to get first, but here's my story:

Growing up I didn't have too much to live for. I had a good family at home and grew up in a middle class environment, but that's where the good fortunes kinda ended. Not to belittle how great those are, because had I not had those aspects of my life growing up, I probably would be committed or dead right now. But the rest of the story goes like this: I got bullied a lot until high school. I was fat, eccentric, a bit effeminate, and a minority in a whitewashed town. It started off with targeting me and making me look like a fool, and I tried to kill myself when I was 11 because of it. It got worse over time. I've been called everything from the n-word to insults commonly used against Hispanics and Indians (I'm both), told to go back to my home country, and beat up because of my appearance. I was molested when I was 14 by a school bully who pulled my pants down so that my dick was hanging out, and then the following day proceeded to grope me. It made me really angry and sad, and I was scared to masturbate until I was 18. During and around this time, I started to become really inward and cold towards people, including my family, who I was very hostile and distant towards until I was 18.

Shortly thereafter, I began to figure out how to fit in with the kids that were making my life a living hell. I realized certain aspects of myself had to be pushed away, and certain behaviors had to be toned down or hidden. Interests as well, and I couldn't risk tainting my image by dating a girl who wasn't considered to be acceptable by my peer's standards, otherwise I'd be bullied again. But the girls that were everyone's desires weren't attracted to me, because I wasn't really high up there on the totem pole either looks wise or popularity wise. That didn't bother me, but what did bother me was that if I simply didn't want to get picked on, I had to literally live a life that did not allow me to be fundamentally human. I couldn't express myself at all, I had to monitor who I kept in my circle strictly, and dating was pretty much off the table. As a teenager, that was very destructive for me. I also tried to, and many minorities can relate to this, 'whiten up'. I tried 'acting white', identifying as white (I'm mixed race), and while I was never racist, I was very resentful of my ethnic background, which made me somewhat angry at my mother, who was the reason I was a POC. I had nobody to vent to about these frustrations, as I felt too distant from my parents, too distrusting of my peers, and my closest friends were dealing with far worse issues that I didn't want to burden them with. So I took them out online, being a 'troll' as it were. I made a fake persona that was a loose portrayal of my real life, and my biggest (pretty much my only) target was women, or myself. In my real life, I was respectful, timid, and pretty self-effacing around women, be it family, friends, or girls I was attracted to. But when I would talk with friends, and moreover, when I would talk online, I would absolutely shit on women. Every slur you could think of, mocking them, objectifying them, et al. I did this for three reasons: 1) The guys I wanted to fit in with, who were either bullying me or were friends with bullies, almost always behaved this way. Only one guy I know wasn't like this that was in that group. He was a good dude. 2) Besides being a minority, having 'feminine' interests (writing, art, fashion, music...) got me bullied a lot too. I was also shamed for having crushes to the point where I couldn't even admit to myself that I was attracted to girls. It made me hateful of anything feminine, and considering femininity was initially conceived as a way to stereotype womanhood, I hated women for being feminine. I saw them as my adversaries because what society had attributed to them I thought was inherent of them, and I knew that it made me get bullied. I couldn't stand them because of that. 3) After being molested, I was super insecure and withdrawn about my sexuality. I didn't masturbate, I didn't date, I only really had any remote romantic involvement with one girl in high school and that was just conversational and a meetup once. I hated the fact that I felt sexual attraction to girls, because it made me feel helpless and vulnerable, like the time when I got molested. So I was resentful of those feelings, and lashed out in private about women. Icing on the cake was that I didn't really know what feminism was, so I assumed ignorantly that it was just women blindly hating men. So I would wreak havoc online with insulting women. Never directed at a particular woman, sent to a woman, or about a woman, but just blind insults to women in general. I would piss people off, and I ended up going completely fucking insane with this persona. It became like a Mr. Hyde for me. By day I was mild mannered, quiet, and genuinely decent to people, but all of my insecurities and anger were released into this ugly capsule. I also tried killing myself when I was 17, and the only reason I survived was because I didn't cut myself deep enough. I bled out for 11 minute profusely. I soaked through an entire roll of toilet paper, a gym bag I had, and a few towels. It was absolutely terrifying. I was getting really bad dry mouth towards the end, and I felt like I was going to pass out. Had I not stopped bleeding then, I would have probably needed to go to the hospital. My parents, who had been throwing me in and out of therapy, assuming I had something wrong even though I kept it hidden by being hateful and withdrawn towards them, never found this out. I vehemently denied it, saying my cat scratched me, and eventually they gave up trying to figure it out. I knew that if they found out what I did, I'd be doped up on meds and potentially put away in a mental hospital. I knew I had no chemical imbalances, my surroundings were just driving me insane. I had derealization syndrome, I was having a hard time sleeping, and panic attacks were regular occurrences. I was snapping, but I knew it wasn't a chemical problem. If they started doping me up and locking me away like I was insane, then I would turn insane, and I'd be a victim of my circumstances completely.

And then I went to college.

As I was graduating high school, I made a point of losing weight. I didn't care about my looks, I didn't care about what people said about me (and even when I was in high school and relatively popular, people chimed in about my minority status and weight a lot), I just wanted to get fit. I was ridiculously out of shape, and although I was strong due to working out, you wouldn't know it because I was a slob. I lost a lot of weight, and put a lot of muscle on, around the last month of school was when I had mostly evened out. I lost a little more weight over the summer, and I moved into college.

In high school, I didn't really pay attention to girls. I was very on edge about being at all vulnerable, so I was voluntarily withdrawn from dating. Even when I was fat though, a good amount of girls had found me attractive. Mostly creepy ones who stalked me or obsessed over me, but at least it was something. When I got to college, I had come to terms with that I wasn't a good looking guy. I was just not what women wanted, both as a person and with my looks. I was content with this, accepting of it, and found comfort in it. I set my expectations realistically, and kept to myself. But, apparently, I found out I was actually pretty hot once I got in shape. Girls who I never even fathomed would ever find me attractive were losing their minds over me, dozens of them. I was told I should go into porn once, and I did a modeling shoot with a friend. It was kind of surreal. It also led to me getting sexually assaulted, and meeting a lot of girls who although attracted to me, treated me like crap. I withdrew inward, but my bitterness towards women was declining. I had become more accepted for who I was at college, and the progressive nature towards gender dynamics that colleges can foster made me more comfortable to be myself. I was still really down on myself because of my personality however.

The nail in the coffin for my misogyny, and the beginnings of me losing my self-hatred, was when I took this random class by an exceptional professor that ended up being about racism and sexism. Prior to this class, I had, despite racist insults, convinced myself I was white. I was still pretty iffy about feminism, but I had greatly toned down the outright hatefulness I used to express online, and even sympathized with a good bit of modern feminism. But when I took this class, and saw the facts presented to me about these things, I realized I was never white at all despite being a light-skinned person, and that feminism not only benefited women, but it REALLY benefits men. Especially for a guy like me, who wasn't really a stereotypical male, feminism stood up for guys like me to express themselves, as well as demanding equity for women. I completely dropped being sexist after that, whether online, in real life, or in jest. It was a learning process to unlearn that stuff, but I got there. And slowly but surely, I ended up becoming more comfortable, caring, accepting, and even loving of myself. Appreciative of who I was. Honestly, it was incredible how much getting in shape, actually interacting with women, and learning about women's issues changed my perception of things. I realized just how disgusting sexism was, and how even as a joke, it was really shitty to behave in a sexist way. I wouldn't say I'm a feminist, only because I think I may have waived the ability to be one in the days of my youth, but I absolutely agree with their sentiments.

Fast forward to my senior year. I'm about to wrap it up. Based off of what I previously wrote, you'd think I had a good directional change for my life path, and was ready to start life anew. Well, that didn't happen. I chose a major that I was best suited for, which was communications, specifically advertising. I did well in college, I have internship experience, was involved at school, et cetera. But I realized that the field I'm qualified to work in via this degree raises major ethical concerns for me, particularly regarding privacy. These were concerns I was also unaware of until it was too late into the major track for me to switch, unless I wanted to stay an extra year, which I do not have the economic means for. The corporate environment for advertising is known for its sexism and racism, which I refuse to tolerate at my workspace, but I also will have to be tethered to social media, and be involved with big data collection. Ever since I was in high school I was up to date with the hideous things the American government, and other world governments, do to enforce digital surveillance without or knowledge. I am vehemently against it, and given recent leaks about social media surveillance, stuff I've learned in my advertising classes about it, and the most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal on Facebook, I've withdrawn from social media completely. I haven't been removed from social media in eight years, now I'm completely off. I also refuse to engage in practices, or be a part of a direct process, of obtaining, deciphering, or using big data to construct essentially artificial digital worlds for people via rigged advertising and selective searches. Couple this with demanding, erratic hours, and potentially having to be international at random times at a moment's notice, and the corporate level of what I'm qualified to work in does not look like the job for me. Problem is, the nonprofit sector of what I'm studying pays so little I would be better off working a full-time retail position at or around minimum wage. Elsewhere in comm, I either lack the qualifications to go into it (broadcasting), it is relatively as corrupt (public relations), or the corporate environment and pay is even worse (journalism). So at the moment, and in the foreseeable future, I'm fucked. I'm applying to jobs in New York City, where I attend school, and could probably shack up with a friend (splitting rent and utilities obviously) if I can get a solid blue collar job. But if I don't find that, and that's definitely not a guarantee, I will have to move back home. Networking and job opportunities are scarce, as it is in an outdated little town, and again, the racist bullshit is everywhere. And the sexism. Quite frankly, when I'm there for too long it triggers old feelings of sadness and self-hate. It's not healthy for me to be back there, and if I'm stuck in that town, I may end up being there forever. I'm also single, and the loneliness is getting to me (I've got a decidedly small circle at school, and we're all very busy right now as seniors, so I'm alone a lot. It's hard to fall asleep sometimes because of it). I don't like most of the women where I grew up, and I have little desire to try dating where I'm from. I don't date white women as a personal choice of preservation for my ethnic roots, so it's very hard to find POC women where I'm from, let alone ones who I am compatible with. There's little in the way of socializing, and most of the people where I'm from are considerably older than me. Having no job, or a part time job that I could have gotten in high school, in a hometown that ends up being taxing on my mental health to live in, all alone, and with no change in sight, will definitely not yield positive results for me.

The linchpin for the suicidal desires comes in the form of pursuing a passion of mine. Since I was 10, I rapped. I did it to escape my everyday problems. I quit it upon attempting to kill myself for the last time in high school, and stopped rapping for five years. As my life has been spinning out of control recently due to my impending graduation and bleak outlook, I've gotten back into rapping, and taught myself how to produce. Turns out, the stuff is coming out pretty damn good. A few very small time bloggers have checked it out (who don't know me personally and regularly shit on people who show them music, so they're not sycophants), and my friends and family, and on all fronts I get notably positive reception. There's even, it's incredibly small but it's existent, anticipation for a project I'm going to put out. All well and good, but the problem is my digital past. The insensitive shit I used to say as a kid online. I also aired out some family grievances online, with less than ideal language, and although I've taken measures to delete the stuff, nothing disappears from the Internet, and it will eventually come to light. I also used to say I was white on occasion online, before I really understood my mixed race identity. I never said anything racist online, but I would also look ridiculous talking about racism from a firsthand experience if I claimed I was white, even though I'm not white. My music is about political themes such as this, and people will shit on me and think I'm a walking contradiction once this stuff is exposed. I'll be bounced out of hip-hop, and then I won't be employable, and my family will think less of me, so I'll spin out of control. My entire life will be marred by the things I said in a time of deep hurt, ignorance, and nihilistic rage as a teenager, because although I may grow and change, that past is permanent via the Internet. My one shot to potentially live out a childhood dream and escaping my current situation has effectively been killed. Even if the music never blew up enough for me to make a full-time living off of it, if it blew up at all, and people connected the dots, I'd be exposed, and the damage would be done. My ethics and fear of technocracy have led me away from pursuing a job with my major. I'm left with essentially nothing to live for, and was thrown into this situation partly of my doing, but absolutely as a reaction to my circumstances. I feel completely hopeless, and that all of my personal initiatives to better myself and change my life were pointless. I feel that if I just killed myself years ago, the disappointment that will be my adult life, and the suffocation of most likely spending the rest of my days in my hometown that hates people like me, would have been avoided. As well as the loneliness. If it gets as bad as I think it is going to get upon graduation, by this time next year I will not be alive. "

I graduate in May with a bachelors degree. 
I have no idea what to do after I graduate. 
I attended Clemson for 2 years, majoring in Engineering. It interested me, but I didn’t see any career paths I wanted to pursue. 
I have a few ideas about what sort of career I want, but they are all completely different from one another and I don’t know how to gain experience in them to decide.
Please let me know if my understanding of any of these is incorrect. I have done research but it is hard to gauge an understanding without experiencing it. Hence, my dilemma. 
I know I have to attend grad school for pretty much all of these. I’m definitely going to have to take a gap year to figure it out.

My ideas are:

Engineering Psychology
Pros: 
- It’s a logical choice, given my interest in engineering AND psychology
- Growing field with decent to high salary
- I am logical and can easily point out ways to make things easier for the consumer to use
Cons:
- I CANNOT find a way to gain experience in this whatsoever and FSU does not have any I/O psych professors to speak to
- I don’t know how much engineering is involved - I like the concept of telling people to fix something or how to make something better more than figuring out the logistics behind it

Victim Advocacy
Pros:
- I want to victims to understand they have resources and people to help
- It just seems interesting 
Cons:
- I have a habit of judging people and find it hard to disguise it (why therapy is not on this list)
- It just seems interesting - nothing really stands out

Sexual Behavior
Pros:
- I’m  a huge advocate for comprehensive sex ed
- I like seeing people react when they learn something they “wish they learned in middle/high school”
- I am interested in how sex influences behavior
Cons:
- From a psychological/criminological perspective, the job is mostly research based
- Not sure of particular jobs with this

Forensic/Criminal Psychology
Pros:
- Utilizes my current majors
- Criminal behavior fascinates me
- I like things like Criminal Minds and Hannibal (though I understand they aren’t very representative, but the concept interests me)
Cons:
- I don’t want to be involved in law enforcement (being a detective, field officer, etc)
- I don’t know of the specific jobs in this (other than the FBI, which I am probably not qualified for)

Engineering Psychology AND Sexual Behavior
One specific idea I have come up with is applying engineering psychology to sexual behavior by working to make contraceptives and/or sex toys easier to use/understand and more effective
Pros:
- REALLY interests me
- Obvious benefits of “testing” products
- Combines 2 of my previous interests
Cons:
- How the fuck would I even be able to do this
- Is there a market???
- Possible stigmas associated and how family would react (not particularly important, but still a factor)


Aside from my issue of not knowing what to do, I also don’t know how. I haven’t had much job experience and no research experience. My only job has been at Jimmy John’s, which clearly doesn’t relate to these. I haven’t had any internships either. Everyone emphasized school and getting good grades so that’s what I focused on (current GPA of 3.2ish which isn’t even particularly /great/). I also had mental and family issues throughout college which hindered that. Now it’s clear that people want experience and for you to have had a balance of work and school. So now I feel like I’m figuring this out too late and I’m fucked.

Sorry for a long post, I just don’t know what to do once I graduate. I’d really appreciate any advice/input on my situation or the career paths I listed. "

I've been put on a 30 day PIP and, from reading what I've read here, I know I won't beat it.

Some background about me: Went to a no-name state university and had 2 internships. Technically my job titles at those internships were not ""SE Intern"" but I did a lot of coding and got compensated decently (about 3 - 4k monthly). I graduated in May 2017, before which I got an offer for SWE at a startup in NYC paying me $105k salary.

But as the title states, I got put on a PIP today and I'm in a shock right now. I've been here for only 11 months and did not see this coming. Obviously my main priority right now is to review CTCI and LeetCode and find a different job, which I plan spending 100% of my time doing, but I'm not really sure I can make it before I get booted, given the extreme competitiveness of junior SWE roles in NYC.

Does anyone have some tips? I'm in a state of panic right now and would very much appreciate some advice.

Thank you all."

Is there anything special I should study or prepare to answer?  Thanks!

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: I have been DM'ed multiple times already how I landed to MS internships so I will answer it here:

&amp;nbsp;

 I will start off by saying I was born and raised in Silicon Valley and focus heavily in the technology sector, specifically computer hardware.  I know it might sound cliche mimic'ing Warrant Buffett, but the circle of competence is incredibly important.  Living in Silicon Valley I gained a great fundamental understanding of my ever-expanding little circle which benefited me greatly and gave me a huge leg up on other applicants.  All that being said, I self taught myself a lot through CC, Investopedia is your friend.  I learned a respectable amount of Fundamental, Technical, and Quantitative analysis.  I also taught myself how to make a proper stock/sector report, how to diversify a portfolio, etc. etc. 

&amp;nbsp;

 With all that in mind, the first internship application required a stock report and I did really well on it.  When I got to the in person interviews I had a few tech stocks with all relevant information memorized (i.e. Upcoming products, how their competitors were doing, How the tech sector was doing, what inside the sector was pushing the sector up the most, P/E ratios, market cap, did they beat earnings, etc.) . This landed me the first internship.  During the first internship I won a paper trading competition, beating out all other interns with an ROI of 30% in 3 months.  This got me personally invited by the Senior VP running the internship to intern again in Global Wealth Management. "

I'm worried that two internships I listed on my resume won't be able to be verified:

The first internship I listed is at a research lab in my school's CS department. The thing is, my school doesn't call it an internship but instead an ""advanced project in computer science"". I'm working for two semesters on a real-world project in the research lab, outside of classes, so when I was writing my resume it didn't seem like it was stretching the truth to label it an internship and put it under the experience section. But it is not, in fact, regarded by my school as an internship but as a ""project"" that gives graduate credit towards my degree.

The second internship was a virtual unpaid internship that I took because I was unable to find a real internship last summer. The problem with this one is that it was at a small company and the guy who ran it is totally unreachable now. As it was unpaid and virtual, I doubt there were any sort of records kept.

Other than that everything else on my resume is verifiably true and I have no criminal history or bad credit or anything like that. Do you think I should be concerned? If so, what can I do if the background check fails?"

So this will be a bit long winded, but I'll make sure not to go off on a tangent

For the past 2 and a half years I've been studying like a demon to gain certifications so I can prove I can work in IT and to hopefully move into a sysadmin position.


Recently, I've been applying for various jobs and whenever I get into an interview, they all focus on my lack of experience. I worked in a Computer Repair shop when I was younger and in Tech Support for businesses for a Broadband + Content provider (Intentionally keeping company names out to not break any posting rules)


These roles lasted a total of 21 months before I took my current role as a chef which I've been in for the last few years. During this time, I've taken night classes and have been studying in my own time and have been fortunate enough to gain the following certifications:

* Certified Fire Marshal (Not IT based but mentioning it just in case)
* Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician (CCENT)
* Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)
* Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate  (MCSA)
* Computing Technology Industry Association A+ (CompTIA A+) 


All of these certs are currently valid and were gained through Pearson VUE with the exception of the Fire Marshal. And yes I know I used the full titles when I could have used the abbreviations, I just prefer to be clear.



Anyway back to the main point, I keep getting turned down for jobs as I dont have much practical work experience in the IT field (most jobs in my area are asking minimum 3 years). I've been informed in interviews or in declined emails that I dont have enough 'Day to day experience working with this technology'.


What can I do (aside from taking internships) to gain the level of experience needed to break back into IT work? Any advice or feedback would be appreciated :)

EDIT: I also have a Bachelors Degree in Business however that was gained more than 5 years ago."

I didn't go to a well known school or anything (wasn't really a school person).

I've applied for some jobs and had a second internship with a public sector organization. Unfortunately, I did not get selected for a full-time position there.

I have been professionally freelancing in web development since 2012. I was a writing tutor in college and even redesigned their website. The director there liked my work and connected me with an association. If I am selected, I should have 3-4 months of steady and somewhat decent paying work redesigning their site. Afterwards, I might be maintaining the site and maybe even build out a custom member management system for them.

Most of the work I have been doing lately is boring me (content edits, etc.) but I suppose that's part of the job.

I used to love working on web projects but lately feel bored with it. Does this mean I just need a break? Could freelancing be the reason for my boredom?

I am also really interested in telecom but not sure how to go into that field and if my CS degree will work.

I think I can manage one semester (maybe two, if I really stretch it) using what I'll earn this summer plus my parents' contribution.

Additionally, I can't work in the industry for more than 9 months in total and I've already used 3 last year and plan to use the other 6 in my remaining internships.

89l9rc,4,2018-04-03,Should I ask for a written offer?,lemonylime7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/89l9rc/should_i_ask_for_a_written_offer/,"I'm a college senior, graduating this May. My manager at my summer internship referred me to this small company (~50 people) and I've been talking with the CEO since November. Since phone call 1, he's expressed sincere interest in hiring me and told me to keep in touch. Our latest phone call (last week), he offered me a job verbally and told me we can talk more details about the offer, like salary, start date, location, benefits, etc in May. 

I'd like a written offer so I can see all of the details. However, because this was a rather informal process (never really ""interviewed"", just had a series of casual phone calls with him), and because I was referred to him by my manager (so I know he is trustworthy and him and my manager knowing each other well in a good professional working relationship gives a sense of accountability), I don't want to overstep. In addition, I'm worried he'll give me an offer and then expect a yes/no decision when right now, I don't have any other offers.

I have been interviewing at different companies and I was thinking that *if* I get an offer from another company, I could then email this CEO and ask for a written offer so I could see which company is the best fit for me and make an informed decision. Logical right? (Also, having multiple offers can give me leverage.)

But if I don't get another offer... I would simply have to wait until May and email him right?

What are your thoughts? As of now, I was thinking of waiting 2 weeks and seeing if I end up getting offers from the other companies. If yes, I'll email and ask for the written offer to compare. If no offer, I'll wait til late April or early May to ask for the offer.

(P.S. I don't think this company has an HR department.)

The system is based in SQL, but the language is called C/AL, which has PASCAL syntax. 

The language is very simple, but what took the longest was learning our software. My first 1-2 years was spent as the IT person/developer. I was working with our cloud solution, managing backups, installs, configuring our web solution etc. and doing C/AL development on the side.

I've had to write a few SQL scripts for simple things like backups, boot scripts, etc. I've made a few PowerShell scripts. I wouldn't say I'm an expert in either, but if with Google's help I can shoot you a script pretty quickly.

NAV is a table-based database software and I like working with databases, so that's something I wouldn't mind continuing to work with. Back in college we primarily used Java which I enjoyed. I'm just now jumping back into it by taking a class on Udemy.

I recently got thrown a Python course by a friend at another job. I've heard that Python developers are really in demand, but I'm still not sure how Python is used or what it's used for. The syntax does seem easy to read which many people have mentioned.

I did an internship in high school working for a website design company that worked with PHP and MySQL and this steered me from web development, at least on the PHP side. As I'm approaching year four, I'm looking for a career change that'll open up doors for me and actually make me feel like a *real* developer again.

Should I stick with the Java (and as I've been researching, Spring) or should I jump into the unknown of Python (of which I have no knowledge or experience)? Should I use both until I figure out which one I like the most?"

 I have a few questions on how really excel in the hunt to becoming a Wall Street Quant. 

My first question is what sort of data science/Math courses should i be looking to take? I cannot take classes within the business school so that knocks out most of the finance course I could take.

 I have/am currently) taking  all the basic  math major courses(right now I’m in linear algebra/calc 3). But the math major at my school is not a lot of credits at all, which leaves me a lot of room to take electives once I finish my last one or two requirements.  

Secondly, what internships look best when applying to grad school/post grad positions? My GPA is low atm, 3.09(major GPA 3.6) and I got into applying late for this summer, so it’s looking like I’m getting anything better than the sales internship I received an offer for.  

I have joined the quantitative fiannce club, learned python, sql ant matlab and began investing in stocks recently, if that makes any difference. 

I’d really appreciate and look forward to any responses towards any one of my questions. I love talking to people in the industry

&amp;nbsp;

My senior year of high school I worked my ass off to compensate for my poor grades in junior year, which were mostly due to personal issues involving my family. I was able to get the grades I wanted, but I was waitlisted at my dream, first choice school because my junior year math grade wasn't competitive enough. 

&amp;nbsp;

Because of this, my grandfather did everything in his power to help me get in. This included calling people he knew to try and get the school's admissions or whatever to be ""swayed"". I did not object because I was blinded by my extreme desire to get in. I appreciate his efforts, but it feels fake. Anywho, I ended up getting off of the waitlist, but I will never know if it was off of my own merits, or because of the people he talked to.

&amp;nbsp;

So now, I'm in the spring semester of my freshman year, and I needed to look for a summer job. Figuring I could try and get a headstart on everybody else, I decided to look for an internship. At around that time, my grandfather lets me know he knew someone who ran an engineering firm very close to where we lived and said he could inquire about opportunities there. It is now a couple months later, and earlier today I spoke to the VP of the firm, and I got the internship. 

&amp;nbsp;

It's wonderful, but I can't help having a sour taste in my mouth. There were no interview questions asked, I had 10 sample questions and responses typed up and ready, I had researched the company and expected a hard vetting process, and to be very competitive, because I'm only a freshman. There was nothing of substance, the man basically called me to tell me I got the job. 

&amp;nbsp;

Again, I can't help but feel guilty. I see posts on here all the time about people submitting *hundreds* of internship applications, to get none in return. I can only assume I was handed the offer because of my connection, and I feel like I don't deserve it. There are people that worked harder than me, met with companies, networked, applied, and still didn't get slapped with an offer. 

&amp;nbsp;

Am I being irrational? Or am I truly a privileged asshole of epic proportions? Thanks guys, 
&amp;nbsp;

So that's what I'm going to do, I'll work my ass off so that it wasn't a waste, and hopefully, I'll be able to help out the little guy sometime in the future. Thanks guys, it meant a lot &lt;3"

Most of the people I have heard of online have gone through some kind of campus connections to interviewers that I don’t have access to. Furthermore, what skill level do I need to be a competitive applicant? I will try to complete Cracking the Coding Interview and currently I do around 3-5 LeetCode problems per day.

Before voicing my concerns, a little bit about me: I did my undergrad from a private institute in India. I did a 6 month internship in my undergrad I don't know if that counts as experience. I took a year break after that. No internships or projects to show for the break year, just did a bit of programming at home (again, nothing to show for it) 

Concerns
1. I was introduced to Embedded System only pre final year of undergrad so I feel like one year of graduate study won't be enough to get me a job. (I've been working on improving my coding but I'm still not great at it and Embedded is a lot of coding.)
2. It's a one year course so there isn't even scope for internship (I'll have to pay the tuition again if I want to extend my stay to 1.5 years)
3. As of now I don't want to get a PhD but if I do someday then is it impossible (or super hard)
4. Will my year break look bad on my CV? Some people (my age) scared me about how employers see that as a big minus and paired with just one year of grad school. Am I screwed? 
5. I also got into UMass Amherst, ASU and Northeastern and hopefully will get into NCSU. Should I consider going to any of these over Cornell and Northwestern? (All MS) 
6. Does going to an Ivy League school really live up to Rory's college experience? :P I went to a shitty college here, and so campus and college life are huge factors for me.

Cost and weather aren't really a problem. Everything's expensive :P I'm only worried about whether or not I'll get a job after. 

TL;DR MEng at Cornell or MS at Northwestern. Don't want to get a PhD any time soon. "

My question is, should I be going for internships (higher liklihood of me landing them) that are potentially low paying? Or apply straight for full time positions which I am probably less likely to get but would have better monetary compensation?

I'm pretty lost on what sort of positions I should apply to.

89o86u,9,2018-04-04,Help me weigh up my options?,Voteformiles,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/89o86u/help_me_weigh_up_my_options/,"I'm 3.5 years through a 5 year Bachelors plus Masters program in EE. Just completed an internship in Analogue/Mixed Signal IC design, which went well, they kept me on part-time. Also, they said they'd sponsor my masters project if I do it with them, I.e. pay me for the hours I spend on research work for them. 

Working on my honours thesis at the moment in Quantum Computing. There's some good lead on work which they want me to do, and they're relatively loaded as far as academia goes, so they offered to sponsor a PhD pretty well. They wanted a masters, and I suspect they might be able to sponsor a master's project too, but haven't looked into it. 

I think the options look something like this:

1) IC design - stay on for the sponsored masters, and get hired on 80kish when I graduate. 

2) IC design - take the bachelors and run, get hired on 80kish when I graduate. 

3) Quantum Computing - stick around for the masters either with the IC design guys ($$$) or in QC (???), then do a PhD (45k tax free).

4) Quantum Computing - take the bachelors and go straight into a PhD (45k tax free)

I'm keen on both fields. Perhaps leaning a bit more towards quantum computing since it's so challenging and cutting edge. I don't care much for the PhD as a title or anything, but it's the best way into Quantum Computing for me. Earnings would most likely be supplemented a bit with teaching.

There is a bunch of course work in the masters I'd like to do, from the belief that investing in your own ability is the best investment you can make, but realise that if I've got other options, it's really not necessary.

What do you'll think? Thanks for reading if you've made it this far!"
89opih,37,2018-04-04,Committing to coding without excessive career options,The_Fatness,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/89opih/committing_to_coding_without_excessive_career/,"I apologize in advance for the length of my post, but I feel some background is needed to fully explain my situation. 

I completed my Associate's in Programming back in May, and have not pursued a Bachelor's in programming because we only have one college locally that offers four year degrees and it's roughly $40,000 a year in tuition. I decided to pursue a Bachelor's online in Management Information Systems and Business Analytics. I spent two years as a BA and figured an AAS in programming combined with those two years of experience would help me get back to BA work, I was wrong. 

I didn't have an internship in college and only did a capstone to make up for it. I spent five months looking for programming related work after graduating before giving up and taking the first job I could working in IT support for a bank. I do basically no coding work at all and haven't looked at or written code since about August of last year. 

At any given time, I just looked before making this post, there are 4-8 programming related jobs in my town. I've never looked at remote jobs because it feels pointless with only an AAS and no experience. I have a very overactive brain, my brain never turns off or stops, and always found that programming was a nice way to channel all that brain function because it gave something outside of real life stresses to focus on. 

Whenever I see anything programming related it makes me wish that I had taken it more seriously or tried harder to find an internship because I think that would be a better career path financially. My question is whether or not it is likely worth it to try and keep learning and refining my skills even though there are almost no jobs here at any given time for programming. I wouldn't know what languages to try and focus on, or spend time learning more in depth. Each job that pops up here is usually unique in what languages they want or what experience they expect and it's hard to commit to a specific language knowing that it may not be useful. It's hard to want to commit knowing that there's a real chance it won't pan out at all. 

I am really just looking for any advice about whether I should just forget about what I learned in college or try to pick it back up and hope something works out. I am making more than most of the entry-level coding jobs here, but won't get much higher than that in my current position. I am slated to finish my degree in May of next year, but want to make sure I am not missing out on an opportunity. I'm 30 now, and have only been coding for 2 years and feel like it may be too late to really begin a full career in development. 

Thanks in advance for any advice and thanks for taking the time to read my post.

I've enjoyed my (almost) decade teaching.  I've taught Physics, and most recently, Java-based intro programming to 9th graders.  Through that, I've discovered a love of computer science, and I'm thinking about transitioning into the field. 

However, I have no clue where to even begin.  Bootcamps, go back to school, learn on my own?  I don't even know what the right questions to ask myself are.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I am about to finish my degree and to find entry-level positions, but the job search and my qualifications due to my degree make me:

a)	doubt my value on the job market 
b)	doubt what a first job should be not too get limited right away

Background:
Msc (Research-focussed) in Cognitive Neuroscience
Most valuable skills:
Advanced Data Analysis in R, SPSS
Behavioural and Neuroscientific research methodology, Survey etc.
Excellent in Writing &amp; Presenting (I have won prizes for public speaking)


I do not want to stay in academia – that topic is pretty much over for me.

Ideally, I would like a role in which I help make tangible decisions using a data-driven approach. I enjoy conducting research, analyzing data and presenting them. I have really good communication and presentation skills, and I love working on challenging topics. I also would like to start working for a big/well-known firm to build both skills and reputation.

However, this is my problem:

I (assume to) have (significantly) more data, statistics &amp; statistical programming background than most people in business degrees, but are far from the skills of CS masters and/or data scientists. Jobs or internships that require either business knowledge (that I lack) or excellent data scientists skills (which I yet not have) reject me. I want to build technical skills, i.e. programming and data analysis, but I also do not want to become a data scientist and work 8h+ behind a PC. So I looked for positions that are less technical, like data analytics, but they often require (considerable) work experience unless they are at a tiny unknown firm. Also I would not want to start in HR positions, because they tend to lock you into HR. My biggest fear is to do a job that either locks me in or does not have enough reputation/teach skills that will let me progress into bigger firms later on.
I thought about consulting etc., but I am coming from a burnout and am nowhere near working 50-60h a week. I am very productive and ambitious, but right now I do 40h/week at best.

I would really appreciate advice regarding what positions, internships or general job description I should be looking out for.

Thanks so much!

After doing so, I have created a career path that seems as the best fit to where I can stay in the cs Field, make a comfortable living and not burn out. Feel free to comment on my career path and even tell me if I am heading in the complete wrong direction. 

Current Career Path: 

1st couple years out of College: Persure an entry level CS related position such as: SWE or Systems Engineer. (Also taking suggestions closely related to the two positions above)

3-4 Years into my entry position: Begin looking for a junior/ intermediate position.(Perferably one that may enable me to attend gradute school.) 

At this point in my career I would enjoy to attend graduate school to obtain an MBA which will allow me to move into the managerial side of CS. The reason for an MBA is because like I stated earlier, I do not see myself coding everyday and an MBA will allow me to obtain a position on the management team which may fit me better suiting my work and social style. Plus, I believe an MBA and technical experience may bring a pay raise which may allow me to live more comfortably.

My problem is I don't advance through these top tier company interview loops.  When I'm given feedback, it usually comes down to lack of technical skill. 

Most recently, I did an in person programming interview.  I actually solved the problem within the time limit.  I was able to correctly state the time complexity (Big O) of the algorithm I used and the space complexity of the data structure I used.

I accepted an offer to a software engineering internship that pays $1,500 per month. My working hours are from 9:00-5:30 and the internship is from May 20th to August 20th. I'm also in Maryland which has a minimum wage of $9.25 and there is a young worker minimum wage of $4.25. Maryland also has a law that states I must be paid semi-monthly

My hourly rate comes out at $8.14. I'm 19 and this is a 3 month so I think I'm only restricted to young worker minimum wage.

Some reasons I'm worried that minimum wage laws could be violated * I think I'm being paid monthly * I am working 42.5 hours a week without overtime * I might be under minimum wage

Could someone tell me if my current internship wage is legal?"

I am 30, about a year-year and a half away from a BS in Business Management and have worked retail, grocery specifically for my entire adult life in various roles, currently department manager with an option to move into store management whenever I want. About a year and a half ago I decided that I couldn't do that forever as there's just too much a sacrifice to outside work life and the industry change has eliminated any and all perks of working for them and is resulting in a net loss of easily 7-10k a year of lost overtime at minimum without going into store management. I really value a Monday-Friday daytime career. I've been trying to narrow down a path after completing my degree but it's becoming increasingly more difficult.

So, that's where you come in. My main strengths are being analytical, detail oriented, adaptable, very hard working, and generally a left-side brain oriented person. I do enjoy leading a team as their successes and failures are my own in the end. I thoroughly enjoy the aspects of my job that entertain those traits. My biggest weakness is the ability to sell. I don't think I'd ever be able to work in any type of sales atmosphere, whether it's selling a good or a service in general. My main objective in my career is solid pay(nothing extravagant maybe 55-65k annually), Monday-Friday, daytime position with a lot of stability. I have been looking into various analyst roles but am having trouble narrowing down my field of focus.

At this stage, I've built a life around my income and have financial obligations which require a minimum of ~36k a year so taking a pay cut to start at the bottom or internships aren't really an option. I live in a low cost of living area.

I've worked for the same company for pretty much my entire adult life and so moving upwards within is much easier than going abroad and from what I can tell, most of the roles I might be interested in require a significant amount of experience or nuanced expertise and without coming from within the company, seem difficult to achieve without. I'd really like to narrow down my field of focus and find a path to best execute in as little time as possible.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Position: CNBC.com Digital video product team
Duties: not set in stone; possible help on front end work, maybe datascience work. However, I could possibly be doing some competitor analysis/business related work.
Thoughts: New experience. Seems to be more digital product focused. It’s a Different opportunity in another industry but afraid there’s a possibility that the internship may not be as technical since my  project is not set in stone and I was not asked to do a technical interview.

Offer B: 

Company: Regeneron
Industry: pharmaceutical

Distance: 15 miles/ 30 mins to 45 mins. No toll
Position: Clinical Informatics intern
Duties: applying statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze patient health records
Thoughts: I Have worked in health field before but seems to be more technically focused since I had to  complete a coding problem during interview. 

Situation:
However despite all this, I have already accepted cnbc but have not signed their offer letter. Regeneron just came back to me today with the offer. I have until Friday to choose an internship basically where I would have to renege on CNBC if I were to choose regeneron. How bad would it be to renege on CNBC?

The next day, I received an email telling me I got the job, which made no sense but I was not complaining. It turned out that the email was meant for another person who applied for the internship with my EXACT SAME NAME, but they still want to interview me for another position. A contact I have on the show confirmed that there is actually another person with my name- so it’s fair to say the hiring manager is not the most professional. 

Although it was my first real interview, it went fantastically and the interviewer gave me a ton of positive feedback both as I was answering his questions and after the interview. I was told I would be contacted two days later, but I have not yet heard back, 7 days after the interview and 5 after I was told I’d hear. I sent a follow up email yesterday morning, and have not heard anything. 

I am conflicted because I have another interview opportunity on another television program of prominence, however it is not my first choice. I have been waiting on an answer from the first program, but I’m on the verge of missing out on the other internship.

So I guess I’m asking for advice on what to do here! I definitely don’t want to burn any bridges and keep these options open for the future!

My major was marketing but the marketing jobs I would most like involve skills that I don't specifically have like photoshop and video editing. (Would like to but can't handle more loans)

My recent job was a sales coordinator at a hotel. I left it to relocate back home. It was great experience and a lot of responsibility. My manager was supposed to write me a recommendation but is always too busy..

I've been looking for 4 months now so I'm almost ready to just take a couple part time jobs.. but I really need a real job! And I'm really hoping to finally find the job I'll stay in for years. I have tried a staffing agency for one job and never got any reply. I also emailed someone there who's name I got from my dad and they also never replied :/

I think a state, city or county job would be great. If I'm not mistaken those hopefully count as a public job for loan forgiveness?

Otherwise I don't know because I don't want to be pigeonholed into working at hotels (not great pay, don't want to do sales) or as an administrative assistant, but I feel like those are the only jobs I could easily get. I also do not want to be a customer service manager. So i guess I'm trying to see if anyone has suggestions for general jobs that I could get with my degree/experience that pay well.

from my past experience I would say:
As a sales coordinator, I had a bunch of different responsibilities. I didn't mind this. Sometimes I felt a lot of stress but that was mostly the position (being one person for the only manager in this area) I didn't mind the data entry, or being busy, or having to talk to clients, or communicate with many people I worked with. It was a good job and I was happy to be in an office lol but if I had a job where I might go places sometime that'd be cool. 

I had a bit of social media experience, which could be ok but it was a small company and not at all in an exciting area. This was a marketing assistant position. I also had a ""marketing representative"" job once which sounds like good experience. It was a terrible job though, kind of like sales. I also had an internship that was events, which I liked. 

Also I am great at typing/English/grammar/spelling, I'm not bad at math, learned all of Microsoft office (would just have to refresh a lot with excel and access) I'm flexible and positive, not outgoing but can talk to customers easily.

- Top 20 CS school

- Currently double major (BS CS &amp; Econ with Math minor) however I am attempting a triple major (CS Econ Math)
-International Student
-Study abroad at top school in world (Oxford)

Apologies if this does not belong here, however I am asking as I really have no outside guidance or anyone to give me any insight whatsoever. I am also full of doubt since when I ask around it seems like everyone is doing just as good as I am if not better based on word of mouth (I highly doubt this too, but who am I to judge how well others are doing).

a) the type of consulting you are interested in (tech, management, HR, etc.)


b) the type of role (internship / full-time, undergrad / MBA / experienced hire, etc.)


c) résumé or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.


**Common topics**

a) How do I to break into consulting? 

 * If you are at a target school, join your consulting club and work with your career center.
 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  Experienced hires do happen, but often require a combination of in-demand experience and a meaningful referral.

b) How can I improve my candidacy / resume / cover letter?

c) I have not heard back after the interview, what should I do?  

 * Wait or contact the recruiter directly.  Students may also wish to contact their career center.  Waiting times can range from same day to several days at target schools, to several weeks or more with non-target schools and experienced hires.  Asking in this thread will not help.

If this helps even one person, I'll be more than happy. 
Try your hardest to get a near perfect or perfect GPA in the hardest courses your school offers because this is almost expected at this point for top applicants. Take the SAT very seriously because I did not realize how important 50 points could be. Take the SAT or ACT as many times as you need to get 1550+ or 34+. You can take the SAT basically once a month so take advantage of that. Plan ahead as to what subject tests you want to take and get an 800 if possible in 2-3 subject tests. I would highly recommend taking math II as one of them because it is not too hard to get an 800. 
Find things you like or things that pertain to what you plan to pursue if you already know and make something of it. Create clubs, find internships, find research opportunities, shadow people, join competitions, etc. But whatever you do, make sure you become great at something rather than good at many things. Try to get some state or national recognition in whatever you end up choosing to do and make an impact. If you have the money to get a counselor, I would highly recommend it because they can guide you as to what to do throughout high school, making this much easier. 
For your college essays, start around halfway through your junior year and write many drafts. Show these drafts to trusted teachers, friends, and editors to keep improving them because the essay is immensely important. 
Make sure you find some teachers that you like and build a great relationship with them. People underestimate how much a glowing letter of rec can be. I know many people who didn't have the best stats or extracurriculars, but their teachers really vouched for them and gave them amazing letters, which got them into t10. 
Finally, make sure to enjoy yourself because you're only in high school once.

I have got an internship at a good research institute for this upcoming summer. There is another interview coming up at a great company(VIASAT) which has a good pay and great work too. Good performance at VIASAT's summer internship will lead to another 6-month opportunity for my final semester. So, this is my conundrum:

1) My college has a rule that on being selected for an internship, one has to go for the internship mandatorily and rejection after the selection will lead to barring from sitting at further interviews.

2) If I am selected, then I will have to join VIASAT but I cannot leave my pre-committed research internship at the summer institute. 

3) If I am selected and I reject this opportunity, I am depriving some other candidate of a position and I would hate for one of my friends to lose this limited opportunity.

8a0jjj,252,2018-04-05,Never pays to be outside The Family,porksteaks,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8a0jjj/never_pays_to_be_outside_the_family/,"I am the IT jack-of-all-trades for a family-owned business services firm that, among other things, puts on events for clients. And by family-owned, I mean all executives come from two families. I have been with the company for about 12 years and was hired right out of college.


Basically, my role is if someone else in the company thinks it might have to do with computers or ""The Google"", I get called. I am a one-man IT department though the company refuses to grant me an official IT title. Not a big deal; most people in the company make up their titles anyway. I run our servers, do company and client websites, and remote into the PCs of anyone who needs help.


Days before a big ticketed event, I get a memo from a coworker (who is reasonably tech-savvy and sometimes works with our databases, but is not considered an IT worker) that the upcoming event is gone from the company’s central database system!  Despite being out sick that day, I call in and conference the coworker and her supervisor, who happens to be a member of one of the two executive families. While on the conference call I see that other events are missing from the system as well.  I advise that the best procedure will be to restore from a recent hourly backup, but this will require some minimal downtime to complete.  Supervisor says no, work some different ""computer magic"".  I let coworker and her supervisor debate while I patiently wait on the line, and then advise again that the simplest process to get back up and running is to do a restore from backup which I can initiate right away with her authorization.  Supervisor says no, we’ll just retype the missing info, and ends the call.  She explicitly states not to modify or do anything; she will handle it.  I am out sick, so I go back to bed.


About an hour later, phone rings. It’s coworker’s supervisor and she wants the backup restoration done ASAP. Turns out in the meantime she’s sent out an all-staff memo about there being an extended downtime, no one can log in and use our CRM until further notice, we can’t take any more ticket orders for the upcoming event, even the registration portal for the event has had to be turned off, etc. I log in to our cloud based server control panel, pick a backup from before the events went missing, and start the restoration process. Once it’s unzipped into the appropriate directory, I quickly rename the database to ‘database.bak’, rename the restored backup to ‘database’, and restart the web app front end.  We’re back up and running in minutes, with all the lost data restored.


Except that three hours later, coworker’s supervisor hasn’t given the go-ahead for any staff to go back in the system.  The public is complaining that they can’t register for our event and a different board member says that it will remain down until the next day “as a precaution”.  Despite my fixing the issue quickly, we still have arbitrary downtime so the board can save face that it was really a big, huge, catastrophic failure and their actions were warranted.


During the evening I hear from one of the highest ranking people in the company who has been briefed and is extremely disappointed in the lack of professionalism I showed by requiring so much time to restore the system, and by being sick on a day when I was needed.  It cements in his mind the inadequacy of our IT solution and that we must have redundant full time contractors available at the drop of a hat.  I remind him that everything under my control took mere minutes to resolve, even though I was supposedly out sick.  I am also now interacting with him after hours.  What’s this about not being available at the drop of a hat?


Curious about how this happened to one of my systems, which I take pride in and have high standards for, I commence a full analysis of our system logs.  The missing events were each explicitly deleted in our software, and the logs reveal that each deletion operation was performed from an internal IP address. Then I cross-check against our Active Directory which is used for all company authentication in order to match the time stamps and find the user.  Turns out the user who deleted the events from the core system is a friend of the supervisor I have been working with all day, recently hired to be one of her special assistants in working on a new company service.   First thing the next morning, I send an email with these findings to said supervisor as well as the high ranking family member, anticipating that I will be fully vindicated and the matter will be addressed with the recently-hired assistant.


Instead, I receive a terse reply that I must cease and desist from any further log investigation, because the matter is closed and the board has already decided what their actions will be.


Within an hour, I learn that I am being removed from IT tasks and administration/ownership of my systems is being turned over to a team of highly-paid external consultants (considerably more than my pay level). The “very serious matter” has been resolved and the company is ready to move on. I am warned to not look back and “we all must move on”. My job description has been rewritten into a reduced role, having nothing further to do with IT work, but instead as an assistant to one of the highest ranking people in the company. In effect, with over 10 years experience, I suddenly am at the level of a paid intern.


Moral of the story:  never expose someone who's friends of The Family."

The IT department is comprised of 4 people (not including myself), where we heavily utilize the AS400 which is an extremely volatile server system. Because of this, I cannot play around with the interface to become somewhat familiar and due to our small IT crew, the amount of time spent on the intern being taught new things is extremely limited. Which leaves me sitting at my desk most of the day messaging people to let me shadow them or extend a helping hand. 
I was really looking forward to having a fulfilling internship where I could actually gather some real world IT knowledge but instead I either deal with monkey-work or excel spreadsheets. Hell, sometimes I don't even get that. I'm just really trying to keep my chin up because waking up at 5:30 to get into work at 7 only to sit around all day is really depressing.

I filed my taxes back in early February, and it turns out I owe about $1100 in Oregon state income tax. Unfortunately, I have no money, and have not had a job for several months as I'm trying to focus on school, and my partner makes enough for us to get by for now (but not enough to have $1100 saved up). I've been trying to apply for jobs after college for a few months now, and I was hoping that I could negotiate some sort of relocation bonus/advance (to pay for moving, etc) and pay my taxes from that.

Unfortunately, now the due date is coming up in a few weeks, and I still have no idea how to pay for it. Is there any way I can put off having to pay the taxes until I get a job and can afford it? I've found information on setting up payment plans, but it sounds like they still require an upfront payment, and I have literally $0.25 to my name. Trying to get my partner to pay would probably mean going without groceries for a while, which isn't preferable.

Matter of fact, I've never really thought about it, but...what would happen if I just didn't pay? I mean, I'm not planning on that, but what would actually be the consequences?

On a side note, the reason I owe so much is because I made a lot of money during a summer internship in San Francisco (unfortunately, most of that money went into the costs of living in San Francisco). California called it taxable income (because I was living and working in CA that summer), but it was short term enough that I got a bit back; Oregon *also* called it taxable income, because I lived in Oregon for most of the year, so my owed taxes were *way* higher than what I'd payed in Oregon over the year.

I wad not able to get an internship mostly on my part for not trying to hard to get one and I will be looking for a full time job this month in the accounting field hopefully.

My questions are to figure out what further education I should seek and what certifications I should aim for first as well as what type of work I should be looking for. I have asked a handful of professors and career services at my university and no one seems to be able to give me clear answers so I thought I would ask the internet for advice as well.

I'm interested in information systems auditing and unsure if I should get my masters in accounting or into a more technical degree like information technology. With that being said, should I look for a job in auditing or an entry level accounting job? My final question is if I should go for the CPA first or the CISA?

8a2tla,5,2018-04-05,List of films I have found inspiring over the years,LordPotatoVader,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8a2tla/list_of_films_i_have_found_inspiring_over_the/,"Hopefully someone will enjoy some of these if they haven't seen them all. Please share any others you think I/other people will enjoy!

I have always wanted to write these out with a little write up on why each one means something to me... All are inspired/based on true stories. So here we go...

1) **Jerry Maguire** - *""When slick sports agent Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) has a crisis of conscience, he pens a heartfelt company-wide memo that promptly gets him fired. Desperate to hang on to the athletes that he represents, Jerry starts his own management firm, with only single mother Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger) joining him in his new venture"".*

To me this film is a great portrayal of the stress, ups and downs and general uncertainty one must endure in the early stages of the pursuit of their dream. It so well demonstrates the balls and forced self belief required to attempt something big. Making the jump from employed to self employed can be a big jump for many people. But if you stick it out... You might just get there!



2) **Middlemen** - *""Jack Harris (Luke Wilson) is a legitimate Texas businessman who wanders off the straight-and-narrow path when he meets Wayne Beering (Giovanni Ribisi) and Buck Dolby (Gabriel Macht), a slimy pair of Internet porn profiteers. Jack's association with the men leads to his involvement with a host of other lowlifes, and though he tries to convince himself that he is staying clean in a dirty business, his disintegrating family situation proves otherwise.""*

I love how well this film captures the burning desire of the young entrepreneur to do *something* even when they don't have an idea to work on... And then that eureka moment when you realise you have just come up with one.  



3) **The Social Network** - *""In 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer genius Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) begins work on a new concept that eventually turns into the global social network known as Facebook. Six years later, he is one of the youngest billionaires ever, but Zuckerberg finds that his unprecedented success leads to both personal and legal complications when he ends up on the receiving end of two lawsuits, one involving his former friend (Andrew Garfield).""*

Among other things, a great example of how quickly some ideas explode while you try to keep up. And if going into business with friends... A reminder to try not to lose them in the process. 



4) **The Pursuit of Happiness** - *""Life is a struggle for single father Chris Gardner (Will Smith). Evicted from their apartment, he and his young son (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) find themselves alone with no place to go. Even though Chris eventually lands a job as an intern at a prestigious brokerage firm, the position pays no money. The pair must live in shelters and endure many hardships, but Chris refuses to give in to despair as he struggles to create a better life for himself and his son.""*

A demonstration of true persistence no matter how hard it gets. You never give up. NEVER!



5) **American Gangster** - *""Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) earns his living as a chauffeur to one of Harlem's leading mobsters. After his boss dies, Frank uses his own ingenuity and strict business code to become one of the inner city's most powerful crime bosses.""*

Whilst I imagine some people might question this films place on this list; to me, it belongs here due to denoting the possibility of taking an industry by storm by changing the way things are done. What can you see in a particular industry that everyone else is missing? What can you *find* in a particular industry that everyone else is missing? It might be enough to take a big chunk of the pie. Shit, maybe even the whole pie.



6) **War Dogs** - *""With the war in Iraq raging on, a young man (Jonah Hill) offers his childhood friend a chance to make big bucks by becoming an international arms dealer. Together, they exploit a government initiative that allows businesses to bid on U.S. military contracts. Starting small allows the duo to rake in money and live the high life. They soon find themselves in over their heads after landing a $300 million deal to supply Afghan forces, a deal that puts them in business with some very shady people.""*

This is a great portrayal of starting small. I love it when Jonah Hills character is initially recruiting his friend and he has this bit on the big players all fighting over the same cake whilst ignoring the crumbs... And that he lives off crumbs. If you go for crumbs, maybe one day you will get lucky.  



7) **Wolf of Wallstreet** - *""In 1987, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes an entry-level job at a Wall Street brokerage firm. By the early 1990s, while still in his 20s, Belfort founds his own firm, Stratton Oakmont. Together with his trusted lieutenant (Jonah Hill) and a merry band of brokers, Belfort makes a huge fortune by defrauding wealthy investors out of millions. However, while Belfort and his cronies partake in a hedonistic brew of sex, drugs and thrills, the SEC and the FBI close in on his empire of excess.""*

Whilst dishonesty probably isn't the best way to try to make your millions for a number of reasons; the way this films depicts self belief, hard work, necessary thick skin, the rush of making money and enjoying the fruits of your labour meant it had to make the list. 


I hope someone enjoys one or some of these if they were not aware of them. There was also another one I saw years ago which I can't remember the name of... It was about a young lad who traveled to China to get his product manufactured which was one of the best entrepreneurial films I have ever seen but for the life of me and no matter how much Googling I have tried, I cannot find it :( 

If anyone knows it please let me know! It might have been a netflix film"

Maybe 2-4 were slightly appealing but applications don't begin for several weeks so it's risky to just rely on those).


For those who worked in labs or research centers (preferably as a high schooler), did you just email the lab or center and ask if they needed an intern? What was the protocol? Did you have prior experience? How do you go about presenting yourself, even if you're not very outstanding (if it helps I go to a prestigious school in my city)?

What if I had accepted an offer from a company in February, while I could have had a much better offer later on? Is it better to play it safe, or bet on yourself?

I am quite clumsy with my laptops... most of my laptops have only lasted me 1-2 years (except for my Late 2013 13"" macbook pro which I still use daily despite being banged around a lot), so build quality and good customer support is pretty important to me.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
During my graduate program, I will be working with a company (like an internship). This means that the computer must be professional looking (none of that aggressive look that most gaming laptops have). I am quite interested in the Dell inspiron 7577, but those aesthetics are pushing it for me. Considering the Gigabyte Aero 14 but I can't seem to find the black version anywhere.

1) Go to a 3 month bootcamp, learn everything I can and develop a small side project while I'm taking classes. Another student ik is also doing this, it seems like a good idea to me. 

2) Take a MOOC or 2 , work on a side project.

3) Don't take any coursework, spend all the time studying on my own and try to complete several side projects (considering working with a friend or 2 from other colleges, along with another large individual project idea).

8a6fh9,4,2018-04-05,Return back to NVIDIA or explore for my fall coop,zero2g,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8a6fh9/return_back_to_nvidia_or_explore_for_my_fall_coop/,"I am currently a coop student at Uber right now doing deep learning platforms and currently planning my next steps for my fall coop. Previously last summer, I was able to intern at NVIDIA for their deep learning infrastructures team.

Earlier, I attended NVIDIA's conference and met up with my former team members to touch up on how they were doing. The team is doing well and amazing and wants me to come back. My former recruiter at NVIDIA reached out to me earlier asking me about future opportunities.

At Uber though, my manager already told me during my midterm review that I am too Junior for his team (He is only looking for Senior Level Engineers for deep learning platforms) and because of that, I will not be receiving a return offer back. I have also already asked my recruiter at Uber but they have already filled up all their internship positions for the entire year (fall included)

So currently, I know that I will not be going back to Uber and that there is a door open for me to go back to NVIDIA. After my internships, I decided that I really like to do deep learning platforms and infrastructure.

My school though is University of Waterloo, and because of that, I will have access to my school's coop system for the fall term. At Waterloo though, it is also I guess a bit of the school culture to go out and explore other places rather than going back to the same one.

The decision for me right now though is to go back to NVIDIA, or to try and see if I can get into other companies. However, the problem I am seeing right now is that I would argue NVIDIA in my opinion is one of the best for deep learning platforms and infra (as they do control the entire stack) and I do not want to end up getting another bad experience that I had at Uber. Also, it would be really great to not go through the entire recruitment process again because honestly it is just so damn tiring especially during the school term.

However, if I were to go back to NVIDIA, it is basically telling that I am going to be there for full time after graduation as I already cooped there twice. I really do not mind that and I do want to try and use it to my advantage to negotiate for a possible ENG II offer rather than ENG I. However, I will be losing leverage though less competing offers and a less diversified experience.

What do you think it is the best choice for me though? Go back to NVIDIA for deep learning infra? Or try out other companies and see what is possible?

I regretted later about faking but I had to join, otherwise college placement cell, would have put me out of placements.

after joining, along with other 5 interns, our CEO told us to learn technologies which will be used in the project as React with Redux and Express Js for a backend(optional).

I was knowing only a few tags in HTML, no CSS knowledge, and little javascript. I told my senior to give me more time to learn React.

I started learning React though I knew I don't know JavaScript, I wasted my week by jumping directly on React. then I started Javascript, but I was unfamiliar with DOM, then I started learning HTML, then CSS.

I made small Component in React somehow and pushed on GitHub, but it was rejected as it was far more from design and expectation.

I completed Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap, Git, Bootstrap, React, Redux. Till that time 2 months were completed and No work was left for a Front-end developer.

The internship itself seems really good; it's a mid-large size company whose internship program seems to get unanimously good reviews, and the pay is solid. I would be doing front-end work in React which I really like.

I'm likely to accept, but I'm somewhat wary for a few reasons.

The whole interview process felt so short that I felt like there must be some catch. I got a recruiter call, then did a 1-hour video interview the next week with one of the team members. It didn't really involve any technical problems, but was more an overview of my experience and looking at the code of some of my projects on GitHub. Then I got an offer two days later.

On the other hand, the other companies I interviewed with (who I haven't completed interviews/heard back from yet) usually had a more robust interviewing system and are all smaller. e.g. unicorn w/ 1-hour video interview with technical problems + 3-hour onsite; medium company w/ 20 min screening + 1-hour onsite; startup w/ 4-5 hour coding exercise + 1-hour video interview w/ live coding. And they took quite more time to get back to me for successive rounds. Also, this company is only giving me a few days to respond and it's a pretty strict deadline even though I asked for an extension, meaning I'd have to miss the 3-hour onsite with the unicorn.

Basically, the combination of easy interview + really quick offer and short timeframe for acceptance is bothering me a little even though it seems like a good internship. I'm not sure how normal these timeframes are for internships, but any insights would help. Plus, since I'm graduating this year, I'd really like to know how possible it is to either extend the internship or convert to full-time since the internship is only 8 weeks. That would really sweeten the deal.

I am an international student currently enrolled at masters in finance with a focus on risk management in one of the top20 UK universities. My background, however, is in computer science and I had some work experience and internships, but IT related.

During this summer we have no classes and are required to work on our dissertation. I didn't want to waste the whole summer and instead make up for the fact that I don't have relevant experience by doing some work/internships.

Of course, in the beginning, I have been applying to numerous IB internships and some others that were available. Then I found out that although we don't have classes, I am still considered to be in a full-time study during the summer term, and due to visa restrictions only allowed to work 20 hours per week.

So I wanted to ask if you think it is even possible to find a part-time job/internship/work experience, and if you maybe have any advice on where or how to look for this kind of opportunities...

So should I go to him and say that he should re-evaluate my progress and consider my application again as I started grasping the business in which we are working which will help them in a long time. 
Also, I bagged a remote internship(open mainframe project: http://bit.ly/2GD31V3; it is similar to GSoC) for summers and I will be working open source for the whole summer.  If I go for the internship, I can’t work for them as doing two things at the same time is not good.
Also, should I go to my senior for re-evaluation or not as I didn’t have any job in my hand?
My long-term goal is to do Masters so will job will be more beneficial or an open source internship?"
8adp1r,15,2018-04-06,I graduated last June. Fears have held me back for too long. I need a plan to move forward.,AileWing,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8adp1r/i_graduated_last_june_fears_have_held_me_back_for/,"I graduated with a BS in Computer Science in June of last year. Since then I've done very little to try to get a job in the field. My fears of not knowing enough and social anxiety have really held me back, but now I need to just get over it all and move forward. I actually have an interview for the 13th and am scared to death of it, but I'm going to do it. To be honest, I'm not expecting to do well as I wasn't the best learner and some things that might be considered basics weren't easy to learn for me.

I think I've come up with what I'd like to think is a decent plan listed below, but I'd like some input from those who are willing on things that I should add and resources that I should use. Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: The numbers don't indicate the order I'd necessarily do them in. I just listed them by number as I typed them out.

1. **Do a review course on Java.** Although I've been focusing on more web development stuff lately, Java is my primary language. It's been a while since I've delved into it. I picked up one of the Udemy Java courses to refresh my memory on syntax and things like that, so I'll go through it.

2. **Nail down data structures.** I'm weak in this area. Sure, I did projects with linked lists and the like, but I never had them down pat. Also, hash tables? We never did those. There's a lot I need to go through here.

3. **Algorithms.** Boy, where do I start here? I'm so bad at algorithm stuff. The sorts, the searches... All that is stuff I need to know.

4. **Projects.** I have several projects on my resume, but nothing great. I know there are ideas out there. I'll scour here, the learnprogramming subreddit, and wherever to find more ideas.

5. **Experience.** There probably isn't anything I can do about this. I didn't get an internship like I should have. That's not to say I didn't try. I applied during the summer of my second year, but it didn't pan out. Then, the next year, I had graduated, so, yeah. Internship time is over."
8adqkp,1,2018-04-06,"Have over 11 years IT professional experience, yet I'm being reclassified as entry level, paraprofessional, ""Customer Support"".",vaarr80,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8adqkp/have_over_11_years_it_professional_experience_yet/,"TL;DR:  I work for a job that the state is trying to pay more competitively by changing our job titles and pay.  However our HR department seems to be actively trying to prevent us from getting paid more and I need advice of ways to expose them and/or get around them.

I work for a higher education institution in a state where they've been having some major issues with IT job retention.  Our state has been doing an study over the last few years to reclassify IT staff employed by state agencies from ""Information Technology Specialist"" 1-6 positions into more common industry classifications that correspond to more competitive pay scales.  In the beginning of this study we were asked to fill out a form describing our day to day job duties that we performed in order to better classify us into one of these new categories which consist of IT Project Management, IT Quality Assurance, IT Security, IT Systems Administration, IT Vendor Management, Network &amp; Telecommunications, Application Development, IT Architecture, IT Business Analysis, IT Customer Support, IT Data Management, and IT Policy &amp; Planning. Each of these categories has job levels ranging from Entry level to Sr IT Manager, and each of those job levels has 3 categories of their own including ""Power User"", Paraprofessional, and Professional.

I submitted my job description listing my Apple systems admin duties such as  ""Coordinate and maintain user/client requirements for Apple computing services . Design multiple-server system configuration to meet imaging and file server needs."" and ""Improve the necessary implementation of Apple products into our Enterprise Active Directory environment.""  I also included some of my Network Analyst duties I perform such as ""Configure and install Juniper switches across campus.""  There were a lot of duties I perform that were also not able to be included in the form due to the limitations of the form such as limited number of fields and space to enter information.

Back in 2016 we were asked to send HR the form with our job descriptions.  After my supervisor submitted our job descriptions to HR in PDF format (so that they could not be easily edited) the head of HR replied back to my supervisor asking for mine in particular to be resubmitted in Word format.  I was not aware at the time that mine was the only one requested as this, and did not learn this until yesterday.

Recently we had a meeting with our union rep with an update on the states progress into this study and proposed changes along with each person in our departments proposed reclassification.  We have 9 people in our IT department, of those 9 people, I am ranked number 4 with regards to employment length, meaning there are 5 people who have been in this job less time than I have been.  I've been here for about 4 years now and am basically considered the senior ITS as an ITS 2 outside of current Sysadmin, IT supervisor, and IT Project Manager which are all ITS 3s.  However, when we looked at our proposed job reclassifications . I was placed as an Entry Level Paraprofessional Customer Support Technician.  Which, in my mind, is basically the equivalent of an intern. Also, it would also coincidently make it so that I really don't get a pay raise at all. 
 Two of the guys that started less than 6 months ago, in the same position as me, were placed in Application Development, which would start at just a little bit less than where I would cap out at.  They, however were also considered paraprofessional, and honestly didn't even have a category of entry level or anything else yet associated to determine pay scale so I can't even really say where their pay would be.  The only actual professional in our department was our supervisor, who was also labeled as an entry level Customer Support.  My supervisor told me that, given what was on my job description, she would have place me in a network position or a sysadmin.

That being said, it is pretty commonly known at our college, that when we attempt to get reclassified into a higher ITS position our HR department will always deny it.  And in the last few years almost everybody that has tried to challenge that through the union has also been denied (our head HR manager is also on the union committee that reviews these challenges coincidently). Myself and 2 others in the same position as me have attempted to get reclassified, since the work we do goes way above and beyond what the ITS 2 job description states including server administration, network security design and maintenance, and all around sys admin stuff.  Each of us has been denied accordingly.  The other two people have left for higher paying sysadmin and network admin jobs before we ever got the results for this study back.  I really don't want to leave because honestly, the benefits for this job are great and I have a family.  However, it's very disheartening to work as hard as all of us do in our small IT department only to be told we're just entry level and not even professional level. And then to find out that my job description was singled out to be resubmitted in an editable word format to the HR manager really bothers me.

Now, I know that one option I would have would be to do a freedom of information act request for the documents that our HR manager actually sent to the state which would show whether or not they were altered in any way.  However, I am worried that in doing so I would be putting a big target on my back as someone they would try to get rid of (this has also been a common theme in the past for people who ask questions about the administration at this institution.) So I am wondering what other options I might have as a recourse for what seems like a really corrupt system designed to prevent people from moving up or getting paid more?  In the mean time, I am studying for the CCNA exam and putting applications out at other comparable jobs in the area.

Sorry if this is long and confusing, but I couldn't think of any better way to describe the situation.

8afhf0,8,2018-04-06,Stick it out in CS or switch to IST?,freshmanCS1234,PennStateUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/8afhf0/stick_it_out_in_cs_or_switch_to_ist/,"Hello everyone, I'm currently a freshman in CS so I'm sure this question gets thrown around a lot but I'm currently deciding whether I should stay in CS or switch to IST. My situation is a little different than others. About halfway through the year I realized all of my previous experience has been more in IT than CS. 

I have a little bit of coding experience in high school, having designed a few basic websites here and there and programmed a small game, but I noticed I have a lot more useful stuff in the IT field that doesn't really overlap with CS that much. I have 3+ years of experience working a network administration job for my uncle's hospital so I feel moderately well versed in SQL databases and network administration etc. I am quite comfortable around UNIX based systems and feel like I know a lot more than the average student in CS (not meaning to brag but the UNIX stuff in cmpsc 121/122 feels extremely basic to me whereas my friends find it a little complex). I worked a full time tech job for a year at Dell configuring custom UNIX like OS's on servers and desktop systems and setting up their network configs/VPNs/whatever and I also worked a part time job at another local tech company repairing hardware/software issues with laptops and desktops at my hometown throughout my high school career. I was close to getting an A+ certification and studied a bit with some co-workers who were pursuing a cert in CCNA (cisco routing cert) but decided to hold back and focus more on academics so I can get admitted to CS engineering in college.

It looks kinda cool on paper but I realized this stuff has nothing to do with programming and probably won't do much to get me into a decent CS internship. Meanwhile I did get promising feedback for an internship in an IST field that I applied to but decided not to follow up on because it didn't have anything to do with my field. I'm just not sure which one holds better opportunity for me. Math has also been really difficult lately and it's been bringing me to the edge of switching. Should I stick it out in CS and get a job in the CS field or switch to IST and focus on the stuff I'm actually already experienced in? I am already aware of the whole stigma behind switching from CS to IST with CS being one of the most valuable degrees in the engineering college and IST being thrown under the bus and I don't want to be labeled as 'that guy' either but I feel like IST might actually be better for my situation.

**TL;DR:** CS freshman premajor right now with little prior programming achievements but 3+ years of experience in the IT field with network/sys admin level jobs. Thinking about switching but not sure if worth it."

Why? Because you're its main reporter, gathering news from alternate realities.

***
""Look, kid, I don't want you along, I don't want to teach you, you're an inconvenience,"" I said a bit unkindly perhaps. ""But I have to teach you the job, and by God I'm going to teach you the damn job.""

""Are you aware this is not *Full Meta Jacket,* Ms. Seraph?"" Mark said with an idiotic grin. The kid was in his early twenties, tall, blond - a sharp contrast to my short stature and jet black hair - and thought, like every 20 and change kid, that he was the king of the damn world. Or worlds as it may be. He kind of reminded me of me actually. 

Which was why I hated him. 

""Do you know the mortality rate of our trainees, kid?"" I asked, pretending I hadn't heard him. 

""Wow you really think it *is*-""

Christ, this kid. I grabbed him by the collar and pulled him off his feet until he was inches from my face.  
	
""75 percent. Got it?"" I said, his wide blue eyes staring into the depths of my opal irises. ""Three out of four die, of the remaining 25 percent, most are missing in action, stranded in some hell, and what few are left drop out. There's a reason there have been five reporters in he Onion since 1988."" I let him go and kid practically fell to the floor. His eyes were wide and his face was bloodless. ""Do you understand now?"" I said, keeping my voice low. 

The kid opened his mouth to say something then decided against it. Instead, he just swallowed and nodded. 

""Good,"" I said. ""Follow my instructions and you might not die."" Without waiting for a response I laid my hand across his forearm and with my other hand activated the TransTemporal-Relocator, or the TTR. 

I'd been doing the job for just about two decades and I still wasn't used to the sensation. It was as if my center of gravity shifted *out of my body* and I stumbled as I lost my balance. But the feeling fades and we're there. Wherever that might be.  

Decades of experience saved us. I'd once dropped into a a nuclear test site, and another time in the middle of a horde of demons. The first few seconds of any Stumble as well called it were the most dangerous. 

So when I landed in the driver's seat I immediately slammed the breaks as a car tried to ram us from the left. The car careened, and since it didn't hit us, hit another car on the left. They both spun out and hit the divider in the middle of the - I looked around - twelve lane highway. 

""What the fuck!"" the kid shouted next to me. 

I briefly glanced at him - he was holding a box of pizza. We were in a sleek, red sports car. There was a GPS in front of the car and a timer in the bottom left. Five minutes, three miles away. Got it. The TTR always did this, put us in fantastical scenarios or events, and we had to play them through. Rarely longer than an hour, they were the stories I wrote for every Onion piece. 

“In the next one half mile, take the exit 27,” the GPS said in that infuriatingly kind voice. Some things stay constant across dimensions. 

“Th-that’s impossible,” the kid said. “You’re on like the tenth lane, how’re you gonna make this exit?”

“Recklessly,” I replied. “Hold on to something.” I flung the steering wheel left and crossed two lanes immediately. A couple of people honked on their horns as I cut them off but I paid them no mind. I slammed the breaks to get behind a car on the right lane and swung left again. Four lanes to go, and the exit was in sight.

“We aren’t gonna make it,” the kid said, practically in tears. Christ, I would take overly eager over useless downer any day.  

I looked in the rear view mirror and saw another one of those black cars who had tried to ram us before. In seconds he was in parallel with us to my right. I could break or speed up, forcing him t miss. 

Or I could be insane. 

“Sorry kid,” I said, as the car slammed into our right. I’d relaxed already though every muscle in my body screamed at me to tense up, and so all I suffered was some seatbelt burn and ear damage when the car slammed into us. I timed a sharp left as it did and we flew across the last some lanes, directly into the exit. The car tried to follow but was T-boned by a white minivan. I let out a whoop of joy as we rattled through the road.

I spared a glance at the kid. The door had dented inwards, and his arm was at an impossible angle. I checked his pulse with my hand – still alive. Small favors, I suppose.  

The rest of the trip was relatively uneventful. I drove into a suburban neighborhood until the GPS indicated I’d arrived. With ten seconds left I practically ran to the doorbell and rung it, breathing heavy. 

A dejected looking man who reeked of vodka opened the door. “Aw, fuck you, bitch. Would it have killed you to arrive four seconds later?! Is free pizza really that much of a fucking loss?”

I pointed to my car ad the dying intern. “Yeah, douchebag, it is.”

The TTR beeped, the end of the experience. Once more I “Stumbled,” and we were back in my office. I didn’t have to be in contact with the kid on the return trip, and so he was there to, landing on his broken arm. He let out a strangled scream of pain.   

The medics were already on standby and rushed to help the kid. I watched as they put him on a stretcher and escorted him out. I shook my head. Idiot. Should never have signed up for this. 

I sighed and went over to my computer to start the article. “Pizza Corporatism: The Lengths Pizza companies will go to make sure you don’t get free pizza.”

Any advice or feedback is appreciated! Thanks!

Edit: Also I don’t have any personal projects yet."

I have been working at a general office for about 3 years. I managed to obtain the job as an internship during college and have enjoyed working their since. The only thing i disliked about my job, was they fact that it was in a very liberal city. Outside my office, i would see people marching, picketing and the usual shit. Most of the time, i would avoid the protesters since, most of them were younger then me and generally just looked plain sketchy.


Sadly, I made the mistake of taking a smoke break while they were in front of our front door. Normally, i would take the back entrance and smoke in an ongoing development area, but i went on break late and the construction guys were working. anyways, that day, i decided to take my break in the front of my workplace, despite the dirty looks a lot of the protesters were giving me. Naturally, a couple of guys decided to make a scene. They ended up walking up to me and saying that i wasn't ""welcome"" here and that i needed to ""white ass"" elsewhere (a little ironic since they were white men as well, what?). I tried to explain to them that I was just on break and would be leaving soon. One of the kids really didn't care what i had to say and spat on my face mid sentence. Now, i'm not going to lie, i have anger issues and having someone spit a giant spit wad in my face kinda pissed me off to the point where i kicked as hard as i could into the fuckers ball sack. 


After that, all i remember is waking up on the ground with a police officer handcuffing me and my manager yelling in the background how I was fired. Luckily enough, no charges were given to me since the guys ended up booking it when the police showed up. They did have to detain me since one of the protesters who witness the situation decided to fabricate a story about how, ""I pulled a knife and tried to kill everyone"" Anyway, that is my story of how i almost got arrested by police and ultimately lost my job due to being surrounded by 4 guys and assaulted.



TL;DR Stay away from aggressive protesters in front of your workplace, unless you want to be assaulted for no particular reason, detain and possibly lose your job, like I did"

8ainqb,648,2018-04-07,“Not-so-Secret” Formula to Securing a NASA Internship (From a 2x NASA intern),kaixixx,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/8ainqb/notsosecret_formula_to_securing_a_nasa_internship/,"Hello everyone! I’m an aerospace engineering student and I’ve interned for NASA at two different centers (Armstrong and JPL). You definitely do not have to study aerospace engineering to work/intern at NASA. NASA is a great place to intern from my experiences so I wanted to give some tips that have personally worked for me in the past. While these tips worked for me at NASA, I’ll be these can also apply for any other big engineering company.

Landing a NASA internship is difficult. On top of the obvious advice everyone provides like have a high GPA, etc. there are more distinctive ways to stand out from the crowd. I know people who have sub 3.5 GPAs and still interned for NASA by doing the things listed below. The secret formula is a simple 3-step process:

KEYWORDS IN YOUR RESUME

Because so many people apply to every single position on OSSI (the website to apply for all NASA internships with the exception of JPL), the hiring managers automatically screen through the resumes using some sort of software. They look for “keywords” that they deem as necessary for the position. For example, if the job listing is for computational fluid dynamics, you probably want to include “computational fluid dynamics” or “CFD” somewhere on your resume. They also might look for soft skill words like “group” or “team.” You want to match as many words on the job description in your resume as possible without lying about any experience. This step is crucial because even if you have a lot of experience, if you don’t get past the computer screening, no one will even take a glance at your resume.

DON’T BE AFRAID TO REACH OUT

If you see a position online that has the hiring manager’s email, feel free to reach out to them with any questions you may have or even express your interest and ask them questions about what their work entails. (definitely don’t spam them begging for the job). I know this is hard since you probably don’t want to bother them but trust me, they put their email on there for a reason and the worst thing that can happen is that you don’t hear anything back. Reaching out not only expresses your interest, but also makes you stand out from the crowd since the hiring manager might remember your name and take a glance at your resume. At JPL, every other intern I’ve asked has said that they emailed their respective boss when they applied.

GET INVOLVED

This is kinda a given. Whether you do research with a professor, are a part of an engineering org, or do something completely unrelated to your major, just do something. You could have a 4.0 but without experience, not a lot of people will pick you from a group of people with lower GPAs but with more experience. Getting involved can mean joining any engineering org like FSAE, AIAA, DBF, etc. but the most important aspect is to actually be passionate and dedicated. I secured my JPL internship because I’m obtaining my high school teaching certificate in math/physics. I didn’t have to do any sort of crazy research or build rockets or anything of that sort although many other interns did.

I know the process is hard so if you have any further questions or just want to chat in general, feel free to dm me at www.instagram.com/kyeshee (I don’t check reddit all that often). Thanks for reading and good luck! :) :) :)"
8aj8i4,11,2018-04-07,I was misdiagnosed as bipolar when it was really ADHD all along. I'm really upset about this.,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/8aj8i4/i_was_misdiagnosed_as_bipolar_when_it_was_really/,"5 years ago I went to see a psychiatrist because as I was falling in love with someone, I realized I was having racing thoughts and rapid speech. When I googled those symptoms bipolar disorder came up. I thought that since I had those symptoms and have also been depressed multiple times that I must have bipolar disorder. I told the psychiatrist this and she agreed and started me on lamotrogine. A few months into it I hadn't noticed improvement in my emotionally volatile reactions or my ability to manage my life in terms of self-care, organization, and completing tasks. I asked her about ADHD. She asked me if I had bad grades in school or was disruptive in class as a child. I said no. She then ended that conversation. It was difficult for me to get to her office for appointments and I didn't want my meds upped or changed so I just pretended like everything was fine in future appointments. 

Fast forward five years and I'm seeing a new psychiatrist. I asked her about ADHD so she refers me to a neuropsychologist to do testing. It came back as me having ADHD, specifically affecting me most in terms of emotional dysregulation. My psychiatrist begins me on adderall, as I had experience taking this as I had been intermittently taking other people's adderall for 14 years to get chores and schoolwork done. 1.5 months in I asked to be switched to Modafinil because I was feeling strung out on adderall and very irritable. With Modafinil my inability to focus, pay attention, and accomplish tasks returned. I didn't take it one day and I had a date. I could not stop talking. That night I stayed up until 3:30 am, even though I had to be up at 8:30, because I got distracted making homemade pizza. I message my doctor whose nurse then calls me saying that my doctor is concerned about hypomania. I say that no, without the adderall or Modafinil I feel the exact same way I have felt for the past 5 years before starting those medications. Hypomania does not last 5 years. I google those symptoms and realize that besides rapid speech, I have never ever experienced any of them. 

I do more research on ADHD and it all makes sense. Because I did not fully understand it 5 years ago I could not advocate for myself. Because my psychiatrist did not understand ADHD she did not do a proper evaluation. 
I did well in school because I'm above average intelligence. I wasn't disruptive but I always was reading ahead in the books while the teacher was talking and passing notes. I cheated a lot in high school and in college, could only accomplish things if there was an extreme time pressure or I took someone else's ADHD medication, and dropped multiple classes. I've learned that sensory processing issues are associated with ADHD and as a child I would have meltdowns if my shoes or socks felt wrong. I would go weeks without bathing. When I was around 6-years-old a tag in a shirt was bothering me so badly that I couldn't even wait to take the shirt off to cut it out. I cut it out while the shirt was still on and ended up cutting out a huge chunk of my hair and having a mullet for the next year. I also have learned that balance is an issue. I'm super clumsy.  Being on adderall was the first time I haven't had at least one cut, burn, or bruise. I also got made fun of for walking crooked when I was 12. I had to consciously train myself to walk in a straight line. My depression was always triggered by situational things such as unstable home dynamics as a teenager and then being sexually assaulted as an adult. My depression never came out of nowhere. It was always connected to something. 

This misdiagnosis prevented me from getting the help that I needed for so long. It made my last boyfriend of 4.5 years suffer as I would have extreme emotional reactions, hyperfocus on issues, become obsessive about various things, lose interest quickly, unable to sustain hugs or conversations without become quickly distracted, always walked in front of him, finished his sentences, made him feel crazy, etc.

I'm now so depressed. I've cried so much since coming to this realization. It's hard to not sit here and wonder what could have been if I had been diagnosed correctly 5 years ago. Would I be married to my ex? Would I have done better in school and gotten the internship that I needed after college? (given I had a 3.5 regardless and now have a good job but it could have been so much better) 

What if I had been diagnosed as a child...

Now I need to wean off of this strong mood stabilizer. I need to get my psychiatrist to remove the bipolar diagnosis or else seek out a new psychiatrist, which it can take up to 9 months to get in for an intake appointment in my city. I need to figure out which ADHD medications work for me. I have to wait until August, 4 months from now, for my appointment with a psychologist because that's how long it takes to get an intake appointment with them. 


I'm so angry that the DSM is skewed towards males and children so that girls and women get overlooked and not properly diagnosed. Ugh.

Has this happened to anyone else? How did you cope? Any advice? 

TL;DR: I was diagnosed as bipolar 5 years ago but I'm now realizing that its been ADHD this entire time. It has interfered with so many parts of my life that I'm depressed and angry that I wasn't properly diagnosed when I sought out help.

I'm freaking out. My advisor told me I'm going to graduate next fall, assuming I take the summer off to find an internship. I'm completely unprepared for this and have no idea what steps I need to do to find a job after I graduate.

I don't have any significant projects other than basic recursive maze solvers and polynomial calculators build using Java on NetBeans. I don't have any internship experience either since I didn't feel confident in my abilities to have the skillset that companies are looking for in interns. 

My GPA is a 3.96....so I know I have one factor that will leverage me against other potential job candidates. But...GPA isn't everything. A list of useful projects and an internship or two is much more valuable as I can see by reading this sub. 

Where do I even begin to find an internship in the first place? Do I look somewhere national or apply on my university's career website with local companies? What kind of projects do I need to have to make me a viable candidate for an intern? And lastly, what happens if I graduate with no internships and no significant projects? Does that mean I basically screwed myself over in finding a job?

Please and thank you,

I like UCLA more in terms of academics because I want to be an entrepreneur in the future (maybe become a software engineer and join a startup or work in finance or something). I want to build strong technical skill in college because I think I can learn the soft skills you need for business outside college, in internships or in an MBA.  UCLA just has better technical (STEM) programs – it’s #2 in applied math which I think is a very strong major that lets me branch into many different career paths. 

How would an undergrad business major from Georgetown be better for what I want? Would I learn enough technical skill or will I have to supplement with Statistics courses or something? Gtown isn’t known for strength in STEM and its undergrad business program is only rank 15ish. 

I’m really introverted and tbh pretentious so I think I’d like Gtown’s smaller, more (is intellectual the word?) vibe. UCLA has a better campus, city, and food but I’m really intimidated by the size. I just want to be happy though.

As for the TD1BC, it says I should add $200 or $60 for the months I'll be enrolled full-time or part-time. Which would be Summer and Fall being part-time (internship) and Winter being Full-time. My dilemma is, I pay for my tuition for Winter in 2018 but i go to school in 2019. Do I add the $200/month for Winter (2019)?

Edit: Not sure which flair to use...

The reason I am asking is that if i add the $200/month, I can safely check off the no paying tax box at the back."

I've taken Intro Computer Science (OOP, tree traversals, basic runtime analysis, all in Python) and Intro Discrete Math for Computer Science (basic number theory proofs, runtime analysis proofs, big-O/big-Omega/big-Theta proofs). This summer I'll be taking Software Design (Design patterns, unittesting, refactoring, regex, all in Java) and Intro Theory of Computation (More algorithm proofs, automata) as a part time student. I don't get to take Data Structures or Algorithms until Fall/Winter 2018 at earliest.

What should I focus on in my free time? I'm really interesting in machine learning and I know most of the necessary math to get started (linear algebra, basic probability and statistics, basic multivariable calculus) so I was thinking of working through the Andrew Ng courses so that I can make some sort of project by the end of the summer. Should I do CTCI/Leetcode instead? I'd much rather do the former but I don't want to fail interviews either.

I haven't had any past relevant internships if that matters."

At least I was lucky still that he took me back, I love him so much and he's gotten a great job where he's not stressed out anymore...

I had to quit my job because I got promoted and didn't get the option to be back to my lower position (it was less stressful), and now been like 8 months jobless.

2017, my bf's friend passed away from cancer...

2018, finally we could afford a small holiday to another state, we got back, we find out one of our cats almost died from a kidney disease, my last bits of savings to keep him going. He's healthier again and happy, and I'm glad I did it, but damn it, I know I should appreciate what I have, but I hate myself so much lately:

It's hard with my bf who isn't very emotional and we never do things together like watch a movie or anything, we just sit on our computers and talk to each other; I had a talk with him and maybe I got through him finally, but I just wish he would do something out of his way for me since I suprise him with his favourite snacks when he calls and has had a bad day, I listen to him every night complain about work, I cook and clean and I do pay for my own rent and bills since I have savings...

I'm just so tired of crying every night now, I called my bf's mother and wished her a happy Birthday, but they wanted to cut it short and kept asking about what I'm doing with myself...it made me feel baaad.

I've just been feeling like crap, I don't want to call lifeline because with all my problems they tell me to see a psychiatrist, and the last time I saw one he gave me medication that made me too tired. I went back, and he tried to give me even more medication on top of that. I have been functioning without medication for years after all of this crap, I know I need to work on finding a job, I'm not sitting around sleeping or being depressed, but I am so frustrated in not finding any jobs I want.

I just want a normal cashier job where I can scan items, talk to customers and go home. Not sales where I'm pressured to reach targets, not food because people blame you for everything (at least as a cashier you sell it as it is, not actually making the product)...and it seems just too much to ask for nowadays.

Not to mention I'm desperate to get attention all the time lately: I never get compliments from my boyfriend and I give him loads; but I don't know people or have friends that are into the same things as I am. Even with my boyfriend's family I feel like an idiot: His granddad went out driving with me, and I almost hit a gas tank and for that I feel everybody thinks I'm an idiot.

I just don't know why I should continue on: I always try to think it will get better, but then thinks always get even worse and worse...I'm even worried now that something will go wrong with my taxes and what I waste I am, I'm an idiot who can't do anything.

I always wanted to be a graphic designer, I did a bachelor of digital media but only two subjects were about graphic design and it was bullshit to create some kind of art piece, not following a brief whatsoever. I did 2 internships who both said my knowledge was lacking and was mostly changing facebook banners or marketing and I hate it now. Even becoming an illustrator, my art work never sells, it's not good enough no matter how hard I try.


I'm so tired, I just want advice or someone to listen to me without being tired or angry that I'm emotional again (Because I know how annoying it is to hear it all the time, I don't want to burden people I love with it all the time, god knows if my bf still has the strength to want to be with me)."

This is kind of connected to the previous one. I have 3 colleges I can go to 100% and those three look the best to me. 
One is in the middle of a huge city(plus for me), good food,  no engineering program but has a computer science program, but great internship opportunities. 
Two is in that same city suburb, has an engineering and computer science program, my gf is going there, bad food, a bit harder to get internships. 
Three is in the middle of no where but it has a vibe I really like, they have a computer science and an engineering program, great food, but the only internships would have to be done over the summer. 

Idk do I have my priorities straight? 

Edit: cost isn’t a concern the state takes care of 70% of my tuition and my parents take care of the rest (thank god)

But the city college is the most expensive"

Without the structure of my college, I ended up isolated from my friends and colleagues and struggled to get any internships and jobs in the field, only having my part-time receptionist job to fall on to keep me from being a NEET and I felt like a failure for not having any motivation to build my portfolio and get a job despite being once considered ""The Golden Egg"" from my family and friends. 

For over 2 years since graduating, I've been saving up to enter a developer bootcamp program like Hack Reactor to supplement my degree and give me structure in developing my experience in software engineering and getting a good job on the field. I still struggle with my illnesses, so I believe that is the best chance I have of motivating myself to build a strong porfolio/ resume and getting my dream job through the bootcamp's connections, resources, and mentors.

I'm really not super thrilled with my college options this year, and I was wondering about the possibility of re-applying during my gap year. 

Right now I've been accepted to a school that I like and has a very good program for what I want to study, but it is in a foreign country and I am not quite willing to make that commitment. I was also waitlisted at many schools, including one of my top choices. I am trying to get off the waitlist for that school, but I am quite set on taking a gap year and would not be able to do so in the unlikely event that I am accepted off the waitlist. I have some really exciting internships set up for my gap year, which I can only do during the school year which is why the gap year is so important to me.

So my question is: what if I decline all my college offers, re-take my ACT to improve the score, and apply ED to the school I got waitlisted at (I applied RD the first round.) Are there any reasons why that would be a terrible idea? The only thing I'm really worried about is that my grades for senior year have experienced a bit of a drop from junior year because I have been taking much harder classes. Anyone with any experience that could offer advice?

Thanks so much!!"
8at4yr,2,2018-04-08,Most of the times I talk to my mom it ends up in some argument,MaterialPlantain,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8at4yr/most_of_the_times_i_talk_to_my_mom_it_ends_up_in/,"Hi reddit using a throwaway for obvious reasons..

I honestly don't know why but I have such a shitty relationship with my mom. I care about my mom to death, but literally almost every time I talk to her we end up fighting about some bullshit. (sorry for potentially cursing alot im about to go on a big rant)

So I'm 19, on my first year of college, financial aid is paying for my tuition and she's paying for my apartment / food. She just got remarried so she is financially stable, it's just that throughout highschool she went through a horrible divorce with my dad and i don't speak to him at all. 

She's been telling me to get a job to help pay for the rent and I guess just to be responsible and I respect that so I've been job hunting. My college had a part-time job fair and I attended and ended up having an interview for an internship at a big tech company. I told her about my  interview and how it went well, and I told her it might be an internship and she literally disregarded the good news on how I had a good interview (and how this could potentially end up landing me a well paying job in the future). And started complaining about how she wants me to get a good paying job now.. I was literally so excited, and I thought for once my mom would be proud of me and she literally made me feel like such shit that I just hung up the phone on her.

So anyways I got a call from a grocery store who really treats their workers well and they want to interview me. My friend from highschool who works their in a different location started talking to me about his interview and how he wore a full suit (without a coat), and how he ironed it, and I remembered how my mom offered to get me a cheap little steamer a couple weeks before, and I ended up texting my mom asking if she could possibly get me a cheap steamer just like she offered. She ended up calling me instead of texting me back and her voice sounded rude from the start, she started telling me ""I'm not gonna let your friends control your choices in life."" And I had no idea what she was talking about, and i just asked what's her problem, she started saying ""you're always getting influenced by your friends to be doing things you shouldnt do"" which really isn't true at all, I live my life under my choices, I've never been pushed into doing something I dont want to do. So I told her that this could be a good paying job and that the company really cares about their employees and she said ok well I'm not getting you a steamer just because your friend told you to get one. 
And at that point I got so frustrated and I told her that (I really shouldnt have said this but i just blew up cause im sick of my mom acting like this) ""every single thing that comes out of your mouth is bullshit, you never think before you speak, you always put me down when I have something to tell you that I'm proud of, and that nothing is ever good enough for you"". She said that she didnt want to talk to me anymore and she hung up and started texting me saying that shes not a good enough mom for me, and just playing the victim card on me as per usual.

I really don't know what the fuck my moms problem is.. I'm assuming she said I'm pushed into doing things because I told her I stopped taking my antidepressants because I want to be able to drink, and that I've tried alcohol before in the past (shes extremely straight edged, so that was a pretty big thing to her). She also mentioned that my roommate pushes me into doings, which literally isn't true at all (i literally get a vibe that he doesn't like me hanging out with his friends bc of jealousy). So when I go out to drink or I smoke it's usually on my own or with my own friends..

Literally ever since that damn divorce I feel like my mom would try to take out her frustrations on me. I'm not trying to accuse my mom for abuse, but like during highschool she literally lost her shit a couple of times and would scream at me like going crazy, and try hitting me (I always stopped her from doing anything since I was stronger than her, but I've never hit her just pushed her away from me.)

I always thought I had depression because I wasted 2 years trying to get with this one girl I had a huge crush on, and ended up getting rejected really hard by her, but honestly I think it comes from my parents.. One of them completely abandoning me for some woman and her family and then trying to destroy the woman who raised me, and the other who's mood is always changing nowadays..

i really dont know what to do to fix my relationship with her, it honestly kills me just thinking about it

sorry if this may have been confusing i really needed to rant and this was all off the top of my head..  thanks for reading 
if you need any clarifications just quote whatever part your confused with and i'll let you know..

**tldr i guess**
I honestly don't know what to do, my mom never seems happy with anything I do, we always fight, and i sometimes feel like shes the reason I get stressed / depressed.

would really appreciate the advice, or just anything you'd have to say

Anyways, I can only look forward now so I'd like to know how I can better my situation and move towards some sort of goal. I definitely enjoy computer science as a major but also have surface level interests in psychology, neuroscience and cognitive science. Basically, I want to now make the most use of the oppurtunites in front of me and don't really know how to do that. What are the possible careers that encompass the topics I mentioned above? 
What steps could I take to increase my understanding of those topics? Any Links? Books? Should I email a professor for research oppurtunites (planning on doing that but am delaying)? 

Also, I haven't done any computer science projects, don't have any friends in the field yet and have no internships. My GPA is ok, 3.65. 

Not only am I overwhelmed by career options(I have many interests) which leads to me inaction and avoidance but even when I say to myself that I'm gonna focus on my degree, I get overwhelmed by what next steps should I take. For example, should I work towards internships? Networking? Research? 

I don't know where to start. Some practical advice on dealing with inaction and some sort of guidance on what my next step should be would be helpful. What can I do in the next year or two to change my life socially and academically and make the best use of the oppurtunies presented to me by society? 

TLDR: Struggling with inaction and self doubt from too many interests but have an interest in the topics mentioned and want to move towards it. I also worry too much.

Looking for something else in IT 

Hello all,

I’m a recent graduate (May 2017) who’s been working as a software engineer for a little under a year now (hired June 2017). I have mostly enjoyed the work I’ve done but lately I’ve found the stress and duties of the job aren’t what I wanted it to be. I wouldn’t say I’m “bad” at what I do, I just feel that a job where the main purgative isn’t put on hitting development deadlines would be better for me.

I had internship experience during my undergrad (3 summers) in development and also in an IT analyst role. I wanted to look into that role as a career option. 

I was posting here to see if anyone else had similar experiences in development and what they did or if I could get some advice on how to work out these current work issues. 

Thanks in advance! "

I like drawing (pixel art), I’ve always had a dream to create a comic based on the world of a popular webcomic, but I’m afraid to be derivative, I’m barely good enough at art to do even a proof of concept, and my characters are lifeless and halfformed. 

I started a practice comic and then a full comic a week ago, but it’s not good enough. I’m afraid of it, and I’m rushing into it without planning anything so I don’t get choked by anxiety. I want to start over every time I look at it, but I worry I wouldn’t get anywhere. 

Am I wasting my time trying to create something by myself? Should I keep trying to learn more programming, or should I just hope my classes give me enough experience?

Bit of background: I completed my bachelor's in English linguistics and have already taken and passed the ELA subject area exam. I am currently enrolled as a master's degree student in a teacher certification program for secondary ed, graduating Spring 2019.

Though my background is in English, I have been thinking about switching over to math. I am good at math, but I will need to study before I feel prepared to take the subject area exam because it's been so long.

I am also thinking of switching my degree program from MAC (masters and certification) to inMAC (intern masters and certification). The difference is with an inMAC degree, I would actually be hired at a school as the teacher of record for two years while I complete my certification and masters, taking classes at night. My state (AZ) has a separate certificate for this, called the intern certificate. The school has to go through a few extra steps to make sure that I am set up with a mentor teacher to guide me through.

Now to the situation at hand: there is a job fair this Saturday near me. I've never been to one before - not even for nonteaching careers. I know I should have my resume, cover letter, and recommendation letters handy, and come dressed for an interview. However, I am not really sure what else to expect. I am open to teaching any grade from 7-12.

If anyone can give me a general idea of how it goes at school job fairs, I would be very grateful. I also have a few specific questions:

1. I know AZ is super hurting for teachers, but how much are we hurting for English teachers? (How hard will it be for me to land a job *in English* as an intern teacher?)

2. Would it be helpful to mention that I am planning to switch to math sometime in the future, or would that confuse things? (I am not allowed to switch subjects while getting my masters, so the earliest I would be able to change to math is in two years.)

3. Has anyone done the intern certificate, and would you recommend it? Even if you're not in AZ, I'd be interested in hearing from you if your state does something similar.

Thanks for your help!"

Because of this, I'm afraid I may have to go back to school. I've been accepted into a master's program at a decent state school (with my declared emphasis being power engineering), but I feel woefully unprepared and I'm worried about still having poor employment prospects after graduating. I'm also considering earning a BS in computer science because of the field's seemingly rosier future and higher demand for graduates (see https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/stem-jobs-industry-careers.html). It's also possible that I'm not intelligent enough to earn a master's in EE.

The choice is mine to make, but I thought I'd express my thoughts in case anyone disagrees with my rationale. Any advice would be appreciated.

8ay3gh,0,2018-04-09,Yep,sherpawrpa,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8ay3gh/yep/,"I'm not going to live through 2018. I used to believe I was a survivor, and for awhile I probably was. Also for any mods who think they're smart, I'm behind over 9000 proxies, so good luck.

Eight years ago I was diagnosed with PTSD. Four years ago I was diagnosed with cancer, and had to drop out of school to get a full time job to pay for insurance/healthcare. Cancer went into remission two years ago ironically only to lose my best friend shortly after. All the people who I thought cared or were my friends disappeared and dropped out of my life the second I reached out for help. The only resources that I have to reach out to now is a mental health system that honestly doesn't give a shit about it's patients. So as someone with way more experience than the vast majority of people who would recommend me to get help; fuck off. I have, and probably ended up more fucked up than when I first started getting help.

Mental health facilities are a fucking joke in the United States. The VA is useless when it comes to the treatment of PTSD, or any health treatment as far as I'm concerned. The vast majority of civi mental health units outside of the VA that I've been to (And yes, I've been to a lot -- over 10 at this point with some having multiple visits) are just glorified drug and alcohol rehab facilities that have a psychiatrist on staff that allows them to also accept mental health patients, as far as insurance companies are concerned, at least. While I'm sure this great for people with drug, alcohol, or dual diagnosis issues, this doesn't really help anyone else. Anyone who knows me will tell you I don't drink or do drugs (Probably the reason why I don't have anymore friends, to be honest). These places are not going to help people who legitimately only have mental health issues and need help. All they're going to do is take advantage of you, and your insurance, especially if you're there against your will. All you do at these facilities is sit around for 3-7 days being bored, watching TV (If you're lucky enough to have one in a group room), and going to one group a day that is patient lead since all the intern social worker does, who hasn't even graduated yet, just sits and listens, and doesn't really add much value to the groups. I've been to the one (And only) mental health unit in my state that is specifically for trauma patients, and while this unit was far more valuable than the others, didn't really help much because I found out that talking about my problems doesn't really do much for me. It also sent me off to yet another outpatient facility that was literally a drug and alcohol rehab facility because they had no where else to send me, and didn't want to release me without some sort of care. Thanks.

I have one of the most recognized psychiatrists in my region, but drugs only do so much. The only medication that has helped with the nightmares unfortunately also had the side effect of causing me to have more suicidal thoughts. Nothing has really helped with the flashbacks and panic attacks. The regimen of medicine that I've been taking consists of over 15 pills daily, and this is on the lower side of what I have taken in the past.

Last year I managed to break my neck, and pretty much destroy the right side of my body. That's not even the worst part. I somehow made a pretty good recovery. The worst part was when I realized the sad truth of where I was at in my life. When I was in the hospital, I had people I hadn't seen in *years* coming out of the woodwork to see me in the hospital all of the sudden. Where were these people when I actually needed them though? Where were they when my closest friend passed away? Where were they a few months after I got out of the hospital, and reached out for help to everyone I could think of? The worst part was realizing that people seem to only care when they can see you physically in pain. Apparently they could give two shits about me when it concerned any mental health issues.

I can't even remember the last time I had more than 3-4 hours of sleep. I'm having more panic attacks each week than I've ever had in my life even though I'm on more anti-anxiety meds than I've ever been on. The only people who seemingly care about me anymore are medical specialists my insurance is paying for me to see. I'm in more medical debt than I'll ever be able to pay off in 10 lifetimes thanks to said insurance refusing to pay for any of the surgeries required after my accident last year. I probably won't have insurance by the end of the year because I can't afford it anymore, so bye-bye psychiatrist and psychologist. And at this point with all this stress, I probably wouldn't be surprised if I died from some cardiac related issue before I could kill myself.

All the friends I ever had are either dead or not returning calls/texts, my family is pretty much fucking worthless. I'm mostly writing this in the hope that anyone recommending mental health units as a form of help to stop doing that, and do some research before continuing to spout of useless information to people who are already in a vulnerable position. And if you've gone to a mental health unit, and had nothing good come out of it, you're not the only one. So don't think it's you that's the problem as much as it's just the mental health system failing to actually help it's patients. There is far too much research being done in the pharma field, when there is an increasing need for far more research to be done on the neuro and psych side of mental health. Pharma is just a bandaid.

tl;dr: fuck this big dumb earth and it's big dumb pharma. goodbye forever~"

It's mostly a collection of useful terms and resources to know, like Big Tech freshman internship programs (most internships do not seriously consider freshmen), with links to find out more about them.

 I plan to update my guide soon with answers to questions like ""when should I apply to Fall or Spring (instead of Summer) internships"", so if you have any suggestions of information to include let me know! I also plan to write a second guide targeted at students interested in undergrad research in STEM, especially CS."

Since my sophomore year, I have tried to get a structural/design internship over the summer, but with absolutely no luck. 
As an undergrad, I was an outstanding student: 3.9 GPA (damn dynamics causing me to lose my 4.0) and actually enjoyed the material presented to us in lecture. I have good communication skills and am personable even though I would consider myself as an introvert. 
Every year, I apply to every structural internship I find around me yet no luck. I had one research type internship and one internship in the civil field and even that one I landed because of a family friend that put in a good word for me. 
However, I see students with much less engineering knowledge and understanding getting such jobs over me. In such cases, the students had connections to people within the company through frats, clubs, etc. I had my resume looked at and have gotten fairly good comments about it so I do not think it is my resume that is throwing employers off. However, after over 100 structural internship applications I have NEVER EVEN GOTTEN A CALL BACK. This has now continued into my grad school career as well. 
It is incredibly frustrating and is making me doubt my future in the field that I love and have invested so much into. I do not understand why some employers seems to value “connections” more than merit, especially in a structural design field. 
I admit that I have done a poor job of networking and am realizing this is a crucial part of engineering. However, the fact that I have never even had an interview based on my accomplishments as a student baffles me. 
Have others had the same experience? Does it happen a lot in the industry (full time/non-internship jobs) as well? 
If anyone has any tips on how to help land such a job please let me know. 
I am set to graduate from the masters program in December, so landing a design internship this summer is an absolute must for me. "

I hope I can get a little insight to my dilemma, maybe someone out there went thru the same feelings or is going thru it. This is actually really hard and embarrassing for me to talk about but I have no idea what to do with my CS Degree I will be obtaining this May 2018. A little background, I go to a small Liberal arts college and to be honest going into this college I was not intending to major in CS. I originally was following a Pre-Med Path with a major in Psychology but after a year and thinking ""I dont want to go to Med School anymore"" I decided to go into CS because I've always liked computers and as a kid growing up I was always the tech guy in my household. If i originally wanted to follow the CS path from the beginning I would not have gone to the school I go to right now, because our CS Program is very small and the courses they offer vary from semester to semester so you can't really ""specialize"" or ""focus"" on something. But i didnt feel like going through the ordeal of transferring so i stuck through with it. I never had the opportunity to do internships ( I did apply to some, not as many as I should have, but the ones i tried to apply i didnt get in), I feel like I dont really remember much of what I was taught and I'd have to go back and really review in order to refresh my memory, I think I am terrible when I have to have a tech conversation (its just very difficult for me) and I'm probably an average programmer. I mean I did survive the major while I saw my friends drop it, so that must mean something right? I'm just lost. Any advice on what my next step could possibly be?

I'm a full stack web developer in my 3rd year of professional experience (no internships). Just started a new job at a big company (though, not a tech company). I'm self taught - got good grades in high school but no higher education. On the job I've worked mainly with PHP, C#, and Java (and of course HTML, CSS, JS). 

I'm proud of how well I'm doing (took a lot of hard work!) but so far I've always been the least capable person in the room. Capable, but capable like a pocket knife, whittling away at my nice, contained projects right next to these full blown chain saws around me with their decades of experience and fancy CS degrees.

I know it's going to take a lot more work and raw experience to get where they are and I'm down with that. I just don't want it to take another 20 years for me to get there.

I'm not interested in a college degree cause it seems like a huge waste of time/money when I'm already in the field getting paid to learn on the job. But I do want to have a deep understanding of computer science fundamentals, design patterns, and such.

What I think I need is a CS career coach (or maybe several). Someone experienced who knows the landscape and can point me in the right direction to help get get where I want to go. How can I find someone like that?

If not that, then I think what I need is some sort of curriculum or study map. There's tons of stuff on line, but it's hard to find comprehensive study materials rather than bootcamps and ""learn x in y weeks""

What would all you experienced giants wish upon your past selves when you were as fresh as I am?

Uh, I work in an undisclosed research facility roughly 10 km south of the Ross Ice Shelf. A team of 5 other researchers and I were tasked with the job of retrieving ice cores from the shelf and dating the ice inside. The rest doesn’t matter as I need to get this up as soon as possible. I am going to copy my log of important activity from my arrival up until now. My name is Mike and I’ve been trapped in Antarctica for a month.

--

March 8, 2018

The crew and I arrived have arrived at the undisclosed research facility. This one is much smaller than your average Antarctican research facility. There is only a barracks, common building, and a research wing. We each settled into our respective rooms in the barracks. It is not a luxurious room. It only has a bed, desk, and closet. It is going to need a lot of work to make me feel at home for the next 7 months I will be here. We all agreed to take the rest of the night off to get some sleep and get some work done in the morning.

--

March 9, 2018

We all had alarms set for 0700. We all showered and dressed to meet up in the common building to get our bearings. Simon and Todd were already inside the common building drinking coffee by the time I arrived. They have both been in this business for the last 20 years of their lives. They have been working together since 2006. Simon is your average looking scientist; short white hair, glasses and very professional. Todd is a few years younger than Simon with a buzz cut and very short temper. Todd can be very eccentric, but he and Simon seem to work well together so I don't hold it against him.

I walked with Sarah and Jeanie to the commons. Sarah has been working in Antarctica for 5 years, Jeanie for 2 years. However, they have never worked together. Sarah has long brown hair she keeps up in a ponytail. Jeanie has had my attention since I arrived. She is a tantalizing redhead and very friendly. I know it is unprofessional, but she is gorgeous.

I came with my boss Kate, who I am an intern for. She has been studying ice cores for all of her life. She put this crew together for this study. She is a strict brunette who only cares for her job. She showed up in the commons shortly after I did. Kate took me on a tour of the research building while the other 4 talked in the commons. She showed me how each of the instruments worked and what they did. I reminded her I was an intern, not a tourist, and that I knew what all of these were used for and what they did.

Upon returning to the group they were getting their gear on to go out into the desert. Yes, Antarctica is a desert. Antarctica gets, on average, about 8 inches of precipitation a year. All deserts are not blistering. Anyway we bundled up for the 10 km journey in the -10°C/20°F weather. We gathered into our Ford E series icechallenger van and were off. We surveyed the area where we would be coring for a few hours and returned back to the base.

--

Mike here. I should state that all three buildings are connected which means we only go outside to retrieve the ice cores.

March 10, 2018

Today was the first day out in the field so this entry will be short as I did not have my log out there. Nothing important to note today. Future logs will only include important updates as I do not want to be cooped up in my dorm away from everyone. 

--

March 16, 2018 

We lost Simon today. As in we cannot find him. The small camp we set up where we will be coring has a few tents we were all sitting in as he was drilling into the ice. We heard the machine stop grinding into the ice much too soon. We opened the tent and saw Simon was not on the drill. We searched everywhere in the 200 square foot camp we set up. If you didn’t know, in Antarctica all you see is white. We all wear bright orange jackets out here for this reason. There was no orange in sight besides our own jackets. We came back to the base early today. Todd doesn’t seem himself.

Update 21:30

After dinner at the base we were starting to settle in for the night when Jeanie called for everyone to come into the commons. She was looking out the front window and was pointing out into the vast whiteness. I turned on my voice recorder and went over to her.

Voice record 1 begin.

“Do you guys see that? The white thing moving around out there.” Jeanie said.

“It’s all white out there Jeanie what are you talking about?” Todd said.

“No, it has a human shape, but it’s…white. Like-” Jeanie stated. 

“Like the Ningen?” Todd spouted angrily.

We all know the stories of the ningen around here.

“I mean, is it so impossible? There is no one else here but us Todd, and-“

“I’m not listening to any of this. We LOST Simon today and you’re gonna pull this shit? No thanks I’m going to the bunks.” Todd walked out of the commons.

“Jeanie really? The ningen? Come on.” Sarah said.

Voice record 1 end.

The group stated disbanding at this point. I stayed with Jeanie and watched out the window with her. I could see something. It was just wandering around our vehicles right in front of the base. The inside lights barely illuminating the figure. It was looking inside at us and moving its hand across the vehicle in a very particular motion. I left Jeanie at this point and went to my bunk.

--

March 17, 2018

Todd is refusing to leave his room today. I am not going to fight him on this one. 
Sarah and Jeanie are working in the research wing.
Kate and I are going out to the camp to pick up some more cores. 

Update 14:00

I noticed something on the icechallenger we took to the camp. It had an “S” carved into the driver side door. I informed Kate and she said to let it go before we returned to the base.

Update 23:00

I found Jeanie setting up a camera at the window we saw the figure in last night. She said if anything moves tonight this camera will catch it. 

--

March 18, 2018

In the morning Jeanie and I reviewed the camera as Sarah and Kate tried to get the research mission back on track by going to drill for more cores. Todd was still in his room. He only came out to eat yesterday. When we approached the camera I noticed Sarah’s mouth agape. The camera was there, but what we saw was something we needed to review on the camera right away. 

An “I” had been carved into the window glass. 

The camera revealed nothing. No pictures. No video. It didn’t catch anything. We were dumbfounded.

I’m becoming uneasy.

March 26, 2018

The last 8 days went by with nothing new developing of the situation. Today changed that. Kate and Sarah have been working together a lot recently. Todd stays in his room all day now. Jeanie and I have become closer during this unsettling adventure. Sarah and Kate told us to go to the camp to get her research logs she left down there the day prior. I think it was to get us out of the base to get some fresh air and forget some of this stuff going on. 
Upon arriving at the camp we retrieved the notes and started back to the icechallenger. Jeanie called my name and I came over to where she was standing inside one of the tents. 

She turned to me and held up a bright orange jacket…with an “M” torn out of the material.

We returned to the base as fast as we could and showed Sarah and Kate. Kate ripped the jacket out of Jeanie’s hands and threw it in the trash. I turned my voice recorder on behind my back.

Voice Record 2 begin

“Kate what the hell has been wrong with you?” I asked.

“Mike we are not doing this right now. Forget the jacket. Forget the 'S' the 'I' and the 'M'. Now!” Kate told me emphatically.

“The 'S'?” Jeanie asked.

“Yeah” I said, “it was carved into the icechallenger door, where that thing was standing.”

Jeanie ran outside in the cold without her protective clothing.

“Mike god damnit we are here to do research not fuck around with superstitions!” Kate shouted.

“Kate why are you being so defensive over all of this?” asked Sarah.

“I am responsible for Mike. He is my intern. His first mission in the field is under my guidance. How would it look for me if he came back and this was all he had to show for this trip? I’m trying to save both of our asses. I don’t know what is going on, but it is not my job to figure it out.”

Voice record 2 end.

Jeanie came back in a few minutes later and stayed in my room with me for the night.

Jeanie asked me to record our conversation so we can get everything we know all in one place.

Voice record 3 begin.

""I don't like this Mike, I know I saw something out there. Why won't Kate do anything?"" Asked Jeanie.

""I've been her intern for almost 4 months now Jeanie, when she has a job to do, that's all she focuses on. But this, I don't know. This isn't something to just put behind you."" I tried to reassure her. ""Kate is the most experienced here. She will do what will keep us safe.""

""Okay, but how do you explain what we've found. S-I-M. That thing has Simon and it's toying with us! What else are we going to find with letters carved into it?"" Jeanie said shaking.

""I don't know Jeanie. Let's just try to get some sleep and calm down.""

Voice record 3 end.

Jeanie shut off my recorder and we tried to get some sleep that night.

--

March 22, 2018

With everything that has been going on recently, Sarah has been keeping to herself now too. Today she came up to Jeanie and me and told us she was leaving. She said she couldn’t stay here with Kate acting the way she is along with Simon and the letters. She is taking the second icechallenger we haven’t used yet to the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station to await an evacuation from the continent. We said our goodbyes and she was off. We did not inform Kate until Sarah was gone.

Todd has stopped replying to our requests to come out of his bunk.

--

March 28, 2018

Jeanie and I went with Kate to the camp to collect more ice cores. Jeanie and I were in a tent going over notes trying to stay focused on the research. Kate came in with a new core and told us to work on it. Each core we get is from further and further out on the shelf. The readings should be similar and so far they have been. 

Upon laying the core down next to the machine and starting the reading Jeanie and I both had a bad feeling. The screen was only showing an “O” and no different reading would show up from this core nor did any other we tried. Jeanie and I both knew what was coming next. 

We called for Kate to come look at the reading. She was not happy with our joke and said it had gone on far enough. She got in the icechallenger and drove off without us. She left us in the cold 10 km away from base. Jeanie and I decided to walk back to camp before it became late and got colder.

We started following the tracks from the icechallenger and about 15 minutes into our walk it started to snow. The snow mixed with the wind was covering the tracks. Something I should mention is that in Antarctica there are very few landmarks to keep your bearings. Humans and animals do not walk in straight lines. We tend to curve ever so slightly. This is how people become lost in cornfields and such. Along with the lack of landmarks and the snow flurry we were experiencing, our fate was looking bleak. 

And that’s when we saw it.

The white figure emerged from the snow. It was a tall figure. Long arms and legs. The head was human shaped, but the eyes and mouth were that of a dolphin. Big empty black eyes and a wide open mouth with very small serrated teeth. It stuck its pointy fingers up and pointed. We followed its hand with our eyes to see Kate driving the icechallenger back to the camp. We had strayed so far from the path we could barely even see the deep blue vehicle in the snow. We started to run toward the camp. We ran to the icechallenger and jumped in and told Kate to gun it back to the base. Kate however was not in the vehicle when we got there. Jeanie and I booked it back to the camp with the GPS in the vehicle. We ran inside and locked all the doors leading outside. We ran to Todd’s room and started banging on the door to let us in. I noticed snow coming from under his door. Jeanie and I started slamming into the door until it finally gave way.

We found Todd’s body on the ground being covered in snow.

A blood red “N” carved in his chest.

--

March 29, 2018

Todd’s body was gone this morning.

--

April 3, 2018

Jeanie and I have gotten the rest and small break we needed. We decided to get back to work and try to put this behind us. Help won’t come. There’s no point in trying. This unusual snow storm is keeping everyone out of the air.
We have decided to just continue to do our research.

--

And now you are all caught up to today. 

April 10, 2018

Today we were out the farthest we had been coring for ice. I was guiding the drill down into the ice while Jeanie was next to me when all of the sudden the drill dropped like it had went through the bottom of the ice. Now the Ross Ice Shelf is several hundred meters thick. There is no way I would have went through the bottom. I pulled the drill up and to my surprise it was covered in blood.

Jeanie and I quickly pulled the core out of the drill and saw the flesh and muscle that was in the drill. We knew it was Simon. The Ningen had been leading us to find this. It had somehow gotten Simon’s body deep inside the ice. Jeanie and I rushed back to the base for the final time.

We have locked all doors leading inside as well as blocked all corridors leading out of the common building.

We have enough supplies to last a few months in here, but we don't think we will.

Tonight the sun sets for the winter in Antarctica.

I want to thank VA_Network_Nerd for his detailed response and helping me out. I am new in the IT path, and have been doing my own constant homework on IT and degrees in general. I recently got a volunteer IT gig at my church helping the IT admin, which is a little overwhelming since he loan me his CCNA book to help educate me. Though we been doing simple IT stuff, so it is mostly fine. I have other ideas to help get me more experience, however I have been struggling with the CompSci vs IS/MIS/CIS degree path. I avoided CompSci because I am not interested in development, and it just a degree I kinda did not want to go into, I am not the greatest with math or science, and I do not think i would enjoy CS classes. However I hear stories of people saying CompSci is a ""better"" degree for IT work in general and I might be overlooked for having a IS/MIS/CIS degree, however I have heard other stories of how great IS/MIS/CIS major is. I know experience is king in IT, but it can be discouraging sometimes.

I followed VA's advise and went to the career fair, and it was one big CompSci fest. Companies in my area want dev people, I kinda felt sad for the other engineering majors because I think I had some more options as a IS major. Though from what I gathered at the fair for IS/MIS/CIS majors was IT security and project management positions (there may be more in the fall career fair). I did not get any Internships because I am not a junior yet.

My current plan so far is doing my IS/MIS/CIS degree path with a minor in CompSci just so I have the technical knowledge of programming (I do not mind learning programming it just sounds boring and tedious to me). I do not have a precise ideal career path in IT yet, I like the idea of INFOSEC, project management sounds like fun, and network admin/engineer too. Though would it be harder to get these position with an IS degree? I like the IS/MIS/CIS path, on paper it seems to interest me the most with all of the options, though I do have an open mind of its limitations. It unfortunately has been a stressful time dealing with this dilemma, and dealing with the IS stigma of being the CS dropout major. Though I do not want to re-major in CS because I know I would be miserable in it. I just do not want to make a mistake that blows up in my face later on in my career.

Any advise will help!"

Figured it was finally time I made an account to ask questions on this sub. Here’s my situation:

I have fairly decent stats:
1550 SAT
4.0 UW
4.4 W (junior year, will be higher senior year as I’m taking more APs then)
Fair amount of APs, honors courses, etc. and a few academic awards

BUT— weak ECs. 
-JV soccer (9-11 and not continuing senior year)
-Played club soccer for 2 years (9-10)
-Varsity track (11-12)
-2 years of a service organization outside of school, and was Historian for one of those years (10-11) 
-2 years of a school service club (11-12)
-I did Girl Scouts for 3-4 years when I was a preteen but I’m not sure if that counts
-A summer job (10-12)
-Taking a course related to my intended major at my local community college over the summer after junior year (11)
-Had some photos I’ve taken recognized by photo galleries and companies (11)
-Occasionally volunteer at local shelter for a few hours on weekends (11-12)

Compared to my friends and people on this sub, these seem pretty weak. I searched around for internships and opportunities related to my intended major, but couldn’t really find anything. 

So, how screwed am I? Any ideas of what I can do?"

I've seen a lot of posts on this sub about software engineering internship experiences but not a lot about research interns. Just wanted to ask some questions for anyone who was a research intern previously.

1) Which are you treated more as: a scientist (lit reviews, formulating questions) or a engineer (implementing research projects using SWE tools)?

2) Are you expected to publish a paper by the end of the internship (12 weeks)?

3) How big were your teams, and who do you work with on a daily basis? 

4) How much independence do you have (is your manager/advisor always looking over your shoulder)?

Some maybe relevant information: I'm an junior undergrad, most likely working on machine learning/deep learning applications at IBM Research in Austin, TX.

Seeking advice after doing some lurking.,throwawayyfreshman,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8b8bz8/entering_high_school_in_the_fall_seeking_advice/,"So, I'll be entering freshmen year of high school.  I've been lurking on this sub for the past 6 months just to see what the college application process is like.  First of all, half of these posts are super inspiring (people improving their SAT scores, getting into T20 schools, etc).  The other half are scary af because people seem to be doing all the right things, but shit still doesn't work out.  Anyway, I'm here to ask you ""what would be your advice to someone starting freshman year"".  I have a clean slate.  What I've gleamed from my time lurking here:

* Class rank &amp; GPA are super important.
* Get involved in ECs
* Practice the SAT, take it more than once.  Lots of online resources (Khan academy, Uworld, etc.)  Tutors &amp; Kaplan are probably wastes of money if you've got the discipline.
* Do stuff over the summers (internships, research, etc). 
* Don't obsess about T20 schools, but yeah I want to go to one.
* Don't forget to have fun, but not too much fun.
 
About me:

* White, male, living in Texas
* Wanna go into engineering or CS
* I'm definitely type-A (as you can guess).
* Always been an A student
* UT Austin is on my list given it's reputation and proximity to home, but I'd obviously love to go to an MIT, Cal tech, etc.
* Thinking of going to TAMS, which is this STEM school for 11th &amp; 12th grade. 
* My folks are probably upper-middle class, so need-based aid will be limited/non-existent.  They've always pushed me, but aren't completely nuts.
 
So questions:

* How many ECs should I shoot for?  I'm in band and track at my middle school. I plan on doing those in high school.  I don't want to overdo it.  I know there isn't a magic number.
* Is there anything you wish you had done at this point in the game?  Like if a time machine showed up. 
* How do I develop a relationship with teachers so they write me a good letter of rec?  
* Is it too early for me to be doing this stuff?
* Anyone been to TAMS, or know more about the culture there?

Thanks everyone!

I started an internship about a month before graduating in mid-december.  The internship was supposed to end next month, in May. I wasn't thrilled about the prospect of staying an intern after graduation, but I was willing to accept it since it was only 4-5 months. However, apparently the company is now extending it to July 31st.  I was already feeling a little questionable about still being in an internship instead of a full time position 4-5 months after graduating.  Because of this I was a little annoyed as I was ready to transition to full time soon.  My questions are the following:

1)  Does it look bad to still be in an internship for 4-5 (or 7-8 with the extension) months after graduating?  Would this make it more difficult to find positions?  

2)  Is it normal to have an internship start before graduating and then go through graduation?  I know it was a little different since it started so close to my graduation. 

3)  What should I do?  I really like this company and I've enjoyed working here.  The pay is average for my area (for an intern.)  My manager said that they are planning on giving me a full time offer and that they would give me details at the beginning of July.  Should I wait until then to see the offer?  Should I start applying to other companies right now?  Should I try to get other offers and leverage them to try to get an offer at my current company sooner?  I already asked my manager about the internship ending and transitioning into fulltime earlier but she said I would have to wait until July.  Something else?  I know the usual answer for this subreddit is to switch jobs, but like I said, I really like it here, and if the offer was competitive, I would be open to accepting it.  The main impact is whether or not it would be harder to find jobs as a result of being an intern so long outside of college.

Also, right now we're thinking of focusing more on building developer tools, but that's kind of hard to do since we haven't really coded in professional settings.

I was able to get in, and eventually they offered me a full position. They also work with my schedule, so I am a full time student during school, and work 20 hours, then during vacations and the summer I work full time (sometimes more).

Being there for almost 4 years, the culture is lackluster and the work is monotonous (not really challenging). I have some friends who go to summer internships, and are getting higher quality experience, with more pay. There are only two developers, myself and a senior developer, and we're woefully out of date technology wise, and general development processes-wise. We don't perform code reviews, unit tests are rarely advocated, and just to get our own git server, I had to do a lot of pushing. My boss is on my side luckily, but even with both of us pushing for change, it doesn't occur, even when it could save time/money.

I'm currently finishing up my second semester as a Junior working towards my B.S. in CS, and have basically taken all of the core courses required for the degree. I've learned a ton at my current job, but now its not challenging, and I fear I'm not improving as well as I could be, with a more challenging job, along with a true development team.

I've tried to apply to full time positions, explaining that I can do full time in the summer, and part time during the school, but rarely are companies, or recruiters, willing to have an employee with such a schedule. 

What should I do? Should I try for a paid internship, then possibly go back to my current job (if they're willing to let me go, then rehire me) or continue applying to full time jobs? Any advice is very appreciated, thanks!"

A little bit about me:
I started a fixed term full time job in January after 3 months of job hunting. The job ends in December due to the end date of the project. I recently graduated and this is my first 'proper' job but ever since I graduated I've wanted to do a masters. 

So, I am thinking of applying for a course with an October 2018 start however I'm not sure whether I should apply for it for full time or part time. 

My job ends in December and I have spoken to my manager who has said that they can only determine whether they would keep me on closer to the time due to budgets and demand etc. This is fair enough however it took me 3 months to find this job and I have currently have access to the full cross-government job database which I'm not sure I want to give up. It will help me to keep my options open after I graduate because there is one department in particular that I would like to work in. Though I'm not limiting myself to public sector and will apply to graduate schemes. 


Options:

1. Stick with the job until it ends in December and do the Masters full time. This would mean working flexibly/part-time from when I start. This would also mean I would lose access to the job database and would be starting from square one when I finish my degree.

2. Do the masters part time. Take a risk and see if they will allow me to continue working after December. If not, I can attempt to find a new job asap in the remaining months that I will have left with them. If I don't find another job in government by December it will be a lose lose situation. I will be able to apply for internships though as I will be a student. I won't be able to apply for graduate schemes as I will not have graduated in that year!

3. Help?? Please let me know if there are better ways of going about this. 


Thanks in advance!!

I've thought of speaking with a therapist or psychiatrist but I dont want to be wasting anyone's time or my money. That is if there's nothing wrong with me.

I used to enjoy drawing a lot, I tried to balance drawing and music and soon music replaced drawing. Music was later replaced by writing after another failed balance act. Then I picked up photography and for a long while I worked at that and a couple years back picked writing back up. Now I have no motivation to do any of it no matter how much I talk myself into it. Even if I have the stuff lying in front of me, I can't get myself to do any of it. I've moved around a couple times for school and internships away from home because I end up feeling stuck and trapped. As soon as I leave I get bored and want to go home but as soon as I'm home I feel trapped again. I've had a couple of incidents in life but I feel others have gone through a lot worse and so I have no real reason to feel sorry for myself. I can't help but feel negative all the time even if I try to stay positive. There's a contstant nagging voice in my head and it's only heightened if I'm inebriated that absolutely nothing matters and that there's no real point to life. What's the point in doing anything if all I'll do is die at some point. Then I get the reality check that I'll be a leeching bum if I dont figure something out. 

My days as of the last 2 or 3 years are filled with scrolling through facebook and not being productive. Should I be on some sort of medication, should I talk to a professional? Is this a normal mentality that I need to find a way to get over or am I just a lazy, whiny, dramatic loser?

8bac98,3,2018-04-10,So anxious and unsure after a couple days at my new job...is it a normal feeling?,pebbletots,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8bac98/so_anxious_and_unsure_after_a_couple_days_at_my/,"I just started a new job this week and it's off to a confusing start. I was hired as an hourly employee on a per project/consulting basis. But not as a consultant. If that makes sense. I go into the office and work on whatever projects they throw my way. I'm still treated as an employee with benefits, a company computer, full-access to information, etc vs what a normal consultant would get. 

The first thing that is confusing is I was told it was a part-time/limited hours job but now I'm told I can be full-time if I want which is great, but will mean I need to quit my other job at a restaurant which I was planning on keeping in case things went south with the consulting gig. I don't want it to a be ""Oh hey we realized how much it actually costs to pay you full-time and we need to scale that way back"" situation. 

There's a steep learning curve with the products and clients I'm working with as they're very technical and advanced. The first project I was given without much explanation or structure but I managed it without too many rounds of edits. 

My supervisor is young and also new at the job and has never had anyone working under her. She is not great at delegating or explaining what she expects which makes it a bit hard to know where to start with projects sometimes. Which I think will just be about taking the time to understand how she works and get used to her style. 

The worst though and giving me the most anxiety is that I already messed up and made a stupid mistake today as I left the office right at 5. I was there my full 8 hours (plus 30 for lunch) but I left before submitting a project I didn't know had a deadline. I got a call from my supervisor asking me where the project was and if it was ready to be reviewed by her as it needed to be fully edited by Thursday. She seemed irritated that it wasn't done before I left. Understandably. I know I messed that up and now know for next time. 

When I got home I finished the edits and sent them over with a note saying basically 'I'm sorry for the confusion. I'll be sure to finish and submit all work before leaving for the day from now on'. Which I think was the right thing to do as I knew as I was walking out of the door that I should have finished the assignment. She responded nicely that she appreciated it and ""see you tomorrow!"" which is good. 

But I still can't help but feel anxious and like I'm floundering with the lack of set schedule, learning curve, already messing up on day 3 and generally being a bit clueless on some things. 

Is this normal to feel this way to an extent? I need to keep this job as it took me ages to get and I'm living abroad where my language skills are lacking. They are hiring another person for the same role soon (they want two people) and also having an intern full-time over the summer. I'm worried I'll be the first to go if work gets slow and I'm feeling really insecure in the position right now especially as I'll have to quit my other job for it. 


TLDR: Feel anxious and insecure at new job over not knowing things and messing up some things. Is it normal at a new job?"

I'm finishing a degree in Computer Science in a few months, but unfortunately during my studies I did not participate in internships or studied for certs. My favorite classes in college have been Operating Systems, Networking, and Security, with the Security class being more focused on theory and frameworks as opposed to actual software or hands-on experience.

My programming is fairly strong and my grades in the above-mentioned classes are strong, but my overall grades from other classes are not as strong. I have experience with various OSes, including compiling kernels from scratch and programming a tiny kernel in C.

The few security positions that I have found in my area seem to require a high GPA and certs with experience, so I cannot apply to those although that kind of work is my end-goal. There is an abundance of IT in my town, but the entry-level positions don't pay as much as the front-end dev positions that are also available (and that I am qualified for), and IT and security interest me more.

What kind of positions in IT that pay higher than entry-level would I be eligible for? Given my experience with operating systems, networking and security, what certs can I jump into that would provide the most benefit for the least cost? From looking at the beginner CompTIA certs, it seems that I already know much of the info, and being a broke college grad I would rather not dole out money to take them if a higher level test might make them redundant.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 Good battery life is very important for when i'm attending classes (so not when gaming - when gaming I will always be plugged in)

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
I need to carry this laptop around for classes and internships all day, so weight matters. My current laptop has given me back problems due to its weight

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
 Windows preferred since its difficult to game on macs. screw the ""industry standard"" lol

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
around 13 inches sounds good atm

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
YES. 
Gaming - fps games like overwatch are common. I would like at least 60 fps for those games.
Needs to be able to run all programs of the adobe creative suite!! I also plan on taking classes that require CAD/vectorworks/Rhinoceros


* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 As stated before, I woul like to be able to play games like overwatch at at least 60 fps, medium-low graphics are OK. *if this is not possible for the weight I can drop heavier games from my wants for this laptop... design programs must stay however*

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
Good quality screen/display for color oriented design projects. touchscreen not needed (i never used it with my current laptop)

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
At the moment i'm looking at the LG Gram, Dell XPS 13 Touch, and Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon as possibilities. 

Thanks for your time! I know this is a lot I am trying to fit into one laptop :x"

8bbnee,156,2018-04-10,Mini Guide on How to Benefit From LinkedIn,balleigh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8bbnee/mini_guide_on_how_to_benefit_from_linkedin/,"I made a post yesterday detailing the benefits of LinkedIn and sharing my personal experience using the website. Most people, understandably, thought that it was an ad for the website so I'll try to sound more general and less enthusiastic in this post. Keep in mind, most of the recruitment information below applies mostly to larger companies with a stronger emphasis on recruiting. 

.
.
.


For those of you who don't know, LinkedIn is a professional networking website where you can create a portfolio and connect with other business professionals. It shares alot in common with websites like Facebook where you can create a profile, make friends (or connections in LinkedIn), and share news or events on a timeline of sorts. 

.
.
.

When used correctly LinkedIn is **A Very Powerful Tool** that I believe anybody can benefit from, whether you're a college student looking for an internship or business professional trying to increase your network. This mini guide is a short list of the benefits of LinkedIn from my perspective and how you can benefit from the website, mainly from the position of someone trying to find a job/internship. 

# Connections
One of the best uses of LinkedIn is to expand your professional network and connect with people outside of your immediate business circle. Much like a friends request on Facebook, you can send a connection request to anyone on LinkedIn no matter where they are or where they work. For me, this was specifically beneficial in the job market. Whether you want to connect with Engineers at Google to inquire on their experience, or connect with Recruiters from Facebook to stay in contact throughout the next hiring season, any connection is beneficial. One thing to note is that your connections can be seen by people who have the same connection.  From a recruiting perspective, the more connections an applicant has the better they look. Think of Facebook friend request, you're more likely to accept a friends request if that person is already friends with someone you're close with. If you and a recruiter have alot of common connections they are more likely to engage with you in the long run. Some recruiters also include their personal information (usually email) on their profiles so you can make sure to stand out if you want to contact them about any available openings.

*Edit: Received a job opportunity today based on a recruiter I reached out to on March 1. In the offer phone call the recruiter explicitly stated the only reason they gave me a chance, out of all of their inbox messages, is because she grew up 10 miles from my college and felt a connection with me. I'm on the east coast, the job is in the west coast. Again, this is an example of why connections are important and why it never hurts to reach out to recruiters who want to help you.*

# Getting Job Opportunities
This one is a bit more subjective as the experience will depend on the person. In my opinion LinkedIn is the best place to go if you want to find a Job or Internship, heres why:
 
1 - LinkedIn recruiters often post new job/internship opportunities on LinkedIn first. Here's a post from a University Recruiter at a Big 4 company, seen on my timeline today: 

&gt; I am currently hiring experienced Software Development Engineers, Managers and Technical Program Managers for AWS S3!  Please 
&gt; reach out to me if you are interested in learning more.

Again, nothing is guaranteed, but getting that extra advantage that comes with being able to communicate with recruiters directly and find out about open positions ahead of time really helps. 

2 - This one has gotten me numerous job interviews and is, in my opinion, the best part of LinkedIn. *The ability to connect with recruiters at the specific company you want to work for.* A great feature of LinkedIn is the ability to search for people based on their job title, and then filter based on their current company and location. **This is Huge**. Say you want to work for Amazon. Simply search for *University/Technical Recruiter*, type Amazon in the *Current Company* filter, and BAM, every (most) Amazon recruiter has a LinkedIn profile. So what now? LinkedIn premium allows you to send longer detailed ""InMail"" messages to recruiters, but if you dont want to buy the service you can simply send them a connection request and in the *Note* (300 characters) section detail your interest in the company and how you would love the opportunity to connect with them concerning future employment opportunities. That's it. Some recruiters will connect and respond to your message, other will connect and ignore it, and other might not want to connect at all. From my experience, **recruiters love when applicants show initiative and reach out to them directly for opportunities**. There are a plethora of websites and guides you can look up on how to do this effectively, but it helps. I was able to get 6+ phone interviews doing this over the past 3 months. 
 
3 - Getting connections on LinkedIn can not only help you in the immediate future, but they can also help alot down the line. Many recruiters turn to their LinkedIn connections when considering applicants for jobs, and others explicitly state that if you contact them on LinkedIn they can try to connect you to the right person for your need. This, again, is just another great advantage of dealing with the recruiting process at the source rather than submitting a resume and hoping for the best. 

4 - You can see when people view your LinkedIn profile, but they can also see when you view theirs. 

# Job Interviews

This one should be a bit more obvious, but LinkedIn can be a big help when it comes to the following: 

1 - Many hiring managers and recruiters check your LinkedIn before scheduling you for an interview. You will know this because LinkedIn will explicitly give you a notification stating: 
&gt; Someone with the job title Recruiter viewed your profile

Your profile serves as a great first look into who you are as not only a candidate, but also a personality and team fit. 

2 - Before a job interview, LinkedIn is a great source for getting insight into your interviewer, if you know their name. Are they young or old? Do you have any similarities you can speak on later? Are they technical and if so what is their job title? All of these answers will be very helpful in preparing for a Phone, or in person interview with the staff. 

# Career Advise 
Im pretty sure this is a feature of LinkedIn premium, but I'll include it anyway. Based on your profile and interest, LinkedIn will give you recommendations on people who can, and are willing, to give you career advise. These people are often in the same field as you and can offer input on whatever questions or decisions you might want to make. Another way to build relationships, but also just capitalize on the input of others who have been in the industry. 

# Being Scouted 
Companies can also reach out to candidates directly via LinkedIn in order to scout for positions. LinkedIn will give you notifications on how often your profile appears in search results. Companies can search for candidates based on certain keywords on your profile and reach out to you if they think your qualified. The types of companies that do this can range from small local companies, to people hiring for specialized positions, to companies from the Big 4 reaching out to you personally. Anytime you receive a message from a recruiter like this you can be sure that you are amongst a group of very small candidates as most accounts can only InMail 4 candidates per month. 

.
.
.
.
.

That is my advice concerning how to take advantage of LinkedIn. There are many articles online that can go into alot more detail on the things I spoke on. **I'm in no way a professional on the site**, and im not trying to give out free press or advertise, I've just benefitted alot from the website and wanted to share my experience and help others. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or want more specific advice. Always happy to help. Excuse spelling.

What was asked and What's next,Funnyguy17,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/8bcl6b/update_i_had_a_first_round_interview_with_goldman/,"Hello /r/FinancialCareers. 

&amp;nbsp;

[I wanted to make a new post because my last post got quite a bit of traction for this subreddit and thought some people might be curious on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/89jntr/i_have_a_first_round_interview_with_goldman_sachs/)




* 1) Results

* 2) How I prepared

* 3) What was asked

* 4) How I felt about the interview

&amp;nbsp;

1)

&amp;nbsp;

I was moved to round 2 of the interview process.  I had my first interview last Wednesday and yesterday I got an email asking to make an appointment for a 30 minute phone interview for round 2.  I have this appointment on Thursday and will update you guys again, if you'd like me to.(Let me know) . Now that we have that established hopefully you can have a little more faith in the rest of my post.

&amp;nbsp;

2)

&amp;nbsp;

Let me start off by saying I way over prepared for this interview but I felt it help me a lot because I was infinitely more comfortable talking to the recruiter and helped me greatly with answering all questions in clear and concise statements.

&amp;nbsp;

To prepare, 

* I read through every WSJ for the week following up to the day of the interview.
* Read through 10-Q's of four Companies I already knew very well. (I made sure to know relevant competitors as well)
* Looked for potential interview questions online
* Wrote my own personal answers in a notebook to each of the questions I felt might be asked
* Goodnight sleep the day before (I took a melatonin) 
* And finally, a solid protein meal for breakfast and a cup of coffee with the days WSJ.

&amp;nbsp;

Each of these 6 points helped me a lot and I don't think I would have been as comfortable with the interview without doing all of it.

&amp;nbsp;

3)

&amp;nbsp;

I was asked mainly about my time interning at Morgan Stanley

* What did you do while interning?

* What were some challenges you faced?

* Accomplishments?

* What did you like about the internships?

* What did I dislike about the internships?

* Was I given a job offer?

&amp;nbsp;

This is pretty much the jest of it, your typical first round interview questions.  They also asked me about the position.

* What is PWM?

* Why do you want to do PWM?

* Are you able to commute to the location if offered the job.

&amp;nbsp;

Again, typical questions you might expect.

&amp;nbsp;

I was asked if I had any questions. I only had a few but I feel it was important to ask so the recruiter knew I am actually interested.

* Do you have any questions or concerns about my resume?

* What would the typical day look like in this position?

* Expected hours?

* How often I will be traveling?

* What will I be doing my first year or two at the company?

&amp;nbsp;

Because she was a recruiter she couldn't give me a full answers to some of these questions, but again, I feel it was beneficial to ask them regardless. 

&amp;nbsp;

4)

&amp;nbsp;

I felt the interview went incredibly well.  Obviously with me moving onto round 2 my feelings were correct.  I answered every questions as clearly and concise as possible.  I mentally made sure not to say things like ""umm"" ""Hmm"" etc. I just paused to think or asked the recruiter to rephrase the question if I didn't quite understand or needed a few more moments to think of my answer.  We ended the 25 minute phone call in very friendly spirits and that's all she wrote.


&amp;nbsp;


What's next:  I have effectively two days to study for this interview and because I was so over prepared for the first one I feel what I researched might have a bigger impact on this interview so all I am really doing is doing what I did for the first interview but am researching more in depth.

&amp;nbsp; 

I am gonna get back to studying but I will make sure to check this post for any questions anyone may have. "

Any advice would be appreciated!

edit: my other concern is that I heard about ridiculous stress and grade deflation at Cal. I am expecting this to be especially true for CS and I was wondering if this alone makes UCLA a better option? Some thoughts on this would be great too."

I am currently a junior who has 3 semester of school to go. I have 2 internships under my belt. Both of these internships are at very large corporations $10B+. I have two solid projects.....a multi parti hangout application with gif support etc and a goal setting application that basically tracks procrastination etc. I'm also on par to graduate with a GPA around 2.8 to 3.0.....depending on how the next couple of semesters go. I'm at about a 2.79 rn.

The issue is I got denied from my schools BA and BS programs for CS. I was relatively unmotivated my sophomore year after transferring to a a new school and got low grades. This is ironic because I only got denied because I applied too late. Like my grades were good enough but I applied after I got the bad grades because I was still trying to get into my schools CSE (BS) program. I also think the fact that I transferred hindered me. My good grades from Calc I and II were not counted. 

I subsequently took a year off from school to get my bearings and have returned with more focus &amp; general motivation.

However, I had to settle for a degree in the continuing education program at my school....I will be officially graduating with a Bachelors of Individualized Studies in Computer Science, Information Technology and History. 

Will this effect my chances at getting a job? 

For those wondering - the biggest difference is I will have some freedom to skip out of some hard classes. Irony is I have already taken almost but all of them except 2. I'm going to take one of those classes anyways because it's good. The other one is a C++ Software Eng course."

I'm graduating this July, and have been getting few bites on my resumes. Here's the facts:

&gt;Not a great GPA (2.8) - didn't list it on resume

&gt;Have had 1 internship - full time last summer, and part time remote during this school year for ~1 year experience with Java professionally

&gt;Have been applying all over - focus cities were Dallas, Chicago, Denver, Minneapolis/St. Paul, but I am applying to other cities as well

&gt;Have been applying to all manner of companies (retail, finance, random companies), not just dream companies

&gt;In a resume thread, I received minimal critique 

I don't have a return offer formally for my internship, but if I ask I'd get one, 90% sure. However, that company is in a city 3 hours away from my college town - even further away from civilization (~7 hours away from a decently sized metro area). The company is ok, but I really hate the city, and feel it'd make it harder for me to interview in other companies.

So here are my questions:

&gt;Is my location holding me back a ton?

&gt;If I don't find a full-time position upon graduation, is moving to (Dallas/Houston/Twin Cities/Any city with more of a tech scene) and applying advisable?

Thank you."
8bdnkr,3,2018-04-10,Applied Math Major for CS Grad,lostkid900,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/8bdnkr/applied_math_major_for_cs_grad/,"I'm currently deciding whether or not I should go for a Applied Math degree instead of Computer Science, even though I wish to go to grad school for CS (specifically Machine Learning). Because of the way my classes have gone so far, I will be able to complete the Math degree in 2 semesters with a summer class. However a CS degree would take me 6 semesters to complete. 

I've been looking at some school that interest me, and a lot of them say they require CS classes or much of a list of classes that includes CS and Math courses. I won't really have an opportunity to take any CS classes with the Math degree except for the Intro classes and discrete structures. Would it really hamper my chances of getting into a Machine Learning or CS Ph.D. program without many CS classes? Is there any good way to look for ML programs that don't require much of a CS background? Even a CS minor would take me an extra year in addition to the Math degree. Possibly I could apply just prior to receiving my Math degree and if I don't get in I could stay an extra year just taking a couple classes to get a CS minor then reapply. Or would it be better to just bite the bullet and go for another 3 years to get a CS major? 

Another problem I have, is I haven't had any internships or research experience really at all and didn't get an internship for this summer. My GPA is very strong however (4.0) at a large school known for STEMs. Taking 3 years to complete the program would give me more opportunity to get some extracurriculars, but I feel like at this point I want to move onto higher level classes and wouldn't be able to take 400lvl CS classes for a couple years. I do have some experience programming, however at my school this doesn't help me skip classes, because you can't test out of classes once you've began attending (apparently due to a large cheating ring, someone always ruins it :p). 

tl;dr - I can get an applied math degree in a year, or a CS one in 3 years. I want to do Machine Learning in grad school, would the extra two years for cs help me substantially?"

Internship I pay for,c0sm0nautt,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8be55m/does_this_seem_like_a_good_idea_internship_i_pay/,"Someone posted this on Craiglist under the title ""Network Engineer Internship"". Not sure how I feel about the $500 fee.

&gt;Hey, glad to hear that you're interested in the internship.
 
Let me share the rest of the details and you can let me know if you're still interested. This is a six-week opportunity.
 
The purpose of this opportunity is to help junior engineers get some hands-on experience to build up their resumes and to help them get a boost to their careers. Employers love to see past experience with network deployment projects and migrations, and that is exactly what I'll help you get. Everything that you will do is based on real-life projects just like you would do if you were working for a VAR, service provider, or enterprise environment. You will also have me available to answer questions and to provide guidance the entire way.

I have created several virtual networking environments, consisting of Cisco switches, routers, and firewalls. You'll be able to choose from several different projects to work on, which cover a variety of topics, and have different levels of difficulty. You can choose any of them to start with based on your areas of interest, and once you finish one you can move on to the others. I'm attaching a list of the projects that I currently have available, and I'm working on adding new ones as quickly as possible.
Once you've chosen a project you'll take a brief open-book quiz to make sure you're ready, then you'll be granted read-only access to your environment to start checking the devices and working on a change plan, just as you would in the real world. You'll submit your change plan to me (your senior engineer) for peer review and feedback, and once you've got an approved plan in place, you'll be able to log in and begin your implementation. You can do all of this at your own pace, with me giving you guidance over email the entire way.
 
I'll be available to guide you and provide feedback when you run into any trouble, but it's up to you to do your part and try to learn as much as possible on your own. That means knowing how to consult documentation or just do a Google search. At the end of the internship you can use me as a job reference. My goal is to help you build up your resume, and to get the experience and job history you need to get your foot in the door for a real (paid) network engineering job. I'd also be happy to keep in touch after and continue mentoring you through your career.
 
Hopefully this all sounds good to you so far. Now for the catch. Although I call this an internship, I am charging $500 for the six weeks. I promise it will be well worth your money, and if you decide otherwise by the end of it, then I will refund your money. It's payable via PayPal at the beginning of the program.
 
I created this opportunity because I know there are plenty of people out there who are eager to advance in this field but just need the experience and the job reference on their resume. I was there myself at one point. Let me mentor you and help you get the experience, and I promise it will be worth the cost. If you're not quite ready for this yet but want to keep in touch in case you have other networking or career related questions, then I'm always happy to help a fellow engineer."

8begvc,32,2018-04-11,I wasn't hired after an internship at Google. What could I have done differently? How should I phrase this to potential employers?,dudeguy409,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8begvc/i_wasnt_hired_after_an_internship_at_google_what/,"EDIT:  added a ""What could I have done differently?"" wiki at the bottom.

After graduating from college with a Bachelors’ degree, I participated in Google’s Software Engineering Residency Program.  It was like a year-long internship broken up into two six-month rotations.  I was not offered a position when the program ended this past September, as I had hoped and expected.  I am pretty sure that this is because I had some issues with my manager on my second rotation.


I have been having a hard time finding a job since then, and suspect that it may be because I am phrasing my reason for current unemployment poorly, AKA why I didn’t get hired at Google.  ALso, there are certainly some things that I could have done differently, but there are some things that I’m not sure how I would avoid in the future.  Any advice on that is also appreciated.  Please feel free to share your open opinions, but please be respectful.


As I already mentioned, I had some issues with my manager on my second rotation.  I try to avoid putting blame on my manager in interviews, since that generally doesn’t go over well.  I’ve been telling companies, “There were technical issues on the first project of my second rotation that neither my manager nor I could foresee that caused a lot of delays.  Although things improved throughout the rotation, I wasn’t able to accomplish enough to compensate for lost time and showcase my talents.  As far as I could tell, Google’s hiring committee understandably wanted a ‘sure thing’, and evaluated me based on what I accomplished.”


This version of the story doesn’t put blame on me or my manager; it’s phrased simply as an unfortunate, unavoidable situation.  The story is pretty true, but a more accurate portrayal would be to say that my manager gave me a bad evaluation to the hiring committee.  In his own words, it was because I never did what he asked me to do.


In all fairness, there were several occasions where I did things that he didn’t ask me to do.   My first project was a sketchy, loosely-planned “intern project”.  My manager wanted me to implement a poor, quick solution that would hide critical errors, and instead, I spent two weeks implementing what I saw as a more proper solution.  I was concerned that if I didn’t do a good job with the project, it would just be scrapped when I left; in retrospect though, there was merit to getting something simple working first.  For the remaining times when I did things he didn’t ask me to do, it was because I wanted to beef up my resume for the hiring committee.  I spent a lot of time dealing with technical issues on my first project which was not actually part of Google’s code repository.  As a result, the hiring committee would probably completely disregard it.  “Metrics or it didn’t happen.”  As a result, when low-hanging fruit came by, I seized the opportunity to actually get something visible done.  I found a critical error in our code that was causing a blocking problem for my project.  My manager told me not to fix it, but it was a relatively simple fix, so I did it anyways.  There were also a lot of blaring mistakes in our public documentation for customers.  Since I figured nobody cared or had the time, I took care of it.  I had a vested interest since I was also using the documentation as a “customer” of sorts myself.  Again, although my manager agreed that it was useful, he was angry that I did it.  I know that it’s important to do what your manager asks, but I’m not sure that I regret what I did.  He seemed determined to waste my time and sabotage my experience.  I don’t think any amount of bending to his will would have made him happy, so at least I got something done.  What are your thoughts?


The biggest recurring problem, however, was in communicating what needed to be done.  To start, most engineering residents like me were paired with a normal engineer that oversaw their work.  In contrast, my manager was in charge of a dozen people.  Furthermore, he was very new to management.  It’s understandable that he was busy.  For my three biggest projects, he informally paired me with another engineer to be an advisor to bounce ideas off of.  I created a documented plan, shared it with my advisor and my manager for feedback, and then implemented it.  The problem was that my manager didn’t have time to review my design documents; on all three projects, my manager insisted that I redo large amounts of work because my implementation didn’t align with what he wanted - my implementation that was specified in my design docs and that other engineers had approved of before I started.  I wouldn’t have minded a micromanager; I can be a bit OCD sometimes too, so I can understand that.  The problem was that he was a retroactive micromanager - unwilling to invest any time to direct my projects, until the end, when he arbitrarily decided that I did them wrong.  Communication was a more general problem though, not just tied to design docs.  My manager worked from home a considerable amount and had lots of meetings.  He very rarely made it to our tri-weekly standup meetings where I shared my progress.  No problem, I thought.  I kept track of my weekly progress and TODOs in a Google Doc that I could share with him.  When I proposed this, he frustratingly declared, “I don’t have time to read your snippets!”  I still finished all of the projects that I started, but “not as fast as [my manager] would have liked because [I] didn’t listen to [him].”  


To be fair to him, for the majority of my rotation, I tried to avoid talking to him unless I had good news.  He was abusive in my opinion.  Starting on day 3 of my rotation, he frequently criticized my work.  Most of the time, this was done in private during our weekly one-on-one meetings, but occasionally he would criticize me at my desk while others were working nearby.  Sometimes he had good points, but sometimes it seemed like he was looking for things to complain about.  Regardless, the criticism was always given in a very condescending and frustrated tone.  It was very debilitating and made the job very stressful for me.  I never saw him do this to anyone else and I never told any of the other employees that this was happening, though I suspected they had overheard it.  I don’t know what his deal was with me, but I know that I wasn’t performing badly enough to warrant that behavior.  His abusive behavior persuaded me to not give him updates as often as I otherwise would have.  I’m not sure how I should have dealt with this.  Any ideas?

Another recurring problem was that I was working on multiple projects at once, which caused all of my work to slow down.  Even though I was working hard, it probably didn’t seem like it to the engineers that I was working with.  Multitasking is something I try to avoid, but it happened despite my efforts, since blockers for one project were resolved after I started another project.  It wasn’t just a problem of splitting my time between different projects; simply having to constantly change gears and worry about a growing list of things to get done is stressful and overwhelming.  What this means is that I probably didn’t impress anyone on my team, despite working hard.  I doubt that I can count on a strong reference from any of them.  I agree that this was a problem, but I’m not sure how I could have avoided it.  Any thoughts?


So is there a way for me to better phrase why I didn’t get hired?  My girlfriend suggested that I could admit more fault and say “This is what I did wrong and this is what I learned”.  She thinks it looks bad to say that I didn’t get hired without talking about what I’ve learned from the mistakes I made.  I could still avoid speaking ill of my manager.  What do you think?



EDIT:

Thanks for all of the great advice!  I appreciate your candor.  Like most people, it can be a bit hard for me to see where I’ve made mistakes.

I’ve decided to add a list of lessons learned based on your posts:

1) I should have always done what my manager wanted.  I think I did a good job of noticing other useful tasks and telling my manager about them, but I shouldn’t have done them without him giving his approval.  No matter how I felt about his decisions, it was my responsibility to do what he wanted.

2) I could have done a better job of making sure that everyone approved of my plans before moving forward.  I DID always talk my plans out with my advisor engineers and sometimes with my manager, but apparently not thoroughly enough with my manager.  I also underestimated how particular my manager would be about the particulars of the final product because of his lack of interest in the early stages.  I should err on the side of getting more approval than necessary from all stakeholders before moving forward, instead of assuming that my manager doesn’t care because he is busy.

3) As the rotation went on, I think my distrust in him snowballed because of how he was treating me.  I think I am pretty receptive to feedback from people that I like (whether all of you are willing to believe me or not, I really had no problems taking orders/advice from my advisor engineers), but stubbornly against taking advice from people who are mean to me.  Failing to recognize and deal with this compounding problem was a big mistake.

4) I should avoid unnecessary distraction projects.

5) Be more proactive about dealing with blockers.

So I'm about to graduate with my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering as the title suggests. While it's been a journey getting here, the next steps are also super important, and I would love some advice from others in the field.

Here are some things about me:

* I want to work in the space industry, in whatever way I can. It's always been a dream of mine to work on helping humanity get out to that final frontier.
* gpa 3.4+, not amazing, but I was working as a tutor a significant portion of the time and doing research, so my academic course work suffered somewhat
* Research is in using solidworks for modeling skeletal structures, and developing a course structure for fracture mechanics (a class I had taken, but the Professor wanted assistance in making the course better)

So for my next part of this journey, I'm a little lost on what to do. I'm fully aware of the difficulty of getting in to the space industry, as it's a hot commodity right now. I've applied to a ton of places, had a couple of interviews, but nothing offered (yet).

Here's the dilemma I'm running into. What would be best do you guys think:

* Keep applying around for internships and jobs, even if it means waiting 3-6 months for a job offer to come my way? I know it's incredibly difficult to get a job out there for someone who has freshly graduated, and I might end up in a field that isn't totally related, such as industrial, HVAC, or sales engineer, but if experience is the key to getting other jobs, that might have to do

* I could join the Navy and try and get into their NUPOC program, as a Nuclear Propulsion Officer. I'm aware that it's unlikely I'll actually being working on the reactors, but the experience may look good on my resume, and I also know it may be a foot in the door to some places if I have some time served.

I'll be posting to the Navy subreddit as well to get their feedback as well

* Apply around and take the FE exam, and if nothing comes up after that, apply for Master's school. If I were to go for my Master's I was thinking Propulsion Engineering (I think that is under the umbrella of Aerospace), straight Mechanical Engineering, or perhaps Material's or HVAC for space systems (I hear that's also going to be important for Mars missions)

Or is there another route I'm not thinking of?

I appreciate your feedback guys, thanks for taking the time to read and reply"

I'm supporting really niche applications &amp; I am completely uninterested in majority of the work I am doing. I don't have any drive to become a SME with the applications I work with. I feel like I've pigeon-holed myself by taking this job (first job out of college) in a windows environment (wanted to work with linux) supporting these niche applications. I jumped at this job offer because it was the first one I got &amp; I guess it was comfortable for me since I was an intern on the team previously.

I am having trouble applying for Linux based roles as my Linux knowledge/skills are quite rusty &amp; I don't have the drive or motivation to learn after a draining 8-9 hour work day. 

Currently the only part of my job I truly enjoy is automation &amp; scripting with Powershell, which is a very small portion of my job. I really enjoy solving problems with code. I know I won't be able to find a job that just has me scripting or automating processes all day, so I'm looking into going back to school for software development (I'm aware it can be self-learned, I need the monetary commitment &amp; structured learning schooling provides). I'm also aware that development jobs are not heads-down coding all day as well.

I am constantly wondering if development is right for me though. The questions I see some people asking on /r/learnpython , /r/learnprogramming , &amp; /r/cscareerquestions make me feel like an idiot. Everything looks very daunting to try to learn. 

I'm just looking for opinions/general feedback on my situation. I am in a rut &amp; need a change. Any comments/opinions are appreciated. 

I've come up with a few options for myself


* Back to school for development (2.5 years + 2-3 internships), keep current job part-time for income
* Look for new jobs (currently having a rough time with this, feel like I've pigeon-holed myself due to niche application experience)
* Self study/brush up on Linux skills, get RHCSA. Maybe study for some cloud certs like AWS or Azure (I feel drained physically &amp; mentally after 8-9 hours of work per day(shit excuse, I know))

Not an expert my any means. I also do IT work around the office. I mostly do technical support for our clients. I also just got another new role of Security Administrator. 

I am a big asset to the company because I am a hybrid between a web developer and a support manager. Which they love and said that they couldn’t put a ad in the paper for my job. 

That said, I just graduated with my AAS in Computer Information Technology. I told them I would like to expand my role and do tech support for all our clients (custom software and CMS clients instead of just CMS clients). They loved the idea and are excited. They said they will talk with the rest of leadership team and get back to me but its been almost a month. 

How do I confront them about it? Or should I find a new job? I say find a new job because my current pay is way under valued and I have asked for EVERY raise I got which was around 2-3 times. I do feel under valued. But I also LOVE my job. The benefits are great and pay has to be better but it might be better with new roles and me graduating. 

Anyone have some ideas for me? I’ve looked at other jobs in the area but most of them want me to know 1 or 2 frontend web development frameworks which I don’t yet. It would suck to go to corporate America again. "

From chatting with the VP friend they have a barely existing IT infrastructure, a ""trash"" AD domain (that's questionably useful in a mostly-mac environment), a VPN server that doesn't work, etc, etc and wants me to fix it. They're basically a company that's 100% devops on AWS. I have lab experience with all of the above and have had two previous IT/desktop support internships with limited hands on infrastructure stuff. 

I'd feel okay cleaning up their AD, cleaning up their network but I know that some stuff is way more than my skill level and likely to overwhelm me. My goal is to create a working network but not create something that when they hire an eventual sysadmin they're ripping their hair out cleaning up the shit I created.

So far the options that I see are: go forward and tell VP I'd be happy to help get his network nice and shiny, tell VP I'd be happy to do a different project that the startup is working on that he mentioned and tell VP to find an MSP, or take another desktop support internship I applied for (that's 30 minutes farther from my house than this company).

8biabx,1,2018-04-11,New IT bachelors student - need advice BADLY!,IchBinWeissesFleisch,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8biabx/new_it_bachelors_student_need_advice_badly/,"I apologize in advance for the length of my post, **I put a TL;DR at the bottom.**

First I need to give some background so you guys can understand the how and why of my crazy decision. I grew up being super fascinated about computers ever since my uncle bought our family our first computer back in 1995 (A sweet 486DX2 33Mhz with Windows 3.1!). I didn't become a computer nerd because I was an outcast and that was my only recourse, which I noticed with some of my friends at the time, I was a computer nerd because I was endlessly fascinated by them and what they could be used for. In middle/high school all I ever imagined I would do is get a ""computer job"". I even worked at my small city's only computer repair/sales shop right after graduating high school.

I didn't get very good grades in school because I was so bullied by everyone in my life that I acted out and blah blah you've heard this story... so I knew college wasn't going to happen. I joined the Air Force thinking I could get a computer job there, which would be like my version of college to get a civilian job after my term. I ended up getting lied to by my recruiter who saw how eager I was to join, and ended up working a maintenance job on heavy aircraft. At some point I decided I thought I wanted to go into the medical field, and abandoned the ""computer job"" idea.

For the past 8 years I've been trying and failing to get started in medical because of school and military never giving way to each other, family problems, and anything else that could go wrong. Finally, during several counseling sessions to get my disability rating through the VA for major depressive disorder (MDD), I realized that I've been unhappy because I've been lying to myself about wanting to be in medicine, and my heart just isn't in it. If it was, it sure as hell shouldn't have taken me 8 years just to be ready to APPLY to nursing school.

After a death in the family, I did a lot of soul searching and made the seemingly crazy decision that I would finally abandon medicine, and return to my original goal. I have been given approval from my Vocational Rehabilitation counselor (A program to help disabled vets start a new career) to attend University to get a bachelor of science in IT (BSIT). This means I'm going back to University (online), I'll get it all paid for while also receiving the post 9/11 GI Bill housing allowance, on top of my disability payments. Tutors, books, supplies, and everything else is covered. I haven't been this happy or excited in many years. That's really saying something for someone who's clinically depressed. My general education is already out of the way from having completed 80% of a BS in biology, from my CCAF (Air Force) credits, and more. That means I will be jumping STRAIGHT INTO CORE CLASSES.


-----------------------------------------------
**FINALLY! THE QUESTIONS!**
-----------------------------------------------

As I've never studied this field before, what should I do to mentally prepare myself for my upcoming courses, short of just getting the textbooks ahead of time (not an option, books are loaded digitally into the classes themselves)? I am pretty smart (not a brag) and earned A's in every college/university class I've taken but two (organic chemistry classes got me a B and a C), but that doesn't mean I'm the *type* of smart that a tech major needs to be.

So far, I'm finding people saying the most difficult class in my upcoming schedule is discrete math, which I've already bookmarked 3 different tutors in town for. What other areas of study in an IT degree are especially difficult? I want to be sure I can find help *BEFORE* I NEED IT.

Since it's an online only degree, I have already lined up internships to apply for so I can get as much experience as possible. Are there certain types of internships I should be looking for?

The IT degree is basically meant to be a pedestal for me to stand on while I hold up my certificates. I'm currently in the ""Advanced Networking"" option which I believe results in a CCNP, but I'll have to double check. I took the special CCNA course offered at my high school and did well, but never paid to get the certificate after I graduated (ugh). I have the option to extend my degree so I can get 1 or maybe even 2 other certificates, so I'm hoping to get cyber-security and possibly one other. Is cyber security worth pursuing? How challenging of a field of study is it?

Aside from a job/internship during school, what are other good ways for someone getting an IT degree online, to do that much-needed networking to establish myself in the working world? I realize brick and mortar schools provide much greater opportunities for this.


-----------------------------------------------
**FINALLY! THE TL;DR!**
-----------------------------------------------

I grew up wanting to work on computers for a living, the military destroyed that dream for me, then I pursued a career in medicine but realized it was never what I truly wanted in life, now I'm on a paid track to get an online BSIT with at least 2 advanced certifications and need advice on this major change.

The main questions I asked:

1) What should I do to mentally prepare myself for my upcoming courses, short of just getting the textbooks ahead of time?

2) What classes besides discrete math are especially difficult? I want to line up tutors and extra study aides.

3) Are there certain types of internships I should be looking for?

4) Is cyber security worth pursuing (as an addition to computer networking)? How challenging of a field of study is it?

5) Aside from a job, what are other good ways for me to do human networking to establish myself in the working world?

Uh, I work in an undisclosed research facility roughly 10 km south of the Ross Ice Shelf. A team of 5 other researchers and I were tasked with the job of retrieving ice cores from the shelf and dating the ice inside. The rest doesn’t matter as I need to get this up as soon as possible. I am going to copy my log of important activity from my arrival up until now. My name is Mike and I’ve been trapped in Antarctica for a month.

March 8, 2018

The crew and I arrived have arrived at the undisclosed research facility. This one is much smaller than your average Antarctican research facility. There is only a barracks, common building, and a research wing. We each settled into our respective rooms in the barracks. It is not a luxurious room. It only has a bed, desk, and closet. It is going to need a lot of work to make me feel at home for the next 7 months I will be here. We all agreed to take the rest of the night off to get some sleep and get some work done in the morning.

March 9, 2018

We all had alarms set for 0700. We all showered and dressed to meet up in the common building to get our bearings. Simon and Todd were already inside the common building drinking coffee by the time I arrived. They have both been in this business for the last 20 years of their lives. They have been working together since 2006. Simon is your average looking scientist; short white hair, glasses and very professional. Todd is a few years younger than Simon with a buzz cut and very short temper. Todd can be very eccentric, but he and Simon seem to work well together so I don't hold it against him.

I walked with Sarah and Jeanie to the commons. Sarah has been working in Antarctica for 5 years, Jeanie for 2 years. However, they have never worked together. Sarah has long brown hair she keeps up in a ponytail. Jeanie has had my attention since I arrived. She is a tantalizing redhead and very friendly. I know it is unprofessional, but she is gorgeous.

I came with my boss Kate, who I am an intern for. She has been studying ice cores for all of her life. She put this crew together for this study. She is a strict brunette who only cares for her job. She showed up in the commons shortly after I did. Kate took me on a tour of the research building while the other 4 talked in the commons. She showed me how each of the instruments worked and what they did. I reminded her I was an intern, not a tourist, and that I knew what all of these were used for and what they did.

Upon returning to the group they were getting their gear on to go out into the desert. Yes, Antarctica is a desert. Antarctica gets, on average, about 8 inches of precipitation a year. All deserts are not blistering. Anyway we bundled up for the 10 km journey in the -10°C/20°F weather. We gathered into our Ford E series icechallenger van and were off. We surveyed the area where we would be coring for a few hours and returned back to the base.

--

Mike here. I should state that all three buildings are connected which means we only go outside to retrieve the ice cores.

March 10, 2018

Today was the first day out in the field so this entry will be short as I did not have my log out there. Nothing important to note today. Future logs will only include important updates as I do not want to be cooped up in my dorm away from everyone. 

--

March 16, 2018 

We lost Simon today. As in we cannot find him. The small camp we set up where we will be coring has a few tents we were all sitting in as he was drilling into the ice. We heard the machine stop grinding into the ice much too soon. We opened the tent and saw Simon was not on the drill. We searched everywhere in the 200 square foot camp we set up. If you didn’t know, in Antarctica all you see is white. We all wear bright orange jackets out here for this reason. There was no orange in sight besides our own jackets. We came back to the base early today. Todd doesn’t seem himself.

Update 21:30

After dinner at the base we were starting to settle in for the night when Jeanie called for everyone to come into the commons. She was looking out the front window and was pointing out into the vast whiteness. I turned on my voice recorder and went over to her.

Voice record 1 begin.

“Do you guys see that? The white thing moving around out there.” Jeanie said.

“It’s all white out there Jeanie what are you talking about?” Todd said.

“No, it has a human shape, but it’s…white. Like-” Jeanie stated. 

“Like the Ningen?” Todd spouted angrily.

We all know the stories of the ningen around here.

“I mean, is it so impossible? There is no one else here but us Todd, and-“

“I’m not listening to any of this. We LOST Simon today and you’re gonna pull this shit? No thanks I’m going to the bunks.” Todd walked out of the commons.

“Jeanie really? The ningen? Come on.” Sarah said.

Voice record 1 end.

The group stated disbanding at this point. I stayed with Jeanie and watched out the window with her. I could see something. It was just wandering around our vehicles right in front of the base. The inside lights barely illuminating the figure. It was looking inside at us and moving its hand across the vehicle in a very particular motion. I left Jeanie at this point and went to my bunk.

--

March 17, 2018

Todd is refusing to leave his room today. I am not going to fight him on this one. 
Sarah and Jeanie are working in the research wing.
Kate and I are going out to the camp to pick up some more cores. 

Update 14:00

I noticed something on the icechallenger we took to the camp. It had an “S” carved into the driver side door. I informed Kate and she said to let it go before we returned to the base.

Update 23:00

I found Jeanie setting up a camera at the window we saw the figure in last night. She said if anything moves tonight this camera will catch it. 

--

March 18, 2018

In the morning Jeanie and I reviewed the camera as Sarah and Kate tried to get the research mission back on track by going to drill for more cores. Todd was still in his room. He only came out to eat yesterday. When we approached the camera I noticed Sarah’s mouth agape. The camera was there, but what we saw was something we needed to review on the camera right away. 

An “I” had been carved into the window glass. 

The camera revealed nothing. No pictures. No video. It didn’t catch anything. We were dumbfounded.

I’m becoming uneasy.

--

March 26, 2018

The last 8 days went by with nothing new developing of the situation. Today changed that. Kate and Sarah have been working together a lot recently. Todd stays in his room all day now. Jeanie and I have become closer during this unsettling adventure. Sarah and Kate told us to go to the camp to get her research logs she left down there the day prior. I think it was to get us out of the base to get some fresh air and forget some of this stuff going on. 
Upon arriving at the camp we retrieved the notes and started back to the icechallenger. Jeanie called my name and I came over to where she was standing inside one of the tents. 

She turned to me and held up a bright orange jacket…with an “M” torn out of the material.

We returned to the base as fast as we could and showed Sarah and Kate. Kate ripped the jacket out of Jeanie’s hands and threw it in the trash. I turned my voice recorder on behind my back.

Voice Record 2 begin

“Kate what the hell has been wrong with you?” I asked.

“Mike we are not doing this right now. Forget the jacket. Forget the 'S' the 'I' and the 'M'. Now!” Kate told me emphatically.

“The 'S'?” Jeanie asked.

“Yeah” I said, “it was carved into the icechallenger door, where that thing was standing.”

Jeanie ran outside in the cold without her protective clothing.

“Mike god damnit we are here to do research not fuck around with superstitions!” Kate shouted.

“Kate why are you being so defensive over all of this?” asked Sarah.

“I am responsible for Mike. He is my intern. His first mission in the field is under my guidance. How would it look for me if he came back and this was all he had to show for this trip? I’m trying to save both of our asses. I don’t know what is going on, but it is not my job to figure it out.”

Voice record 2 end.

Jeanie came back in a few minutes later and stayed in my room with me for the night.

Jeanie asked me to record our conversation so we can get everything we know all in one place.

Voice record 3 begin.

""I don't like this Mike, I know I saw something out there. Why won't Kate do anything?"" Asked Jeanie.

""I've been her intern for almost 4 months now Jeanie, when she has a job to do, that's all she focuses on. But this, I don't know. This isn't something to just put behind you."" I tried to reassure her. ""Kate is the most experienced here. She will do what will keep us safe.""

""Okay, but how do you explain what we've found. S-I-M. That thing has Simon and it's toying with us! What else are we going to find with letters carved into it?"" Jeanie said shaking.

""I don't know Jeanie. Let's just try to get some sleep and calm down.""

Voice record 3 end.

Jeanie shut off my recorder and we tried to get some sleep that night.

--

March 22, 2018

With everything that has been going on recently, Sarah has been keeping to herself now too. Today she came up to Jeanie and me and told us she was leaving. She said she couldn’t stay here with Kate acting the way she is along with Simon and the letters. She is taking the second icechallenger we haven’t used yet to the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station to await an evacuation from the continent. We said our goodbyes and she was off. We did not inform Kate until Sarah was gone.

Todd has stopped replying to our requests to come out of his bunk.

--

March 28, 2018

Jeanie and I went with Kate to the camp to collect more ice cores. Jeanie and I were in a tent going over notes trying to stay focused on the research. Kate came in with a new core and told us to work on it. Each core we get is from further and further out on the shelf. The readings should be similar and so far they have been. 

Upon laying the core down next to the machine and starting the reading Jeanie and I both had a bad feeling. The screen was only showing an “O” and no different reading would show up from this core nor did any other we tried. Jeanie and I both knew what was coming next. 

We called for Kate to come look at the reading. She was not happy with our joke and said it had gone on far enough. She got in the icechallenger and drove off without us. She left us in the cold 10 km away from base. Jeanie and I decided to walk back to camp before it became late and got colder.

We started following the tracks from the icechallenger and about 15 minutes into our walk it started to snow. The snow mixed with the wind was covering the tracks. Something I should mention is that in Antarctica there are very few landmarks to keep your bearings. Humans and animals do not walk in straight lines. We tend to curve ever so slightly. This is how people become lost in cornfields and such. Along with the lack of landmarks and the snow flurry we were experiencing, our fate was looking bleak. 

And that’s when we saw it.

The white figure emerged from the snow. It was a tall figure. Long arms and legs. The head was human shaped, but the eyes and mouth were that of a dolphin. Big empty black eyes and a wide open mouth with very small serrated teeth. It stuck its pointy fingers up and pointed. We followed its hand with our eyes to see Kate driving the icechallenger back to the camp. We had strayed so far from the path we could barely even see the deep blue vehicle in the snow. We started to run toward the camp. We ran to the icechallenger and jumped in and told Kate to gun it back to the base. Kate however was not in the vehicle when we got there. Jeanie and I booked it back to the camp with the GPS in the vehicle. We ran inside and locked all the doors leading outside. We ran to Todd’s room and started banging on the door to let us in. I noticed snow coming from under his door. Jeanie and I started slamming into the door until it finally gave way.

We found Todd’s body on the ground being covered in snow.

A blood red “N” carved in his chest.

--

March 29, 2018

Todd’s body was gone this morning.

--

April 3, 2018

Jeanie and I have gotten the rest and small break we needed. We decided to get back to work and try to put this behind us. Help won’t come. There’s no point in trying. This unusual snow storm is keeping everyone out of the air.
We have decided to just continue to do our research.

--

And now you are all caught up to today. 

April 10, 2018

Today we were out the farthest we had been coring for ice. I was guiding the drill down into the ice while Jeanie was next to me when all of the sudden the drill dropped like it had went through the bottom of the ice. Now the Ross Ice Shelf is several hundred meters thick. There is no way I would have went through the bottom. I pulled the drill up and to my surprise it was covered in blood.

Jeanie and I quickly pulled the core out of the drill and saw the flesh and muscle that was in the drill. We knew it was Simon. The Ningen had been leading us to find this. It had somehow gotten Simon’s body deep inside the ice. Jeanie and I rushed back to the base for the final time.

We have locked all doors leading inside as well as blocked all corridors leading out of the common building.

We have enough supplies to last a few months in here, but we don't think we will.

Tonight the sun sets for the winter in Antarctica."

I've applied to multiple but nothing yet and its getting pretty late. If I don't manage to get one what are some other options for the summer and how important is it for me to get one? I had one last summer but long story short I don't love the location and it would almost be a commitment to work for them for a while after college at least, if I go back this summer."
8bjfuz,3,2018-04-11,"As a freshman who thinks he isn’t currently experienced enough for an internship this summer, what would my best move be?",Anth0nyC4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8bjfuz/as_a_freshman_who_thinks_he_isnt_currently/,"So, I am nearing the end of my freshman year in college and I am putting some thought into how I am going to spend my summer. What I decided at first was that I was just going to get a summer job. It wouldn’t be related to Computer Science if only because I do not feel confident enough in my own abilities to apply for such a position, otherwise I would be applying for an internship. As it currently stands, I feel that I should wait until I am a sophomore before applying for any internships.

And that was my plan until I started taking a class called Technical Writing for Engineers. In that class the professor had us write up a cover letter and resume for a job that we would be interested in applying for, and he asked us to choose one that we would be willing to actually apply for, not just consider. And as I was browsing through internship and job postings, I’ve come to realize that these companies emphasize personal projects almost as much as they do actual job experience, to show that coding is indeed your passion. So now I’m trying to figure out what the best use of my summer would be. Should I focus on a personal project to add to my portfolio, maybe learning C++ along the way? Or should I take a summer job that is unrelated to the field of computer science?

tl;dr - How should an inexperienced freshman spend his summer? Working on a personal coding project or getting a summer job that is unrelated to Computer Science? Mind you, I still intend on getting an internship next summer."
8bjiux,15,2018-04-11,My gf feels completely trapped by her degree. She graduates in may. Is going back the right choice?,Karbairusa,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8bjiux/my_gf_feels_completely_trapped_by_her_degree_she/,"She is graduating this may, only 22 yrs old. 

She got her degree in IT (not sure what exactly). She is in her first internship and she absolutely hates it. She says its boring sitting at a desk, just doing scrips and stuff.

She only got this degree because she wasn't sure what she wanted to do when she was 18. Her dad suggested IT because it makes a lot of money and she went completely through with it. 


She is afraid to tell her parents that she thinks she wants to go back and get a 2nd degree. I told her that she needs to do so because she only has one life. Living a life of work that you hate with money is much worse than enjoying your job and having ""okay"" money. 


She is afraid her parent's will kick her out. They sometimes can be a little thoughtless. ""It's my way or the high way. We are right, you are wrong"", etc. Her father paid for her school from start to finish, nearly every penny. She is afraid to disappoint them. She doesn't want to upset them because it will just upset her.

I'm not her, but I told her that her parents will come around again if they do get that upset at her. I told her that she has 1 life and they have 1 life. If they choose to be upset at their daughter for wanting to be happy, that's their mistake.


I told her to shop around for classes at community college to see what she might like. Just a few classes that seem interesting that have decent paying careers. I think that's the smartest thing to do. 

Has anyone ever been in this situation before? What would you do if you were in her shoes?"

8bjub0,4,2018-04-11,"I'm a Software Dev being fast tracked for management, worried about career lock and the job after this one. Should I be concerned?",NaughtyGaymer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8bjub0/im_a_software_dev_being_fast_tracked_for/,"So to make a long story short I somehow miraculously landed myself an internship at a startup/early business with a solid enterprise product and a great (small) team working on it. We're about to start expanding quickly and there is a lot of potential to be had here in the coming months and years. Absolutely no issue with the company or employees whatsoever, total dream. 

My issue is my role within the company. Before I started they had expressed desire to see me in a leadership role, and initially I thought they meant as a coding lead. It wasn't until I started however, that I realised they are more interested in seeing me as a project manager which almost definitely means no coding from me. 

I'm honestly unsure how I feel about this. I'm not upset or anything like that, they've been totally transparent and I don't feel tricked or anything like that, I'm just wondering if this is how I want to build my career. 

I enjoy coding, I find it fun and I'm good at it. As for managing, well it's kinda hard to tell if I'll like it since I'm only 22 and this is my first real job at a tech company. I'm not against the idea, I'm just concerned that if I stay here for several years (or longer) like I had planned, how screwed am I if I want to look for a coding job elsewhere? I was warned by a friend in the industry that I need to watch out about locking myself into a career path, and I'm not really sure if I want to be removing myself from coding just yet if it means I'll never be able to get back to it. 

I'm kinda rambling now so I'll just get to the point. If I leave here in several years with 80% (if not more) of my experience being as a project manager am I handicapping myself if I want to be a coder again? Will I forever be locked into manager positions unless I take a massive paycut to be a junior dev or something?  Thanks so much for any input!"

Some notes: 


I had a lot of fun with this build, however, it did cost a somewhat exorbitant amount of money. Make sure you are very comfortable with the amount of money you are spending on a machine before you start buying parts. The incremental performance of my $5k+ machine is actually minimal for real world use cases (mine, at least) over my roommate's $1500 machine.  


&amp;nbsp;


Of all the parts I bought, the 1080 TI was the best decision I made. It is a game changer over my old 1070 when it comes to pushing modern games to 1440p 144HZ at ultra settings.  


&amp;nbsp;


Installing an operating system onto the 960 Pro was a pain. Look up guides on how to install Windows onto an M.2 / NVMe drive. It may require some trial and error depending on the manufacturer / BIOS version on your Mobo.  


&amp;nbsp;


I don't have my other keyboards (some unlisted) out at the moment, as this is the one I use to play FPS games. Comment below what you guys use your extra keyboards for, because I feel like it's a waste having them sit in my drawer / in their boxes.  


&amp;nbsp;


If I were to do it again, I would definitely have:

* cut out the RGB -- I only really use the all white setting, and, to be honest, I could have done without even that. 

* stuck with only one glass window facing in towards the components -- Glass cases are a lot of work. It is a lot of up-front effort to manage cables in the back of the case, and cleaning the glass is a new weekly chore.

* matched case / AIO CPU water cooling manufacturers the first time -- I originally bought the NZXT Kraken X62, but the radiator was too big for my case / motherboard. I managed to squeeze it in, but ultimately the H100i v2 was a much better fit. If you are concerned about fitting a radiator in your case and having enough room left over to maneuver cables or work internally, just match up manufacturers.

Been looking for work since. I've applied to 60 places so far, each with a tailored resume and most with a cover letter. I've have had 5 interviews, and none of them have given me offers. 1 place gave me a verbal offer so I rejected offers to local part time jobs as I was expecting to get the job, but then they sent me an email saying they were pursuing another applicant. They can go fuck themselves. Another company had me go through 3 rounds of interviews where the last round they had me meeting with the team and team leader I'd be working with and the HR manager and I thought it went really well, only for them to send me an email saying they as well were pursuing another applicant. I'm fairly close to just giving up at this point. I don't think I'm meant to work and be self sufficient. God is just up there laughing at my misfortune. Well fuck you God. I tried praying, fasting, reading the bible, repenting for my sins, in desperation so that He'd guide me to a job and it lead fucking no where. I'm just an inside joke up there in heaven and God and all His angels are just laughing at my inability to find work and complete lack of understanding what's wrong with me and what I need to do to just fucking support myself. Am I in hell? Is this world designed specifically to make me struggle in such a way that I think I have control and can succeed only for everything to backfire? Why the fuck can't I find work. I feel entitled to it after all these years of working hard for a degree that I was originally interested in. I have programming experience, personal side projects on a github page, a lot of internships. What the fuck is wrong with me? I just want to end it. I'm so close to being done. If I can't support myself and I have to leech off my parents and eventually society, then isn't the world better off without me? What the fuck do I need to do, prove to the world, to show that I am a hard worker and can provide value to a company? Why can everyone else find work so easily, all my friends, siblings, peers, colleagues, but I'm struggling so damn fucking hard to get anything? Why won't anyone hire me? Do I need to suck a CEOs dick? Because I'd gladly swallow anyone's cum if they'd give me a job. Do I need to cut off my limbs? If it meant I'd get a full time job with benefits and the ability to support myself and a family, I'd gladly remove every non-vital organ from me. I fantasize about going down to the lake late at night and just swimming as far as I can until I can no longer swim. Or taking my car down the wrong way on the highway and closing my eyes. Or covering myself in black clothing and laying on the train tracks late at night. Anything to escape this waking nightmare."

My school got a new IT Director awhile back, we technically have two. One is in charge of the Chromebooks and the other is left with the infrastructure. I approached the new IT Director a few weeks before summer started and told him that I’d be available during the summer if he needed anything. At the time I was a sophomore in high school. To my surprise, around 2-weeks into summer I received a call asking if I’d consider a paid internship. I took him up on his offer and started working the following week. Initially, he had me to fairly basic but time-consuming tasks. My first project was to upgrade the existing AIO’s that we had. They were Dell Optiplex computers with an HDD and 4GB of RAM and replace them with SSDs and 8-12GB of RAM. My tasks grew as time went on, we got brand new Promethean boards which I updated, calibrated, etc… The school year started, and he’d still give me work here and there such as replacing older computers.

Over the following school year, I worked to assemble a team which he refers to as his “A-Team”. It’s 5 students total, including myself. I’m the team leader. Over the summer I worked with one other student to continue upgrades on different computers, run network cables, mount TVs, and much more.

I’m now in my senior year, 18 years old, and will be going to college. My last day is April 27th and I begin classes October 1st. I’m going to be studying cybersecurity or information technology in college. When talking to the IT Director, I mentioned this during one of our casual talks. He seemed delighted that I’d be around for ~5 months. About a week after that he asked if I’d be interested in working this summer. I thought it was a continuation of my internship, but shortly after that it was proposed to me as an actual job for 5 months. I’m currently getting paid $10/hour under my paid internship.

I have a meeting after my return from break with the CFO and IT Director to discuss everything. I did forget to mention that nobody else was offered this. It could be because of the circumstances where I’ll be around for 5 months, but I’m more hoping it’ll lead to an opportunity down the road. My IT Director plans to retire in the next 3-4 years, and the college I’m going to works in a way where I’d have a bachelors in 3-years. Not to be too optimistic, but I may have a shot at stepping into his position upon graduation since I can work on my masters completely online. 

I felt like sharing this with the community since through reading comments I’ve learned a lot pertaining to my future.

Again sorry if this is against the guidelines, but I felt the need to share this! Thank you!"

I was given a project to make an internal use application for the IT team. After working on it for about a week, another intern was assigned to help me out. I got him up to speed on the code that was written so far, and we continued to work on the project. I think I probably was ultimately responsible for at least 60% of the final product, just based on lines of code.

After a week or two, though, I began to notice that our supervisor was almost exclusively going to the other intern for updates, etc. basically treating him like he was the lead dev on the project. I wasn’t very happy about this, but I couldn’t think of anything to do other than walk over when our supervisor would drop by (usually once every two days or so) so that I could at least be part of the conversation and try to demonstrate the role I was playing.

In the future, what should I do when faced with a situation like this?"

I got my math (statistics &amp; economics) degree about 2 years ago, but I never landed a data analyst job as I had hoped. The Bay Area was much more competitive than I anticipated. 

I'm reading about how there's a shortage of experienced software engineers currently and in the future and I'd like to transition into this field. I took a java intro class in college and some R classes and I tried a handful of different online courses, but didn't really stick them through because I had deal with my job, family friends etc. I am no in a place where I have some savings and very little bills and can take a risk. I know it sounds impossible, but I'd prefer to do this in a year. I am willing to relocate for a job if I get an offer. My current options I'm struggling to decide with are a Bootcamp (Hackreactor remote or on campus ), Oregon State Online CS degree or the Colt Steele Web Developer &amp; MySQL courses as well as some algorithm &amp; data structure courses. 

Hackreactor pros: Short time frame, relatively decent graduate outcomes based on the data https://cirr.org/data about 70% in 6 months, very popular stack, portfolio is made along the way, strict curriculum/routine

Hackreactor cons: The price, nearly $20K for a 3-5 month crash course, the inherent risk of not getting hired due to bootcamp reputation, no internships

OSU pros: Actual CS degree, ability to apply for internships, 

OSU cons: Even more expensive at $28K, no portfolio unless I work on it outside of studying, much longer time frame, quickest is 1 year with a pretty intense workload, required to take less important classes, will only have fundamental knowledge not working experience

Udemy pros: Cheap, maybe like $60 for all the needed material which is taught in the hackreactor class, get to build a portfolio, can keep my current job and study on my own time

Udemy cons: No structure in the sense that I have no one to ask for guidance if I get stuck, no career network available, no internships, I will have to force myself to finish the courses and not get distracted by other things


I'm really not sure what do to here, but I enjoy programming, I think it fits well for me I just need something to get myself into the field and out of what I'm doing right now. I just can't handle knowing that I worked this hard to get a degree only to get a job that doesn't interest me, challenge me, or pay me very well.

I guess the advice I'm looking for is whether I'm doing the right thing. Should I just go back home which is miles and miles away. Leave my boyfriend, leave my new life, and be with her. I'm scared that something is really wrong this time, she isn't acting herself. Should I give up what I have fought for and push for in the last 3 years and go back to them?

I don't know how much time I will have with them. I don't know what's important and I'm sure both sides could fight head on with that topic alone.

Work experience: Two years as a software developer at a large fortune 500 company. I have had a few internships all on the full technical side for programming, but post undergrad I really tried to step up and gain a leadership role.

The last couple years I have made headway - promotions, interview new hires, lead technical solution's, etc. Daily role I communicate with business owners, determine a solution, then lead 2-3 programmers to write the software.


Extra curricular: Youth group leader, couple programming meetups, and hackathons.

Undergrad school/major: Purdue University, Bachelor in Computer Science

Race/nationality: Half Asian, half caucasion

Sex: Male


--------------------
Stats

GMAT Score: 620 overall. Verbal 31, Quantitative 44, Writing 5.0, Reasoning 6.

Undergrad GPA: 2.6 - the program was top 20 and as far as I know well recognized. 

--------
MBA Info

* Goal of MBA: I really have one major goal, to learn leadership/business skills to create a solid foundation for myself. I also like the idea of having an MBA to show I have management skills, but most important to me is learning practices and strategies to become a prominent leader. For example, an ideal job would be managing multiple teams of software developers.

Is an online mba the move? An online degree was never on my radar, I actually always thought it was half a degree and pointless, now it sounds enticing. 

What's going through my head:

1. Assume $, for whatever reason, is no issue.
2. Assume making contacts is not that big of a deal to me. I know it is one of the biggest reasons people even join an MBA program, but I feel I will be fine and going through the curriculum may be more advantageous.
3. I am already growing as a leader, and have no doubt I'll move up, but I second guess a lot of decisions. MBA classes could give me principles for a foundation to build on.

So that is why I think an online mba right now would be so beneficial to me. I may be wrong, but I really am quite excited about the idea of simply learning the textbook skills of an executive role.

-------

Target schools (would probably enroll if accepted):

* Foster - Seems possible to get into, good area and online program.
* U. Maryland (Smith) - Recruiter sold me honestly, hopefully I can get in, seems solid.
* Indiana University (Kelley) - I believe the acceptance rate is not nearly as high as above, but here in the midwest the program is well known.

-------
Might be able to get into + Have online programs (don't know much about these):

* U. Mass Amerst
* U. Minnesota
* Washington State

------
Reach Schools:

* UNC Chapel - Recruiter called me actually, she said to send a resume to see more, but I am hesitant at my chances.
* U. Florida (Gainesville)

-----

Summary:

My GPA is awful and my GMAT is mediocre, but I did have a difficult technical degree and online programs seem easier to get into. I would really like to hear if anyone knows if online programs are actually lower criteria, if I could get into any of the ones I listed, and general opinions (online or even full-time) on my target schools.

8bnekk,2,2018-04-12,Senior at michigan state university trying but failing to get an internship the summer before my 5th year - help me accomplish my goal!,reagan_bush_2020,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/8bnekk/senior_at_michigan_state_university_trying_but/,"Link to resume: https://drive.google.com/open?id=16rc3vG_JcoxzXXuuVn6MdhiD2Lecla5D

This is my first time on reddit so I apologize! It is also really late, so if I am rambling or need to clarify something, feel free to point it out. Also sorry if this is long.

I am currently a senior at michigan state university majoring in mechanical engineering. I am graduating may of 2019 - next year will be my 5th year and I am trying to obtain a second internship before I begin my full time job search for after I graduate. I have had one previous internship the summer of my sophomore year, however I was not able to get one my junior year because I got way too busy with my part time job (to pay my bills), my classes, as well as my extracurricular activities that I started getting involved in.

I am having a lot of trouble getting offers or even to the interview process in a lot of cases - see more below.

The first time I went out looking for internships (my sophomore year) I managed to get one without problems. I went to career fairs in the spring, got myself into around 4 interviews and ended up accepting an offer at a company that I liked and I thought would give me good experience. It was my first internship so I was pretty ""green"" and ended up learning a lot after much trial and error. I was not able to finish all of my projects, but I definitely got far on the ones that I did not complete. I put in as much effort as I could with what I was given and with whatever information I could get.

As I mentioned, junior year I began getting involved with higher level classes. It was also the first year I started living off campus at my college, so I took up a part time job doing data entry at an insurance firm in my college town - the pay was high and competitive. That took up probably 50% of my time alone, and whatever time I had left I was devoting to my fraternity chapter (in which I currently am elected the position as academic chair). I tried whenever I could to get my second internship during this time but ended up not being able to put in as much effort as I could have - I often came to career fairs unprepared and not having had done lots of research on companies that I liked. Inevitably that did not pan out - so I decided to stay in east lansing and continue working that same job (where I am currently still employed at) while paying my rent on my crappy college house in the summer time. I definitely felt down that I could not get the internship that I really wanted, as a lot of my friends seemed really happy at theirs - but I told myself to pick it up and try again the next year.

Fast foreward to this spring, I have completely amped up my game. I took my time to critique my resume by taking it to the engineering center on my college campus, as well as sitting down with a career-savvy friend of mine who really knows a lot about resume writing to completely revamp it to what it is now. After this I set about going to career fairs, doing my research on companies that I had at the very least slight interest in and handing out as many copies as I could while doing my best to be genuine and not come off as overly nervous. I also took the time to apply online to many internships before hand as well as throughout the past few months.

In the end, most of the companies I talked to or applied online rejected me on the basis that they were looking for candidates that better aligned with the qualities they were looking for/experience. I did manage to get a couple of interviews though:

The first interview I had was at a company that I had actually interviewed at previously. It went well, but probably could have gone better to be honest. The atmosphere was kind of tense and I got a little nervous, but I still did my best to give the best genuine answers I could to their questions, and also ask them questions as well about their company, what they liked, what I would do, etc. There were a couple times that I botched the interview, but mistakes are mistakes. I sent a thank you email reaffirming my interest a few days later on a monday after I finished my midterms. They told me they would get back to me by the end of the next week (after I sent it), however I have yet to hear from them. It has been almost a month since I interviewed them now, and I sent a follow up email just this last monday to see where I am at but have gotten no response. I am assuming at this point that I have not gotten the offer (I did not pester them at all).

The second place I interviewed at was at a company where one of my friends is doing a co-op at. He referred me to the head of the engineering department, where after doing some email exchange I sent him my resume and scheduled an interview pretty quickly. The interview went really well - it was in a lot more of a ""chill"" setting with just me and the head of the department in his office talking to each other which made me feel a lot more comfortable. He commented that I had a lot of good experience on my resume which made me feel good, and I maintained good composure throughout the interview while asking and answering questions accordingly. He also told me that he would get back to me in 1-2 weeks (I understand that this is not the case most of the time). I sent a thank you email to him as well, but have not heard from him since. He also never responded to my follow up email which I sent around 10 days ago inquiring if there were any updates. Basically ghosted, I am assuming that I did not get this one either. I am a little conflicted as I felt that I had pretty good leverage on this position with my friend putting in a good word for me, but I know that is not everything when it comes to getting an offer.

To this day I still have not heard anything from either company and it has been almost a month, and I am beginning to apply last minute for any remaining internships I can find before mid-may which is around when I would hypothetically be starting.

I am just asking for input from some of you who may be going through the same thing or have been in the past. I am worried because I feel like after this summer, having only one internship that I did two years ago is going to be really hard for me to talk about in future interviews for full time positions. In terms of my resume, I have went through it about 10 times with different people and they have all said it was good, including my other very successful friend of mine who took a good look at it and worked on it with me. I feel like I also have decent experience doing things outside of class and work (which I always try to bring up in my interviews as some secondary talking points). Most notably holding my position in my fraternity chapter which has a lot of responsibility tied to it.

I am also a bit frustrated, as it seems a lot of friends and people that I know get many interviews and offers regardless of their experience, and here I am stuck either getting rejected applications or going through interviews that end in radio silence. I am currently working on raising my GPA (retaking a class that I failed last semester so it will end up being around a 3.3 at least when I am done this spring). I am dreading the thought of settling with a lower level job this summer, and seeing my friends getting offers at their companies of choice effortlessly is depressing me, and I don't know what I am doing wrong at times. I have sought advice from many people and tried so many different things but nothing has seemed to work.

Feel free to (harshly) critique my resume, and also give me some pointers regarding job searches and interviewing. Right now I feel like I know a lot about both aspects of securing internships but I know for a fact that there is something that I am missing that is costing me interviews/offers.

Thanks in advance guys! Again any input is appreciated and I will always keep an open mind."

 Prefer 2-in-1 (this just means touchscreen without detachable keyboard right?) and a good battery.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
 Pretty important, I'm gonna be using this for the rest of undergrad and then in law school, so it's gonna be in my backpack for a few years.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
 Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 12 to 14.5 inches please.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
 A bit of light gaming, I have a desktop to game on. I'd play real easy to run games every once in a while like Morrowind, Cities Skylines, OSRS, and Age of Empires II. But this really isn't important at all.

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 See above.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 I had the X220t because I loved the keyboard and the touchscreen with the stylus. I can get used to any keyboard though and I understand a stylus can be bought separately. Solid build quality is an absolute must.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
 I'd prefer at least a 1080p screen, and an SSD is required. Refurbished and used is fine."

I know I have screwed up badly as I don't have any real world experience which I now realize is what most companies actually care about.

My sister graduated from a top-tier university with a degree in Computer Science and hasn't been able to find a job after 9 months of job searching. She wasn't quite as academically strong (only had a 3.7 GPA), but she had a lot more going for her outside of academics than I do. She was an officer in multiple clubs, did a couple summer projects with professors (no internships with actual companies though), and she was lead designer for her senior project which won first place among her entire graduating class after being judged by a panel of industry veterans.

If she still can't find a job after 9 months, how am I supposed to find one?  **At this point what is the best way I can remedy this situation?**

What I am thinking at the moment is that I should apply for a Master's program even though originally I thought I would just get a job after my bachelor's.

**Pros**

* I am strong academically so I will likely be able to enter a top-tier program where I can further strengthen my abilities
* I would have more time to get my act together regarding side projects and internships before I enter the job market
* Salaries/options may be higher with a master's (although I've heard that in CS it doesn't matter as much as in other fields)

**Cons**

* Costs a lot of money, especially if I attend a higher tier university which is what I would plan to do
* Part of the reason I wanted to work directly after my bachelor's is because I've wasted a lot of time in school and just wanted to start working. I won't get into details, but I was originally studying a different major at a top-tier university but dropped out due to personal issues. I got my act together, changed majors, and am now excelling in CS but I am getting my bachelor's degree 4 years late...

Honestly though I have no idea. Does getting a master's actually make the most sense? Are there other options I should be considering? If I do go for my master's I know it's still not a ""free pass"" and I really do need to get my act together as far as job experience goes. Any suggestions on what kinds of projects I should work on or what kind of internship positions are the most useful? Thanks in advance!"

I'm still in my learning process as an intern and just found out about Remote Desktop Manager v2.7 (RDCMan) which allows me to add all my servers that I use everyday and connect and manage them easily. I have been looking around for some other software to do the same thing since RDCMan is kinda buggy for me. I had a look at ""Devolutions RDM"" which was nice! The only reason I can't use it is because it supports TeamViewer and some other tools in general that we can't use for security purposes. Does anyone know any good RDP Managers to use? Any tips?

So, as part of my internship I have the task to create a new ""expense sheet"" so that the salespeople of my company can justify ther expenses. I have decided to give a go and automatize the whole process using macros to send directly the expense sheet to the managers e-mail (not too hard) but I'm having trouble with the ticket attachments.

So the whole process should be:

1- Someone downloads the sample sheet and fills it with the expenses.

2- They attach an scanned document with the tickes so that the expenses are justified.

3- A copy of the workbook AND the attached document is sent to the manager using a macro attached to a button or a shape.

4- The manager opens it, checks it and authorizes it by clicking a button.

5- The button saves a range of cells as a pdf and sends that pdf and the attached document to ""support services"" e-mail which will then upload it to an ERP.

I want to switch careers,Jrocha0510,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/8bqbqz/massachusetts_mathhighschool_become_a_teacher_i/,"First time posting on reddit, figured I would give it a shot and see if I can get some opinions...

I graduated from college in 15' with a degree in actuarial mathematics, got an internship and then a full-time position at a midsize insurance company in Massachusetts. I knew I wouldn't like working in a corporate job, but figured the money would make it worth it. The money was OK, but not enough to compensate me hating my life every day. I do not want to wake up one day, 60 years old, and say wow, I have done nothing with my life except work at a big corporation and help make some rich old man more money.

Growing up I always helped my siblings with their schoolwork, and during college I tutored math for 3 years. I really liked being able to help others that were struggling in a course. There were multiple times when tutees would approach me after their exam and tell me they passed because of my help. It was a great feeling to know that I was able to help them. When I was in high school I actually struggled in my math classes until my senior year when I became motivated to go to college. I'm not someone who has math come easily to him, and often it can take me some serious time to really grasp a concept. As someone who went through this, I feel I can be a great resource to students who are from similar backgrounds. 

I am now strongly considering returning to school and getting my masters in secondary education and teaching high school mathematics. I am trying to remain optimistic about my decision but I have a few friends who are teachers and all I ever hear from them is how stressed out they are and how they make no money. It's beginning to really make me second guess my choice to become a teacher. I've been accepted to several grad programs in the Boston area, but I want to be 100% sure of my decision before I go through with it.

I'm hoping I can find someone here who might have gone through a similar transition as me, either corporate to teaching or vice versa, and can give me some advice/opinions on the matter.

Any advice or comments are very welcome, thank you!

**Some background just for the sake of context**  
I am currently finishing up a work term at a 7-5 job with a construction company.  My duties involve a balance of field work and office work.  Rather early on in the internship, I learned that I do not enjoy the strict ""show up at 7, leave at 5, receive a paycheck"" work style.  Showing up at 8/9 and leaving at 6/7 instead is out of the question -- you come off as lazy since no one is around to verify that you worked those hours.  I'm not a morning person so the early wake-ups kill me.  I'm also not a fan of working for someone other than myself.  I've had a few work terms now and I find the boss to employee relationship stressful and uncomfortable.  
  
So I'm going into my final year of study in September as a Civil Engineering student and I really want to take this year as an opportunity to re-focus myself on not only my studies, but also on an entrepreneurial endeavor.  Going into university, my goal was to work at a firm/company where I could develop my skills as a structural engineer or architect, but after this work term I think I'm done with the daily monotonous grind.  I want to do something on my own where I can grind for as many hours as I want, at any hour of the day/night, doing something I truly love, and where I answer only to myself.  I have many different hobbies and interests, so I don't really know where to start -- and herein lies my questions.  
  
**1.  Would it be wise to brainstorm and take the top 2-3 ideas to work on and see what works, or should I focus on one thing at a time?**  
  
**2.  I've heard that building your own brand requires a lot of discipline, drive, and determination.  You have to sacrifice a lot to get where you want to go and sometimes the road ahead may seem treacherous and long.  Are there any signs I can look out for to be sure I'm on the right path?**  
  
**3.  Do you have any advice/key insights for someone starting from the very beginning?  I feel like I'm at the bottom of Mt. Everest looking up and I have no idea how I'm going to do this -- I just know that I want to reach the top and plant my flag.**  
  
**3.5.  Am I being foolish by going through this much schooling only to abandon my plan to be a structural engineer/architect just to pursue this itch?**  
  
Thank you for any help -- it's much appreciated!"

8bqkve,6,2018-04-12,Confused about job transition - defense contractor to government,yesflexzon3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8bqkve/confused_about_job_transition_defense_contractor/,"I have some questions and stresses I would like to bounce off of people who have more time in the industry than I do.

I did a few internships over summers in college and got recruited for a defense contractor near my college. They seemed to like me, and I was happy enough. I signed on full time about 6 months ago, and the situation has rapidly deteriorated.

First question: how prevalent are the following things? The managers at work regularly openly talk shit about previous employees, even using their full names and talking about personal medical details. Almost everyone I work with is an alcoholic (openly discusses it) and spends half the day looking at memes and talking about them. In my initial interview and upon conversion to full time, I was given a telework agreement and promised verbally several times that as soon as I converted to FT I would be allowed to telework a certain amount of time per pay period. I have autism and they have a tax credit for hiring me because I disclosed it. This was an accommodation, but they have a bureaucratic wall that requires me visiting multiple professionals and waiting months to get results back. Their excuse is that they don't have money to get me a laptop they decided to require for it, even as the whole company got newer, more expensive laptops. Finally, they ask me to do work for free all the time. We strictly keep track of time in order to report back to government. They will ask me to ""take lunch"" (euphemism for do it for free but don't record the time) and do all kinds of things (such as making a whole UI mockup for a detailed website). I tend to get sensory overload often because we are not allowed to eat lunch outside of the office (stupid company rule that only lets you purchase fast food and drive it back), and breaks are crucial to me. They also said further education was an option. When I asked about it several months into the job, they laughed at me and said that's only when they have extra money, which is never. Finally, they openly joke and talk about actually firing people with little to no reason. They don't really understand autism, and I know I'm first on the chopping block as soon as they want to kick someone out again.

Second question with some leading information: I began feeling very sad almost all the time a few months into FT work at this company. The last straw was when I was recruited to government in the same sector. As you know, government has much more disability protections and discrimination protection, and their benefits are better. Usually the salary is lower in exchange for job security. Anyhow, the recruiter informed me that the pay would be a bit over $70k, whereas my contractor job paid a bit over $60k (this is in the middle of nowhere in the South and is probably equivalent to about $140k in actual purchasing power in SF). I always hear about getting ""stuck in the government"", but is there any reason that this shift wouldn't be worth it? (I have already interviewed and gotten a formal offer that I can take any time)

Third question: How do I deal with the transition? The people I currently work with are very passive aggressive and take people leaving personally. They have a particular disdain for people leaving for the government. It is a strictly at will contract, so I don't technically owe them any notice, but I plan to give at least some. I just know I'll be treated like shit more than normal, and these people will do ANYTHING to fuck me over that they legally (or illegally but can get away with) can. Is giving them one week in light of this and what I mentioned previously reasonable? My counselor said to give them a few days, but I feel like that's pushing it. 

As a final note, there's pretty much nothing left I can try to mitigate what's happening in my current job. I don't like the fluff development on what's essentially a useless maintenance project already, and on top of that they blatantly lied to me about many things, don't provide basic accommodations, no job security, and the pay is bottom of the barrel. I am very stressed about this because I know that job hopping is frowned upon, but the atmosphere where I shadowed in the government is completely different. They're doing real projects that interest me a lot, and everyone seemed a lot more engaged in actual work instead of petty bullshit.

Thank you for any guidance you can give me. There aren't many people in real life I can ask about this for obvious reasons."

I study finance and all of these positions related to my studies.

- The 1st option is a position at a smaller company - it is about 15 years old, have 160 employees, they are growing, I think they are going to be much bigger in a few years. I would love to work for them, they seem to be really nice and friendly - I had a job interview with the guy who started the company and it was a really good experience. However it is a small company and they don't have a name yet. I think it would be more beneficial for my future to work at a more prestigious company, because it would look better in my CV. If I were looking for a job for 5+ years I would pick them, but it is an internship. They said they would want me to work there longer, but I have no idea what am I going to do one year from now. 

- The 2nd option is working at a Big4 company. It would really nice in my CV, but at a company that big I would be just one of their million employees and I might not enjoy it that much. I have some friends who did their internship at a Big4 and they said they enjoyed it, but it can be monotonous sometimes.

- The 3rd option is working at a really prestigious, well-known company, which works really close with banks. I think I would enjoy working there, but I don't know that much about the position yet. I could work there because my father is friends with someone at high position. It sounds nice, but it would be less of an accomplishment from me and it doesn't feel ""right"". In the end it would be a good looking company in my CV and no one will ever ask how I got the job.

I'm trying to look for a new college at this point. Credit-wise, I am a senior but I checked with my school and because I wasted my time on major switches, failing classes, and taking too many lower-level credits, I accumulated 113 credits at my current institution.

I used to be a fairly good student. My graduation GPA at the community college was a 3.6 with an Honors Diploma. After I arrived at this school, it took a nosedive and I have a 2.2 GPA at the school (3.2 Cumulative GPA)... and for the first time in my academic career, I have been unhappy with school. I am currently taking the semester off, but I have so many complaints about the school I currently attend that I want to leave. I don't want to list them all because it'd be a longer read than a Stephen King book.

I was looking into how many credits it would take to complete my degree. I have 113 credits right now. I need 160 credits from that school to graduate, because I took too many ""junk"" courses that, for the most part, do not transfer anywhere else in the nation (I checked).

I am seriously considering leaving this school before I give them anymore of my money. There's a dissonance between the school's focus versus my career focus and my focus on my future. My career goals and college priorities are much different from when I initially transferred. When I first transferred to this school, I was just looking at the social scene and the quality of on-campus resources (there are many; this is a LARGE school). Now, I have a list of things I'd like to see in my next college:

1	Prepare me for a career in voice acting/music/anything that could give me an income stream
2	A program that allows non-majors to take acting courses and/or an *actual* chance to audition for their plays
3	A program with tutoring services; that will help me when I am struggling in classes
4	Decent Professors that are actually successful in their field and are not just using teaching as an income stream because their other career choice failed
5	Professors that want to see students succeed and will go above and beyond to assist them
6	A program in a thriving acting market in Florida where I can audition for projects or take classes outside of school
7	A program in a city or a suburb right by a city
8	A program that allows me flexibility of schedule
9	A Career Services Center that provides opportunities for me to work in the entertainment industry, either through internships, co-ops, job shadows, or jobs.
10	A college that will fully accept my A.A. as my Gen-Eds but give me the option to not transfer any credits from UCF altogether
11	I would strongly prefer a public college within the state of Florida. That way, I can take advantage of in-state tuition and lower costs
12	The freedom to explore the business side of the entertainment industry so I can prepare for what's to come.
13	A program that allows me the opportunity to get training in a flexible survival job
14	Coursework that is relevant to what I want to do

Some of this criteria should seem obvious. Obviously, you have no idea what kind of insanity I've been through.

I've used up almost 2.5 years of my financial aid. I'm really scared at the possibility of losing it, or worse, that I may needs to take over 160 credits to graduate. My GPA is too low so I can't apply for scholarships like I used to. The state of Florida requires 45 upper-level credits and I only have 3 usable upper-level credits. My GPS from the first institution was a 3.6, my GPA from this current college is a 2.2, and my overall is a 3.2 GPA. I failed 3 classes; two that won't transfer anywhere else. 

I acknowledge that I royally screwed up on many levels when first choosing a transfer school... big time. I want a chance to fix that. I'm concerned about tuition so I feel like I have to stay in Florida and attend a public university. 

So: What are my options Is there any way that I could transfer just the credits from the first college I went to but not the second, even after submitting it? At this point, I want those credits from the second institution gone. It's junk that won't apply towards anything. Do you know of any good vocational/trade schools in either Miami or Orlando, in case there's nothing for me? What are my options looking like? Can anyone give me some advice? Thank you!"

I'm a second year undergrad cs student at a less prestigious Canadian university (Ryerson), and I've kinda thought about doing grad school after I finish. The thought of research seems kinda neat, I was thinking of doing stuff that had to do with the brain and computers, anyway I landed a couple interviews this year but I have two offers right now: (They both have similar rates and hours)

Offer 1 (The research): I can't seem to find the description but basically an Engineering prof recruited me, 2 other undergrads, and 2 PhD students to develop a mobile application funded by the city of Toronto in order to track data about cars to reduce carbon emissions. We'd be using a lot of AWS and I'd be mostly 66% front-end, 33% back end. 

Offer 2. http://prntscr.com/j4gfxg
This offer would technically make me an intern. I'd be working in a team and would have to deliver something every two weeks.

Any advice would be highly appreciated. "
8bt2sz,1,2018-04-12,Moving away,eboaylag,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8bt2sz/moving_away/,"Hi, 

I graduate from college in May. I had an interview today for a full-time position at the company I’ve worked at as an intern for about a year now, and it went really, really well.

If I get the position, I’ll be given the option to either stay in MD where I am, or to move to Denver, CO. I’m leaning towards moving, but I have my hesitations.

When I think about it, there isn’t much that’s grounding me here. 
I’m heavily involved in a student org on my campus, and I love it and the people in it dearly.
I was in an emotional abusive relationship for two years where he cut me off from the world. I wasn’t allowed to have friends, or to be in any orgs, and as a result, I don’t really have friends. The people I am around most and enjoy most now are the people in my student org, but I’m not close to any of them and I’m graduating in a month, so I won’t even be around on campus to get to know anyone more.
My family is here in MD. I love them and care for them a lot, and I know I’d miss them, but I don’t think it’s reason enough for me to stay.
I’ve been dating someone for a year now who is kind, understanding, and everything good. He’s a year behind me at college, so if I leave, we’ll have to do long-distance. He’s fully supportive of my potential move, and I know we’d be able to communicate well log-distance, but the idea of not being able to see him in person breaks my heart.
I think that where I am now in my home state and being surrounded by the members of my student org who think I disappeared for two years and came back randomly brings up so much guilt and anger in me. I feel like moving away would give me the fresh start I need, but part of me feels like I’m running away from my problems.

I guess I’m just looking for some insight on how other people have dealt with moving, and any similar feelings about moving like mine. What pushed you to leave? What made you want to stay behind? How did you decide that moving was the best thing for you? Can you give me any advice for how I’m feeling?

Thanks for reading, and thank you in advance."

No technical internship experience.,barbarellasilver,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8bu7uc/nervous_about_starting_my_first_job_in_it/,"I graduated in December with a degree in Computer Science from a fairly prestigious university with an acceptable GPA (not stellar, but didn’t close many doors either). This might be a controversial subject but I’ve never loved CS. I picked it up later on in undergrad, and by the time I figured I might not be cut it for it it was too late to turn back. It’s interesting and fun depending on the day, but I have no where near the technical skills of my peers at uni. Most other CS majors at my school had been coding since middle or high school and pretty much knew the curriculum of every core/elective coding class before taking it. 

As a result I really struggled to keep up. In  turn, when I started to look for non-technical internships because I never felt like I had the qualifications that most internships required. Most of my internships were in marketing, which I really enjoyed. I found it difficult to find a decent marketing internship the summer before my senior year. Most of the companies that I was targeting were exclusively hiring candidates with Marketing majors. I ended up pursuing what I thought was a viable career option, finance (S&amp;T), instead, but I absolutely hated it. 

I was worried about the idea of having disjointed academic and professional experiences on my resume, but I realized the combination would make me a good candidate for consulting (experience in several industries, many “problem solving” scenarios I was able to speak on). I applied for many strategy consulting roles, but ended up getting a single offer from a small, fast growing IT consulting company. The idea of starting this job really stresses me out because I have no idea what technologies/languages I’ll be working with, and I’ll likely be behind the rest of the new hires in terms of technical experience. My friends from school who were at a similar technical level ended up with software engineering jobs at huge companies where they spend 6 months to a year in training, and not everyone working alongside them is even a computer science major. 

I’m pretty freaked out that within the first few months I’ll be fired for lack of technical skills. I haven’t been able to focus on studying a particular language or technology because it’ll all vary depending on the project I’m working on. 
(I’ll most likely be focused on FinTech related projects.)

**TL;DR: Nervous about starting job in IT consulting. No professional coding experience.**

**Is there anyone else who felt like they slipped through the cracks when starting their first CS job? How did you prepare for and/or cope with the experience? For those who are in IT consulting, what skills (technical or otherwise) are most important in your role?**"

Unfortunately due to taking summer courses I was not able to partake in any summer internships. I'm currently working part time at a startup as a tester for their website (Literally just test each web page to make sure it functions properly and report any errors to a dev team they have overseas developing the site).

I recently got offered a Summer Internship as a Mobile application developer that is full-time however only pays $15/hour and is also a further commute for me (1 hr 30 min).

In my current job, that is part time, I'm getting paid $16 an hour and the commute is 1 hr.

Since I don't have any work experience it has been hard to find a job as a junior developer and I feel interning as a mobile application developer would really help in making my Resume stand out as I continue to apply to other jobs.

I just wanted to get advice in what I should do, should I stay in my current part-time job that is closer to home and continue my job search or should I take the internship (which is almost twice the commute time) and gain some useful experience that I feel would ultimately get me the job I want as a junior developer.

I ultimately know that it is my decision to make but I wanted to garner some advice before making my decision.

I've been getting contacted by technical staffing agencies. Do you think this would be a good route for me to take? Does anyone have any positive or negative experiences using staffing agencies (the one that intrigues me the most is Aerotek since they seem to have a better reputation when compared to other agencies)?

**Backgound**

Sex: Male (26)

Race/Nationality: Hispanic / USA

GMAT: 710 (45Q/42V)

Undergraduate: GPA - 3.8, Double majored in Business Economics and Management (Average State School)

Graduate School: Masters degree in environmental economics and rural development, Graduated with ""Honors"", Earned a ""Distinction"" for my master's thesis (think Oxford, LSE, Cambridge)

Athletics: The reason I went to the average state school was because I was an ESPN All-American at my sport and the school had a great athletic program. I got a full-ride athletic scholarship and was the captain of my Division-1 team. Ranked an ESPN top-10 recruit coming out of high school, but blew out my ankles / achilles / back freshman and sophomore year, and had to re-evaluate my life plan afterwards. This is the area of my background where I have no idea how much value admissions committees will place on my application.

Extra-curriculars: I have volunteered at an urban farm non-profit for awhile. The organization is built to teach low-income children from my city about the importance of farming, responsibility, and hard work. I help build chicken coops / greenhouses / community gardens / etc. there when needed, and am now a field trip leader for groups of children who come and visit the farm. I also volunteer at an urban garden center where I help out with distributing plant seeds and transplants for low-income families to grow food for the season.

**Work Experience**

Current: Active US government security clearance working for a financial regulator in the agriculture industry. I travel around the US visiting and examining agricultural banks to ensure compliance with federal regulations, and provide consultative-like advice on financial issues that are affecting the bank at that time. I've gotten two promotions within three years of working there, and now am in charge of my own bank that has assets over $500MM. I examine all levels of a bank including: governance, capital levels, asset quality, earnings, liquidity, interest rate sensitivity, internal controls, policies and procedures, etc. We work in a project type management structure, so sometimes I am managing between 10-15 people, and other times I am managing no one. Strong performance appraisals throughout my time at the organization.

Past: Before I was at my current job, I interned in the mayor's office of my city (fairly large capital city) doing sustainability work, and I also had an internship the summer between undergrad and grad school where I worked in Central America for a large multinational agricultural company in the corporate social responsibility department.

**MBA Info**

Goal of MBA: My favorite part of my job is the project management style consultative work we do for the banks we regulate. I'd like to leverage my financial and project management work experience to transition to consulting. Preferably, I'd like to work for a consulting company with a strong agriculture related client base. Also, I'm interested in sustainability and corporate responsibility, so that is something I'm interested in from an MBA program and hopefully a future job.

Schools: Harvard (big stretch), Northwestern, Michigan, Dartmouth, Duke, Yale, Virginia, Cornell, UNC, UT-Austin, Washington-Foster

I tried to focus on schools with a strong consulting employment record, and also like I mentioned above, culture fit. I love the outdoors (skiing, backpacking, biking) and thrive better when I am in an environment of teamwork and fun rather than ultra competitive. "

I just got a software developer intern offer some a big company, and they want to put me into a full-stack role to build something from scratch probably. They think I have a strong coding background from previous internships and performed well during the tech interviews.
But the fact is that I overstated my abilities on the resume and cheated a little during the interview since I'm so afraid that I cannot get a summer internship. For my last internship, I basically just do some testing, but I have used some of the developers work to furnish my experience. For the interview, they asked some data structure and algorithm questions which I'm not that competent in right now. I tried to search the answers on the Internet and passed the interviews in the end. 
I do feel really bad about doing this since I know it's totally unethical. (Guys you could look down upon me, I know I've crossed the line) I have tried hard to pick up the skills from now to prepare for the internship. But I'm still worried that I could not complete the work they assigned to me in the future and they will sooner or later find out that I'm indeed incompetent. 
I know based on my programming competence now, I won't have a shot at the return offer. My question is will they fire me during the internship if they find out that I couldn't complete the required tasks? 
Anyway, I want to be a qualified developer and will work hard on the goal. And I hope I could learn a lot and meet the requirement during the internship. But I just feel really unconfident right now since I'm even stuck with simple CS courses/projects in school."

As the title says, I’m looking to learn some C# and SQL programming. I just was offered a job as an IT intern this summer and I want to get a head start on learning the languages they have built their systems on. I have a decent amount of programming background (Java, Python, MATLab) but I’m not sure where to look for good learning material. Should I look for tutorials online (free would be preferable I’m a very broke college student) or should I try something else? 

Thanks in advance!"
8bxi7j,2,2018-04-13,First post college job decision question.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8bxi7j/first_post_college_job_decision_question/,"Hello,

I'm wrapping up my final semester as a cs/math undergrad so the job hunt is in full swing. I apologize in advance for the lengthly background of this question, but I'd appreciate some outside perspective.

**TL;DR:** Offer to be the tech lead on a potentially impactful project, boss would be a nightmare, but don't have any other definite plans lined up.

The first internship I had was at a small-ish CRE firm (call it X) doing tech tasks in an industry that is known in general a bit more old school. On the first day, each of the ~15 interns were assigned to a broker that they would shadow for the duration of the internship. I was brought on to maintain and improve their internal website, and to do any surface level stat/data analysis that came up, so I was assigned to a market research employee with no direct tech background. As a side note these assignments were primarily for on-the-ground broker experience, and meant to be a bit more relevant to interns looking to pursue that career path. 

The only (and somewhat substantial) problem I had there was with the employee I was assigned under. He immediately made it clear that I was there to do non-tech ""grunt work"" for him. I was happy enough to be employed that I was ready to oblige, but by day 2 I was getting requests from above him - from CEO/COO (tight knit firm) - to work on stuff that they had in mind for me. 

When I say grunt work I really mean slow and time consuming, like handing me a list of 650 numbers to call and ask the same question about their listings. When I first started getting those other requests, though, I *assumed* it would be okay for me to prioritize them, but he consistently pressured me (he had a short temper) to finish whatever he had assigned to me before shifting focus. To make matters a bit more frustrating, whenever I tried to bring up any reasonable and easy idea to speed up the tasks he assigned to me, he would shut me down and tell me to just do them exactly as he told me. A lot of micromanagement.

I had some other ideas that I thought would be good month-long side projects that would be of real benefit to the firm, but after the first week or so I became uncomfortable approaching him with those. I like to consider myself a pretty gracious person, especially in work environments, so I was a bit disheartened by the situation up to that point. One day I was chatting with the substantially more forward thinking CEO, and asked him for direction with respect to work prioritization, and when I told him about some of the more substantial ideas I had, he asked me to drop the tasks that were taking up the majority of my time and start developing. This made my supervisor pretty aggravated, and he chewed me out in front the other interns. 

It settled down after that and I was able to complete work that I was proud of, but the first month-ish left a real bad taste in my mouth regarding that particular employee. 

Fast forwarding to present day, I'm looking for a job in the same area and have some tentative - but promising - prospects. Last week, however, I got an email with an offer to have a lead role in building a research platform from the ground up based on extensive consulting from veterans in CRE. It was from that same employee. The CEO has faith in the idea, and I have a lot of faith in him, so the opportunity to get involved has some appeal. On the other hand that employee I had a bad experience with would be my direct and only boss. 

I'm really considering the opportunity as a backup as I get closer to graduation, but thinking about working with that guy makes my skin crawl. My folks tell me I should completely write it off because I was miserable during my time involved with that employee, but some of my friends in tech are telling me that just having *any* post college work experience is a huge stepping stone, and that my position would be eye-catching/impressive for a first non-internship work experience. Should I hold off on moving forward with this and wait to see how other stuff plays out? Part of me is afraid that the project is large enough in scope that I wouldn't be able to move on as quickly as my friends have told me I would. Is it worth it for the nice resume entry even though the particular domain is entirely bland to me? Sorry again for the anxiety-ridden wall of text, I appreciate any insight y'all can provide."

When someone ask me to introduce myself, the first thing I can think of are some shitty side projects that look good on my resume, and nothing more. I'm a mindless, lifeless, hobbyless ECE drone. Everyday, all of my life revolves around MPs, exams, final projects, one after another in an never ending loop. On rare occasions when I have the luxury to eat with friends, all we can talk about are classes and internships. Otherwise, I only have time for some very late night vidya. What's the point of staying in school, if I'm only training myself to be a better slave? That six figure job mean nothing if all I'm gonna do is continuing to be a coding drone for eternity.

Meanwhile, the people I meet and hangout with each semester solely depends on what classes I'm taking. If we end up taking different classes, then we might as well go to different schools.

The worst part is: If I even remotely try to allocate time for anything ""fun"", I get kicked in the balls by this curriculum. If I devote all of my time to studying, I still get kicked in the balls by this curriculum. I feel lost."

By the end of the March massacre, I've been accepted to a couple of equivalent schools for CS including UMass Amherst ($40k), UMD ($47k), UNC ($50k), NEU  ($56k) and UCSD ($58k). And I'm deciding between those.

For UMass Amherst, it's the cheapest and seems to rank high in CS/ AI (according to USNews &amp; CSRankings.org). But I'm not sure if I can do research there because when I looked at multiple AI labs, there were filled with phD/post-docs and almost no undergrads. 

I got into UMD honors and UMD seems to have good CS reputation as well.

UNC seems to have a more vibrant vibe and better national ranking. 

NEU is in Boston and UCSD is in California, which are supposed to give me more internship opportunities.  

What do you guys think?"

I don’t know why I’m posting this, maybe just to tell my story. 
I’m a 24 male and suffered with depression since I was about 10. Throughout my shitty life I’ve been bullied, over weight, and abandoned (I know sounds like a generic teenage loser film lol). I was suffering through my depression alone until I was 22 and I never told a soul about my plans of suicide until that year. I told my father first and I expected some kind of shock or worrying reaction. What I got was him telling me “ get a job” and ignoring me for the next 3 months until I left to go live with my mother. A little background on my father; when my mother got pregnant with me, he came out of the closet as gay and left her. Since then he has only used me and my fragile state for his own benefit while mocking and berating me in private. I don’t want you all to get the wrong idea, I don’t hold any resentment towards him for leaving but what he told me was the last straw of a long line of issues. I no longer talk to him and I don’t regret it. 
I later told my mother who sent me to see a psychiatrist the next day. I was diagnosed with depression (shocking I know) and was prescribed medication and therapy. I also went to a support group where the teach how to act in normal society. 
Throughout this entire process, I’ve lost most of my family, my friends who I made in college stopped talking to me, including my “best friend”. People who I thought would support me are now gone and I have no one. I haven’t been accepted to any job that I’ve applied to, part time included, and I’m running out of places to apply. My degree is useless and I’m broke. My mother is still supporting me and keeps telling me how much I have to give. Her saying that is just making me worse. I’ve been told that all my life. School came easy to me( I don’t mean to sound entitled or anything) and I was treated as an outcast because I wasn’t allowed to move up to more advanced classes so I was treated like shit by almost all my classmates in high school. 
I internalized this into college so I never went to class and never took any internships or had any serious clubs. ( IF YOU READ ANYTHING IN HEAR READ THIS.  DONT YOU WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN ME MAKE THIS MISTAKE LIKE I DID) If you want to be successful you need these and I just thought they were useless things and another reason to be made fun of. After 6 years ( there was an issue where my abroad credit didn’t transfer) I managed to graduate with a 3.0. ( I also retook a couple classes I failed so the grade replaced the failing grade). 
I’ve lived my life thinking things would get better but I’m just toxic. I’ve somehow pushed away anyone who I thought cared about me ( including a girl I thought I loved). The only people I have left are my mother, little brother and sister (who resents me for “abandoning” my father). The world is just full of people who don’t care, are sadistic and there’s no hope for someone like me. Yesterday I had an argument with my stepfather and he told me how useless I was and how much of a waste of money and space I was. I told him I was going to kill myself to relieve everyone and he told me just not to do it in the house. I left to go I don’t know where and ended up driving 100 miles away. The entire time I was considering how to kill myself without pain. My mother called me, concerned for me, and I decided not to do it that day. When I later told her what happened, she was upset but was defending my stepfather. I just don’t know anymore. I don’t think I want to die but I don’t want to exist in this world. My dreams are gone and have dwindled down to winning the lottery and moving to the woods to be left alone. There’s no hope for that though so I don’t know what else to do. Anyway thanks for reading if you made it this far. "

This is not me currently, it is me 2 years after. I would like to know what my chances are, how to improve them and what else is needed to be done so that I can create a career path to myself for remaining 2 years. I am studying electrical and electronics engineering in the one of the best engineering faculties in Turkey with having approximately 3.5 GPA. I will most probably graduate with 3.6-3.7 / 4.0 GPA, I am not sure if that makes much difference though. I have all of my department related courses taught in English and also I have A2 German level. My university offers intermediate and advanced lanbguage courses which I am planning to take and I assume to have B2 or maybe C1 German level, which I hope to be enough for living and working. Also, I cannot bring much money to the Germany due to both parental level of income and euro/tl ratio. After a short background information, I would like to ask my questions, I would appreciate any kind of help.

1) I will complete at least 2 summer internship and probably will work part-time in my senior year. How hard would it be to find my first job considering such experiences? Also is there a minimum wage to be welcomed by German government? (For example, would they say you cannot get visa unless you find job with at least 3k€ salary?)

2) Speaking of salaries, how much would be the regular entrance salary for an engineer? Does it make much difference that I am not German? Would it be enough to create a life in Germany from nothing?

3) If I get accepted by a job, do I need to do anything else to get Visa besides paperwork?

4) Does my bachelor's degree be a problem in Germany? Do they offer an exam or something like that to recognize my degree?

5) What about Master's in Germany? I don't consider pursuing an academic career but I heard having master's degree can be helpful for industry as well. (unfortunately, It does not make much difference here) How hard would it be without having any family money? I heard they are almost free but obtaining funding is almost impossible for master's, unlikely PhD. I assume that we are allowed to work part-time as waiter or something similar to a certain number of hours. Is it true and does working part-time be enough to meet the expenses? Also, how likely fr me to find a part-time job considering my race and non-fluent German level? Can we work while master's degree (I mean departmental work)? If so, how likely is it to find such job that accepts master students? 

6) I can understand racism against Turkish people (average Turkish people is one of my reasons to get away from this country) but does it affect me much? Do I face some challenges while tyring to make some friends due to prejudice?

7) Does [this car](https://suchen.mobile.de/fahrzeuge/details.html?id=258108981&amp;damageUnrepaired=NO_DAMAGE_UNREPAIRED&amp;isSearchRequest=true&amp;makeModelVariant1.makeId=17200&amp;makeModelVariant1.modelId=148&amp;minFirstRegistrationDate=2018-01-01&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;scopeId=C&amp;searchId=2d3d41e7-a3ef-17db-6d27-a44048b3e55b) really costs that much including taxes, etc. ? In Turkey, this car costs like 400 times minimum wage, even just these car prices would be my pure motivation to go there.

8) Does obtaining citizenship makes much difference? If so, are there other ways to obtain it rather than working there for 8 years?

I think that they are all my questions. I appreciate any kind of help. I really would like to live in Germany and I try to do as much as I can to achieve this goal. Are there other things that I need to be aware of? What are the things that I should do to increase my chance to get selected? Do you have any other recommendations or warnings? Also, is there anyone else that achieved a similar shift?

Thanks in advance, I really want to live and work in such country, I am open to any suggestions."

I’m in the second year of my PhD in the middle of no where. (Everything is about 5 hours away). I came to the school I am at now because I was doing an internship at a small start up and the guy who founded it sent me to do my PhD in the lab I’m doing my PhD in now. My boss is kind of like a life mentor to me. He has given me a lot of life advice and definitely does a lot for me to succeed (he can be an asshole to me but I’ll get to that later). He gave me a place to stay, connected me with my professor who pays for my school and me as an RA and I get to still work with him. (So I have a boss and a professor). Seemed great. 

Well I get here and there is one other PhD student in the lab who was on his 4th year of his PhD. However, he quit probably 2 months after I got there. There was a masters student who also quit and another that graduated. Now I am literally the only one in the lab. It is extremely isolating and everything falls on my shoulders. The projects we work on require months of work and leading up to the tape out, I will not sleep for days and stay in lab. I work 12 hour days (of course not all 12 hours are super productive and they seem to be getting less and less productive) on week days and about 8 on week ends. I hate being alone this much. I just wish I had one other person there to bounce ideas off of. My professor is constantly traveling and rarely on campus. I am supposed to have meetings with my boss every week but they are getting fewer and fewer and he’s not here to know what’s really going on.

I also feel like I’m complete shit at what I do. I feel like I’m a chef in a kitchen and I have all these great tools around me and I try and try to put something together but I just end up taking a big shit and serving it. All these orders keep on coming in and I just keep on putting shit together and shit is burning all around me. I have three of those big deadlines coming up and I have two designs I need to test. And one person. All of this takes so much time and I’m so bad at it and it’s all just piling up. 

Then there’s the part that my professor and my boss can be quite mean to me. My boss has called me fat, equated me to a homeless person who can’t help themselves and dumb. My professor calls me useless and says my work is embarrassing. They definitely have their good moments too and are supportive sometimes. It’s just a rollercoaster. And I live in one half of my bosses duplex so I feel like he has so much control of my life. I have thought about moving out but I honestly feel like he would get mad or it would be a thing I’d get a talking about because it’s also a favor for him that I’m living here (i make sure his place is okay as he live 1500 miles away) and he would give me a hard time for putting my energy in something besides research. 

I’m so confused what to do. I’m so broken because it feels like I can’t get anything right and everything is piling up and all I do is just cry at my desk. I can’t even think straight. What would you do?

In his initial request, this intern had written 7 different things he needed and each task or value was work-intensive. That is, each task would take at least an hour, if not more, of time, data collection and/or sparsing and calculations. 

At first this was fine since my work load was smaller and I was looking for things to do, I half heartedly completed most of the list and sent it back to him. The problem is, now my work load has picked up quite a bit, and he's been asking me more questions about how I calculated things or collected the samples he wanted. I feel like he's questioning my methods and micro-analyzing everything I did. And with each question, I've had to spend more and more time explaining and double checking things to the point where, for each email he sends me, I have to spend an hour or more collecting the information to respond.
Point being, this whole thing is getting to be a huge pain. I really DO want to help him with his project, because I believe in everyone supporting each other, but this is cutting into my other projects and he's starting to get use a vaguely condescending ""I'm your manager"" tone with me. 
Is there any way I can call off helping him? Is it even appropriate to tell someone, no, I don't want to do this work that you're asking me to do?"

I am at a kind of unique situation and would really appreciate some insight here. I'm currently a senior in computer engineering at a mid-tier school (ranked maybe top 50), but I feel that I haven't grown from the courses in college as much as I would have liked. I'd like to go somewhere that pushes me harder in terms of coursework for grad school. However, I'm taking a few years off from school, and would like to know how to keep my application as strong as possible for the schools I'm interested in (i.e. stanford, caltech, berkeley, etc). 

Here are the good parts of my application.

* Research: My lab is a bit unique in that it isn't exactly a group. Everyone in it works directly with the PI on their own project, and he'll give you as much as you're capable of handling. Because of this, I've been the main software engineer on 4 separate projects for the last 3 years, and my research has been very successful. After everything finally goes through and our papers are accepted somewhere, my undergrad research will have yielded around 5 conference papers and 2 journal papers. Furthermore, my PI has promised to continue to credit me on research papers related to my projects after I have graduated, which will likely add a couple more.

* Summa cum laude (3.98 GPA).

* Completed 2 internships in very related research. 

* GRE is around 330.

* The job I've accepted after undergrad is very specialized in what I plan to eventually pursue for my Ph. D in is at a really prestigious tech company (think machine learning @ Microsoft, Google, etc).


And here are the parts that are looking less good =/

* Letters of rec. My PI will write me a great one, but I'm not so sure about the other two, as I haven't really tried to reach out to professors much in undergrad. I do have a strong letter from my mentor at my more recent internship which I could use, but I'm a little stuck on the last one. Furthermore, I'm hesitant to ask my boss at the company I go to work for, as I would likely be quitting the company to go back to school, and I'm not sure how supervisors typically handle that.

* Most of my publications are not first author. This is the kind of weird part; my PI generally tends to take first author, so only 1 or 2 of my publications (conferences, no journals) are first author. Most of them are second, and one of them is third. I'm not sure how this affects things though, especially since schools will know that he is my PI based on his letter and there no grad students ahead of me on any of them.

* My major is *slightly* different than what I want to study. I majored in computer engineering, and I'd like towards comp sci in grad school. It's possible that I won't quite meet the course prerequisite requirements depending on the school. 

What I'm mostly worried about is following.

* Is it a good idea to get a generic letter of rec from a professor before I leave college, or would it be better to try to get one from my work supervisor later on?

* Because I've worked on so much research, I'm kind of worried that committees will think that I was super spread over a lot of different things and that as a result, my contributions were all superficial. However, I actually implemented all 4 of my projects from scratch. Do you have any advice on addressing this when I apply without coming off as a cocky jackwagon?

* A lot of the schools I'm interested in ask to describe ongoing research. When I do these statements in a few years, should I focus on my work from undergrad, or should I describe my actual job? They're likely going to be loosely related, but could have a big pull on which group I'd get placed into if I were accepted (i.e. self-driving cars/cognitive robotics vs. machine learning/natural language processing).

I'm a new grad (4 months out of school) and I just got an offer from a propietary trading firm in Chicago. This isn't really the field or even the location I was interested in working in right out of school, but it seems like it could be a cool place to work for a couple of years, the compensation is kind of absurd, and I don't have any other offers so I might be pressed to take it.

Thing is, I'm a little worried because I'm not the fastest developer out there and this company seems to value speed. I really identify with [this thread on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8bvpu3/how_can_i_advance_my_software_engineering_career/). I'm getting better at e.g. planning out projects before writing any code, but finishing tasks still takes me a while. Hell, in the onsite for this trading company, I didn't finish the assigned coding task they gave me or even get it compiling--I'm pretty sure I was hired based on my performance in the design interviews, my commentary on the code I wrote, and my soft skills. 

I've also heard that places like this have high turnover for underperformers, and I really underperformed at my last two internships (didn't finish my projects in either, no return offer from my last one) so I'm worried that 3-4 months in I'm going to just get fired and be jobless in a city I just moved to. I have some strategies in mind for avoiding that kind of outcome again--I've learned to take much better notes since then, for example--but it's still a real possibility.

Are these rational fears? Should I just keep looking for a job or should I take this? They've given me a week and I have a couple of interviews next week with some lesser-known companies in California so I'll hopefully have more on my plate to choose from later.

Thanks in advance."

I had enough time to come back after my startup failure, my best friend cheating, I thought my life was over.

Somehow my love for technologies, my passion for the same didn't let me sink, I came after huge personal loan, home loan mortgages, finally debt free today, hired 3 interns now to start to build my new company on IoT segment. 

I made 100K USD in 2017-2018, being in India, being a technical trainer, teaching React, Angular, Node.js alone in a year, knowing to be good trainer in corporate segment.  I was begging an employer to give me 10K USD per year for my survival in 2016-2017, after I had lost my startup investment, where I had put all my lifelong earnings. 

Consulting is a best thing, survival is all about to fight back.. Keep the energy, things can change in just one year.. I never thought I survive, my wife cried so much, my family concerned so much about future of my 7 year old daughter life and her education. I paid my daughter school fee in credit card, after her school send us notice to pay school fee or withdraw her from school, not paid home loan for few months, credit card guys and home loan bankers threatening me for seizure of properties, could not pay bike and car insurance. All changed in period of 1 year, I could earn 1.2 Lakhs INR (2000+ USD) in 3 days, that paid my daughter school fee + transport etc for whole  year, earned enough money in 1 months to pay off  credit card, earned enough money to pay off and close the home loan in 4 months period, earned enough money to buy a property that my wife had dreamed for life in 7 months time.  

Living is one of the pleasant thing in life, sorrows and pain go away in longer time. Survival in one that every animal deserve in the world, to me, survival is still a chance to claim to achieve what you want to be or realize what you want to do. 

Reddit is one of my energy booster for my life.

I'm one year away from graduating with a degree in computer science BS. Four years ago I was considering going into a different degree because I was scared of math and unsure of my abilities.

Today, I can tell you I made the right choice. I struggled with math at first but now I absolutely love math and do very well in all my math courses. The same goes for my CS courses. I completed an internship last summer and had a blast. It really didn't even feel like work, I had so much fun talking to the experienced devs and getting their inputs on certain problems. I created an algorithm to calculate metrics that is being used thousands of times a day by a massive fortune 100 company. Pushing that out to production was such a thrill, and to witness it actually working in real-time made me feel so amazing.  I was actually offered a full time position at the end of my internship but decided to continue my degree. Now, this summer I've lined up another internship at the same company on a different team more aligned with my interests. I'm super excited to learn all sorts of new technologies this new position has to offer.

I'm no genius. My GPA is below a 3.0. I didn't go to a fancy university. I think a lot of people get all worked up reading this sub, thinking you need to go the best university, get an amazing GPA and have super strong math skills or whatever. My point is, what really matters is the work you put in, and the ambition to keep learning. If you're considering CS, I'd say go for it.

What should I do over the next 6 months? I’m still applying for internships, had 3 final interviews- 1 was a rejection, I think the company is ghosting me for the 2nd one (been 2 weeks, company told me I’d have a response after first week. Emailed recruiter, but he’s on vacation, and the recruiter his automatic email message referred me to won’t respond to my emails) and I had my 3rd interview a few days ago which in my opinion went poorly (It was a technical interview, but instead of asking coding questions, they asked about Java concepts like clauses, exceptions, resources, exceptions, threads, etc. which caught me off guard since I didn’t prepare for it). Overall, I don’t think my chances for an internship look good for this summer.

What are some additional resources I can utilize to learn about cyber security while I'm in software dev and vice versa?

What can I anticipate entering the job hunt with an associate's and an unrelated BS degree?

Will companies still offer me an internship even though it's only an associate's? Could I use my unrelated BS degree as leverage?

Should I try to build something thats completely unique or just make things like calculators and file managing programs?

8c3xvc,25,2018-04-13,The empty book,epicsimitt,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8c3xvc/the_empty_book/,"My friend, Francesca, had recently ended her marriage after a fire left her and her husband broke. And neither of them could go on. She moved to a small cottage in the outskirts of the capital of Peru, Lima. I was visiting her and we were talking as friends. She took me on a small tour of her cottage when I came across her small library. On one of the bookshelves I saw a leather book. But it was the most beautiful book I had ever seen. With gold on the borders and the painted roses on the cover. I was intrigued by what amazing stories were worth of being written in such a book. So being the reader that I was I opened it. The book was completely blank, not a single word written on it. I asked Francesca about it and she said that, she didn't remember how she got it. But since I was pretty interested in it she decide to give it to me. Figuring I would have a better use for it since I'm a journalist. Maybe I'd find some inspiration and decide to write something in the gold bordered pages of this book. After a few drinks I headed back home and put the book in one of my shelves.

After that weekend I went back to work. I hated my current work. Most of my reasons to hate it came from my asshole boss, he once caught me reading Plato and everything went down, he starting yelling about how I should be writing about every little news story instead of wasting my free time reading something that wasnt our own paper. So as a punishment he moved me to the night shift. A few weeks past and a small ulcer reappeared in my stomach, I believe it had to do with the changes in eating and sleeping habits, and I was rushed to the hospital, had to undergo an emergency surgery and ended up in the ICU. Francesca came to visit me a couple of times, she was doing way better than I was. She got remarried and had a new house. The hospital bill left me broke, so I had to work even harder. But I somehow managed to keep myself afloat with the help of some friends.

I regularly met up with said friends. They came to my small apartment and we would play poker or drink a beer. All of them wrote crap except one, that I greatly appreciated. His name was Jose, a young man 20 something and started as an intern but now wrote the greatest articles our newspaper had. While my other friends were checking out my freezer or my tv, Jose went to my bookshelf to check what kind of literature I was into. At one of this meetings he found the empty book and as I had been before, he was amazed at how beautiful it was. He wrote poetry as a hobby, so he was going to put the empty gold bordered pages of the book to better use, since I had not written anything on it. I gifted him the book, he thanked me, we had a few more drinks and then he left.

During the few more months after that everything seemed to have changed. I got a promotion and wasn't broke anymore. I moved to a nicer part of the city and got myself a car. But sadly sometime after I moved Jose died. Nobody knew how he died since he was in perfect health and the police found no evidence of foul play. Some of his stuff ended up in my attic since he had named me in his will. After Jose's death things went downhill again. I had to sell my house because of budget cuts in my work. One fine Sunday I decided to check what things Jose had left me after his death. And at the top of one of the boxes there it rested the empty book with the gold borders and gold bordered pages. I opened it to see if Jose had written anything. And in the middle of the book. Almost as hidden he had written a small poem that goes like this:

If you own this I've empty book.
And it's pages you don't see filled 
Then be prepared to get a spook 
When you are eventually killed. 

Reading this left me in shock as everything started to make sense in my head. I backed off like a scared dog whimpering and crying. I just grabbed the book but it in a bag and dashed to my car. I tripped and broke my arm but I somehow knew it wasn't an accident. I got in the car and painfully drove to a nearby park. When I got to the park I threw it to some bushes and ran off. Months passed since I got rid of the book. One of my friends that lived abroad decided to come to Peru to visit me. I took him to a nearby park to show him around the city. I almost broke down when I saw the beautiful empty book with the gold borders and gold bordered pages laying amidst dead bushes and flowers.

THE END.

Hey guys, I'm from Peru and I share some of the folk stories from my country. Let me know if you want more. Appreciate the support."

Specifically it is related to Business Process Modeling (the description sounds kinda IEish), but my question is: is the work you do at a Freshman internship particularly important?
 
Will the fact that the work I'm doing not relating directly to CS make future employees who are considering me for a purely CS related position not even consider/be impressed by the work experience?

Or is it more just having a technical internship as a freshman is good as it is so it could help me land more competitive CS positions in the future?
Also, the main reason I am even putting so much thought into the opportunity instead of just immediately accepting it is because where I would be working is about a thousand miles from home so obviously I wouldn't be able to enjoy the summer with my friends from home.

This is my first post on r/gatech so take it easy on me (;

I want to work for this company for a lifetime. I would like to spend my career there and I really want to do what it takes to succeed. I do understand, however, that three months over the summer is not very much time to prove myself entirely. Can you guys give me any insight as to what you look for in interns and how I can stand out? How do you stay organized? What tips do you have for someone starting out their career that you wish you knew when you had started?

The typical tasks for this position would be the following

&gt;Reviewing and approving drawings for production

&gt;Identifying and implementing process improvements/advancements and reporting status

&gt;Establishing data collection methods. Learning and applying understanding of variation and statistical analysis to ensure process robustness.

&gt;Creating and releasing process documentation and process specific interpretation

&gt;Providing real-time analysis of quality drivers, non-conformances, performance, customer escapes and inefficiencies

Some of the requirements for the position were as follows:
&gt;Exceptional written and verbal communications skills

&gt;Customer focused

&gt;Ability to perform on task and be able to handle multiple projects at once

&gt;Attention to detail

Most of my experience from my previous internship has been reverse engineering and part design and drafting, writing project documents (SSAs, PMAs, PSCPs, etc) for FAA approval, finding standardized parts to reduce production costs.

**My thoughts on US:** US schools definitely have the edge in terms of recruiting and networking. Most students who I would go to school with will likely end up in California. The weather and school environment will be nice too (though that would be secondary). 

On the other hand, despite how F1 Visa students have work authorization, employers still discriminate with them (""why should I hire this kid who's gonna stay here for 4-5 years when I can just hire a citizen?""). In addition, having someone pay for a part of education can be risky (what if my aunt decides she doesn't want to fund me anymore?).

**My thoughts on Waterloo:** I guess I'm kinda biased because I've always wanted to go here since like grade 10, ever since I saw the Waterloo anime opening. Anyway, from what I've heard, Silicon Valley recruiters love Waterloo so going to the US and spending all that money isn't worth it.

I was recently admitted into UC Davis for civil engineering. It's currently tied with Cal Poly SLO as my top choice and I can't decide between the two of them. They both have great features and big downgrades that basically make them equally appealing to me. I've visited UCD once and Cal Poly twice and I'm leaning towards Davis at the moment. However, I had some concerns about life in Davis.

1. How often is it hazy in Davis? I think I can handle Davis' heat as long as it's dry but I really hate hazy/humid days. 

2. As someone who enjoys hiking and running, will I be able to easily continue those activities in Davis? How is the rec center for running-related activities? 

3. (this question is major-related) Is it easy/possible for civil/environmental engineers to find internships and jobs? Would you say a decent amount of employers are looking for UC Davis engineers? This is what Cal Poly bragged about the most, and I want to get some engineering experience in before grad school.

Thank you in advance and please answer honestly. The answers to these questions probably won't change my mind about UCD but hopefully they will make me more confident in my decision.

She has a bachelors degree in Law, which is quite obviously not really useful in a different country. But I taught her some webdev, which turned out quite easy since she's really into design as a hobby, so she caught on real quick to CSS and then learned JS and Angular 2.

So my plan is to somehow get her an entry-level job in webdev. Money is not important at this point, so even a totally unpaid internship would be great. What's the best strategy for getting one?

It seems like the best approach would be to come up with some projects for her to do and push to github. But idk if that's the most optimal route. I read a lot of people suggest going through some bootcamp instead."

I graduated with a gpa of 2.3 with a degree in computer science. After quite a bit of reflection over the past few years I’ve chalked it up to immaturity, a penchant to party too much, and habitual addiction to marijuana, which whether you believe in or not, I think really messed up my sleep and study patterns. 

I had three years worth of teaching experience there as well as a few internships. I managed to launch myself into a fairly large tech company and rose up to be a technical product manager as of today. I’ve been pretty active in volunteering in my local community as well as the company community. 

I never really planned on getting a masters because I figured my GPA was too low but after studying for the GMAT for a while I ended up taking it and got an 800. Genuine shock. I hear only something like 20 people get that per year.

Then I found web dev and instantly fell in love with being able to create websites and web apps that are actually tangible and not just create some small program to sort through a bunch of letters or numbers using quick sort or something haha.

So here I am now, two or so years after starting to learn webdev and I feel like I'm in a good spot, I'm not a web dev wizard like I see some people are, but I feel like I know enough to get a junior web dev position at the least. My final project I created a clone of facebook + twitter which works completely (can follow people, tweet, etc) so I'm quite happy.

Now I want to enter the ""software dev"" side again and move away from web dev for a bit to expand my horizon and because I'm going to be getting a software dev internship through school and I'm not sure what it entails but I'm pretty sure it's not web dev related.

**So here's the question:** What should I create which is something I can actually put on my resume/github? I proudly like to show my web dev projects (chat application using sockets, social media app, blog platform, etc) but what can I create to show that I can do software stuff too?

8c9xva,4,2018-04-14,Quest for Double Fine,sonictimm,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/8c9xva/quest_for_double_fine/,"I found out about Double Fine through your a podcast in 2012.  Fast forward six years, I’m a student game developer giving it all I have for a job there.

So, I checked their “Action Jobs” page to see what I could find.  Under ""We are always recruiting everybody, all the time"" there is a short story about what happens when you get a job there.

http://www.doublefine.com/jobs

Last summer, I decided I wanted a job there, but they must have interns banging on their windows, so how could I stand out?   I decided to make a game that would have several sections to demonstrate my ability and show that I would work hard.  

Last Fall, I learned Unity through my University.  Every single project I made was either a part of my Double Fine game, or specifically designed so that I could reuse code for my Double Fine game.

Around December I realized it would be awesome to go to GDC.  The main reason being that I could speak to people from Double Fine and make an impression.  

It was too late to sign up as a GDC volunteer, passes were over $1k, but someone told me about the Unity Student Scholarship.  I didn't have a proper portfolio, but I uploaded my work from my Unity class and any other Unity projects I had.  Even without a portfolio, I tried to make it look good.  I spent so long on the application process that I was late to a New Years Eve party.

 The new year came, and my game that would get me into Double Fine, codenamed ""Project Sourdough,"" was not on schedule.  It would never be completed on time, although parts of it were a complete mess.

Since Sourdough didn't have time to rise properly, I needed to make a more concise experience very rapidly.  I reused as much code as I could to make ""Project Unleavened,"" a game that follows the story on Double Fine's “Action Jobs” page.

Time passed.  I really wanted to go to GDC.  One night, I prayed that I would go, even though it was unlikely.  I also prayed that if I didn't go, they would at least tell me soon, so I could stop thinking about it.

The very next moment, I pulled out my phone to call someone, and an e-mail popped up on the lock screen from Unity folks.

""Thank you for submitting...  We received a lot of high quality applications ... Unfortunately, you were not chosen as a recipient ... But we were impressed with your application"" and they gave me a limited access pass.

I was completely in awe.


 **SO I WAS GOING TO GDC! **

 
The next thing I needed was a way to give them the game.  I designed a one-sided business card reminiscent of an atari cartridge, and had it printed onto two USB Business cards from VistaPrint.
https://imgur.com/a/SwEDi

I had a lot of work to do on Unleavened.  I put in some crazy hours in the weeks leading up to GDC, and had to either solve or work around countless issues.  Unfortunately, due to a quirk in my dialogue system, I could only build for Windows at the time.  Fortunately, I did get some help from my friends.  I found out one of them is a QA guru.  Another one could make great drawings, and it was amazing seeing him bring a piece of the game to life.  But their time was limited by their own schoolwork, so I did all the coding and most of the art myself.  That said, I can’t understate the importance of my friends and family during development.

The final week of crunch, I referenced DF’s Jobs page.  It had changed.  I had been planning to apply for an internship, but there was a brand new note.  “Alas, we are unable to offer internships pretty much ever, sorry!”

That could be the end of the story.   But it’s not.  If I couldn’t be an intern, I’d apply for a full position as a Gameplay Programmer.

I programmed, built, tested, rinsed, repeated until it was error-free.  After all that testing I copied those files onto the two business cards.

I took a few hours off Sunday night before GDC to hang out with friends.  Unfortunately, I needed more than two business cards for GDC, so I got back to work around eleven to design some normal ones.  I lied down for a moment and fell asleep for three hours, woke up at 5 AM and then sent my design to the local Minuteman Press.

The next morning, there was no next morning, I woke up at noon.   I ran about a mile to the printer to get those business cards, and began to pack ASAP.

I had a friend who was on-time to bring me to the airport, but I was too far behind packing, and missed the flight Monday.  They rescheduled me for free since the next flights had open seats.  I was stuck at the airport for hours, exhausted, but Tuesday afternoon I finally made it to San Francisco.

Double Fine runs a booth called ""Day of the Devs"" which showcases a few selected indie games.  I hung out there for hours trying to find one of them.  I met plenty of good people, but I missed their main producer (Greg Rice) by literally a minute.  

Wednesday night was an awards ceremony, and the Tim Schafer got a big one.  I waited twenty minutes after the show until the people from that company started walking out, and caught up to Greg Rice when he separated from the rest of them.

""Mister Rice, can I talk to you for a minute?""

""I'm really really late, I can't talk now.""

""Can you at least take this?""

And I handed him one of the USB Business cards with my resume and the game on it.

He ran away screaming.   

Well, not really, he just walked away quickly.


 
**THE HUNT CONTINUED,**

Thursday, I finally got lucky at Double Fine's booth.

While scanning badges, I saw some tiny print.  It said ""Double Fine Productions.""  Whoah.  I looked up, and saw he was wearing a shiny Double Fine pin.  It was beautiful.  I looked at his face, and he was talking to someone else.  

I awkwardly stood by until he was free, and then told him my story before relinquishing the second USB Business card.  Package 2 delivered!  Delivered to a Communications Manager, no less!

Friday I walked out of a building and saw some people in Double Fine branded clothes ==&gt; I orbited around in front of them, and introduced myself to two more DF people (programmers).  They really liked the idea of my game, so I gave them my card and told then where to find it online.

Saturday I applied to Double Fine thru their web site, the normal way, except that I included a link to the game.

Monday, the Communications Manager sent me an e-mail that the game didn't work.  I know exactly the issue and exactly why.  I sent both the fix and a working version.

Which brings us to today. 

Here is the game I made: https://sonictimm.itch.io/action-resume
Playtime is usually less than ten minutes.  I did modify my dialogue system for web, so you can play it in your browser.


**WHAT NOW?**

I'd love to say that the takeaway here is to work hard to get your dream job, but at this point I have no idea if I'll get the job.

What I can say is that even if I don't get the job, this attempt has given me 

    -A portfolio

    -A trip to GDC

    -Lots of contacts from said trip

    -Some free time in San Francisco

    -TONS of Unity Experience

    -Practice writing.  I love writing, but it's hard to sit down and do it.

    -Practice Art-ing.   I love UI, but spritework is not my calling.

    -A chance to collab with some friends

    -An extra reason to practice in Unreal (since DF is using it to make Psychonauts 2)

    -A game that may or may not be fun, I'll let you guys decide

    -This crazy story.  Honestly, the University feels mundane after all this...



   Anyway, I'd love to get your feedback.

    -If you have any tips on getting a job at a specific company, myself (and others who read this) would love to hear it.

    -What do you think of the game?  Is it Earth-shattering?  Abominable?  I'll never get any better without your honest feedback.

I began noticing wired vibes from my supervisor in the way he interacted with me. For example, he would be friendlier and warmer with the other interns in my office and he would act distant and not as friendly with me. I always assumed that maybe it was because I was coming off distant or detached. 

However, recently he met with me to discuss my performance since I started. He told me that he, and the rest of the staff, had noticed a few things about my work and conduct that were hindering my performance and frustrating him. He said that I was not following through in my assignments and not prioritizing my tasks appropriately. He was concerned about giving me assignments and responsibilities because he wasn't sure when he would get them back. 

He told me I am a very kind and polite person around the office and that I have a good sense of humor but that sometimes I talk too much to the other interns. This can be distracting and inefficient for work that needs to be completed. 

I appreciate his feedback because now I am no longer in the dark and aware of my conduct. I'm also very disappointed in myself because I had always assumed that I was doing a decent job and completing my tasks in a reasonable manner.

I'm recently out of school and this is my first experience in a fast-paced office environment, where I am working 7-8 hour days. I find myself becoming tired later in the day, which affects my performance. I've never worked for long periods of time before and I notice that my focus and concentration are poor after the morning hours. I also haven't' adjusted or figured out an organization system that will allow me to manage all the tasks I need to complete, on top of everything else that needs to get done. I'm still learning the office/corporate culture and the etiquette associated with it. 

I really like the work that I'm doing and I can see myself working there in the future. I also think I can be very good at. Even my supervisor, despite the criticism, thinks so as well.

So I have been sending numerous internship applications for the Summer I am currently about to finish my Bachelors Degree in Information Technology a year early IF i find an internship!

I had an interview about 3 weeks ago for one internship and everything went smoothly and I asked politely about when approximately I can hear back and the person that interviewed me said that I was the first one to be interviewed  for the internship position and that he was going to go out of the country for some business so he didn't give me any approximate date unfortunately. I sent a thank you email within 24 hours.

The other place I applied also went very smoothly I did a lot of research about the company and even mentioned one of the workers that used to work at the company and I was given more detailed info about his accomplishments the guy did before leaving. It was very casual and I asked the interviewer more questions then he asked me! The second person that interviewed me also was quite surprised that I did good research on the company and again the conversation was very casual and not too many technical questions only a few.

Now here is where I am struggling. First of all I had no clue that three people were going to interview me that day. Anyways the part I want you guys to help me is that the third person that I needed to speak with was busy in a meeting (I assume this may have been someone from higher end since the two people I interviewed with were the managers of the position.) So as soon as I was told that the 3rd person was busy, do you think I should have waited for the person to finish his or her meeting? Right away I was asked if I had any other offers made to me and I replied no that I am still searching and applying. Then I was finally told that I would be contacted by the person whom I've been communicating with (who didn't show up one of the HR rep's) that she would follow up with me within a week as to any next steps. Should I contact her to let her know that I want to know if the third person I needed to speak with is available?

Sorry for the long post I just really want to make sure I didn't leave anything unmentioned. Once again thank you all so much!

Coasted through high school disappointing my teachers who said 'I had potential' and if only I 'actually tried'. Going into college, struggled a bunch, and then fell into a pretty bad depressive episode; literally the worst two years of my life. Finally was able to find the right medication and dosage (I'm on 450mg of Wellbutrin XL, 7.5mg of Mirtazapine), and it was a big improvement, but finally being out of that I sort of noticed my ADHD more(?). My psychiatrist said that now that we were mostly good on the depression aspect, we could begin to address the ADHD directly. He put me on 10mg Adderall IR twice a day, Initially.

 
First time I took it, though not a very huge difference, I noticed my head being a little more quiet. I was able to sort of follow a thought through with ease, instead of going off to something else, or having to struggle to focus on the one thought. It worked for about the week before it stopped and only the side effects, which I didn't especially mind if it meant being able to function, remained. I went back for a check up and was upped to 20mg IR twice a day. Which really really hit the spot. Right away, huge difference. The quietness came back, and it was so much quieter. I never realized there was so much going on there, and how stressful that was until I started the medication. This was towards the end of finals, and then during winter break little by little I began to get my shit together—I finally cleaned my room, fukin redecorated  it, I'm actually comfortable hanging out in there because it's always mostly clean, I began a new, pretty demanding job, landed myself a really, really good internship, and actually got around to submitting my work and got published again.


 School started, as did the internship, the job remained as well, and even though now I’ve realized 'oh fuck this is a lot' and occasionally become pretty overwhelmed by all the things I'm attempting to do, I've been handling it all mostly alright. Especially the internship; last week they told me we're going to start getting paid and there was also talk about hiring. Socially, it's gotten a little harder to see family or go out, but it's mostly out of ‘I'm really busy,’ and not a strong lack of interest; still I've managed to allocate some time for it. 

For the past 2-3 months I began to notice really bad effects on me, mostly drastic and super intense mood swings, terrible irritability, worse than how I got when 'coming down' during the first couple of weeks, and ticks. I continued to be productive but continuously felt like I was falling apart. I was ready to quit it, or lower the dosage, but I wouldn't get to see my psychiatrist for weeks, so I figured I'd just get this last refill, suck it up, and then figure it out. Then I sort of noticed I was getting into less arguments with my parents, much less sensitive to things, no meltdowns, the tics became much, much less recurrent, and my emotions were more balanced; I've always been a pretty intense guy, so I'm still like that but now it feels back to normal. I went through my journal to sort of see dates of when it started or stopped, and I noticed it was during times when they've given me different manufacturer of generics. 


Turns out the months when I was on top of everything and fine, I was on a specific brand, and during those months that fucked me up, I was on another brand of generics. So figure it was that. Still I went to see a new psychiatrist earlier this week, because I'd been paying out of pocket for the one that had been treating me and can't afford it anymore. When I told him about the ticks, he said it would be a good idea to take me off the adderall for a month to see if they went away. I was like, ""oh, no I'm very busy I can't"", he continued asking questions and whatnot. Eventually he ended up prescribing me 40mg Strattera twice a day, to use instead of the adderall. I was pretty okay with the idea, but then I read about it taking weeks to kick in, if at all; which, in the context I'm in right now I can't quite afford to gamble a whole month. But also the sleepiness, lack of energy, and mild sexual dysfunction don't sound very fun to me. So, considering my current context, is it a good idea to try out a new medication at the moment? Should I wait for a slower period? if so, how do I go about asking to go back on Adderall without sounding like I'm addicted? Any of you switched from Adderall to strattera? What was your experience? 

TL;DR  Adderall helped me bring myself to what I can actually achieve. I took on multiple projects, knowing I would probably be able to do it all. Now I'm really fuckin busy with important things at stake. New psychiatrist switched me to strattera; everyone says it sucks. Can I afford to put myself through that, and risk it not even working? Any previous experiences switching meds during busy times, or going from adderall to strattera would be helpful.

I’m waiting to hear back on a couple REU opportunities, so that’s still up in the air. 

I’ve never really done open-source projects before and having a free summer would be a good opportunity to finally do that or work on a couple of project ideas of my own. Where’s a good place to start as far as contributing to open source projects?

Also, should I be applying to jobs this summer or wait until the Fall near the start of my final semester? I really want to get a job outside of Alabama which is my home state

8cbagj,2,2018-04-14,"I took a job after being unemployed for 6 months, it was an ""Just get anything"" type role and regretting it.",LocalToaster,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8cbagj/i_took_a_job_after_being_unemployed_for_6_months/,"Hi guys,

So I accepted a role with a company selling a local internet ISP (Cox) in mall kiosks. I'm a recent Computer Information Systems major that graduated last year, I had an internship in the summer of 2017 and once that internship ended I was unemployed. I have been applying to jobs over the past few months. 

I did a lot of interviews with large companies, start ups, and small companies and was constantly rejected. I thought that these interviews each went well besides maybe a few phones ones. During this time I got increasingly anxious because I have loans, not much savings, and I couldn't find a job to accept me. 

2 weeks ago I had an interview with a marketing company, I have the role of ""Sales Associate"" that is training to be an ""Account manager"" where I will essentially be training sales associates and then be their managers. Or at least this is how it's laid out for me.

I took the job because I needed something to start paying bills. I'm sort of regretting this decision because the pay is extremely low and the hours are pretty extreme. 

The pay is 400 dollars a week and I'm working from 9am - 6pm each day. 9 AM I go into the office to do briefing with the team, then I'm out on the field trying to sell people to my telecommunication company. No benefits, just purely a flat 400 dollar rate. If I sell to enough people each week, then I make whatever I profited the company for whatever is over 400 dollars. To make the situation worse, during my training right now I only make 250 dollars a week but still have to work full time. The only way to get out of this training period is to sell 3 contracts within an 8 day period. So far, it looks like people could give less of a fuck to switch from their current plans.

Am I being scammed? Should I look for other options or keep grinding this out?

EDIT: I really messed the title up here lol"

However, due to personal reasons I was never able to land an internship while in school. Thus, my only experience is class based.

Now, over 3 months later I've applied several places, but not even a response back. It's left me frustrated and discouraged. Will I even be able to get into the IT industry? How long will I be waiting? I have a decent retail job, but I now have a family to take care of, so a new job is definitely needed..

So, could anyone offer some advice for this recent grad?

Anyway, I graduated May 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science from an ok 4 year State University with only a 2 year govt internship on my resume that was totally unrelated to my major/career goals.

I've recently accepted a job offer with the title ""Software Programmer"" and salary in the VERY low 40k range in a VERY low COL city. I countered the salary, of course, and was politely shut down; reason given was this being a completely new position and my complete lack of professional developer experience warranted the low starting pay and to look forward to promotions and other upcoming positions. All pending my performance on the job.

Honestly I'm more concerned about the job title than anything. I get that all the titles in this field are pretty much interchangeable and not totally important but it seems that having ""Programmer"" in your job title sort of allows employers to pay less for pretty much the same work. I'm leaning towards maybe asking around to have my title changed after I've gotten into the groove of things on the job (around month 2 or 3) to replace ""Programmer"" with developer or engineer. 

Am I being ridiculous and should just be happy to be working (which I am!). Or, are my concerns valid?

From my understanding, having personal projects is extremely helpful in landing internships, and internships are extremely important for getting jobs after graduation. I fear being an unemployed graduate at age 25 with no path to a decent developer role. I feel like it would be advantageous for me to get all set up with a portfolio THEN do the degree so I have the luxury of spending more time on getting a high GPA and polishing my projects/making better ones.

I go to the University of Alberta (western Canada) and I'm in the computer software engineering coop program. Problem is that this year, there was a high influx of incoming students going from ~20 to what is now ~60. Of these 60, only ~15 people have gotten placed into a 4 month coop position for this summer. It's really dumb because the coop department at my school told us to start applying in January -- but by then I know for a fact that from creeping this sub we should have been applying in the Fall. I know every single one of those 12 people who have gotten jobs -- and they have either gotten their jobs through a direct connection or have a ridiculously high GPA. 

Basically, is it too late to apply to places for a summer internship or coop position? Should I just give up and waive my coop term? Coop department at my school is telling me to ""not worry"" but it's seriously fucking finals and companies are already looking to hire people for THE FALL and I'm really fucking worried. 

I've been applying like crazy but everything is either 8 months (with the sequencing of my coop terms, I can't do more than 4 months) OR in the East (Ontario and Quebec) and I'm like 99% sure all those are getting taken by Waterloo and U of T students. The deadline for me to be able to get a job is June 8th. 

I'll admit I don't have a lot to show for, but I am trying. My GPA isn't the best (about a ~3.0) but I've been writing cover letters as much as I can (if necessary) and I've gotten my resume looked at and checked. I don't know a lot of languages (only know C++, Python, Assembly and very basic Swift and Java) or have a lot of projects (2 final projects for classes and one iOS app), so I guess it could be that. I've applied to 200+ jobs but have gotten rejected from everything in the US (probably because I would require sponsorship?) and about ~60 from Canada. I've had 1 interview, but since improved my resume drastically and that's pretty much it. 

Sorry if this was a bit incoherent it's like 1am and I'm just kind of rambling I guess

8cenqv,51,2018-04-15,In Search of R’lyeh - Part 1,noonehas3,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8cenqv/in_search_of_rlyeh_part_1/,"“This is going to be our big break, Matt. I just know it!”

Donny beamed with excitement as he sat down with his business partner and childhood friend, Matt in their film production company’s office. Matt was an expert cameraman and Donny was a brilliant film editor. They had both worked previously for large studios but recently decided to go into business with one another. Their company was called, For the Love of the Craft LLC, or LoveCraft as they liked to refer to it. However, what had at first seemed like an exciting adventure quickly became a struggle to survive. It was difficult for them to find work as an independent studio, and the bills piled up.

Matt eyed his friend warily and said, “Whoa, calm down. What are you talking about?” He knew that his friend had a tendency to get too excited and then under-think ideas.

Donny said, “I just got off the phone with a representative for… wait for it… Jim Camberson! He said they want to talk to us about filming a documentary he’s making about searching for some lost city at the bottom of the ocean or whatever.”

Matt furrowed his brow as he replied incredulously, “Jim Camberson? You mean the guy who directed The Exterminator, Extraterrestrials, and Chasm? That Jim Camberson?”

Donny clapped his hands excitedly and said, “Yes! Apparently, he’s making a new documentary and he wants to work with a small, independent production company to make it. Not many people know this, but in addition to the fact that he’s a world class director, he’s also a deep-sea explorer. He’s even a National Geographic explorer-in-residence. I don’t know what that means, but it sounds important.”

“Yes, it does,” Matt said thoughtfully. “But, how did he hear about us?”

Donny winced and said, “Oh come on, Matt. We’ve both been in the film industry for years. You know we told all our contacts when we decided to go off on our own. Most of them just wished us luck, but it seems like someone took us seriously. And now we’ve got Jim Camberson himself calling us up to hire us!”

“You mean, Jim Camberson’s representative. No doubt our price point is pretty attractive as well, considering we’re in the bargain bin as far as filmmakers go.”

“Whatever, look, it’s like I said – this could be out big break. We’ve got a meeting with him next week to discuss the details and sign the contract.”

“I don’t know, Donny. This is moving pretty quickly. We should think about it.”

“What’s there to think about? When a bigshot like Jim Camberson tells you that he wants to work with you, then you just do it. Besides, what else do we have going on? We need this, Matt.”

Matt thought for a moment and said, “Ok, Donny. I’m on board. Let’s just hope this works out well.”

“Oh, it’s going to work out really well, my friend. I guarantee it,” Donny said as he smiled brightly.

Matt inwardly shuddered. He hated it when Donny guaranteed anything. That almost always meant something was about to go wrong.

Donny and Matt showed up fifteen minutes early to their meeting with Jim Camberson. His office was in huge, gleaming building in the nicest part of the city. Camberson’s assistant immediately ushered them into a large meeting room with an oval desk. Around the desk sat a petite young woman, a large older man, and James Camberson himself, tall and lanky with salt-and-pepper colored hair.

When they entered, Camberson leapt out of his chair and marched up to them, holding out his hand and saying in a booming voice, “Hello boys! Thank you very much for taking the time to meet with me. I really do appreciate you stopping by.”

The other two people stood up as well, and Camberson introduced them. He indicated the woman first and said, “This is Dr. Petra Maxwell, PhD. She’s a marine biologist and is acting as my primary scientific advisor for this project. We met through our work with National Geographic.”

Dr. Petra shook hands with Matt and Donny, giving them both a quick smile and saying, “Good to meet you.”

Then, he indicated the man and said, “And this is Captain William Billingsly, or Captain Bill. He’s a British Navy veteran who started his own maritime trading company years ago. He’ll be lending us his sailing expertise and the use of his ship, The Vigilant.”

Captain Bill shook hands with Matt and Donny as well, crushing them with his massive paw and saying “Cheers.”

“Excellent,” Camberson said as each person took a seat around the desk. “Let’s get down to business. The project entails combining my knowledge of storytelling with my passion for explora…”

Donny interrupted and said, “Excuse me, Mr. Camberson, sir. Please forgive me, but could you say how you heard about us? We’re not exactly a household name like you are.”

Camberson smiled like a Cheshire cat and said, “Oh, I’ve actually known about you both for a long time through the film industry. I’ve always been very impressed by your work. You could even call me a fan.”

Matt’s jaw dropped, and Donny’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. The very notion that a huge industry player like Camberson knew who they were was shocking, but to hear him describe himself as a fan was beyond belief. Matt was spellbound, but Donny thought it was fishy. It was as if he was saying exactly what they wanted to hear.

Camberson continued, “You boys recently started your own company, didn’t you? When I heard about this, I found it to be quite serendipitous as I’ve been waiting for just the right film crew to come along and make my dream a reality. This project has been years in the making, and now it’s about to happen. I can barely contain my excitement.

“As I was saying, the project entails combining my knowledge of storytelling with my passion for exploration. Now, let me ask you a question: Have either of you ever heard of the lost city of R’lyeh?”

Matt and Donny shook their heads.

“R’lyeh is a city that is believed to have once existed on a small island in the South Pacific Ocean. It was built thousands of years ago by an unknown civilization that was completely shut off from the outside world. Most historians think that it doesn’t even exist, that it’s a fairytale like Atlantis. But, I believe it’s real.”

As he said this, Camberson reached into the inner pocket of his sport coat and took out a weathered-looking piece of paper that was folded in thirds. He carefully unfolded it, then pressed it flat against the table and slid it toward Matt and Donny. As they looked it over, Matt noticed the paper contained indecipherable handwriting and a small drawing at the bottom that resembled a man with the head of an octopus and the wings of a bat sitting on some kind of platform.

“Several years ago, I discovered a cache of notes written at the end of the 19th century by a person named George Gammell Angell. He was a professor of Semitic languages at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and he was an expert on the topic of ancient and lost civilizations. This is one of his notes that indicates the existence of this lost city, R’lyeh.

“After I learned of it, the city became somewhat of an obsession for me. I’ve since tracked down many other primary and secondary sources which support the notion that it’s a real place. As I’m sure you know, I’m not just a movie director but am an also explorer, particularly of deep-sea environments. The late professor’s notes indicate that R’lyeh sits at the bottom of the South Pacific, and I intend to find it. Thus, I require a film crew to record the expedition for posterity and hopefully, for profit as well.”

Camberson continued, “I’ll be using a submersible designed by Dr. Petra here. It’s equipped with cutting-edge sound and video equipment that will be recording as I search for the city. I’d like you to film every moment of the expedition leading up to that point. I’d also like you to conduct interviews of myself, Dr. Petra, and Captain Bill. Then, I’d like you to combine all the audio and video footage together into a documentary.”

“Where exactly in the South Pacific is this lost city supposed to be?” asked Matt.

“At a location called Point Nemo. It’s as far from civilization as you can possibly be in the ocean,” replied Camberson.

Dr. Petra spoke up and said, “It’s so far from society, that if the International Space Station happened to pass overhead while we were there, we’d be closer to the astronauts than any other human being on the planet.”

Matt shifted uncomfortably in his seat. This was starting to sound like a much bigger endeavor than he’d counted on.

He asked, “How long will the whole project last?”

Captain Bill answered this time and said, “We’ll start by flying out to Auckland, New Zealand where my ship is waiting for us and disembark from there. It will then take us about a month of sailing to reach Point Nemo. Once Mr. Camberson has found this lost city, which will take an indeterminate amount of time, it will then take about 45 days to return to land as we sail against the current.”

Matt stared at him in disbelief. He hadn’t been prepared to confront the prospect of such a long voyage.

Camberson said, “In order for us to get started, I need you boys to sign this contract. It’s mostly legal mumbo-jumbo that you don’t need to concern yourselves with. Mainly, it says that you’re entering into this project of your own volition and that you indemnify me, my company, and the rest of my crew in the event of any unfortunate accidents that may occur. But, I’ve been planning this for years and I’ve considered every contingency. I guarantee a successful outcome for all.”

Matt shuddered inwardly again. There was that word again that he hated, “guarantee.”

“Before I show you the contract, I must insist that the terms are non-negotiable,” Camberson said. “However, you can take comfort in the fact that should our little film make any money, you’ll each receive favorable royalties. And, though this goes without saying, you’ll have the prestige of the Camberson name all over one of your first projects.”

Camberson slid the contract across the table. Donny reached for it, but Matt took it before he could get it. Matt immediately flipped to the part where it described their upfront compensation. He was crushed to see that was for a ridiculously low amount. Camberson wasn’t lying about the royalties, though. They would be very lucrative if the film made any money.

However, Matt was no fool. He knew the chances of the film being profitable were slim, and that this was clearly a pet project Camberson was pursuing purely out of vanity. It wasn’t a serious business investment for him at all. The prestige of Camberson’s name did indeed have value, though, but prestige doesn’t pay the bills.

It dawned on Matt that Camberson chose them not because of their reputation, but because he knew they were desperate. This project was going to take them to one of the most desolate locations on the planet for nearly three months at the paygrade of an intern. He wanted to tear up the contract and bolt for the door, but he knew Donny would never forgive him if he did.

Matt began to say, “I think we need to discu–“ but Donny interrupted him and said excitedly, “We’ll do it!” He then grabbed the contract out of Matt’s hands, took a pen out of his pocket, and signed it without reading a word of it. Matt looked at him in shock and anger. However, Donny merely pushed the contract over to him, held out the pen, and pointed at the part where Matt was supposed to sign.

Matt’s shoulders slumped in defeat and he snatched the pen out of Donny’s hand. Then, he quickly scribbled a sloppy signature on the contract and spiked the pen on the table in frustration. The deal was made.

---

Matt yawned as he panned his camera across the wharf while workers loaded The Vigilant with supplies. It was still early in the morning, and the sun had started to peak out from the horizon. They’d arrived in New Zealand the day before, and Camberson wanted to get out into the water as soon as possible.

Matt stopped the camera as Captain Bill came into view in the foreground with his ship in the background. The captain held a steaming cup of coffee and stood still as Donny pinned a small microphone on his jacket. Through the lens, Matt could see Camberson’s submersible, dubbed the Deep-Sea Discovery, being loaded into the ship’s hull with a small crane.

Donny said, “Ok, Captain. I’m going to ask you a few questions and you can just say whatever answer enters your mind in the moment. We want this to be very spontaneous, so don’t worry about it sounding perfect. Later, we’re going to edit my voice out, so this interview will appear to be a monologue by you. Does that make sense?”

“Aye,” replied the captain as he sipped his coffee.

“Great,” said Donny. He then turned to Matt and said, “Are we rolling?”

Matt gave him a thumbs-up, and Donny stepped out of view of the camera and asked, “What are doing right now, Captain?”

With a frustrated grunt, the captain replied “Are you daft? We’re loading up the ship, what’s it bloody look like we’re doing?”

Donny winced and asked, “I mean, how are we preparing for the trip?”

The captain grumbled, “Oh bollocks. We’re taking six months’ worth of supplies including foodstuffs, water, and toiletries as well as medical supplies. Heaven forbid one of you pretty boys breaks a fingernail out there.”

Matt and Donny looked at each other with frustration. None of this is going to work for the documentary. Donny decided to try a different approach.

“You seem a bit frustrated, captain. Are you nervous for the trip?” he asked.

The captain sneered sarcastically and said, “I’ve got nothing to be nervous about, lad. However, I must say that as far as sea voyages go, this one is already all bollocksed-up.”

“Why do you say that?”

“Well, for one thing, we’ve got a red sunrise. That’s never a good sign. A red sunrise is a bad omen indeed. It suggests blood is on the horizon.”

Matt panned his camera over to the sunrise to reveal that it did indeed appear to be blood red. Then he panned back to the captain who continued, “Another thing is that I don’t like the look of your camera boy here. He looks like a Jonas to me. You know what I mean by a ‘Jonas’? That’s a person who brings bad luck at sea.”

Matt started to say something in response but shut his mouth.

“One more thing,” said the captain. “It’s downright awful luck to start a voyage on a Friday, yet here we are, on a Friday, about to risk our lives at sea to find some fairytale city that doesn’t even exist. It’s as if the stars are aligned against us!” With this, the captain’s voice rose, and he began to tremble with anger.

He continued, “I tried explaining all this to our esteemed benefactor and fearless leader, but did he listen to me? Of course not. Well, let me tell you something, bucko. I’ve only been sailing for nearly 50 years, and one thing I know is you don’t bloody well start a bloody voyage at sea on a bloody Friday with a bloody red sunrise with a bloody Jonas on board! If I didn’t need the bloody money so bad, I’d have told that pompous arse to shove it!”

The captain was shouting now and several of the workers had turned to see what the commotion was. He shook so violently that the lid of his coffee popped off and piping hot coffee spilled all over his hand. He shouted “Ow!” and dropped the cup to the ground. The remaining coffee splashed up directly into his eye, and he screamed in pain as he doubled over, covering his face with his hands.

Donny rushed to the captain’s side and asked, “Captain Bill, are you alright?”

“It’s the stars,” moaned the captain. “The stars are aligned against us. We’re doomed.”

After leaning in close to check his eye, Donny detected the smell of rum on the captain’s breath. He was drunk.

---

Matt retched violently into the trash can next to his bed in the small, cramped cabin he shared with Donny. They’d been at sea for only a week before they were beset by a vicious storm that had already lasted for three days with no signs of letting up. The constant motion created by waves crashing against their vessel gave Matt horrific sea sickness.

Meanwhile, Captain Bill was constantly at the rudder, cursing up a storm himself, trying to cut a path to safety. He now wore an eyepatch after scalding his eyeball during his breakdown at the wharf. Though there was certainly a pirate joke to be made about it somewhere, nobody was laughing.

Another thing that wasn’t funny was that the storm had damaged or destroyed nearly half their supplies. Several crates had gone overboard after having been originally secured on the ship’s bow to make room in the hull for Camberson’s submersible. They weren’t sure if they’d have enough supplies to make it to Point Nemo and back, and they’d already began rationing food and water. Everyone tried to convince Camberson to turn back, but he wouldn’t hear of it.

Dr. Petra was also not handling the situation well. She’d holed herself up in the makeshift science lab she’d created in the bowels of the ship’s hull. In it, she’d stocked various devices and equipment to help her manage the Deep-Sea Discovery during the expedition. However, she hadn’t left the lab since the storm began, and Donny wondered if she was even eating.

The one person who didn’t seem put off by the storm was Camberson, whose enthusiasm for the voyage only seemed to increase every time another wave smashed against the hull of The Vigilant.

Another week passed, and the storm had subsided. Captain Bill managed to find a more favorable course by dipping south and picking up momentum from the prevailing winds to make up for lost time. His humor improved substantially, and he started cracking jokes about his eyepatch, wondering aloud where his parrot was and beginning and ending sentences by saying “Arrr…”

---

Matt’s condition improved as well, despite merciless teasing from Captain Bill about being a “land lover in need of his sea legs.” He even felt well enough to help Donny interview Dr. Petra, and they met her in her science lab in the ship’s hull. Once Donny pinned a microphone on her shirt, Matt started to roll camera and they were ready to begin.

Donny said, “Let’s start by talking about the submersible, Dr. Petra. Can you please tell us a bit about it?”

Dr. Petra replied, “I’d love to. The Deep-Sea Discovery is the product of nearly seven years of work. I like to think of it as a ‘vertical torpedo’ because it’s designed to reach the bottom of the ocean as quickly as possible and then rocket back up to the surface just as rapidly. It’s nearly eight meters tall and three-and-a-half meters wide, with the most sophisticated battery-powered wireless audio and visual equipment available.

“With it, we’ll be able to see and hear everything Mr. Camberson sees and hears, and we’ll have a full 360-degree view around the submersible as well. We’ll also be able to communicate with him through a microphone. Feedback will come through these displays and speakers I’ve set up inside The Vigilant’s hull.”

Dr. Petra waved her arm towards a small command center behind her that had several screens and various metal cabinets and computers.

Donny asked, “Do you anticipate that we’ll run across any strange or interesting sea life?”

Dr. Petra chuckled, then shook her head and said, “Unfortunately, no. This region is devoid of nutrients that would be required to sustain life. This expedition will be more like going to the moon than visiting an ocean reef. My interest as a marine biologist is primarily in testing the performance of the submersible I designed. I’ve only ever seen it in action in controlled environments before, so I’m looking forward to seeing how it performs out here in the wild.

“Speaking of the moon, one thing I do anticipate running across on the ocean floor is space ship wreckage. You see, space agencies of various governments including the U.S., China, and Russia use this region to, for lack of a better term, ‘dump’ their old spacecraft once their missions are complete. They simply navigate their ships to reenter the Earth’s atmosphere at a trajectory so that they’ll fall in or around Point Nemo. The reason is because of this area’s remoteness. This doesn’t really have anything to do with our expedition, but I find it fascinating nonetheless.”

“This is starting to sound more like a science fiction story than a deep-sea adventure.”

“Yes, I suppose.”

“And what of the lost city of R’lyeh? Do you think we’ll find any evidence of that?”

Dr. Petra hesitated, then said, “That’s Mr. Camberson’s department, not mine. He has been researching this lost city for more than a decade. He’s a bit eccentric, but he’s also highly intelligent and, as you know, extremely successful. I doubt he’d come all this way unless he truly believed there was something down there. I hope we do find some evidence, and I think we might, but I have no idea what that could be.”

---

Donny and Matt opened the hatch and stepped up onto the ship’s bow. It was nearly 1:00 a.m. and the night sky was awash with stars. They were surrounded on all sides by pitch darkness, and pale moonlight spilled across the ship, providing slight illumination. The sound of waves gently lapping against the hull was all they could hear.

“Wow, it seems like whole galaxies are visible out here,” Donny said. “See if you can get a good shot of the sky, Matt. This would make excellent B-roll, not just for this documentary, but for our archives as well.”

Matt hoisted his camera up and began pointing it at several constellations in the sky. Donny directed him to capture images of the Southern Cross, Capricorn, and Sagittarius, but then Matt noticed one that seemed out of place.

“Hey Matt, look at that constellation over there. Does that one seem weird to you?”

“Yes, really weird. It’s like all the stars in that cluster are slightly bigger than the others, and they all have this otherworldly green tint. I’ve never seen anything like it.”

“Me either. I’m starting to feel creeped out. Let’s head back down.”

Just as they turned to leave, Captain Bill stumbled out from behind one of the remaining storage crates, holding a nearly empty bottle of rum. He’d removed his eyepatch, and Matt and Donny could see a horrific burn scar on his eye in the moonlight.

Captain Bill slurred his words as he said, “Ahoy maties! Now just where do you think you’re going?” Then, he burped and added, “Arrr…”

Donny cringed and said, “Hey, Captain Bill. We were just capturing some footage of the night sky. We didn’t realize you were there.”

Captain Bill hiccupped and said, “Oh yes, I’ve been here the whole time.” Then he laughed disquietly, “Heh, heh, heh.”

Matt said, “But we finished and we’re leaving now.”

“Not so fast, gents,” said Captain Bill. “Do you see those stars o’er there?” Captain Bill pointed at the strange constellation Matt and Donny had just discussed, and said, “That’s not a good sign for us, not at all.”

“Why’s that?” asked Matt.

“Why’s that?” Captain Bill replied in a mocking tone. “That’s because those stars are abnormal. I’ve sailed all over every ocean on this bloody planet, all throughout every season of the year, and I’ve never seen anything like that bloody constellation. Those stars are aligned against us. Aligned against us, I say!”

Captain Bill took a mighty swig and downed the last bit of rum from his bottle. Then, he stood there, tottering back and forth, muttering to himself under his breath.

“You’re drunk, Captain Bill. You should go to bed,” Donny said, but the captain said nothing in response, and continued to stand still, muttering. As they passed by him on their way to the hatch, they noticed the glint of a huge bowie knife strapped to his belt.

8cev2t,9,2018-04-15,Interested in CS but have no career interests,CsCareerAmbiguity,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8cev2t/interested_in_cs_but_have_no_career_interests/,"Hi, I'm a freshman at a very large state university (United States) that's not known for its CS program. I started learning programming in 7th grade with a bit of C++ but then Java, did a year of Racket in 12th grade, fell in love with Python from class last semester, and currently hack around in Java/Python, with the intention of learning C/D/Haskell in the near future. The reason I mention that these languages is that I have very broad interests in CS, but don't have a passion for any specific thing, and can't really imagine myself doing any CS job that I've heard of.

I actually got quite disillusioned with programming in 12th grade, and ended up applying for the school's Finance degree, but am also getting a dual degree in CS. The professor last semester was really amazing, and made me realize (this sounds incredibly stupid, but was a huge epiphany for me) that computers are just tools we use to solve problems.

I had made a few small but complete video games before, and still do, but I took a look at what real impact I could make, and made programs to fit my needs. Examples include a browser extension to get rid of requiring 2 factor authentication for my university's login, a cross-platform GUI application that places buy/sell orders with a cryptocurrency exchange in a way that reduces trading fees by 85%, and a super simple but configurable static site generator for my website/blog. These and some other projects are all on Bitbucket (though I haven't seeked out internships much this year, due to location restrictions).

The thing is, I don't want to sit in front of a computer doing any of these things. Video game dev at a large company is very different than making a game by yourself; I **hate** working with front end for the web, and can't get around the immense number of JS frameworks and how often they are created and die; making the trader was a learning experience but ultimately it's just a wrapper around a single API endpoint for trading and a WebSockets feed for the price data; and the blog is basically just a long Python script - it's less of software engineering and more of just coding.

For the degree, I'm getting a specialization in AI because none of the others appeal to me. I'm interested about learning low level stuff like compilers &amp; OSs and they're on my list of things to pursue in my free time, but again the thought of doing that 40 hours a week for 40 years terrifies me. None of the other specializations seem at all interesting to me. I've only taken one AI course, and it was more of data analysis than AI. It again seems like it would get boring really, really quickly - the main challenge of the final project (Kaggle) is basically just cleaning up and preprocessing the data, discovering that random forest is an epic fail, so feeding it into various types &amp; stacks of neural nets to get a good model. I think the other AI classes will be a bit different, and neural nets obviously have huge ramifications for the future, but the thought of doing them doesn't excite me in the same way as solving a *new* real world problem *now*.

So while I have decently spread out experience, no area really appeals to me. I suppose a part of this is due to no experience with what jobs in different fields are like. What resources are there for me to discover what careers would be a good match for me? Because I've read through the faqs and wikis here and on other sited, and just can't find anything.

In case this may help with any suggestions, here's my to-do list for CS projects: add a few simple improvements to some open source projects I use (better notifications integration for KDE Connect and better handling of )]} close brackets in Kate); finish the [Nand to Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/) book (I've completed the assembler); learn C or D and finish [this](http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/introduction.html) graphics tutorial; code a multiplayer 2d game I have the design doc written out for (quite a bit more complex than anything I've done so far), and learn Haskell (because my experience with Racket still affects the way I approach programming today, and thus I want to learn functional programming more thoroughly).

Thank you so much for the help!"

To the point that I’m afraid of them. I mean I’ll be 20 graduating with my 4 year degree, I’m running an Honor Society at my school, and I just got a great internship in my field. But I’m still afraid of them even though I’m basically independent. They pay for most of my stuff, but I’ll be covering a lot more once my new job starts. I’m not happy. I always tell them I am because if I tell them I’m not, they’ll list off all the stuff I have and that those things should make me happy. I picked my degree because it was the one I could get done with the fastest - I don’t like it. But I figure once I find a job that gets me out of the house, I’ll be happy. I’m tired of pleasing them and not myself. I try to talk to them, but they never listen and just blame my feelings on me. They say that I feel “ wrong “. I believe that some of the stuff that happened when I was younger is the reason that I feel the way that I do. They never were comforting parents. When I was in grade school I was always SO quiet and afraid to speak to people. I had to go up and present something at an event at school, and got up there and didn’t say anything because i was nervous. Instead of being the parents that consoles their kid, mine made me cry in front of everyone and proclaimed that I embarrassed them. Another time I was about to go on a trip for a week where I would have no contact with them. So I come home and they are just yelling at me and so upset but I had no clue why. It was a trip that they wanted me to go on. They were still mad up until I left, so I went a whole week and still wonder why they were mad at me. They didn’t say anything as to why they were mad. Another time when I was little I must’ve done something, and my dad spanked me. I get that, that’s normal, but he held me down by the back of my neck and I couldn’t breathe while he did that - that to me wasn’t normal. So now I’m afraid that they’ll get mad at me and something will happen. They always are like we are  never mad at you and what the heck could happen! They’re never mad at me because I would never do anything to make them feel that way. But now I’m older and I have my own beliefs and such, and I’m tired of being afraid of them. It’s so bad that I get nervous to be out late because I’m afraid one day they’ll use it against me. They never talk out their problems and just yell at me when I start crying. It’s a toxic household in and out, but every time I try to talk about a problem it’s just blamed on me. They’re so bad that I haven’t even told them that a good friend of mine died a few weeks ago. They would tell me there’s no reason to be upset since I hadn’t seen that friend in a year. But me and that friend always talked and we were close. They don’t know that though because they would ask why I have guy friends when I have a boyfriend. They are so closed minded and in their ways. There’s no changing them, but I just can’t wait to get away from them. To live my life and not be guilty about every little thing I do and don’t do. They tell me there’s no reason to feel that way, but I just don’t trust them. Once I leave I will never have contact with them again. I won’t let them ruin the good life I am working towards. I would go to a professional and talk to them, but honestly I know I won’t feel better until I’m away from here. "

8chm1f,6,2018-04-15,[FL] State wants to suspend my license over dropping out of HS- I'm in college,cantdrivetoschool,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8chm1f/fl_state_wants_to_suspend_my_license_over/,"I lurk here a lot but have only posted like.. a long time ago on a throwaway over something much more trivial than this so if I messed up lmk. I know a lot of the people here dislike when OPs are emotional so there's a handy dandy TLDR at the top because I am mad af at this stupid state and will probably convey that in my tone. My mom always says don't write about things when you're mad but I can't envision being not mad about this so. 

TL;DR: FL has a law that if you drop out of HS and you're under 18 you get your license suspended. I ended HS early but am homeschooled, so no diploma, but was in a dual enrollment program and I just continued going to my community college but actually paying for classes as a normal student. I'm 17 and will get my AA in a month or so and will turn 18 like right after graduation, but this letter says I have two weeks.

Long ass explanation:

Backstory:
I was homeschooled my whole life, thought about maybe going public for HS but then we found out about this cool thing called dual enrollment. Basically you take college classes at the community college (you can go to the universities too but they're more restrictive), in my county/district you're allowed up to 4 classes a semester and 2 between Jr/Sr year. I was sold, so I stayed homeschooled and decided to dual enroll. Everything is going great, I have straight A's in my classes, I've thought about my major, looked at universities I want to transfer to away from home to still get a college experience, life is good. Then, while looking at universities I learned in FL you need 12 credit hours AFTER HS to be considered a transfer. Otherwise you are first time in college (FTIC) and you have to go to freshman orientation, follow freshman rules about housing/cars, live with freshmen, register when freshmen register instead of the other upperclassmen. I was like that may not be too bad, but I posted to a FB group of dual enrollment kids and some who had already graduated with their AAs were like yeah no it sucks especially registration, the program I want to go into at the school I want to go to has a small amount of seats per classes once you're an upperclassman, like 30. I'm sure the advisers would work with you but after hearing real peoples opinions vs what the universities were trying to tell me I said hey mom and dad, is it okay if I ""graduate"" homeschool HS and take 12 credits as a regular student at this college before my AA? My parents were like yeah, actually we made a pros and cons list but the pros sounded better like with registration and better housing and being able to have my car and all. SO in December my mom emailed whoever is in charge of some kind of homeschool registry with the state to tell her we're no longer homeschooling and I've ""graduated"".

The issue:
Friday got a letter in the mail addressed to me, looked official, from Tallahassee. Open it. Says I'm about to have my license suspended for dropping out of HS unless I send them proof of graduating HS or enroll in GED classes and send proof of that within 2 calendar weeks from the *date they dated the letter when they printed/mailed it* which was last Monday, but obv since this is the government they only have business days and even those are like riddled with a bunch of stupid holidays. I check it out, seems to be a legit thing, isn't asking for money, number listed to call is same as state DOT so I call it, get put on hold for literally 2 hours, let the music play in the background while I do my *college* homework, get a lady, started off really polite but I'll admit I got frustrated when she wasn't being understanding. She tells me I HAVE to send them a diploma, at this point I've already offered to send her my CC transcripts and proof I'm enrolled at the CC right now. I told her I'm homeschooled, what do you want? I am more than willing to print one out and have my mom sign it and send it your way. She said that would not suffice it needs to be official, I told her we didn't use an umbrella school or anything we did straight up homeschooling with some Florida Virtual School (FLVS) until I started my dual enrollment. She then lectured me on how life without a HS diploma has no positive outcome. I said listen I get the goal of this law, but I am literally going to have my AA in less than a month I don't need a HS diploma because I'm pretty sure an AA is a level up. Then the call ""disconnected"" and I waited on hold again but at that point it was 4:30pm so after like 5:15pm I gave up because their hours said they would leave at 5. Cool, now it's the weekend and I have no clue what to do.

My parents and I talked about it because like FL does not have a good reputation for public transportation, at least in my area, I have a 7am class and there's literally no way to take the bus and get there on time, I could Uber to class but just to see I woke up early this morning when I usually leave for class (6:15) and there was like 1 uber in the area, I know it's Sunday but I don't want to count on it. My parents could take me however they really don't want to as it'd be inconvenient for them, and what was the point of spending all of that time helping me learn how to drive, getting me a car, and paying insurance and all if they still have to bus me around? My dad emailed the local representatives to complain and one of the local news channels ""investigative"" things hoping that'd do something but we can't really do much since it's the weekend. My mom says to just keep driving and just don't get pulled over (I haven't been stopped in my driving career yet and my friends say I drive like an old person I use my blinker for every turn and freak if I'm going like 2 over the speed limits but I don't want to bank on that).

The major I want to go into does not prefer people with arrest records, even if it is for something as dumb as driving on a license that was suspended for NO reason related to driving. I obviously understand this law is here to discourage children from dropping out of school but what can I do if they won't accept the fact that I WILL NOT EVER have a HS diploma? That I don't need one because I'm about to have a two year degree and transfer? When I turn 18 will my license be automatically re-instated? Will they still want HS proof when I'm 18 and go to get my license back? Does this give me points on my record? I tried asking the lady at the DOT but she just kept pushing for a HS diploma. I printed one off of Google images and had my mom sign it and sent it off in the Saturday mail along w/ a printout of my unofficial transcripts, a scan of my college ID and license side by side so you can see it's me, and a print out of the section of my college's portal where you can see what you're currently enrolled in and your schedule by date and time. I'm 17 taking 13 credit hours w/ an introductory internship in the field I want to major in I literally do not have the time to call them 9-5 until Wednesday or Friday and by then we've already wasted over a week of their stupid deadline. Is it really that unbelievable to them that I could have my life together and not need some dumbass piece of paper from the public school system to prove it?"

It's been a difficult internship season for me, but I've learned a lot. I naively started with applying to a lot of large tech companies (big 4), but realized I might have better luck with smaller ones (Pandora, Lyft, iRobot, etc). Still nothing

I go to a fairly large school, so it's been pretty competitive. Some of my friends who (imo) don't have as strong of a resume have been landing internships through connections and referrals with friends/professional frats, but I'm afraid I don't really have any of those.

After some reflection, I can see why it could be the way I'm applying (only making cover letters if requested, didn't reach out to recruiters to follow up, rarely attend career fairs), and I'm planning to change that next year. Meanwhile, I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to polish my resume!

Here's my resume: https://imgur.com/ykP8FWQ

Also, if anyone has any other tips for how to apply, please let me know!"

Hobbies (essay or somethin idk)

- Guitar --&gt; gotta get the ladies

- Magic --&gt; see above; performed at a few senior centers too

8cjtua,93,2018-04-15,TIFU by flossing before an interview with Google,scifisquirrel,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8cjtua/tifu_by_flossing_before_an_interview_with_google/,"A little over a year ago my school was awesome and gave me a scholarship to the Grace Hopper Conference (a conference for women in tech). Most of the time I had to watch over my school's booth, but I worked it out with the other students that I could spend an hour going around to the different tech booths to talk to recruiters (gotta get that summer internship). 

I eat a salad for lunch and head over to Google's booth. But wait! I just ate a salad and might have something in my teeth. It would be super embarrassing to have something in my teeth for my interview! 

I go back and get some floss from my bag and head towards the restroom. As I feared, I had flecks of lettuce in my teeth, but luckily I caught them! 

Now I floss once every few days, so my gums are a little red, but it's no big deal. An extra layer of lip gloss, make sure my shirt is tucked in, and I'm good to go! 

I head back out. I'm nervous and jittery but extremely excited. And great, there's no line! I head right over to the Google booth and sign up to talk to a recruiter. A minute later a cool looking twenty-something Asian woman with a Google t-shirt beckons me over with a smile. 

""Hey! How are you enjoying the conference?"" 

""Great!"" I exclaim. Her smile falters.

Maybe my voice is too high. I take a deep breath and try to calm down. In a more even tone I talk about my favorite talks I've seen so far at the conference. 

She is now frowning. 

Maybe she's heard the same chit chat before and is really bored? I change to talking about the research I'm doing at my school, hoping this will click with her better....

She is now noticeably getting farther away from me. 

Abstractedly I notice my mouth is unusually wet. Usually when I'm nervous it gets really dry. Weird. 

Anyways I love the research I'm doing so I forget how nervous I am and start nerding out about cities and technology. The ramifications of self-driving cars on cities is my jam! I'm starting to feel more confident. 

Then it happens. 

A fleck of blood flies out of my mouth. It arcs in between us, I swear moving in slow motion. 

It lands on her shirt right above her chest. 

The both of us go quiet. We're both looking at the drop of blood, which has now soaked into the shirt in a large brown-purple blob.  

I mumble an apology, while trying to keep my mouth as closed as possible. I can't make eye contact. The world feels like it's closing in on me. 

I don't even try to continue. I just turn and run. 

I run to the restroom, hoping maybe it wasn't as bad as I was building it up in my head? Maybe I can go back and apologize and continue?

It's even worse. All of my teeth are coated in a thick bright red sheen. I spit in the sink and it is half blood. 

I spend the next 5 minutes cleaning my mouth out, the next fifteen minutes hyperventilating in a stall, and the rest of the conference I avoid the Google booth like a vampire avoids mirrors. I still no longer floss before interviews. 

TL;DR: Flossed before talking to a Google recruiter, blood ensues, likely convince the recruiter I was a vampire. Did not get a call back interview. "

I really wanted this at my school, and it was the main reason why I decided to come here. But after getting further and further into the program, Im starting to get discouraged at how much im going to be in debt after i graduate, and finding work in the sound recording field. 

Roughly 30 people applied for the study away and only 18 got accepted. I was one of those that was accepted and Im not sure if i want to follow through with it. A couple reasons:
1)Housing is not regulated by the school, and there is no meal plan, which means im on my own.
2)my own transportation is required so i have to bring my car down there. 
3)It will add to my debt, and when I come back from it I will have another 2 years left of school.
4)I will also be leaving my current job to go down there, which i need to pay for my car.

Ive also noticed that to be successful in this industry, you dont need a degree, and thats another reason why im starting to rethink this. I have also already changed my major, so if i decide to go, i may need to switch back in order to still qualify. My new major is a liberal studies major, and it will allow me to get out of school in 2 more semesters as opposed to the music and sound recording degree which will keep me in school for another 2-3 years. 

Im just kind of stuck, and Im not sure if this is what I really want. If anyone has been in a similar situation or has good advice please leave it, thanks! "

I am a 23 year old man from Saudi Arabia, currently in the USA in a MS program - one year left until graduation - after a BS degree (also done in the States). Both are in tech fields. 

I need to start planning ahead long-term to see how I may stay in the US permanently. This is because there are very little jobs in my field back home, and I have a tenuous grasp over the Arabic language. I also love the USA and am a firm believer in all things American. I am treated better here than at home.

While I have a high level industry certification, as well as what is soon to be two US degrees in the field, along side an internship in the industry (40 hours during the summer only, due to visa restrictions. 20 hours otherwise), I will always be disadvantaged as a lot of jobs in my industry either require US citizenship for security clearances, or do not sponsor non-US citizens.

Other than marriage - which is definitely not happening - what would you guys suggest is the best way to secure a permanent residency in the US, so I may pursue employment irrespective of my ethnicity? I have yet to invoke OPT, but that does not last forever.

So I landed a pretty big internship with one of the prestigious companies everyone talks about on this sub. I studied the hell out of leetcode last semester and applied to a lot of different places and was able to get a few pretty good offers.

I feel like I am decently smart, my GPA is really high and I've never really had a problem in school. However, my state school doesn't really teach you much about software engineering. I feel quite behind some other people that go to more prestigious schools that have probably had a lot better education than me.

I've only gotten serious about CS in this past school year. I had an internship last summer at a small defense contractor and did a bit of Python/Django development, but it wasn't anything special. This school year, I've been working for that company remotely and done some more Python development and have worked on a Node.js/React application for them.

However, all of these projects I've worked on in the job have been shared with other people. I didn't build them from the ground up, so I feel like I'm really not prepared for this internship this summer.


This past school year has been extremely busy so I have not had much time to work on side projects. Consequently, my portfolio outside of my job is pretty bare. I do have a machine learning research project on my github, but that's not really software engineering per se.


Anyways, because of all this I feel like I will be out of my depth at this prestigious internship this summer. Is it normal to feel this way? I'm *really* not very good at coding yet, and while I'm decent at algorithms, I feel like I'm pretty rusty with object-oriented and system design stuff.


The thing is, I am very hungry to learn as much as I can. I *really* want to rise to the occasion. I'm just scared that I'm so far behind that I won't be able to keep up. What can I do to get prepared for the summer? I've begun working on one side project currently. I'm hoping to have it done before I begin the internship. Am I fucked, or is it totally normal to feel this unprepared for an undergrad internship? I'm guessing a lot of people learn a lot on the job."
8cl8cu,1,2018-04-16,Why bother?,Abec13,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8cl8cu/why_bother/,"There's that Chinese curse that goes ""May you find what you are looking for."" This saying is a curse disguised as a blessing. Said unto others as not to generate bad karma or juju for the person who speaks it.

I have this problem--nothing can hold my interest. Everything and everyone is temporary.  My hobbies/interest stick for a few months or so until I inevitablly burn out of it and am left in this void of boredom. Bored of my hobbies, bored of my stagnant relationship, bored of my predictable family, no desire for schooling that my parents pay for even though it's the only thing in my  life currently that holds purpose. Boredom strikes hard; it's a mental pain for me that manifests itself as physical discomfort. 

I think of how bored I am now and how long it will be until I find another stimulus. Sometimes that gap is too long. Sometimes there's something for me but it's too inconvenient for me to bother. 

I've always found that happiness isn't my priority. I'll volunteer to work 55 hours a week because, logically, I'd those extra 15 hours would be me just playing video games (considered to be the lowest level of productivity) so why not just work instead and claim the time and a half?

Eventually I'll be working a sallary job (in the engineering field) fighting to find things that hold my interest for the little time I have after work. I don't like engineering, I'm just good at it. 

I thought about doing drugs. I smoke weed occasionally but feel guilty when I do because I should be doing school work instead. I don't like drinking, I don't like the crowd of people who like drinking. I don't like people that like what I like because I usually find that I'm more intelligent than them and they don't impress me or interest me in the slightest. I'm lonely by my own accord.

I thought about cheating on my girlfriend for fun because she's boring too but couldn't bring myself to crush someone like that. Even sadness and anger are more interesting than being bored.

I would leave this lifestyle and move to a different country but it would be stupid of me to turn down paid for schooling and living. My parents would be disappointed in me for years and I'm sure I would be disappointed in me too.

Does it ever end? I'm scared I'll be bored forever. I'm jealous of people that can suck at things and be happy. I jealous people that can find everything interesting. I'm jealous of people that can be happy with nothing.

I sit here in my expensive apartment with paid for school a nice paying internship on the track of my schooling. I'm a pretty good looking guy with some sort of charisma, no health problems and all I have is complaints and negativity and I can't stop. I just want to be happy but I don't think it's ever going to happen. I've never been happy with status quo. I'm always looking to the future for a higher point but it's dark.

I don't want to talk to anyone about it because I don't want them to think less of me. Even more so, I don't want them to know what I think of them. I don't want to be the guy that ""needs emotional help."" That's just more baggage. As much as we wish people won't look at us different when they know we're this miserable. They do, we do. I do."

I attended community college while I worked there not knowing what I wanted to do with my life and realized I liked my job so, here I am with ~1 year of school left at [x] State University.

I only made parts in OrCad, never designed PCBs (until school - after I moved on from this job). Basically I had a shit ton of test experience and that’s why I got recruited for a Test Engineering Internship position. As much as I wanted a shiny EE Internship to put on my resume, I was still delighted to take this offer from a big company. I will be creating tests for product based off their specified requirements. Similar to what I have experience with except I’ll be actually designing test stands/procedures and writing code.

How useful is my previous/future summer experience? 

It seems like I’m a die hard test guy, but I don’t want to be in this area all my life, just going with the flow. Is this something that will help in moving up the ladder if this company hires me after grad?

Thank you!"

Two budgets here to gauge what is worth spending. Sub $1,000 USD and $1,000-1500 USD

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Looking for the best of both worlds here. Good battery life is a preference but I don't want to sacrifice specifications for the money. Want to best bang for the buck here. 


* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
Lightweight and thin is very preferable. Not sure how possible this is but it is very appealing. 


* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
 Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
N/A just not tiny.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
This will eventually be used for CAD courses my senior year. I would not expect to be doing anything crazy heavy but for the most part it will be a laptop for taking notes, running some programs such as MatLab and GINT. It will eventually be used to run solidworks or solid edge. 



* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 NA

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 

Just something that is friendly to use and feels nice. I don't like bulky at all. Simple and slim is how I like it. As for a touch screen, this isn't a must but if it's in the budget, sure. 


* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**


Just to recap the above. I'm an engineering student who will one day be doing some CAD programs in a year/year and a half. Sadly my laptop is dead and need to replace now with that in mind. I would expect to be doing data analysis in programs given by the company for internships or Coops. I would like something that I can use to take notes, reports, and run programs when needed. I ideally want something that is more on the slim/lightweight side without sacrificing quality for my budget. I want something that can handle the future so I won't be pulling my hair out but I don't want to lug around a massive gaming computer.
A good display is nice, so the better quality I can get in this budget the better. I have broken into two budgets so I can see what each budget gets me. If you know something thats essentially a 'no brainer' to get, tell me so I'm not wasting my money on something just by saving a few hundred bucks. 

Let me know if this answered all of your questions!

I've lost interest in physics. I was pursuing a graduate degree, but I really wasn't enjoying the research aspect of it. I like reading and learning about physics, but actually doing physics research just wasn't for me. I found the thing I enjoyed most from my physics education was programming solutions to problems. So I figured I could pursue further education in that area and try to find work in it. My dream job would be to work in the video game industry, but I don't know how realistic that is, so I figure pursuing software engineering, or getting a computer programming diploma, would get me closer to that goal while providing me with education and experience in something that is tangentially related and in high demand.

I'm leaning more towards computer programming diploma right now since I already have a degree, and the diploma track gives me more hands-on experience and exposure to different languages, approaches, etc. Also, it's cheaper and shorter. Would you recommend the software engineering degree over the computer programming diploma?"

I plan on pursuing Computer Science wherever I go, however I'm not sure which school I should choose. My biggest interest is choosing a college that provides its students with a strong CS education as well as opportunities in the field (ie internships), which would be UCI, however I did not get in for CS (and I'm still somewhat skeptical about being able to transfer after talking to the CS department over email). I also have some concerns about getting the right amount of support and access to resources wherever I go, since at my current school I have an IEP that provides me with extra help when I need it (which I would surmise would be difficult at a school with a large student population). Right now, I'm really on the fence about where I should go, and I was wondering if anyone has any advice. I'm mostly looking between UCSC (where I got in for the program I want, is nearby to me, and has a lower student population) and UCI (which has a strong program and greater access to internships but I am in undeclared).

So I'd like some input on what to do in the next couple years of my life. I'm a high school junior at the moment and I've set my mind on the IT industry. 
Right now I don't have too much in terms of certifications. I have an Adobe Photoshop certification and an Autodesk Maya certification which isn't really IT. However, I'm currently enrolled in a computer engineering class, and my school is buying me a voucher and a study book to take the CompTIA A+ 901. I plan on taking Computer Engineering 2 and Networking 2 next year, where I would (hopefully) get the CompTIA A+ 902.
 Another thing that I have going on now is that I'm attempting to get an Internship at Lenovo. I've sent in my application and am currently waiting for a reply. 
The last thing that could help me is my 5 years in 2 different CTSOs (Carrer and Technical Student Organizations) which is Technology Student Association and SkillsUSA. Other than that, I don't have too much in terms of things that make me stand out from others who I would be competing against for jobs.

Is there anything else I can do outside of what I already have that could help put me above others. Or any advice as what the expect 

TL;DR
I have some stuff to make me stand out but I'd like more, any recommendations or advice for what to do in the future"

I am (28 m) from Germany. I recently finished my master thesis in management with the specialization information systems. The reason why I studied so long is that I started working full time 2 years ago besides my studies (I had financial problems).

Since I don’t want to write my whole CV here is a short summary:

From 2009-2016 worked part time in small e-commerce shop: Tasks-&gt;

- Supported the warehouse manager in his tasks; distribution of shipments; receiving shipments; storing products and booking them; solve questions from workers in the warehouse
- After that went to the office, tasks here; developed a android application for our salesman to record invoices at the customer and print them there; supported the purchaser and CEO with data maintenance (sql)

Since 2016 I am working officially as an IT-Consultant full time in the same company, but I really don’t know if I am an IT-Consultant so yeah, my tasks here are:

- I introduced a new sales channel and developed the interface between our system and the extern system in Java and SQL-Databases; Herefore I worked in all processes for this channel (pick&amp;pack, shipment, booking); I have created the databases and developed some programs in java to support the distribution of the products; I managed and still manage the products which are offered on this sales channel, means I calculate KPI and analyse the competition in order to make decisions about products (Stock value currently around 100k US Dollar)
- Now I support the CEO with search engine optimization and product ranking on Amazon.
- I studied abroad in China for 6 months and did an internship in Japan for 6 months as well. I created a information portal for the company in Japan.
- I didn’t learn coding in the university; learning by doing and when I have problems stackoverflow and google😊
- I have very good experience in SQL and Excel. And normal experience in java.
- I can learn very fast, if I am interested.
- I like to learn new technologies in the area of IT. I do like coding but since I didn’t study IT I am a rookie and honestly, I feel sometimes stupid and that I am not capable of coding well.
- I speak 2 languages fluently and my English is okay.

So here is the problem. I am applying for jobs. Mainly jobs as a IT-Consultant, some IT project manager positions and in the area of process management. I have written around 8 applications; 4 of them were refusals. For the other 4 I had interviews, but it didn’t go well.

Right now, I am afraid that I am drifting in a depression, I don’t like my job anymore and I am old. I don’t earn much money.

I really don’t know what I want from life and I am really negative now. I guess I just need an advice. What do you guys think about my market value? What am I capable?"

Hello all, I have some conflicts I am trying to work out with my upcoming schedule for the Fall of my junior year of college.

I am considering doing all 3 next semester since the Math Theory and Probability course will greatly benefit me in a professional aspect, since I will be interviewing for Quant internships for the summer of 2019, and Probability and Statistics are a large part of the interview processes.

Do you think it is reasonable, as well as logical, to take 3 math courses in one semester? I cant imagine that Math Reasoning and Math Theory will be as technically difficult as diffy q's, but it still seems like a large commitment nonetheless. Any advice?

**TLDR :** Software Engineer hates job and stuck in major till graduation, but needs to figure out what to do post-graduation.

Currently looking for advice, or just stories of your experiences, about what you did after you graduated. 

**Academic Background :**

I'm a Software Engineering major going into my last year of school. I've had over a year of real work experience in my field through co-ops / internships. 

As of the last two co-ops I've been on I've realized that I despise the work. It feels completely meaningless, absolutely uninteresting, and is not challenging me in any real way. At those co-ops, I blazed through the first two months and then sat around and researched random Math &amp; Stats concepts, jumped down the Wikipedia knowledge rabbit hole, worked on Kaggle projects (and generally failed to get anywhere), or read book reviews for the rest of my stint at work.

It's way too late to change my major, get a liberal arts minor, or get an engineering minor. I'm currently starting to finish my Math minor, and have a Stats minor under my belt. However, I don't feel that I'm interested enough in either Stats or Math to fully pursue them full-time. I'm really at a loss right now.

**Conclusions from On-The-Job Experience :**

I've finally realized that unless the work in meaningful and interesting, I will hate it. More so if I'm chained to a desk for more than two hours at a time.

**Interests :**

*Sailing* - I'm currently certed as a Sailing Instructor and have a job this summer doing that (*fist pump*), but, as a career, that isn't my end goal. I've been sailing as much as possible during school, but I'm nowhere near a professional (or even especially competent). I'm interested in building and repair work as well and have been considering trying to apprentice out to a sailmaker. Doing anything maritime related would be awesome.

*Music* - I play and absolutely love music (fiddle and percussion). I don't play it well enough to teach it or make a living at it.

*Reading / Literature* - I love reading. I'm sprinting my way through two of Dostoyevsky's works right now (Brothers Karamazov and Notes From A Dead House). I'm also working my way through John Adams by David McCullough, The Farseer Trilogy (read 300 pages in the last two days 0_o), a book on Buddhism, The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K Le Guin (RIP), Eats, Shoots, &amp; Leaves by ?, and What Unites Us by Dan Rather. However, I don't know if editing would be a feasible career, given the lack of a formal liberal arts education of any real value (at an Institute of Technology with no time to spare for relatively poorly done LA classes).

*History* - Stupidly interesting. Always. But a history major can do jack shit, and I have no formal education. I've loved every history class I've ever taken. No job prospects though.

*Cooking* - I'd love to learn how to cook. I've spent a good deal of time looking up food history (fucking weird right?), especially of foreign food. However, not sure how well that would go.

*Math &amp; Stats* - I love reading wikipedia articles on Stats / Math concepts, but I haven't had a really good math class in college yet somehow (despite the quality of the Math department here). I'm doubtful that either of these minors will be the focus of a future career. I've attempted Kaggle and Data Science competitions on the side, but I've never been able to full-time it like I would probably enjoy.

*Environmentalism &amp; Activism* - Anything that would make a difference so that my kids (don't have them yet...or plan on it any time soon) can enjoy this awesome planet in a similar or better condition would make my time at work worthwhile. Also any job that makes me spend time outdoors would make me happy just by being outdoors.

Pretty much stuck at an impasse right now. I don't know what to do or where to go after making the conclusion that I'll jump off a bridge if forced to do this for more than 6 months at a time. It's gotten bad enough that I had to get counseling, which isn't helping that much other than helping me identify other unrelated problems. 

Any help, advice, and / or references to resources would be immensely appreciated."

Its no secret that what you do outside of class is more important than going to class alone, so I would love to give other students the opportunity to stand out and qualify for the same opportunities that universities get. 

To add to that last point, if the department saw that our club was accomplishing something with academic and career merit, I believe we could get a nice amount of funding, though nothing extravagant.


If anyone has ideas on what kind of projects we can start, whether it be simple arduino projects (which I intend to do) or more importantly a larger club wide project that is realistic and beneficial to our futures, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. "

I was in the Navy for 6 years was an aviation electronics technician. When I got out I got a contractor job as a subject matter expert for avionics but really all that means is I wrote training material for the Navy on the platform I worked on before I got out. After about a year of that I was presented an opportunity with another Navy contracting company doing similar work but my title now is Technical Publications Writer. I make a very good salary for the area, between 70k and 80k and love the company I work for, but I'm not doing something I love. One of the things I miss about my job in the Navy was I was able to fix problems and had a great sense of accomplishment every day when I went home.

So since I left the Navy I have been in school for networking and LOVE everything about it. I spend a lot of time in our lab and know that IT is where I want my career to end up. I'm 32 and have a wife, 7 month old, and one on the way so starting over at a square one with a help desk job isn't really an option. I've done two VERY in depth capstone projects where we developed a networking infrastructure from scratch for a fake non profit. I also have had two internships but they weren't with big companies. They were both 1 man show places which I don't think I'd like either. 

I know I need to get some certs and have already purchased vouchers for A+, Net+, and Sec+. I'll probably also take the CCENT and CCNA which I think will put me in a good spot to approach a recruiter. I also think I'm going to need to have a professional resume writing service do my resume so they can word it correctly since I'm coming in without any direct work experience as a sys admin or network admin. 

Just curious what you guys think a good course of action would be. I think the ultimate goal is management/director/CIO but I don't really know the steps to get there from here. Thanks for your time!"

8cr4f9,77,2018-04-16,The LifeTrip Drug IL9,abhisek_,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8cr4f9/the_lifetrip_drug_il9/,"My wife was 37 when we fell in love with each other. 
I was 32 at the time, still single and living my life. 

We married each other after 2 wonderful years of dating. 
I was sternly against the idea of marriage at the time, believing that I'd not get married under any circumstances. That was my view, until I finally met my wife. Till then, my life had consisted of mostly one night stands, short flings and in total: a long string of unsuccessful relationships.

Intentionally unsuccessful, mind you, because I didn't want any of them to succeed. I wasn't ready to settle down just yet. The abundance of nightclubs and the social acceptance of hookup culture ensured that my physical needs would always be taken care of. 
I was blessed with good genetics and worked hard to become a successful neurosurgeon by age 28. So, hooking up with random women, wasn't exactly a difficult thing for me. 

I wasn't always like that, though. 
I used to believe in love and ‘happily ever after’ till that notion was shattered during my first serious relationship with a girl named Alisha. She was the first girl whom I thought I really loved. 
I started partying and going on rebounds after she broke up with me. To this day, I firmly believe that she was the one person I actually loved, till I met my current wife(of course).

It was my fault and I had messed up and cheated on Alisha. 
I'm man enough to admit my mistakes. One day, I was drinking with with a pretty red haired girl at a friend's party, and too many drinks later I found myself waking up in her bed on the next morning.
I came clean because Alisha deserved to know the truth, but she didn't give me a second chance. I was heartbroken, but it was her choice. I would've done the same to her, I guess, had I been in her shoes. 
After she had left me, I started spending every weekend sloshed at nightclubs. Thus, working in the hospital during the week and partying at nightclubs during the weekends was all I was used to doing. 

That all changed on June 25th 2012, when my soon-to-be wife joined my hospital as a fellow neurosurgeon.
I had been told about her joining by my supervisors, but what they had told me differed drastically from what I saw when she came into my chambers. 
I was expecting a serious, experienced 37 year old woman from whom I'd get to learn a thing or two myself.
What walked in seemed to be a beautiful Greek Goddess in human form. 
She looked like she was in her twenties, fit and almost as tall as me.
She had long blonde hair, which was neatly tied up in a ponytail behind her perfectly shaped head. 
Her skin was fair and looked flawlessly smooth. 

However, the best feature were her deep, dreamy eyes. She had big hazel brown eyes that seemed to drown me in from the first glance. I had never seen anyone with such beautiful, rare eyes. It had a tinge of yellow in them, scattered around her pupil uniformly, which was only visible if you looked at them for a while. 
""For a while"" was more than what I had spent staring at her eyes.
Even now, as I'm typing  this, I distinctly remember that first day. 
You never really forget the first time you meet ""the one"" of your life.

Workplace romance isn't encouraged anywhere, but to me, giving up on someone like this seemed to be a far greater risk. So, as you can already guess, I asked her out after the first day of working together.

The first few dates were terrific. I had fallen in love before, as you can remember, but this was different. She was different. 
What made me fall in love so deeply, wasn't her looks. It wasn't the time we spent with each other or her intellect. It wasn't our common profession or even our common interests. 
It was her darkness. It was in her choice of total vulnerability and the fact that she trusted me enough to share her deepest, darkest secrets with me.

I'm aware of the fact that at 37, you're expected to have a difficult past. But her past nowhere near normal. She told me all of this after just a month of dating each other and each day since then, I've fallen deeper and deeper in love with her.
What I am about to tell you now, is true.
 
My wife has killed 6 men in the past. 
Six.
Let that sink in for a moment.

She wasn't a psychopathic serial killer, per se. She killed and slaughtered 6 innocent men for a good reason which you will start to understand, in a while.
My wife's mother was a powerful witch who had bestowed upon her the gifts of witchcraft and a bottle of ancient drugs which were named IL9. IL9 was the Lifetrip Drug.
One pill of IL9 is to be first wrapped  with the victim's right coronary artery and then taken orally. 
To get someone's coronary artery, you have to, obviously, kill them. This someone should be a potential love interest, i.e, someone you want to spend a lifetime with, because:
On swallowing the pill wrapped with that person's artery, you spend a lifetime with that person on your trip.
The IL9 trip  lasts for an hour. 

If you have ever tripped on LSD or DMT before, you would know that the time of the trip itself does not correlate with your perception of time while you're tripping. 1 hour of a DMT trip can feel like days while 9 hours of an LSD trip might feel like a pleasant half an hour.
 
The Lifetrip IL9 trip lasts for an hour. Exactly an hour.

But in that hour, you would trip till you died in your world. 
According to my wife, each trip feels like a new life. As real as the life we live and indistinguishable in every way.
In that lifetime of a trip, you would get married and spend your life with the person whom you killed in real life, who's right coronary artery you swallowed. 

My wife had killed 6 men and had spent 6 entire lifetimes with 6 different men.

If you're judging my  wife right now, don't. 
I'll tell you why. Today, 50% of all marriages end in divorce. In fact, there is one divorce every 36 seconds in America. 
We all know no one marries someone unless they are really sure of them. Even then, the probability of that marriage working out is slim. 
With odds such as these, if there was a way to find out exactly how your entire life would be with a person, from then till death, would you not want to know?
We all have just one life.

Imagine all the extra time that you would have. Imagine all the different experiences you would have otherwise missed out on. 

Would you not want to live an entire life with someone special to you, knowing that whatever you would do and whatever that happened in that life which you were living had no consequences in the real world? 
Let's be honest here. Who doesn't want to live multiple lives in this short 90 year life that we all are inadvertently bound to?

I know I'd take that option in a heartbeat if I had the choice. 
I was surprised my wife wasn't killing a new guy everyday. 

Sure, killing people mercilessly to take out their right coronary artery was a major drawback. 
You might call her cold blooded. Heartless, even. 
And you would be right.  
But you're not married to my beautiful wife. I am. 
I am fine with her past. I have made my peace with it. That's all that should matter. 

There's a saying that you learn a lot from each relationship. 
My wife practically had six lifetimes to learn. With six different men.

By the time she had met me,  she had way more experience in relationships than I would ever have. She was mature and calm. She knew how to deal with conflict effectively. She was emotionally stable and understanding.
In this world of instant gratifications, she seemed to understand how important true love was.

Such maturity would've been impossible without her past experiences.
Of all the people she felt something with, she killed them and lived out her fantasy of living with them for an entire life. She told me about all of them. 
Being a surgeon herself, she never lacked the tools or skills necessary to cut people up. 

Why did she spare me? 
In her words, it felt ""right"" to settle down with me. And she had to settle somewhere along the line. 
Before me, no one was lucky enough to break through her shell and properly ""know her"". None of her victims knew about her secret.
Then I came along and everything changed. 
To her, I was the one. 
The one because of whom all the killing stopped. 

It takes a lot of courage to show someone the cracks in your soul. If you're lucky, that someone will pour all their love inside your void places. That's what I did with her. 
It's her darkness that captivated me from the very beginning. I wasn't in love with her despite her flaws. I was in love with her because of them.

With me, she didn't feel like carving my heart out and going on a lifetime trip to see how well we worked out. 
With me, she took the risk of her life when she really didn't have to. 

I'll always be grateful to my darling wife for that.
As the years passed, we went on living our happy lives. We never had kids as we both realized we didn't want that.
But last month everything changed. Alisha reached out to me on Facebook last week, telling me her husband had died. Poor lad got crushed under a truck while fetching her groceries. He was just 40. 

She was crying and said that she had no one else to contact. She was messed up and in a really bad place.
She needed someone to be there for her. As much as I hate myself for this, I lied to my wife and left. 

I went over to hers for 2 days telling her I was visiting my brother upstate. Nothing happened between me and Alisha. I still loved my wife, and Alisha knew that. She just needed someone to comfort her for a few days.

When I returned, nothing was out of the ordinary. My wife was unaware of my visit. 

But she soon found out. She went through my phone while I was in the shower and read all of our chats.

I was initially, in the dark about all of my wife's findings.
Last week I woke up with my wife pointing a gun at me. That was the first thing I saw. 
The next thing I saw was a plate on my bed, which was almost filled to its brim with blood. At the centre of the plate was a carefully placed coronary artery. 

It didn't take me long to figure out whose artery it was.

""There's a pill on your right. Swallow that with the whore's artery"" 

""Baby. Is that Alisha's? Did you kill Alisha?""
""It was what she deserved."" she said, with no remorse or guilt.
""But I swear, nothing happened between us. You know how much I love you. Why would you-"" I stopped talking, noticing her hand.

She had pulled the hammer of the gun back with her left thumb. 

""Do what I said. Now!"" she shouted, pointing her gun steadily at my horrified face.

I looked at the dead piece of artery on the plate. I chewed and gobbled it down with the IL9 pill. The taste was unbearable. The looming fear of being shot by my wife was the only thing that kept me from throwing up. 

In an instant, the room changed color and I was 10 years younger. I looked at the picture beside me on the bed. It  was a picture of me and Alisha. She called out to me from the kitchen, just then. 
So apparently we were living with each other. 
It all felt real, even though I knew I wasn't in the real world. In this world, Alisha was mine. 
We would go on to have a successful marriage and 2 very beautiful kids. The question of ""What if me and Alisha had worked out?"" that I always pondered about in my youth, was answered by the drug.

I was amazed by how effective the drug was. 
It all felt like real life. The days, the weeks, the years- everything was as it should be. As the years went on, I was happy living with Alisha. 

I had forgotten about the fact that this was all a trip. By the time I was 35, I was convinced that this was my life and I should just live it as best as I could. Watching my kids grow up was an entirely different experience altogether. I can't believe I didn't want kids before.

I had thought I would live to at least 70 with Alisha before dying. That was not the case. 
I died at age 40. It was just a Friday morning when I had gone out to fetch some groceries when a truck ran me over.
I didn't feel any pain.
I just woke up, into my real life. 

Just an hour had passed, just like my wife had described. She was waiting for me to snap out of it and when I did wake up, she came and embraced me in her arms tightly.

Perhaps the shared experience of the IL9 trip had brought us together. 
You may choose not to believe any of this, and that's fine.

Only I know what I went through. 
I had lived an entire alternate life, with a girl that I dated back in college.  
An entire 15 years of life. The realness of it all was what amazed me. It almost felt like that was the real world. I was starting to hypothesize that maybe-just maybe- the drug finds an alternate reality and sends your consciousness there. 
Whatever it was, it was an unbelievable experience.I had the time of my life, and all it costed was just one of my life and my first girlfriend’s life. 

But that's not why I am writing this. I am writing this to tell you that there's this new intern at the hospital that I'm falling for. 
I've started talking to her lately on facebook, and we've been getting to know each other. 
I've also removed the password on my home computer where my facebook account is always signed in, and I leave my phone unlocked and on our bed whenever I go for a shower.

Potential lawsuit?",Jasonlovestummyrub,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8crk7i/interning_at_public_school_and_interns_supervisor/,"So, a friend of mine that has worked her way through college and her masters program towards her dream job as a school psychologist at a local school in Ohio. She has been interning this year in a local school system underneath a supervisor that has been hard to work with from day one. Her supervisor has made it known to my friend that she didn't like her or her work ethics, and also coldly told her to not let her home life affect her work life, just a few months in, when she was leaving an abusive marriage.

Keep in mind, my friend is a very nice person, very friendly and has gone through alot to better herself. I have no idea why the supervisor has such an issue with her, other than she is Catholic, and doesnt approve of divorce. I have listened to many instances of ridiculous behavior all school year by her supervisor, and she has been making my friend jump through multiple hoops for things that other supervisors said were unnecessary. Her actions were bad enough that my friend decided not to use her as a reference or let her know when she was applying to jobs at other schools. She made sure to just say she had ""appointments"" or went to interviews on her off time. She was doing well and into 2nd interviews (close to completion) when the supervisor discovered she was interviewing at some of the local schools, without telling her. She confronted her, telling her she was a bad person, amongst other things. She also just took it upon herself to email EVERY other school psych within the district, effectively blacklisting her to all other employers about her concerns with my friend.

We're encouraging her to lawyer up and talk to an employment attorney. It seems to me that the factors here would seem to warrant that A) it doesn't matter if she did / didn't do a good job as an intern that B) her supervisor, a publicly funded employee, took illegal action by blacklisting her with other schools.

Were this the private sector, I'd think she'd have a case. I do HR myself and have worked in a prior private employer where they were sued by a candidate that experienced a similar scenario by a prior manager blacklisting him AS he interviewed with us? I don't know if the candidate won the lawsuit, though in this instance, my friend's supervisor did a similar action to multiple employers, very effectively damaging her career and on taxpayer dollar?

Any idea what may be the outcome of a scenario like this if she were to sue? Should she start with a cease and desist to the school Superintendent? Can an employment attorney request the emails the supervisor sent to faculty for records?

Any advice would be a HUGE help. Thank you so much, Reddit!

Edit:  was just thinking about how crazy this scenario is.  She still is working under this supervisor for a few more weeks, knowing she has messaged all of these other schools (due to the sources telling her).   It's as if you worked for a company and your actively current manager told all similar employers within a 50 mile radius how awful you are and not to hire you (before you even interviewed with them), meanwhile, still working with you each day, paying you a salary, etc..  it's not as if these employers were calling HER asking for a reference check.  She took it upon herself to throw her under the bus.

My brother graduated from a UC school (not Berkley or UCLA) in summer 2017 with a computer science degree. He has been looking for jobs since that time and has gotten several interviews, but no job offers so far.  I was hoping I might be able to find some advice for him. 

He has big weaknesses in his resume. It took him 6 years to graduate after he had to drop out of the first school he went to. He also does not have any work or internship experience, he took summer classes every year to make up for the classes he failed at his first college.

He has been looking mostly online for jobs and internships. He is currently living with our parents in the SF Bay area.

What else should he be doing? What kind of networking can you do for computer science jobs? I would be grateful for any and all advice.

I went to college to get a degree for game design and this was from 2007-10. I got a bachelors degree in 3 years while still doing two jobs. At the time I graduated I had just missed honors for graduation by a letter grade and my school had my resume and portfolio to help place me.

After graduation, though, I felt almost as though I didn’t learn enough from my time there so I looked at Academy of Art (keeping in mind that Game Design as a major was still not all that common) and was told that since I have a bachelors I can only take Master level classes.

I had to keep checking with my original school and kept applying everywhere....for years.....even for QA jobs because, again, I felt I needed to learn more and wanted to be with an actual company so I know I’m learning what I need to. The school didn’t send me potential openings, I had to contact them repeatedly just for basic info, and the school now no longer exists :-/

I want to be a level designer primarily, but since the “education” I got from my school literally only seemed to get me huge debt (by the way, the school since I left had over 1/2 million complaints about various things including getting accreditation removed a year after I left) I just need to find a way in to QA to do....something

The school courses never did any real internships and never had classes on QA or the programs that are being used and since every “entry-level” post needs 1-2 experience, how can I get experience to get these jobs when I can’t get the jobs to get the experience? Even if I download JIRA or Bugzilla, it’s not like I’ll have anything to test it with....at least not that I know and I still don’t have the actual job experience with it....

I'd like to get some feedback on the situation I currently find myself in, as my yearly performance review is coming up.

In April 2016 I was offered an internship at a local startup at $12/hour. The pay was lower than I liked but the location was really great for me and I'd learn a lot very quickly due to the startup environment. I really enjoyed by internship there and they ended up hiring me back at $16.50/hour, allowing me to choose my hours to work around school. I gladly accepted.

I've really enjoyed working at the company, but I've been there since the position was offered in September 2016, and have yet to receive a raise. I find this a bit concerning - I hear stories of interns getting hired on full time as cheap labour.

I personally don't think this is the case, but the lack of a raise has me very concerned that maybe I wasn't actually getting a good a deal as I had hoped. I just wanted to get opinions on whether I am being overly greedy - the town I am from many of my fellow students are finding third year internships for only slightly more pay than me, but with far less experience.

My current plan is to ask for a raise at the performance review in a week, and if I get what I'd like, stay on after graduation. If not, then I'd jump ship to a different company after school, taking advantage of the flexible hours until then.

Not sure if this is enough information, feel free to ask a bit more. Thanks to anyone who contributes."

I'll admit I've made awful mistakes initially when first handing in my resume to recruiters like for example its not  set up correctly etc. But that was early on and now as the semester rolling to an end I have nothing to show for I've been on linkedin everyday to search for internship opportunities I've had recruiters look at my page from going to career fairs only to see a rejection email the next day. Of all the places I had applied to one company ask for a FaceTime interview through the computer to which I thought went nicely for the most part and after the interview I was ghosted which in my opinion was very unprofessional considering they chose to go forward with me enough to interview me with one of their employees the least they can do is tell me why I was rejected from the offer. But to summarize I accomplished virtually nothing this junior year only the fact that I seemingly have a better resume which didn't pay off considering I haven't gotten anything in terms of job offers yet and I am beginning to feel like companies just randomly choose people for internships. I don't want to sound whiny about not getting an internship, but it doesn't feel good doing this extra amount of work as a student and getting no reward other than a better resume for a student. I don't know what to do as a student and am I wasting my time?"

How easy is it to make friends as someone who doesn’t want to participate in Greek life as someone studying CS at UIUC? (I definitely intend to join a lot of clubs and such)

What is the general personality of the group of people in CS at UIUC? Are most people closed off or are they more outgoing? Are they interested in only CS related things or are they interested in a wide variety of fields? Are they very motivated and work very hard and pursue internships, research, etc as we’ll as do coursework, or is there a high percentage of people who aren’t that motivated?

How are the dorms and dorm life at UIUC? Are there any housing options that are clearly better than others for someone who wants a really good community right off the bat?

What is the stress culture like in CS at UIUC?

8cty68,2,2018-04-17,Changing career from clerical to IT?,severalbricks,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8cty68/changing_career_from_clerical_to_it/,"I currently do temporary clerical work, including document imaging and looking up client information on a proprietary database, for a county government bureau. It’s my first full time job. I’d like to keep working for the government permanently (for the benefits, stability, etc.), but I’d rather be in an IT department in the long run, even if it’s in the private sector. Let me break down my current situation:

WORK ENVIRONMENT: I’ve had to call the help desk a number of times to keep our imaging software running, so over time I’ve taken the opportunity to ask about 5 or 6 techs how they got the jobs they have. One had extensive experience in the private sector. One mentioned getting an AS in computer science, but she had gotten hers in the 1990s, when that degree meant something different than I bet it means now. All mentioned the importance of certifications like the CCNA.

My current job is being phased out at the end of my temp contract due to things like departmental budget constraints, so I’m probably going to end up taking more temp assignments or a permanent clerical job before I have enough certifications under my belt to be competitive for help desk jobs. There is ample downtime where I am now, so I study for my certs between tasks. I have extensively documented my clerical work processes and submitted it to my boss, if only for posterity.

EDUCATION: I have a bachelor’s in psychology, which wound up being a foot in the door to clerical. I sort of wish I could get another bachelor’s, but the universities around me are so impacted that it’s not an option for me. I’m open to the idea of an associate’s degree, and my local community college’s comp sci program has many night and online classes, so scheduling won’t be too much of a hassle, but I fear that I may overextend myself, and that the information I learn may be outdated. This degree, which would take at least a year and a half, would focus on programming with some basics in databases, shell scripting, and systems design/analysis—this school has other paths that focus more on systems administration, but that’s covered pretty extensively by the certs I want to pursue.

INTERVIEWING/APPLICATION STRATEGY: Entirely focused on clerical for now. I’m aware that I may have to take a significant pay cut to break into IT. I cannot afford a full-time unpaid internship. I am willing to volunteer one Saturday or Sunday a week at, say, a non-profit’s IT department—any ideas on how to hit the pavement on that? I’ve had bad luck with outfits like VolunteerMatch. Will that kind of part-time experience be a good use of my time when a lot of government IT jobs ask for full-time experience?

The only reason I’ve been holding off on interviewing for IT positions is that I don’t yet have enough IT-related certs or education to put on my résumé.

CERTIFICATION: I am working on the A+, then the CCNA R&amp;S. I take it that the A+ doesn’t look particularly good by itself, so I plan to pair it with other certs. I am also considering an MCSE, which one of the techs at my workplace mentioned; the type of MCSE I want focuses on Server 2016 because most of my computer knowledge isn’t yet specialized for enterprise machines. I’m also considering the Sec+ down the line, but I’m unsure how much I’d need it for a first job.

I know a lot of companies are moving into the cloud, so I’m hoping some AWS coursework would help make me more competitive in the private sector, but I’m not sure that the government departments I want to work for are as eager to adopt cloud technology.

I know that certs are expensive; I know they can help me get promoted, but how many do I really need for my first IT job?

SELF-EDUCATION: I’m trying to teach myself some Linux, bash, and PowerShell. I have VMs for several distros that were recommended by my textbooks. I’m working on a home lab which, when I know how to do it, will be isolated from the rest of my home network, and will run evaluation versions of some of the software I’ve encountered at work. I also sometimes fiddle with web dev, knowing that it dovetails with databases and that a lot of development is moving to JS.

My question is this: Am I missing anything? Is there anything else I can do to get my foot in the door in IT when I have to spend so much time and energy in clerical? Thanks in advance!"

I am finishing my second year of a four\-year bachelor's degree in computer science with a minor in business in the United States.

I am one semester ahead of schedule, so my original plan was to graduate in winter 2019. Recently my advisor came up with a way for me to graduate almost a full year early by doing this:

|Summer 2018|10 credits \(3 classes\)|
|:-|:-|
|Fall 2018|16 credits \(5 classes \+ senior design\)|
|Spring 2019|18 credits \(6 classes \+ senior design\)|

This plan sounds tempting to me, but I have several reservations:

* Summer courses are expensive. I have a full\-ride scholarship each fall/spring semester as long as I stay full time \(\&gt;= 12 credits\). My scholarship is ineligible for summer, so I'd have to almost totally deplete my savings.
* The additional course load is going to be hard for me to keep on top of. It's not that I'm not up to the challenge, but I lose my scholarship if I end up withdrawing from any course. I also have a 20 hr/week job as an RA I need to keep to affordably go to school. I'm not sure it's worth the risk.
* Most importantly, I don't feel employable! I know a lot can change in a year, but I don't think that having an undergraduate degree from a state school and a few course projects on GitHub will exactly impress any employer. Ideally, I would spend next summer as an intern in the field, as a way to get some practical experience and my foot in the door. I feel that this, in tandem with an involved personal project I'm working on, would help cement my qualifications.

I need to make a decision about this soon, so before I do, what do you think about all this? What else do you think I should factor into my decision?"

I am a beginner and I know this is a big leap but I am willing to take it. This will be my first PC that I have put together.

I am trying to keep it below $1000 since I am only going to be getting money from my internship over the summer, but I will make a decent amount since I will be full-time.

I was curious if there were any parts that I have picked to generally stay away from, or if maybe I can go even cheaper, but that is not a priority. 

I am also wondering if 8GB Ram will be enough for most VR games, or if I should switch to 2x8. 

I typically looked over most of the items that fit my budget and have been reading reviews and doing research for the past week, and have finally come up with this build that I think is ok within my budget. 

It would good to know if others recommend certain parts or if there is any compatibility that I am missing out on. 

Thank you for the read fellas.

8cuwnv,3,2018-04-17,[22M] I don't know what to do with my life,PinkertonCommunist,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8cuwnv/22m_i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/,"Hello everyone,

So, this is my current situation. I'm a third year chemistry student at a top public institution, and recently, I think I hit rock bottom. I have not been doing well academically for the past two years, and for some reason I have never seemed to address this despite all the times I told myself that I would do better next time. Because of this, I feel like I haven't done anything with my degree (i.e research, internships), and the realization of this has led me to feel like a total failure and caused to develop suicidal thoughts.

Now, I think this is where my situation gets complex. I graduated high school in the top 5% of my 520 person class, and like everyone in my group, I was looking forward to college. I had the intention of studying engineering but part of me wanted to be a doctor. So, I think the process was OK except for one important aspect: my SAT and ACT scores were rather low. So, a combination on failing to research how engineering is a capped major at most institutions and not being realistic about my school choices led me to being rejected at all but three schools. In the end, I had to choose between two. One (my current school) was more prestigious but I was going to go in undeclared since all the engineering spots were taken. For the other, I was pre-engineering and had a scholarship. Naturally, I picked the more prestigious school.

So, my interest at the time was biological/genetic engineering and I tried to get into the program, but then eventually I decided against it and decided to major in biochemistry since it was similar and formed synergy with dream of being a doctor. Three years later, I'm struggling and my dream of being a doctor is pretty much dead in the water, and I started to realize that maybe I don't like my major. The only problem is that pretty much all the other majors that I was interested in ( Physics, Biology,Mathematics, Economics, and as I mentioned Engineering) are all locked, meaning you need to pass screening courses before you can try to apply to get in, and to be honest, while I appreciate humanities majors, I don't see myself majoring in them. So, right now I feel trapped in a major that I never really developed much interest in.

Right now, I'm just trying to finish out of responsibility and hoping that I finish well enough for me to pursue more advanced studies in another field, But recently, I've been toying with the idea of dropping out. I don't really know. I think having too many conflicting interests and dreams has put me in this situation. I just don't know who I am anymore.

I just had a candid chat with Aaron about life, love, and how to organize your sales.

Aaron is a sales guru, CEO and full\-time dad. He works 15 hours per week, has 9 kids, 3 dogs, and 40 employees.

Mad or genius? 🤔 I'm not sure, but he's freakin' inspiring.

\-\-\-

Prefer listening? I put links to the recording/podcast in the original post \(link at the bottom\).

\-\-\-

Jeroen: Hey Aaron, it’s great to have you on Founder Coffee!

Aaron: Yeah, I just wish there was some actual coffee as well!

Jeroen: Well, I do have have some coffee right next to me for our chat. What about you?

Aaron: Going a little slow on that, but I’m going to get it right after! I do like it.

Jeroen: So, Aaron, you’re the founder of Predictable Revenue. For those who have not been on this planet for the past few years, what is it all about?

Aaron: Predictable Revenue started as a book actually, which came out in 2011. The book was about how when I worked at Salesforce, way back when it was small and had a couple hundred employees, I created an outbound sales system that helped them almost double their revenue growth.

After few years of leaving Salesforce, I wrote the book and I guess they now call it the Sales Bible of the Silicon Valley now. The book is getting translated in different languages for different markets — Portuguese in Brazil, Mandarin in China and more. We have even had a sequel come out!

Now, I have a company around what the book does. It is basically an outbound success company that helps other companies trade results effectively, for a faster revenue to outbound prospecting.

Jeroen: Actually my wife is a Brazilian and I heard that in Brazil, it’s already huge. It’s a bestseller!

Aaron: Yeah, it’s a big thing in Brazil. They are going crazy for it. So after the US, our second biggest business is in Brazil. There’s a separate unit there altogether and I absolutely love the place.

Jeroen: That makes the two of us! I even spoke to one of the guys at Salesforce, about a month back. He really wants to set up a business around Predictable Revenue because it seems that the kind of selling presented in the book, is really not known in Brazil and you are the ones introducing it.

Aaron: Yeah, most of the world wants to do that. So for example, one of the key ideas is… we’ll get to outbound prospecting, but let’s start something even more fundamental — sales specialization.

In the book, it was the first time that someone came out and said, “you have to specialize your sales people if you want to be able to grow and be successful.”

What this means is that you need to change the way you imagine a typical sales person. For hundreds of years, a salesperson has been doing the prospecting, closing the deals and even handling customer accounts. But with the rise of inside sales and big data, things have started to change in the last 10 years.

In sales, you divide and conquer. You have many different jobs for the sales team, so you hire different skills and make them work together. You have prospectors who do the prospecting. And that’s all that they really do. They generate leads for closers or account executives and sales people who will get customers to sign up. Now that’s all that this section of the team does.

There could also be leads coming in from your inbound marketing campaigns. You could have a separate role for inbound lead responders or junior sales reps. Their job would be to qualify or pre\-qualify and pass the account executive the leads who are most likely to sign up.

Then comes the last type of role in the sales team. This would be after the customer signs up and there’s actually different kind of roles that come into play here — account management, customer success or professional services.

The idea is again to have a team approach to sales with different roles. Working together is the new idea of sales, really. Now most companies around the world, like in Brazil, don’t follow this. The model they still follow is of the sales people doing everything. Now that the market has read the book, they are looking at a sales team in a different way.

I can’t tell you how many notes I have gotten from people who read the book and implemented this in their sales team. They’re like, “I did that. I specialised my sales people and it has doubled my results!”

Jeroen: Doesn’t this then make the actual sales roles a little boring?

Aaron: I would say that for most people, it might be a boring job. But for those in sales already, they are overwhelmed doing five different jobs together. They just end up doing each one of them poorly and it hampers their overall performance.

No one likes to struggle. So when you refocus them and they can do fewer things better, it helps them stay on track and give it their best shot. It gets them closer to being an expert in that area. For instance, if I’m a closer, then I become an expert at closing leads and if I’m a prospector, then I become the expert at prospecting quality leads.

There are several reasons why businesses should follow this new sales model. Now there could of course be exceptions too in this case, where you just have to take one or two calls. In that case, one sales rep can definitely do the task.

But the book primarily talks about B2B sales. In all B2B sales, specialization is the way to go and there are a few reasons I can give for it. First, people just aren’t that good at juggling a bunch of different tasks. Most heads of sales complain about their people not being able to prospect well. Well, it is not because they don’t want to do it. It is simply because they are burdened with way too many jobs. Give them one or two tasks at a time, and then see them perform.

For instance, when you ask your most senior team members to do sales for you. Them making phone calls is like the most expensive of resources you could be setting aside. Not being able to close as many leads, is only going to bring down your company revenue. That’s the first reason why you hire sales reps to take care of this end of the job!

Another reason why this model works, is the sales measurability. When you specialise your team and break them into different jobs, it becomes a lot easier to understand what is working and what is not working. You can see the outbound prospecting, how it is working, how does the closing of leads happen, how are the accounts handled, how an inbound lead is responded to — all as separate events.

When you have your sales people doing everything, all you can see is, “Okay, John is not doing too well.” But you really can’t see why he is struggling!

One of the biggest reasons why the new model works is because it keeps the team happy. When you specialise people, they have a chance at becoming an expert at what they do and that feels good. This also simplifies the hiring, as you’re looking for a good rep to join the team to do a specific task — not a unicorn who can do all the magic all by himself!

Jeroen: Yes, I think employee satisfaction plays a key role in sales success too. You were at Salesforce, in what position were you?

Aaron: Well I started out as the most junior executive at the company — an entry level job of answering the 1–800 line. That was the only job they had in sales. The only person who would work under me, was an intern. Honestly, I wanted to do this job.

I’ve been the CEO of an internet company. We had raised five million dollars in funding. The company ended up failing and one of the reasons was that I as CEO, didn’t understand how to build and manage a sales team — a professional sales team.

I had hired a VP of sales, but I had abdicated my understanding. I didn’t delegate, so when sales weren’t working, I didn’t really know what to do. So I was like, “I have to work in sales to know sales, if I’m going to start another company.” We are better than Salesforce, and the only job they had was the website responder. We now call it market response rep or inbound SDR.

Jeroen: Basically you had a startup and it didn’t work out. That’s when you decided to take the lowest job at Salesforce, where nobody was doing sales and you built it into a very successful sales system.

Aaron: Close. Yes, I wanted to take a job there to learn sales. The only job they had was that a junior one. So I was like, “Whatever. I don’t have any ego about it, I just want to learn.”

Salesforce was very successful already. But there was something that Salesforce wasn’t doing too well yet. They had tons of leads coming in, like thousands a month for small business customers. They’d just built an enterprise product, hired and spent a ton of money on experienced field enterprise sales. Despite all the inbound lead generation and Marc Benioff — who’s brilliant at public relations, we weren’t getting enough enterprise or mid\-market leads. It just wasn’t penetrating.

Instead of waiting for a solution, what I did was have a little chat with myself. “I see the problem. We’re getting leads but not enough sales. We have hired the most experienced sales people out there and they are helping bridge relationships with customers, but they’re not bringing anything in and they’re struggling.”

So I decided to take a crack at creating an outbound prospecting process — a simple, yet effective way to prospect for appointments.

I had never done prospecting before, but I could tell that we weren’t doing it very well. I was like, “I don’t know how this works but I know what we are doing, is just crap.” I read a bunch of books and then tried some things. I really didn’t like any of it. But ultimately, this is where I wrote in the Predictable Revenue book, that I started using email prospecting more than phone.

Get them to respond back, get appointments and it created a whole system — accounting management system, email metrics, everything. The idea was to generate as many appointments as we needed at these medium and large scale companies to fill our sales pipeline with sales people. That was the outbound system we created from scratch at Salesforce and wrote a lot about in detail in the Predictable Revenue book. Now we help companies build their own teams to do this too.

Jeroen: You created this whole system at Salesforce; at what point did you figure, “I’m going to make a book. I’m going to start a consultancy?”

Aaron: Here, not to digress too much, but I have a big family now. I have nine kids, three dogs and then we got to foster some other kids as well. I actually had zero kids. I only got married seven years ago. What’s interesting is, I left Salesforce in 2006. I spent a few years thinking, “I don’t want to do sales consulting. I don’t want to do that.” I did it enough to sort of get by while I worked on some other projects.

What ended up happening was I knew I wanted to do a book. I actually had a book offer before, but it didn’t feel right at that moment. In 2011, I got married and my wife had a couple of kids from her prior marriage, and she got pregnant right away. So that year, we went from zero to three kids or two kids plus one on the way, and I still remember this moment where before that, I didn’t really have to make a lot of money as a single guy. And I never really had expensive tastes.

I didn’t have to make a lot but I remember this moment was like, “I have a family coming.” I’m like, “Oh shit, I need to make more money in a more regular way to support my family.”

We also needed to move to a bigger apartment, get more health insurance. Okay, that really lit a fire in my eyes to publish the book and to start doing more focused consulting around it. That was 2011 and in four years, I grew my own income almost 10 times, actually 11 times. From 70 something thousand a year to more than 700 to 800 a year. All from the book, “Predictable Revenue” and its sequel, “From Impossible To Inevitable”.

The point is, what I always look at is how do you make growth a system?

At regular sales jobs, you’re always like, “I’m not sure if I’ll make out my number this month or this quarter.” I didn’t like that uncertainty. I tried to make it predictable.

Ironically, my income today isn’t that predictable month to month. There’s other reasons for that but how do you make growth more of a system? How do you look at companies who have something and they want to grow, why do some grow and why do some struggle?

That’s really what I am thinking in my books and what I’m interested in, is to find out how to do few things but do them well. There’s always a thousand things that you could do better or maybe a million. We all have that. But if you can do only one or two, or say three things this year, what would those be? This is what interests me the most.

Jeroen: If you want to make your revenue predictable, have you ever thought about creating a subscription based model around your services?

Aaron: Again, I sort of have a unique situation where I can only work 15 hours a week. It used to be 25 but it’s even less because again, the family’s gotten so big. I’m in Los Angeles, so I roughly need to make something like $60,000 a month.

How do I explain? I would love to have a recurring model, but it just hasn’t been practical yet.

To do a recurring model, it’s like you have to choose your business and up until this point, consulting and services, that’s what we could offer. That’s what gets outsourced the most. But now we have a team and a business. I think it’s ready to move towards what we are calling the Predictable University.

Jeroen: How many are you now, in the Predictable Revenue team?

Aaron: Well, in the Predictable Revenue company, there’s about 25 or 30 team members. Then there’s another half dozen. We have a small team in Brazil as well. It’s small but we’ve done a lot to lay the groundwork for the next few years.

The way I think about it is and there’s a lot of people who are listening, who feel this way, which is sometimes you are in the fast growth stage but sometimes it plateaus — whether it’s a business or you as a person. You can be working on things to restart growth. It might be redoing a product or redoing your team. It might be redoing your personal life in some way. You often times are planting the seeds to grow, but you may not see the results for quite some time.

For example, my income has been a straight graph in the last two or three years. I am investing in a future — it could be writing another book, creating a product or simply growing my team — but it’s something that I believe in. As long as you feel like you’re doing the right thing, it is going to work.

Jeroen: If you are trying to limit the amount of time you spend on the business, how do you manage the fact that it’s so linked to your name as well?

Aaron: I have a bunch of great partners and a great team. There’s no way I’ll have people sign up who wouldn’t work with me on something ‘together’.

I’m more of an author at heart. We’re looking at updating the Predictable Revenue book in the next year or so. There’s a book I did with Jason Lemkin of SaaStr, called ‘From Impossible To Inevitable’. I’ve heard a lot of people say it’s the best book they’ve ever read.

For me the way I do it is, I want to build a reputation and a brand, and a set of ideas that really connect with people. But then, I would also want a team around it. I’m okay working more slowly in some ways, than try to work really fast all the time. I’m okay investing in things that will take a year or three years to pay off because I know they will.

I can say it’s taken us a few years to get to this point where I work like 15 hours a week. I really can’t work more between watching kids at home and my wife is gone a lot. She’s doing a lot of singing. I’m managing all the kids a lot of the time and supporting the family. I found a way to do it. It’s not always easy, just like parenting is not easy but it works.

Jeroen: Got it. Have you always known that you wanted to do something in sales or is this something that only grew on you after your startup failed?

Aaron: I never knew I wanted to do sales. I don’t think that I ever imagined to be a salesperson as a kid.

Jeroen: What did you want to be?

Aaron: A pilot or an astronaut. Then during college, I was looking at computer programming and then my interest shifted to civil engineering. I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I did civil engineering at Stanford and then I did investment banking for a couple of years. Simply because I was like, “That’d be interesting,” and it was for a while, then it got really boring.

Then I went into software. At some point there, I realized I wanted to be an entrepreneur. No one ever asked me what I wanted to do, until I had to complete an application for the Stanford Business School. Till 26, I never really thought about an answer in a very focused way.

I remember specifically filling out that Stanford Business School application, “What do you want to do with your life?” I was like, “Oh well, I want to be an entrepreneur.” That led me to starting a company, which then led me to a company failing and then I was like “I really need to know sales”.

Jeroen: Did you have one startup before Salesforce or multiple?

Aaron: One internet startup. I’d done some other small businesses at college; like a painting company. In high school, I created and sold fake IDs, so I was a forger. In the United States, to buy alcohol you have to be 21. A couple of those things when I was younger. But the first startup would be the internet one, before starting work at Salesforce.

Jeroen: You never got caught as a forger?

Aaron: No. It was partly a way to make a little money, partly a way to be able to buy alcohol, and partly a way to make friends because I won’t say I was anti\-social, I was just shy in high school. I had trouble making friends, but I was good with computers.

Jeroen: Why do you think you were into startups? Why did you want to be an entrepreneur?

Aaron: My father was an entrepreneur. So I guess that played a big part. If anyone listening to me right now, is in their 50s, or maybe 40s, they might have heard of Ross Systems. In the United States, it was a big financial budgeting software company. It’s actually still around.

It was sold to a Chinese company. It has been bought and sold a few times, but he started that when I was born basically. That’s where I got my original inspiration and then after doing it for a while, I was like I enjoy it.

I got a lot out of Salesforce, in terms of learning. It was a struggle though because of working for three months out of the year, I’d be inspired just to create something and then nine months I’d be plotting along in Salesforce. I learned a lot about politics and internal working. It was a great way to get paid to learn.

I think any job if you look at it, can be a great way to get paid to learn. So don’t complain about your job, be like, “Wow, you have an opportunity here.” I was glad to go back out on my own after Salesforce and start doing my own thing.

Jeroen: Do you still feel like you are getting paid to learn by your own company then?

Aaron: I try to. There are periods where I can feel that way when there’s something new. But then there are definitely times when it’s more of a grind. That’s partly because of the limited time and energy.

Even last night, I slept a few hours but the baby was sick and so even today, I just kind of feel like crap, like physically, I feel like crap. No matter how much you love your job — and I love my business — in terms of kids, love has a different definition now. I wouldn’t say I love my job. I love my kids, which is just beyond describing. My business is great but there’s always days where it’s better than others and I don’t think that ever changes. I think when I was young and I’d see the people like, “If I just had a job I loved, that I could love everyday.” You may even have something you love, but some days it sucks.

You can’t avoid that in life unless you sit on the sidelines and do nothing. It’s better to be out there like an entrepreneur, whether it’s in business or in life. Take the risk of doing something new, fall flat on your face a few times and then learn to get up. Trust me, it is better to getting stagnated and sticking to one thing just because it’s comfortable.

Jeroen: What is it that you mostly do nowadays?

Aaron: I am mostly consulting. There are two main things in our business: one is outsourcing for companies who aren’t ready to do their own prospecting. Most in the US. The other is what me and my team do, consult with companies on how they can build their own outbound prospecting team for faster growth.

Part of that is me working with some clients myself. And a part of it, is helping companies go through the learning system of how to hire the right sales teams, how to prospect, what metrics to measure, how to configure Salesforce and other things. That’s really what I spend my time on.

Jeroen: Building Predictable Revenue, what is it that keeps you up at night lately?

Aaron: Lately, there’s not much.

Probably it’s just how to get things done. When you say I’ve got some number of hours and have some go to clients… It’s a little scary. I might have three or four hours a week of like real investment time, to improve work in the business, so I work on the business.

It’s like how to get more time to improve our internal systems — how we manage and track how our clients are doing, primarily. Then comes being able to coach my team and spend more time with them.

Jeroen: So currently it’s the process and coaching?

Aaron: Process and coaching, yes.

If our team is in place and we have our tools, things will go great. But if we miss someone, if there’s no communication, we will definitely struggle in some way. The team communication is so important.

Also, I live in LA alone and almost everybody else is in Vancouver. There’s like 20 something people in Vancouver and I’m sort of on my own here in LA. That just creates a little extra challenges around team communication — especially on what’s happening. So team communication and our progress, is what keeps me up. Sometimes, I feel I am not at the top of things as much as I’d like to be.

Jeroen: How does that work exactly? Are you like the face on the screen that is always there in the meetings or?

Aaron: I try to attend as many meetings as I can. But there are so many that it becomes difficult. There are a lot of people in our company, that I haven’t even met.

I try to attend our sales meetings, where the whole team groups. Also, when I go onsite with customers, I make it a point to bring along one or two new people from the team. In fact, I’m actually going to China next week. We have a fast growing SaaS company in China that has hired us to help them with outbound prospecting and improving inbound lead generation and churn reduction.

I’m going to take two people from my team. It’s like their training period. They are not coming to help me out; they are coming so that they can see what it’s like to be onsite with the client and see me work with them.

Jeroen: What do you think are the main skills that you as a founder bring to your business? Is it like the coaching aspect that you are referring to or something else?

Aaron: One of them is like a deep expertise in this area of outbound prospecting and specifically building teams to do it.

We’re into the outsourcing business, which I don’t have much experience in. So the co\-CEO takes care of it. We work together in these areas because they are very complimentary.

I think my role is more around defining what we’re going to do in the long term. What are we doing in the next few days, weeks, months or 5 to 10 years? My co\-founder, co\-CEO, is good at more of the 3–12 months planning on how to run the company.

There’s lots of things I’m not good at, but I think it’s more important for the things I focus on. I try and be really good at those things only. With that whole book, it’s basically focusing on your strengths and not your weaknesses.

Jeroen: What are these things that give you energy, these strengths?

Aaron: Well let’s talk about energy for a minute because with the nine kids, eight live at home and there’s some young ones. There’s a baby who’s 1, there’s an almost baby who’s 2. Most of the other kids are relatively self sufficient, but … do you have kids?

Jeroen: No, not yet.

Aaron: Well, when they are under 1 or 2, it’s a lot of physical work holding them. I mean it’s intense. Driving the other kids around, it’s just a lot to do. So we do have a nanny that comes in, but the bottom line is, I’m pretty much always tired and have been for years.

There’s never enough sleep, even if I have time at night. I mostly use that time to write a blog post or catch up with work. What I found is, before I had kids, I would get inspired and write. After babies and kids, especially the last few years, I rarely get inspired anymore, because I’m just always tired.

What happens is, how does it work? I’m up from 06:00–06:30 in the morning to late at night. And then come the deadlines. That’s where I get my energy! I know I can’t escape deadlines. It’s just something that I absolutely have to do — including publishing a book publishing deadline, a conference deadline, a newsletter, …

That’s where for a while, I’ve really relied on extrinsic motivation or that outside motivation, where I have to get things done, regardless of whether I’m tired or not inspired — because, I have to. Think of it as ‘forcing functions’. This is in the “From Impossible …” book!

But think about it, if you want to get into shape, what works better? Do you sign up for a gym, or do you sign up to do a marathon and tell all your friends you are going to do it?

Jeroen: The marathon. I have even done that a couple of times. The problem with marathons is I tend to overtrain and then that doesn’t work either.

Aaron: Yeah, you got to know yourself at some point. I don’t want to say weaknesses, but things we know we have to do or we shouldn’t do but we do them anyway. That is where I get the energy from because I may not have the time to rest for another year or two, until we don’t have any babies who are under like 2.

Jeroen: The way you deal with it, is chasing deadlines basically?

Aaron: Yes, that’s how it works for me.

Kids have to be at school at a certain time, my wife leaves at a certain time for her music classes, that’s a lot of time being very defined.

But then there is one thing that I haven’t been able to do well — putting time aside for myself. Like I haven’t worked out regularly in a while, although I do move around all day. To do even the smallest of things, I have to put it on my calendar. If it’s not on the calendar, it just doesn’t happen. I have to like block it out ahead of time!

Jeroen: You very consciously decide: “this is family time, this is me time, this is business time” and then there’s these deadlines that keep you awake?

Aaron: Yeah. I have my routines, so the days and the weeks are usual. But it’s the calendar that drives a lot of this — even daily activities like the routines around school, business or personal deadlines for tasks.

Jeroen: What is your long term goal with Predictable Revenue. What do you want to achieve?

Aaron: We want to be the number one sales brand in the world. We want it to be a brand that helps inspire people to learn how to make more money in ways that feel good. Because sales, I think deservedly so, leaves a bad taste in many people’s mouths.

Even as a life skill, if you don’t know how to sell yourself an idea or product, you are not going to accomplish anything in life really. Whether you are trying to start a non\-profit, get a promotion, get a job or start a company. It’s a life skill!

Our other goal is to create a culture in our own company that’s really very innovative and I would say, humanistic. People get paid to learn. We want to groom the future entrepreneurs and inspire people to do their best.

Jeroen: When I asked the question you were able to answer pretty quickly. Is it a mission statement you have written down somewhere?

Aaron: Yes, we’ve talked about it. We haven’t written it down some place but we’ve talked about it internally. Apart from the two mission statements, we also have one more goal that keeps it all going — pushing people to do more than they think they can.

Jeroen: Cool. Slowly wrapping up… What’s the latest good book you’ve read and why did you choose to read it?

Aaron: Well, what’s funny is that I haven’t read any business books lately.

Jeroen: Any other books is fine as well.

Aaron: My wife and I are really into reading Shakespeare and the theories that Shakespeare didn’t write.

All the plays attributed to Shakespeare and a woman named Emilia Bassano, who we now believe just from reading books, is the most likely person who wrote, or who was the leading author because there’s a lot of collaborations on the plays.

Whether she collaborated with Shakespeare or not, who knows.

Jeroen: Why did you choose to read these books?

Aaron: My wife got me into it. She’s really obsessed with it! If you haven’t even heard of this already, the fact that Shakespeare may not be the author of his plays. It’s called “Shakespeare’s Dark Lady”. There’s also a site called The Shakespeare Authorship Trust, that you need to check out.

They list out why people think Shakespeare didn’t write the plays. I don’t know, it’s just interesting to see the theories. It’s just like a Sherlock Holmes puzzle to circle back and piece through like what really happened and what you believe. That’s been our obsession lately.

Jeroen: That’s funny. Actually, the last book I’ve read was when we were in Brazil over New Years and bought this huge collection of all the Sherlock Holmes stories and I’m now in I think 60&amp;#37;.

Aaron: Yeah, you picked some great ones.

Jeroen: Pretty nice.

Aaron: Yes, do you speak Portuguese or did you pick it up in English?

Jeroen: No, I pick it up in English. I’m studying Portuguese and it’s going pretty well but I’m not good enough to read Sherlock Holmes in Portuguese. That would be crazy.

Aaron: I love Sherlock Holmes. I have one of those compilations some place. You can never go wrong. I heard he was the character that most movies were made out of.

Jeroen: I really love the one with Cumberbatch.

Aaron: Yes, that’s a great one.

Jeroen: Anyhow, last question. Is there anything you wish that you’d have known when you started out?

Aaron: I mean… how much time do you have?

If there’s one thing I’d like to point out, is what a positive effect your real friends and family can have on your growth.

A lot of people think that having a family while starting out is a burden or a distraction. It doesn’t really need to be. It can actually be a huge help and support, and the motivation you need to keep going and be more successful than you could be on your own. I really want people to start appreciating those they have around them.

Jeroen: I fully agree with you there. Well, thank you for the super open conversation and thank you for being on Founder Coffee.

Aaron: Thank you for having me, Jeroen.

If this post turns out to become a very long one I'm gonna go ahead and apologize right now. Frankly I just needed to be able to pour out my thoughts and concerns and reach out to anyone who might be able to provide some useful insight into how to traverse the bumpy road that is getting your foot into the gaming industry as a whole. 

At the moment I'm 20 years of age yet I feel like I'm severely behind when it comes to getting my life together and finding out what I really want to pursue as a career for the rest of my life (which I'm beginning to realize, that not that many people find out what they want to do when they are 20 years old, which is reassuring). 

I know for a fact that my biggest passion lies within the gaming community as a whole and watching it thrive and evolve as the technology and people within it continue to do so. However, I'm not stupid enough to not realize that passion alone doesn't net you many jobs nowadays, especially when it comes to developing games and working as a team. My main struggle is that where I live in Florida, there isn't much of a support group that I can fall back on when it comes to resources for potential gaming careers and pathways into the industry. There is also a severe lack of local indie developers that I could even contact nearby for additional insight (and even internships down the road), and the closest major company near my city is EA Tiburon down in Orlando. 

From the way I see it the only option I really have at the moment is just to do what I can do while I am at home or when I'm not at my university to really delve deep into a specific discipline of the gaming business (Programming, Art, Design, etc.) and devote time into truly getting a grasp of it and discovering if a career in gaming would really be a fit for me. 

I feel like I have so many questions that I can ask anyone out there who is in this industry and went through that struggle to make it to where they are, but I don't want to make this longer than it already is. I'm just looking for a push in the right direction when it comes to how I should be researching and studying the more specific fields such as programming, game design, and even game production as I'm currently majoring in Business and so that would be one of the few options for me should I stick with my degree (I am definitely more interested in the programming and design aspects though.) 

I know there are a lot of people that ask questions like this every day but any kind of advice is genuinely appreciated from me. 
Thanks :)

This is my last one (out of three), and I just started on Monday.  Now the night before it took me 4 goddamn hours to fall asleep (despite taking zzzquil, and side note if you take zzzquil and don't fall asleep you start tripping in a really weird and creepy way), so I only got 4 hours of sleep for my first day of work.  The co-op is in the electrical engineering field so my first day learning about one of their most current designs for a product and familiarizing myself with all the theory of the it, which was extremely hard considering I was half awake.  Whatever, made it through the first day, lay down to bed at 9pm (I was waking up at 6:30am) to give me plenty of time to fall asleep and still get a night's rest.  Well what do you know I'm laying there as it's 3am and I'm still not asleep.  So I decided I would miss my second day because I was probably not getting any sleep and I would go see my doctor because I've had sporadic insomnia issues before but recently it's become much more frequent.  I missed my second day because I didn't want to go into work and make a fool of myself by being brain dead and possibly even falling asleep.  I emailed my boss and told him that I wasn't feeling well and that I was seeing my doctor (which is true) and that I apologize because I know it's bad timing.  I reassured him that I am committed to this job and good attendance (which I am) and that this will not be a regular occurrence.  Should I talk to him first thing in the morning and kind of restate what I said in the email?  If he presses the issue should I tell him about the insomnia?  How big of a deal is this?    "

I'm in undergrad right now in computer engineering at McGill. A lot of the software courses I take are in the ecse department (electrical, computer, software engineering) (eg operating systems, computer architecture, intro to software engineering). I only get two comp sci courses which are basic data structures and algorithms courses. I got an A in the first course but in the second course when we started algorithm design, I really didn't understand how to write a test for this kind of thing and did badly on the first midterm which was supposed to be easy, while the other two were brutal. I'm going into the final with something like a B- or a B. I don't think I can do well enough on the final to get an A in this course, I'm aiming for an A-. I got an A in the introduction to computer science course but I feel like this is a bad indicator about my capacities in computer science. I expect an A in a graduate level course in machine learning, but the average will be high anyways because the course is relatively easy. 

My GPA is only about 3.5 and I want to get into a good Canadian University graduate program in computer science related to AI/Machine Learning which is a relatively competitive field within  computer science. My favourite choices are UBC, McGill, Waterloo, and UoT as a stretch and University of Montreal possibly.

Operating systems and the tech comp I want to take, AI which is a comp sci course will only be able to be taken in my last year of school so it won't show up on my transcript. 

I have one 8 month internship and I'm doing a 4 month internship this summer in industry. I have four semesters left in my undergrad and I plan on trying my best to find someway to do research the next summer, although most of my opportunities are research in ECSE and might be geared towards some type of application development in my school. I also have my senior project left to try and attain a good letter of recommendation.

Should I work for a year and apply for graduate school after I attain my full transcript if I can get good grades in my computer science courses? Possibly work as a research assistant somewhere?

I'm really anxious about getting into a good research masters with funding. I appreciate all and any advice. 

Thanks for reading,

I currently have secured funding and have been accepted into a decently respectable Grad program for a Master's in CS. I also have a decently respectable, much more lucrative internship coming up this summer that I'm hoping I can wiggle into a full time job (summer between undergrad and grad).

I applied to the internship telling them that I had applied/been accepted to grad school and my plans - but do you think a company would be interested in hiring me immediately after the summer, basically changing the plans I originally told them? Would they be open to the idea if I explained that I was fully prepared for my MS but would rather just stay with the company full time?

I'm really torn between full time and higher education, but I think if the company is interested in letting me just work full time I'd be able to learn what I needed/have the money I need to support myself right now and live in less squalor - I'd probably do that. I'm also worried that even if they hired me, the soonest the could get me back and working is like 2 months after the internship. 

Thanks for your time, any advice is very much appreciated."
8cxl65,6,2018-04-17,Enrolling in University as an Adult?,Cuttingishard321,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/8cxl65/enrolling_in_university_as_an_adult/,"Hello, has anyone here enrolled into University as an adult and could share their experience?

I am 22 and I live in Ontario and want to get a university degree either in Software or Computer engineering or Business Administration(specializing in Accounting or Finance). These seem like the best options and are also interesting to me. I would not want to study anything else.

I want to do this now for several reasons. 
A significant one is that with the changes to OSAP it appears that it would be very affordable. 

The other main reason is that it seems like a University degree is necessary to even be looked at when applying in many companies, and beyond that to be considered for progression within the company. This seems important because it appears much of the Canadian workforce has a post-secondary education and unless this changes it will only get harder to compete  with others. Even working a job unrelated to your major it seems easy to leverage it for higher pay.

However I am concerned with how employers will look at someone who would graduate at 26-27. Would they not prefer a 21-year old fresh graduate instead of assuming you're some sort of fuckup for graduating so late? I intend to focus a lot on getting a good co-op position or internship and lots of networking as I heard this is as important if not more important than the degree itself.

Has anyone here gone to University very late and still managed to secure a good job? Is it a reasonable expectation or are you treated essentially as a second-class plebeian?

My main concern with doing a 12-16 month internship is how long it is and how much I'll be getting paid. I get the impression that companies who hire us for that long are really just looking for cheap labour. There's also a chance that the company/manager/environment isn't great, which is also a fair consideration given how long it'll be. What do you guys think?

I just had a candid chat with Aaron about life, love, and how to organize your sales.

Aaron is a sales guru, CEO and full\-time dad. He works 15 hours per week, has 9 kids, 3 dogs, and 40 employees.

Mad or genius? 🤔 I'm not sure, but he's freakin' inspiring.

\-\-\-

Prefer listening? I put links to the recording/podcast in the original post \(link at the bottom\).

\-\-\-

Jeroen: Hey Aaron, it’s great to have you on Founder Coffee!

Aaron: Yeah, I just wish there was some actual coffee as well!

Jeroen: Well, I do have have some coffee right next to me for our chat. What about you?

Aaron: Going a little slow on that, but I’m going to get it right after! I do like it.

Jeroen: So, Aaron, you’re the founder of Predictable Revenue. For those who have not been on this planet for the past few years, what is it all about?

Aaron: Predictable Revenue started as a book actually, which came out in 2011. The book was about how when I worked at Salesforce, way back when it was small and had a couple hundred employees, I created an outbound sales system that helped them almost double their revenue growth.

After few years of leaving Salesforce, I wrote the book and I guess they now call it the Sales Bible of the Silicon Valley now. The book is getting translated in different languages for different markets — Portuguese in Brazil, Mandarin in China and more. We have even had a sequel come out!

Now, I have a company around what the book does. It is basically an outbound success company that helps other companies trade results effectively, for a faster revenue to outbound prospecting.

Jeroen: Actually my wife is a Brazilian and I heard that in Brazil, it’s already huge. It’s a bestseller!

Aaron: Yeah, it’s a big thing in Brazil. They are going crazy for it. So after the US, our second biggest business is in Brazil. There’s a separate unit there altogether and I absolutely love the place.

Jeroen: That makes the two of us! I even spoke to one of the guys at Salesforce, about a month back. He really wants to set up a business around Predictable Revenue because it seems that the kind of selling presented in the book, is really not known in Brazil and you are the ones introducing it.

Aaron: Yeah, most of the world wants to do that. So for example, one of the key ideas is… we’ll get to outbound prospecting, but let’s start something even more fundamental — sales specialization.

In the book, it was the first time that someone came out and said, “you have to specialize your sales people if you want to be able to grow and be successful.”

What this means is that you need to change the way you imagine a typical sales person. For hundreds of years, a salesperson has been doing the prospecting, closing the deals and even handling customer accounts. But with the rise of inside sales and big data, things have started to change in the last 10 years.

In sales, you divide and conquer. You have many different jobs for the sales team, so you hire different skills and make them work together. You have prospectors who do the prospecting. And that’s all that they really do. They generate leads for closers or account executives and sales people who will get customers to sign up. Now that’s all that this section of the team does.

There could also be leads coming in from your inbound marketing campaigns. You could have a separate role for inbound lead responders or junior sales reps. Their job would be to qualify or pre\-qualify and pass the account executive the leads who are most likely to sign up.

Then comes the last type of role in the sales team. This would be after the customer signs up and there’s actually different kind of roles that come into play here — account management, customer success or professional services.

The idea is again to have a team approach to sales with different roles. Working together is the new idea of sales, really. Now most companies around the world, like in Brazil, don’t follow this. The model they still follow is of the sales people doing everything. Now that the market has read the book, they are looking at a sales team in a different way.

I can’t tell you how many notes I have gotten from people who read the book and implemented this in their sales team. They’re like, “I did that. I specialised my sales people and it has doubled my results!”

Jeroen: Doesn’t this then make the actual sales roles a little boring?

Aaron: I would say that for most people, it might be a boring job. But for those in sales already, they are overwhelmed doing five different jobs together. They just end up doing each one of them poorly and it hampers their overall performance.

No one likes to struggle. So when you refocus them and they can do fewer things better, it helps them stay on track and give it their best shot. It gets them closer to being an expert in that area. For instance, if I’m a closer, then I become an expert at closing leads and if I’m a prospector, then I become the expert at prospecting quality leads.

There are several reasons why businesses should follow this new sales model. Now there could of course be exceptions too in this case, where you just have to take one or two calls. In that case, one sales rep can definitely do the task.

But the book primarily talks about B2B sales. In all B2B sales, specialization is the way to go and there are a few reasons I can give for it. First, people just aren’t that good at juggling a bunch of different tasks. Most heads of sales complain about their people not being able to prospect well. Well, it is not because they don’t want to do it. It is simply because they are burdened with way too many jobs. Give them one or two tasks at a time, and then see them perform.

For instance, when you ask your most senior team members to do sales for you. Them making phone calls is like the most expensive of resources you could be setting aside. Not being able to close as many leads, is only going to bring down your company revenue. That’s the first reason why you hire sales reps to take care of this end of the job!

Another reason why this model works, is the sales measurability. When you specialise your team and break them into different jobs, it becomes a lot easier to understand what is working and what is not working. You can see the outbound prospecting, how it is working, how does the closing of leads happen, how are the accounts handled, how an inbound lead is responded to — all as separate events.

When you have your sales people doing everything, all you can see is, “Okay, John is not doing too well.” But you really can’t see why he is struggling!

One of the biggest reasons why the new model works is because it keeps the team happy. When you specialise people, they have a chance at becoming an expert at what they do and that feels good. This also simplifies the hiring, as you’re looking for a good rep to join the team to do a specific task — not a unicorn who can do all the magic all by himself!

Jeroen: Yes, I think employee satisfaction plays a key role in sales success too. You were at Salesforce, in what position were you?

Aaron: Well I started out as the most junior executive at the company — an entry level job of answering the 1–800 line. That was the only job they had in sales. The only person who would work under me, was an intern. Honestly, I wanted to do this job.

I’ve been the CEO of an internet company. We had raised five million dollars in funding. The company ended up failing and one of the reasons was that I as CEO, didn’t understand how to build and manage a sales team — a professional sales team.

I had hired a VP of sales, but I had abdicated my understanding. I didn’t delegate, so when sales weren’t working, I didn’t really know what to do. So I was like, “I have to work in sales to know sales, if I’m going to start another company.” We are better than Salesforce, and the only job they had was the website responder. We now call it market response rep or inbound SDR.

Jeroen: Basically you had a startup and it didn’t work out. That’s when you decided to take the lowest job at Salesforce, where nobody was doing sales and you built it into a very successful sales system.

Aaron: Close. Yes, I wanted to take a job there to learn sales. The only job they had was that a junior one. So I was like, “Whatever. I don’t have any ego about it, I just want to learn.”

Salesforce was very successful already. But there was something that Salesforce wasn’t doing too well yet. They had tons of leads coming in, like thousands a month for small business customers. They’d just built an enterprise product, hired and spent a ton of money on experienced field enterprise sales. Despite all the inbound lead generation and Marc Benioff — who’s brilliant at public relations, we weren’t getting enough enterprise or mid\-market leads. It just wasn’t penetrating.

Instead of waiting for a solution, what I did was have a little chat with myself. “I see the problem. We’re getting leads but not enough sales. We have hired the most experienced sales people out there and they are helping bridge relationships with customers, but they’re not bringing anything in and they’re struggling.”

So I decided to take a crack at creating an outbound prospecting process — a simple, yet effective way to prospect for appointments.

I had never done prospecting before, but I could tell that we weren’t doing it very well. I was like, “I don’t know how this works but I know what we are doing, is just crap.” I read a bunch of books and then tried some things. I really didn’t like any of it. But ultimately, this is where I wrote in the Predictable Revenue book, that I started using email prospecting more than phone.

Get them to respond back, get appointments and it created a whole system — accounting management system, email metrics, everything. The idea was to generate as many appointments as we needed at these medium and large scale companies to fill our sales pipeline with sales people. That was the outbound system we created from scratch at Salesforce and wrote a lot about in detail in the Predictable Revenue book. Now we help companies build their own teams to do this too.

Jeroen: You created this whole system at Salesforce; at what point did you figure, “I’m going to make a book. I’m going to start a consultancy?”

Aaron: Here, not to digress too much, but I have a big family now. I have nine kids, three dogs and then we got to foster some other kids as well. I actually had zero kids. I only got married seven years ago. What’s interesting is, I left Salesforce in 2006. I spent a few years thinking, “I don’t want to do sales consulting. I don’t want to do that.” I did it enough to sort of get by while I worked on some other projects.

What ended up happening was I knew I wanted to do a book. I actually had a book offer before, but it didn’t feel right at that moment. In 2011, I got married and my wife had a couple of kids from her prior marriage, and she got pregnant right away. So that year, we went from zero to three kids or two kids plus one on the way, and I still remember this moment where before that, I didn’t really have to make a lot of money as a single guy. And I never really had expensive tastes.

I didn’t have to make a lot but I remember this moment was like, “I have a family coming.” I’m like, “Oh shit, I need to make more money in a more regular way to support my family.”

We also needed to move to a bigger apartment, get more health insurance. Okay, that really lit a fire in my eyes to publish the book and to start doing more focused consulting around it. That was 2011 and in four years, I grew my own income almost 10 times, actually 11 times. From 70 something thousand a year to more than 700 to 800 a year. All from the book, “Predictable Revenue” and its sequel, “From Impossible To Inevitable”.

The point is, what I always look at is how do you make growth a system?

At regular sales jobs, you’re always like, “I’m not sure if I’ll make out my number this month or this quarter.” I didn’t like that uncertainty. I tried to make it predictable.

Ironically, my income today isn’t that predictable month to month. There’s other reasons for that but how do you make growth more of a system? How do you look at companies who have something and they want to grow, why do some grow and why do some struggle?

That’s really what I am thinking in my books and what I’m interested in, is to find out how to do few things but do them well. There’s always a thousand things that you could do better or maybe a million. We all have that. But if you can do only one or two, or say three things this year, what would those be? This is what interests me the most.

Jeroen: If you want to make your revenue predictable, have you ever thought about creating a subscription based model around your services?

Aaron: Again, I sort of have a unique situation where I can only work 15 hours a week. It used to be 25 but it’s even less because again, the family’s gotten so big. I’m in Los Angeles, so I roughly need to make something like $60,000 a month.

How do I explain? I would love to have a recurring model, but it just hasn’t been practical yet.

To do a recurring model, it’s like you have to choose your business and up until this point, consulting and services, that’s what we could offer. That’s what gets outsourced the most. But now we have a team and a business. I think it’s ready to move towards what we are calling the Predictable University.

Jeroen: How many are you now, in the Predictable Revenue team?

Aaron: Well, in the Predictable Revenue company, there’s about 25 or 30 team members. Then there’s another half dozen. We have a small team in Brazil as well. It’s small but we’ve done a lot to lay the groundwork for the next few years.

The way I think about it is and there’s a lot of people who are listening, who feel this way, which is sometimes you are in the fast growth stage but sometimes it plateaus — whether it’s a business or you as a person. You can be working on things to restart growth. It might be redoing a product or redoing your team. It might be redoing your personal life in some way. You often times are planting the seeds to grow, but you may not see the results for quite some time.

For example, my income has been a straight graph in the last two or three years. I am investing in a future — it could be writing another book, creating a product or simply growing my team — but it’s something that I believe in. As long as you feel like you’re doing the right thing, it is going to work.

Jeroen: If you are trying to limit the amount of time you spend on the business, how do you manage the fact that it’s so linked to your name as well?

Aaron: I have a bunch of great partners and a great team. There’s no way I’ll have people sign up who wouldn’t work with me on something ‘together’.

I’m more of an author at heart. We’re looking at updating the Predictable Revenue book in the next year or so. There’s a book I did with Jason Lemkin of SaaStr, called ‘From Impossible To Inevitable’. I’ve heard a lot of people say it’s the best book they’ve ever read.

For me the way I do it is, I want to build a reputation and a brand, and a set of ideas that really connect with people. But then, I would also want a team around it. I’m okay working more slowly in some ways, than try to work really fast all the time. I’m okay investing in things that will take a year or three years to pay off because I know they will.

I can say it’s taken us a few years to get to this point where I work like 15 hours a week. I really can’t work more between watching kids at home and my wife is gone a lot. She’s doing a lot of singing. I’m managing all the kids a lot of the time and supporting the family. I found a way to do it. It’s not always easy, just like parenting is not easy but it works.

Jeroen: Got it. Have you always known that you wanted to do something in sales or is this something that only grew on you after your startup failed?

Aaron: I never knew I wanted to do sales. I don’t think that I ever imagined to be a salesperson as a kid.

Jeroen: What did you want to be?

Aaron: A pilot or an astronaut. Then during college, I was looking at computer programming and then my interest shifted to civil engineering. I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I did civil engineering at Stanford and then I did investment banking for a couple of years. Simply because I was like, “That’d be interesting,” and it was for a while, then it got really boring.

Then I went into software. At some point there, I realized I wanted to be an entrepreneur. No one ever asked me what I wanted to do, until I had to complete an application for the Stanford Business School. Till 26, I never really thought about an answer in a very focused way.

I remember specifically filling out that Stanford Business School application, “What do you want to do with your life?” I was like, “Oh well, I want to be an entrepreneur.” That led me to starting a company, which then led me to a company failing and then I was like “I really need to know sales”.

Jeroen: Did you have one startup before Salesforce or multiple?

Aaron: One internet startup. I’d done some other small businesses at college; like a painting company. In high school, I created and sold fake IDs, so I was a forger. In the United States, to buy alcohol you have to be 21. A couple of those things when I was younger. But the first startup would be the internet one, before starting work at Salesforce.

Jeroen: You never got caught as a forger?

Aaron: No. It was partly a way to make a little money, partly a way to be able to buy alcohol, and partly a way to make friends because I won’t say I was anti\-social, I was just shy in high school. I had trouble making friends, but I was good with computers.

Jeroen: Why do you think you were into startups? Why did you want to be an entrepreneur?

Aaron: My father was an entrepreneur. So I guess that played a big part. If anyone listening to me right now, is in their 50s, or maybe 40s, they might have heard of Ross Systems. In the United States, it was a big financial budgeting software company. It’s actually still around.

It was sold to a Chinese company. It has been bought and sold a few times, but he started that when I was born basically. That’s where I got my original inspiration and then after doing it for a while, I was like I enjoy it.

I got a lot out of Salesforce, in terms of learning. It was a struggle though because of working for three months out of the year, I’d be inspired just to create something and then nine months I’d be plotting along in Salesforce. I learned a lot about politics and internal working. It was a great way to get paid to learn.

I think any job if you look at it, can be a great way to get paid to learn. So don’t complain about your job, be like, “Wow, you have an opportunity here.” I was glad to go back out on my own after Salesforce and start doing my own thing.

Jeroen: Do you still feel like you are getting paid to learn by your own company then?

Aaron: I try to. There are periods where I can feel that way when there’s something new. But then there are definitely times when it’s more of a grind. That’s partly because of the limited time and energy.

Even last night, I slept a few hours but the baby was sick and so even today, I just kind of feel like crap, like physically, I feel like crap. No matter how much you love your job — and I love my business — in terms of kids, love has a different definition now. I wouldn’t say I love my job. I love my kids, which is just beyond describing. My business is great but there’s always days where it’s better than others and I don’t think that ever changes. I think when I was young and I’d see the people like, “If I just had a job I loved, that I could love everyday.” You may even have something you love, but some days it sucks.

You can’t avoid that in life unless you sit on the sidelines and do nothing. It’s better to be out there like an entrepreneur, whether it’s in business or in life. Take the risk of doing something new, fall flat on your face a few times and then learn to get up. Trust me, it is better to getting stagnated and sticking to one thing just because it’s comfortable.

Jeroen: What is it that you mostly do nowadays?

Aaron: I am mostly consulting. There are two main things in our business: one is outsourcing for companies who aren’t ready to do their own prospecting. Most in the US. The other is what me and my team do, consult with companies on how they can build their own outbound prospecting team for faster growth.

Part of that is me working with some clients myself. And a part of it, is helping companies go through the learning system of how to hire the right sales teams, how to prospect, what metrics to measure, how to configure Salesforce and other things. That’s really what I spend my time on.

Jeroen: Building Predictable Revenue, what is it that keeps you up at night lately?

Aaron: Lately, there’s not much.

Probably it’s just how to get things done. When you say I’ve got some number of hours and have some go to clients… It’s a little scary. I might have three or four hours a week of like real investment time, to improve work in the business, so I work on the business.

It’s like how to get more time to improve our internal systems — how we manage and track how our clients are doing, primarily. Then comes being able to coach my team and spend more time with them.

Jeroen: So currently it’s the process and coaching?

Aaron: Process and coaching, yes.

If our team is in place and we have our tools, things will go great. But if we miss someone, if there’s no communication, we will definitely struggle in some way. The team communication is so important.

Also, I live in LA alone and almost everybody else is in Vancouver. There’s like 20 something people in Vancouver and I’m sort of on my own here in LA. That just creates a little extra challenges around team communication — especially on what’s happening. So team communication and our progress, is what keeps me up. Sometimes, I feel I am not at the top of things as much as I’d like to be.

Jeroen: How does that work exactly? Are you like the face on the screen that is always there in the meetings or?

Aaron: I try to attend as many meetings as I can. But there are so many that it becomes difficult. There are a lot of people in our company, that I haven’t even met.

I try to attend our sales meetings, where the whole team groups. Also, when I go onsite with customers, I make it a point to bring along one or two new people from the team. In fact, I’m actually going to China next week. We have a fast growing SaaS company in China that has hired us to help them with outbound prospecting and improving inbound lead generation and churn reduction.

I’m going to take two people from my team. It’s like their training period. They are not coming to help me out; they are coming so that they can see what it’s like to be onsite with the client and see me work with them.

Jeroen: What do you think are the main skills that you as a founder bring to your business? Is it like the coaching aspect that you are referring to or something else?

Aaron: One of them is like a deep expertise in this area of outbound prospecting and specifically building teams to do it.

We’re into the outsourcing business, which I don’t have much experience in. So the co\-CEO takes care of it. We work together in these areas because they are very complimentary.

I think my role is more around defining what we’re going to do in the long term. What are we doing in the next few days, weeks, months or 5 to 10 years? My co\-founder, co\-CEO, is good at more of the 3–12 months planning on how to run the company.

There’s lots of things I’m not good at, but I think it’s more important for the things I focus on. I try and be really good at those things only. With that whole book, it’s basically focusing on your strengths and not your weaknesses.

Jeroen: What are these things that give you energy, these strengths?

Aaron: Well let’s talk about energy for a minute because with the nine kids, eight live at home and there’s some young ones. There’s a baby who’s 1, there’s an almost baby who’s 2. Most of the other kids are relatively self sufficient, but … do you have kids?

Jeroen: No, not yet.

Aaron: Well, when they are under 1 or 2, it’s a lot of physical work holding them. I mean it’s intense. Driving the other kids around, it’s just a lot to do. So we do have a nanny that comes in, but the bottom line is, I’m pretty much always tired and have been for years.

There’s never enough sleep, even if I have time at night. I mostly use that time to write a blog post or catch up with work. What I found is, before I had kids, I would get inspired and write. After babies and kids, especially the last few years, I rarely get inspired anymore, because I’m just always tired.

What happens is, how does it work? I’m up from 06:00–06:30 in the morning to late at night. And then come the deadlines. That’s where I get my energy! I know I can’t escape deadlines. It’s just something that I absolutely have to do — including publishing a book publishing deadline, a conference deadline, a newsletter, …

That’s where for a while, I’ve really relied on extrinsic motivation or that outside motivation, where I have to get things done, regardless of whether I’m tired or not inspired — because, I have to. Think of it as ‘forcing functions’. This is in the “From Impossible …” book!

But think about it, if you want to get into shape, what works better? Do you sign up for a gym, or do you sign up to do a marathon and tell all your friends you are going to do it?

Jeroen: The marathon. I have even done that a couple of times. The problem with marathons is I tend to overtrain and then that doesn’t work either.

Aaron: Yeah, you got to know yourself at some point. I don’t want to say weaknesses, but things we know we have to do or we shouldn’t do but we do them anyway. That is where I get the energy from because I may not have the time to rest for another year or two, until we don’t have any babies who are under like 2.

Jeroen: The way you deal with it, is chasing deadlines basically?

Aaron: Yes, that’s how it works for me.

Kids have to be at school at a certain time, my wife leaves at a certain time for her music classes, that’s a lot of time being very defined.

But then there is one thing that I haven’t been able to do well — putting time aside for myself. Like I haven’t worked out regularly in a while, although I do move around all day. To do even the smallest of things, I have to put it on my calendar. If it’s not on the calendar, it just doesn’t happen. I have to like block it out ahead of time!

Jeroen: You very consciously decide: “this is family time, this is me time, this is business time” and then there’s these deadlines that keep you awake?

Aaron: Yeah. I have my routines, so the days and the weeks are usual. But it’s the calendar that drives a lot of this — even daily activities like the routines around school, business or personal deadlines for tasks.

Jeroen: What is your long term goal with Predictable Revenue. What do you want to achieve?

Aaron: We want to be the number one sales brand in the world. We want it to be a brand that helps inspire people to learn how to make more money in ways that feel good. Because sales, I think deservedly so, leaves a bad taste in many people’s mouths.

Even as a life skill, if you don’t know how to sell yourself an idea or product, you are not going to accomplish anything in life really. Whether you are trying to start a non\-profit, get a promotion, get a job or start a company. It’s a life skill!

Our other goal is to create a culture in our own company that’s really very innovative and I would say, humanistic. People get paid to learn. We want to groom the future entrepreneurs and inspire people to do their best.

Jeroen: When I asked the question you were able to answer pretty quickly. Is it a mission statement you have written down somewhere?

Aaron: Yes, we’ve talked about it. We haven’t written it down some place but we’ve talked about it internally. Apart from the two mission statements, we also have one more goal that keeps it all going — pushing people to do more than they think they can.

Jeroen: Cool. Slowly wrapping up… What’s the latest good book you’ve read and why did you choose to read it?

Aaron: Well, what’s funny is that I haven’t read any business books lately.

Jeroen: Any other books is fine as well.

Aaron: My wife and I are really into reading Shakespeare and the theories that Shakespeare didn’t write.

All the plays attributed to Shakespeare and a woman named Emilia Bassano, who we now believe just from reading books, is the most likely person who wrote, or who was the leading author because there’s a lot of collaborations on the plays.

Whether she collaborated with Shakespeare or not, who knows.

Jeroen: Why did you choose to read these books?

Aaron: My wife got me into it. She’s really obsessed with it! If you haven’t even heard of this already, the fact that Shakespeare may not be the author of his plays. It’s called “Shakespeare’s Dark Lady”. There’s also a site called The Shakespeare Authorship Trust, that you need to check out.

They list out why people think Shakespeare didn’t write the plays. I don’t know, it’s just interesting to see the theories. It’s just like a Sherlock Holmes puzzle to circle back and piece through like what really happened and what you believe. That’s been our obsession lately.

Jeroen: That’s funny. Actually, the last book I’ve read was when we were in Brazil over New Years and bought this huge collection of all the Sherlock Holmes stories and I’m now in I think 60&amp;#37;.

Aaron: Yeah, you picked some great ones.

Jeroen: Pretty nice.

Aaron: Yes, do you speak Portuguese or did you pick it up in English?

Jeroen: No, I pick it up in English. I’m studying Portuguese and it’s going pretty well but I’m not good enough to read Sherlock Holmes in Portuguese. That would be crazy.

Aaron: I love Sherlock Holmes. I have one of those compilations some place. You can never go wrong. I heard he was the character that most movies were made out of.

Jeroen: I really love the one with Cumberbatch.

Aaron: Yes, that’s a great one.

Jeroen: Anyhow, last question. Is there anything you wish that you’d have known when you started out?

Aaron: I mean… how much time do you have?

If there’s one thing I’d like to point out, is what a positive effect your real friends and family can have on your growth.

A lot of people think that having a family while starting out is a burden or a distraction. It doesn’t really need to be. It can actually be a huge help and support, and the motivation you need to keep going and be more successful than you could be on your own. I really want people to start appreciating those they have around them.

Jeroen: I fully agree with you there. Well, thank you for the super open conversation and thank you for being on Founder Coffee.

Aaron: Thank you for having me, Jeroen.

8cyozj,23,2018-04-17,Is it unwise to consider graduate school for a second chance at the new grad job market?,58good1623,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8cyozj/is_it_unwise_to_consider_graduate_school_for_a/,"I'm coming up on 4 months of unemployment after graduating with my BS in CS, and after around 500 applications that have gone nowhere I'm starting to think I just don't have the qualifications to land a developer job. I've obviously had a ton of time to sit and think, and an idea that has recently crept into my mind is going back to school and getting a master's degree so I get a second chance at the new graduate job market. My reasons for doing it:

* An MS is an additional qualification that could distinguish me from BS-only applicants. From a career perspective, I'll probably eventually want a MS anyway, so I might as well do it now.

* I didn't start applying soon enough before graduation. With a second chance, I could start a lot sooner before my graduation date, and would be a more attractive applicant as a student than as an unemployed person

* I didn't have good enough internship experience, and with an extra summer in school I might be able to work somewhere that will eventually lead to a return offer

* My school had a terrible CS department, and if I'm lucky I could get an MS from a much more reputable university. I'd have a better chance at going to career fairs, networking with peers, professors, etc. (none of which I really did during my undergrad)

The counterpoints that spring to my mind:

* I might still eventually be able to get a job without going to graduate school, in which case I'd come out financially behind because of the opportunity cost of lost income.

* I'd be going to school for the wrong reasons and might not be able to keep up with people there because of a genuine interest in research or whatever else.

At this point, I'm really leaning towards trying to get into a few different MS programs. If my eventual goal is just to have a good developer job somewhere, am I viewing the tradeoffs completely wrong right now? I feel like I botched my first attempt at landing a new graduate job, and if I can just have a do-over at the same market then I can do it better and start to salvage my career."

8czm1m,1,2018-04-17,How to join the software development field,Thaik,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8czm1m/how_to_join_the_software_development_field/,"I wrote this for a comment in another thread but thought someone else might be interested. I am a 24-year old JR.Software developer working at a consultation firm in southern Sweden, with steady employment. I landed this job by studying on my own for 6 months on weekends during a full time job, and 6 more months’ full time and then emailing all local companies for an internship which later turned into a job. And I want to give you my tip if you want to program.  

The programming world is a bit age-ist, if you are only 18, please do consider university. At 18 you will sadly be even more instantly discarded than I was, and I felt me being 23, around normal software degree examinee’s age was still looked down because of my age(not because of no degree).  So I would definitely look into an education, if your grades stop you from getting into university, there are other paths that will do somewhat just as well. In Sweden we have specialized work-degrees that are shorter (1-2 years instead of 3-4), I’m sure there are something similar where you live. That is my career suggestion. Now onto the programming suggestions, these tips hold partly true for people who go to university too. 

1: Play around: Just look around and read about programming concepts. You can pick a random language, a short e-course on code-academy, making a small function (like a for loop in different languages) I jumped around a lot at first, and that is fine. This is your derp around time, your time to experience and get a feeling for programming and what you want to do. You won’t feel like you learn anything and I feel this should be a period between 1-2 months but for me it was double, 4 months. 

2: Learn what you want to do: Example say you want to become a “mobile application developer, unit tester, ai specialist, big data, IT-security(IT-forensics), web developer, and so on” There are so many options, and you can’t be much more than 1. And it will be your selling point when looking for jobs. 

3: Decide what you want your tools to be: Example, I knew I wanted to become a software developer but not how.

4: Start developing, now that you know what you want to do. It’s time to start your first real project. 

Decide to create something that you can show on interviews, this is not something that you will be working on all the time, you will have many other projects on at the same time. But this is a long-term project over several months you work on as much as you want to. So decide to build something: I decided to build a fitness app for myself, there are many others but thought it would be fun to do.

5: In relation to your field and your courses. You should look into free online courses, both related to your programming language of choice and your field. For example one course “Into C#/Fundamentals of OOP” and one course “Xamarin Mobile application development” or “Debugging in visual studio”
Sign up to pluralsight free 30-day trial, google it. In any good course, you MUST/SHOULD code along. 

6: Learn version control and debugging after about 2-6 months of above. This is among the most important things you will learn, most of it will seem boring but it will be the best thing you can learn. 

DON’T focus on more than these things after you have gotten started. Two courses, 1 big project and all the smaller projects in the courses. (They pretty much never have any big projects) 

7: Internships are way easier to get into than directly into employment, and even if you don’t get the job, at least it is experience. Don’t even try job ads unless they outline “BEGINNER or JUNIOR”, emails/phone call the way to go.

8: Up sell, aka small lies, you really kind of have to exaggerate your skills a bit, everyone does it, especially in this field. . Don’t say anything you can’t bullshit your way into and say as little as possible about it, but I mentioned I had SQL-Server experience and some web development, and was okay at it. In truth, I sucked at it, but I didn’t have to handle those stuff at first, so by the time I had to I could handle it. 

Also stackoverflow, register there and prepare to be downvoted A LOT, but they will help you when you get stuck

I have to rebuild a payroll system.

I just don't feel good about it.  I'm essentially going in there blind having been offered the chance on what feels like nepotism and a lack of confidence in me on their part.  If it goes poorly, I could get a bad reference and waste a bunch of people's time.  Additionally, they like to keep their interns, and despite telling them that I would likely not consider employment as I am relocating within the next two years, they offered me the gig anyway.

8d2ppb,4,2018-04-17,Unemployed Recent Graduate Mechanical Engineering Seeking Career Advise,Jaypesee,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/8d2ppb/unemployed_recent_graduate_mechanical_engineering/,"TL;DR - Recent Grad (Dec 2017) with B.S in M.E applied to 100 jobs, gotten 13 interviews consisting: 1 video interview, 6 phone interview and 6 on-site interview, but no job offers. Advise on how to keep my optimism up in job searching? Should I settle for a non-engineering job to fill-in the growing gap between my graduation date? Is the recent oil &amp; gas bust in Houston flooded the engineering market with many experienced engineer, making the job search harder?

**Background about myself:**

Just recently graduate from December 2017 with B.S in Mechanical Engineering along with a mathematics minor. I am also FE Certified which makes me an EIT. I have neither internship nor co-op experience, but I was offered a job out of state (A family friend I knew offered me). Though, I had to reject it last minute due to my father becoming seriously ill. I decided to find a job within the city (Houston), but it seems I haven't got any luck.

**Today**, I listed my 100th job application and did a self-reflection per se. Out of the 100 job I have applied, I got ~13 interviews which consisted 1 video interview, 6 phone interviews, and 6 on-site job interviews which led to no job offers. All of my resumes are catered along with my cover letter so I'm quite sure that is not the problem since I actually got interviews. I also got a good portfolio with projects that I have done as well as things that I am currently working on to improve my drafting skills along with using FEA analysis on certain 3D CAD Softwares. Lastly, I follow the advise in typical job search such as following up after an interview by sending a thank you note, checking for updates in a certain time frame, and other etiquette.

**My Interviews:**
Company 1: 1 phone interview, 1 on-site interview, 1 video interview. I honestly nailed the phone interview along with the first round on-site interview. They then sent me a video interview where I record myself for some odd reason and answer the questions while I was being recorded. Honestly, it was harder than I expected, trying to sell myself in front of a camera without any body language, facial expression, or something to get a feedback from. They sent me a rejection email the next day. I asked for feedback, but they just told me that I did not have the skills for the position which I found odd since I got 2 interviews prior it.

Company 2: 1 phone interview and 1 on-site interview. I honestly was able to answer everything nicely. I struggled on a few questions, but in the end I somehow was able to get through it. They called me back the next day, the recruiter said that they had to close the position due some restructuring they are doing with the company and telling me that I was a perfect candidate which doesn't really encourages me.

Company 3: 1 phone interview and 2 on-site interview. I was used to phone interviews by then and I nailed it easily. As for the 1st on-site interview, my first interviewer haven't even had the chance to read my resume and he just asked me technical questions. After being removed from school for about 3 months (This was in March), I struggled on some questions. He then passed me onto his supervisor for a 2nd round interview on that same day (I actually didn't know I was gonna get interviewed 2 times that same day). The supervisor just asked me the usual questions like tell me about yourself kind of deal and etc. I honestly did pretty good there I think. They gave me a tour on the place afterwards. It's been 2 weeks since I have followed up, and it seems they are not interested since I haven't gotten a reply.

Company 4: I got 1 phone interview and 1 on-site interview. Honestly, when I walked out of the office, I was 100% sure I got the job. I nailed all technical questions, regular interview questions, and they did a mini-CAD test where they gave me something to draw and I had to remake it within a certain amount of time. They were impressed all-around (they told me during the interview) and told me they will get back to me ASAP. I followed up today and the owner of the company decided to close the position and not hire anyone. I was really disappointed since it was a dream job I actually wanted, but I had to move on.

Company 5: 1 phone interview and 1 on-site interview (scheduled). I nailed the phone interview and they scheduled me an on-site interview. Honestly, after the few interviews that led to dead-end, I have pretty much got my answers memorized as well as reviewed my Fundamentals in Engineering.

Company 6: I just recently got a phone interview with the company and they are about to schedule me for an on-site interview sometime next week or the week after.

I noticed that after my interview with Company 4, my depression is getting worse. I was having some troubled thoughts when I was washing my kitchen knife this afternoon. To the experienced engineers on this subreddit: do you guys have any good advise on how to keep my optimism up for job search for my first job? I'm also getting worried that the growing gap between graduation and my first job is lessening my chances to get a job, should I settle for a non-engineering job to fill in the gap? Lastly, I'm getting a feeling that the recent oil &amp; gas bust has flooded the engineering market with lots of experienced engineers making the competition here in Houston a lot harder than it used to be."

I have zero work experience in CS. I am very passionate about it and am always trying to learn new things. Yet, I have had zero internships or jobs relating to CS. 

I am hoping that by next summer I will be able to get my feet wet with an internship doing something in CS. 

What I am afraid of is that when I finally do get out into the field, I wont feel as passionate about it or I will realize that it is just not for me and will have to switch majors. 

Has anyone here had a similar experience? Shed some light to calm me down lol"

I'm beginning to appreciate the benefits of living a private life IRL for the first time but my situation goes a bit beyond the usual ""drunk photos on Facebook"" predicament since my past activities have made me a somewhat public person.

Who I am:

 - CS student close to graduation

 - started several fan communities over the years, some of which attracted enough attention to make me a somewhat public figure with enemies (think xxx,xxx users in smallish niches)

 - liberally associated my pseudonym and online projects with my RL name as the above was the only ""side project"" experience I had, and you know what they say about needing amazing side projects to make it in the software world now…

 - have extremely unique online and RL names

 - have RL name linked to all of the above in publicly searchable business records, WHOIS, OSS commit logs, emails, etc. that appear with simple Google searches

 - have been doxxed and become the subject of an extremely negative disparaging article that appears when googling either my name or pseudonym, in addition to a lot of salt mentioning my pseudonym if you dig a little further

I was a naïve kid who took pride in their ""hobby projects"" and wanted to show them off to potential employers to prove my skills - this taught me skills in full-stack dev and infrastructure management that put me far above and beyond most of my peers at school. So I never bothered to separate out my identities. This worked for landing several great internships but I wonder how many times I might've been passed up for being linked to stupid Internet drama, as I've received many rejections or non-responses, too.

Unfortunately, I turned out to have no interest in professional web dev, which greatly reduces the technical value of these projects for my portfolio going forward. I'll be pursuing grad school abroad to pivot into my dream career (still in software but a small, highly specialized niche of it) and wonder how much all my previous work and reputation might hurt me over the rest of my life.

Is it wise to use my move to a new school, city, and country as an opportunity to reboot my identity? I'm contemplating whether to change my legal name, or at least what I go by IRL, to obscure my past before I begin building a new network of friends, mentors, and other contacts in a new industry.

I fear being a single googling away from being written off by a picky recruiter as an  ""undesirable"" person; it seems that one may be better off being a nobody online than having a divisive reputation there. Any advice would be appreciated."

I’m going to a lesser known school so I want to utilize internships to the best of my ability so I’ve been making lists of all the possible places to apply and noticed a good amount of them require C++ understanding so I’ve been working on c++ so I can start contributing to open source in some way with it and making my own projects with it. However c++ as im sure you all know is hard for me to produce any visual returns on the knowledge I’m gaining, I understand what I’m learning pretty well actually just it’s hard to stay motivated when I don’t get to visually see new projects with this progress.

Does the amount of attention I’m paying to C++ really matter or could I switch over to something like the Odin Project which is progress based (but of course about web development) and still have plenty of internship prospects.

I know freshman and sophomores don’t typically get an internship but I know it does happen and I’m trying to put the work in to be one of those students.

Side note: I do enjoy C++ a lot learning it makes me think a lot and that’s one of the things that entertains me the most. So this isn’t a matter of enjoying web development more just I feel like I’d see more progress visually through my projects than in C++ where even people learning at an intermediate level are still working in the terminal"

I'm a sophomore at a lac in Montana. I've been offered three different summer internship opportunities and am looking for insight on which to pursue. My goal with my CS degree is to end up doing backend dev, possibly with artificial intelligence in some way. 

The first opportunity is with the NAVY working as a dev intern with their NREIP program. Seems like the best expereience, but it only pays 13.50 an hour in Silverdale WA. The second is front-end dev work at a startup in MT, paying 13 an hour. The third opportunity is basically an IT position, deployment tech, with an established company in MT paying 18 an hour.

I see the Navy internship as the most relevant experience, but also the worst move financially. The IT position is the best move financially, but the worst for experience.

Any insight or suggestions on how to make this decision is greatly appreciated.

Just a little background, I am currently getting my Bachelor of Commerce with a concentration in Business Technology Management (BTMA) formerly known as Management Information Systems, at the University of Calgary. 

No, I don’t know how to fix computers. No, I can’t code that revolutionary new app idea you’ve been talking about. And no, I’m not that tech support guy that just tells you to turn your device on and off again. However, these are all things that I tell my parents I do, just to simplify my life.

All jokes aside, essentially I learn about how to bridge the gap between IT and business, then use technology to solve business problems.

Now let’s get into the real deal here.

 


Internship #1:

I got my first internship halfway through my third year of university in January 2016. It was an 8-month work term at TransCanada. My title was SAP Reporting Coordinator; my main day to day responsibility was to ensure that the business’ requested reports were developed, tested and brought to life. In addition, I also reported on key business metrics for upper management. 

We don’t live in a fairy tale and not everything is perfect. I started my work term in the middle of an oil and gas recession and let’s just say, I had to adapt rather quickly. The manager who hired me was let go 3 months after I started (amazing guy, we still stay in touch until this day), my team went from 12 people to 6 people at the end of my term including myself. It was hard seeing good people losing their jobs due to a decline in the overall economy. The new manager was also an incredible leader who mentored me through my work term.

The day to day workload was manageable; demands and tasks came in at a pretty consistent pace. Although, there were times where I had to pull in some hours over the weekend due to crucial project deadlines. 

Everyone was very nice and welcoming in my team. If I had any questions people were more than happy to answer them or point me in the right direction. There was some competitions between other interns in the department but they didn’t really affect me that much at all. Overall, my experience at TransCanada was very positive.

 


Internship #2:

My second internship was at ExxonMobil Canada as a project analyst. My main day to day job was to provide project management support for IT projects in the downstream function. I had the opportunity to attend a week-long training session in Houston, it was my first work trip! 

The campus was located in the industrial area of the city, which I like to call it “the middle of nowhere”. My commute doubled from 20 minutes each way to 40 minutes (long for Calgary) each way comparing to TransCanada. I still remember this one time it took me over 90 minutes.

The campus was newly built with a startup feel to it, they even had a ping pong table. Their seating arrangement was a little foreign to me when I first started. “Hotelling” was their way of seating; basically no one had an assigned desk, they were free to sit in any spot. 

I worked in a global team at ExxonMobil. My team had over 15 people spread out across 6 different cities while only 3 people, including me, worked in Calgary. My manager was located in Houston, this made communication more difficult than usual. Which, of course, we are know hot important in-person interaction is. Especially for an intern. 

Some people were difficult to work with, this and rare communication with my manager made my experience there not as great as I expected. But of course, I contributed to that problem too myself, I learned about what I love to do and what I didn’t love to do. 

Culturally, ExxonMobil was very different from TransCanada. TransCanada was more laid back and ExxonMobil was a lot more results-driven and performance-oriented; which is also the reason why they are successful today.
 


So there you guys have it. These are my internships experiences, what are yours? Ask me anything about these internships!

Three Days Ago

""I'm sure you all know why I've gathered you here today."" The man sitting at the end of the table began. ""It's our job to decide the response to the Silthion attack.""

 A woman in a suit spoke up. ""We absolutely cannot start a war over this. This is too minor an incident to spark a major conflict."" 

A large man in a naval uniform takes a pause in her speech to speak up as well. ""We can't simply go without a retaliation. If we look soft to the face of the galaxy at such a critical time, They won't see any reason not to just shoot down our ships and take thermo engines for themselves.""

The woman pulled herself back into the conversation. ""But wouldn't sending a warship be a bigger risk than we already take with trade ships?"" She said. ""Besides, We'd never win in a war. The Silthion are a massive co-operative hive. Nothing short of killing the queen would stop them.""

The naval man stood up, now shouting. ""Well we can't just do nothing! We need a response of some sort, or the galaxy will laugh at this government!""

The man at the head of the table now stood too. ""Commander, calm down. A shouting match will bring us no closer to a solution."" he said, raising his voice to the naval man, before sitting back down.

""I'll open the floor to anyone with a new idea. We're sorely lacking in communication on this end of the table anyway.""

Across the table, a nervous, young man in a blue polo shirt raises his hand. ""I… uh…. I have an idea.""

""Go ahead young man""

""Uh…. okay."" he said with a stutter in his voice. ""It might be kind of crazy, but this seems like a good time to try out the… uhh… Delta Zero project.""

The naval man was back on his feet. ""That's preposterous! It isn't ready yet, and even if it was, it takes far too long to deploy! The whole galaxy would know what's happening before we're done!""

""Commander, please sit down. You can't just win all of your arguments by standing and shouting. If you can't behave yourself, I'll call in your second in command for this meeting instead."" the man at the end bellowed. 

""My apologies, sir. Carry on, engineer.""

""Thank you, commander."" the man continued, fearful of his compatriots now more than ever. ""I think the Delta Zero program would be a good fit for a situation like this one. It should satisfy the commander here by removing a risk of armed conflict with the Silthion, it will satisfyingly scare the daylights out of the rest of the galaxy, and - to our moral interests - won't involve committing another thermonuclear genocide.""

""Excellent, young man. Now, how do you plan to implement the project? By my understanding, it takes a considerable amount of time to set up.""

""I was planning on covering our tracks with project Silent Night. It should give us enough time to enact Delta Zero without being observed by the galactic community doing so."" he said before sitting back down.

""I think this plan might be our most reasonable Course of action, and it's also the only decent one I've heard in the last two days of these meetings."" the head said, directed at the whole table."" All in favor of moving forward with projects Delta Zero and Silent Night, say aye""

The table erupted in a synchronized ""aye"".

""All opposed say 'nay'"".

With that statement, the naval man shouted ""nay"" at the top of his lungs.

""I take it you have some disagreement, commander?""

""I do. I refuse to waste the manpower, time, and energy required for such a ridiculous undertaking.""

""Then I suppose you have a better idea? We have to respond, and we're running out of time to do so. This plan is logically sound, logistically feasible, and doesn't involve nuclear response or some weird squirrel-themed attack like the psych department suggested.""

""That's… well… I guess I'm not sure what else to do."" the naval man admitted. ""But I am still opposed to this action.""

""That is unfortunate to hear captain, but we still have a majority in favor of taking it. You, on the other hand, may take your leave of this committee.""

""I understand, Mr. President. I'll take my leave. Please don't do anything that will cost the human race.""

----


""Alright men, what else needs to be decided for the Silent-Delta operation?""

A slender man in a blue suit stands. ""We still need to quell any rumors that might arise during and after the action.""

""Do we have any possibilities to silence Silthion escapees during this endeavor?""

""Most of them are unlikely to be an issue"" A man in a gray coat stated with haste. ""The Silthion are a hive. Most laborers and soldiers have little to no mind of their own. They're closer to biological machines than they are sentient lifeforms.""

""Then we just need to answer the rumors of the rest of the galaxy. I think we can do a decent job of that."" with that, he pressed a button on the phone on his desk. ""Sandra, do you know of any interns with acting experience?""

An inaudible chatter responds

""Tom and Linda? Great. Can you send them in to the meeting room?""

Specialising in Marketing Content, Entertainment, Health &amp; fitness and many more.",judgemental_douche,forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/8d758q/for_hire_creative_and_seo_content_writer_with_3/,"Hi, I just wanted to reach out in a better way on a better platform. I may not have much experience on Reddit but I sure do have years of writing experience (where it matters). I took a hiatus from writing to get my assignments done for the final year of Master's (English Literature). I used to work in an office as a content strategist and it was a total chaos with a fair amount of exploitation. That work paid less, way less, for a 12-hour shift on an average. So, I decided to make better use of my writing skills.  

**The OneDrive link for sample articles and my published work:**  [SAMPLES](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AgzyQylLehphjCYZAcsnYXtZMO8b)

My specialization lies in **Marketing content**, digital or non-digital (Blog/Article, text on creatives, text on printables, campaigns, classified ads, social bookmarking posts, press releases, etc.). Apart from that I have also created **Mock Test Papers of Pearson Test of English** for an education company, wrote **sports &amp; fitness news**, and have a substantial amount of experience in **Creative Writing**. I never get terrified or agitated with the amount of work in hand, and better yet, the more challenging the work, the better the satisfaction of completing it. 

 

#**Synopsis:** 

******

I have not only written on **WordPress** websites, I have also worked on the **backend** of many. I have spent years of incorporating the right **SEO** practices in my writing. I started with Sports News and Feature Articles, where I learned to find a pattern in constantly changing **keywords** and hashing out an article or essay structure. I have also **trained interns** to write better using SEO practices. Then I worked as a **content strategist** where I added more to my knowledge of **Digital and Non-Digital marketing content creation** skills. 

#**Experience:**

******

Here are the types of work that I have experience in. 

* Digital Marketing content. 

* Writing/Editing Sports news and feature articles. 

* Fitness blogs. 

* Text for Printable. 

* Mock Test Papers of PTE. 

* Original scripts. 

You can go through the OneDrive link I have provided for the sample articles, articles that I have written for few of the clients and the links to my published work as well. **But you can also PM me if you want me to send you the links to my published work personally**. Also, you can check my LinkedIn profile *(Read how to contact section below).*  

#**Skills:**

******

* Refined research for increased effectiveness.

* No grammatical, continuity and structural errors.

* Basic photoshop skills, in case customized image for content is required. 

* Better efficiency to decrease the turnaround time. 

* SEO optimized content. 

* Fluid interaction with the client to understand the nature of work perfectly. 

#**Services and Costs:** 

******

**Blogs/Articles/Copywriting:** $0.08 - $0.1 per word. Depends on the amount of time and work required to complete the work. For example, if an extensive research is required, it will definitely take a lot of time, and hence, $0.1 per word. 

**Proof Reading/Editing:** $0.05 - $0.08 per word. Depends on the time it is going to take. Smaller pieces of work will cost about $0.05 to $0.06 per word, and longer pieces of work will cost $0.07 to $0.08 per word. 

**WordPress Backend:** $35 per hour. 

**Explainer Videos:** $80 for a minute of video. 

However, I'll happily negotiate whenever the nature of work/content aligns with my interests (for example, I have a fitness bug). But in any case, I would like to have a conversation with any interested parties, because I believe that everything is an opportunity to learn. What will I learn from a conversation, you ask? Well, let's just say, it will improve my conversation skills with a possible client. 

#**Estimated time taken to complete a Work:**

******

Generally, the quality of work depends on the availability of resources from the client's end and the time available for research. On an average, you can expect the best writing draft of 600 words in just 6 hours. Needless to say, I will be available here to make as many drafts/revisions, even after the payment is done until the client is satisfied. 
 

#**Why did I leave my day job? (Read it If you really want to know) (SOMEWHAT NOT RELEVANT TO THE POST)**

******

To be honest, I belong to a small city, and never really liked the concrete jungles, the pollution of every kind imaginable is too much for someone with a routine and a fitness bug. But that job at least got the bills paid. The hiatus was more of a reboot, to get my senses back, I had to unwind myself, and look at the prospects that were kind of contingent on my skills on hand. Actually, I've been writing for 8 years now, if you count poems and long stories that are not published anywhere, as a testament to the writing experience. But professionally, I've been writing for over 3 years now and I am still learning, that is why I require honest reviews from my clients. I crave for the work that will push me into learning something new or at least makes me aware of what I need to learn next. One of the reasons to quit office was also the stagnancy in learning. "
8d7gid,6,2018-04-18,Internships and Job Offers (Before Graduating),randomrusername1,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/8d7gid/internships_and_job_offers_before_graduating/,"Hello everybody,

As you may have seen my post that I just submitted a minute ago, I am interested in getting my bachelor's in computer science, and OSU's program looks great. I've read many of the posts dating back up to a year ago, but I still don't feel like I have an excellent grasp on this subject in relation to OSU's program: internships and jobs (prior to graduation).

I've seen multiple posts talk about how people can land internships (and even job offers) prior to graduating, but I would like to hear about peoples' experiences with such (as in, how many classes/what classes did you take before such events). Also, I'd love to hear if there is a difference (based on classes completed) between 'being able to get an internship/job' and 'being able to contribute productively at an internship/job' (for example, maybe three classes in and somebody will be able to get an internship according to the common timeline for a three-year track, but maybe they wouldn't feel comfortable in such an internship until they have completed five classes).

The main reason why I'm asking is because going for another bachelor's seems like it can be a juggling act (staying in an unrelated full-time position until one can break into the CS field).

I'm not including internships that don't result in a job afterwards...actually, is that a crazy idea after getting one internship? (Doing paid internships after a certain point in classes rather than working an unrelated job.) For example, one would work their non-CS job for a year, but then get an internship for a summer, and then move on to another internship, and then complete one more internship before they get a job (ideally, those internships would be paid). I'm talking theoretically here, so I'd love for somebody to talk about the practicality of this 'internship hopping idea'.

Also, are there any well-established jobs that are tech-related but don't require a CS background (not programming/coding). I'm wondering if it would be beneficial to work for (not necessarily with tech) a tech company while going for this bachelor's. I guess an example of what I'm talking about would maybe be a 'tech recruiter' position (which might not be possible)?

Lastly, are there unpaid internships out there that become 'available' earlier than paid internships?"

I am by no means a rockstar natural cs student; I try hard in my classes, but I barely have any other side projects to show off the other languages that I've tried to learn outside of class. 

So naturally, as I apply to dozens of internships, it's common that I get ghosted by them. So I've been really desperate in securing an internship for this summer as I want to make use of my time and acquire skill within my field. 

I've **accepted** an **Technical Intern** offer from a **well known/established government contracting company** (I should mention that I also live in the DC Metropolitan area). The internship is very well established and renown, with great networking opportunities, great communication with the managers (offering a mentor role), and is just a great place to be working at in terms of reviews. I **accepted** an offer from them, signing an e-contract and submitted the drug test. However, this internship is not a software engineering one and may not deal with as much coding as I will like, if any. 

I have **an other offer** from a much smaller company, with a small team of interns, and is not much of a big name as the other one (in terms of my location in DC). However, this one is a software engineering internship, so I would be working with code, and this is aligned with my interests.

So even though I basically signed the offer for the IT Intern position, should I renege the offer from the large government-based contractor company and take the software engineering intern position at the smaller company? Would taking the IT Technical intern position hinder me from my path to being a software engineer?

**TL;DR - should I renege a IT internship that I have signed the offer to for a Software Engineering one?**

University is really expensive, and coop is an amazing program. But that scholarship money is really tempting. 

Is it still worth risking POSt for that extra help in first year, or is it still more worth going to UW because of coop? 

I don’t know how easily I would be able to get an internship on my own after first year, as well, so that’s a factor too. 

Basically, if coop makes it so I’m still in a better financial situation, even if I get decent internships in the summer after school at UTSG, then UW would still be the better choice.

I am a current Junior in Mechanical Engineering at a good Public University who was lucky enough to score two internship offers for this summer. For context, I love Aerospace Engineering and it has been my dream to work at X Aerospace Company.

Three weeks ago, I met on campus with representatives from Z Company and was able to get an interview. After the interview, they liked me and extended me an offer for the summer. The entire process took three days and everyone, the recruiter my interviewer, were extremely friendly to me.

The same day I got an offer from Z Company, I got an email from X Company saying that they wanted to interview me for a summer position too. I was thrilled and called Z Company and asked for 2 weeks to decide if I wanted to accept the offer.

Fast Forward to last Thursday and it was the day before I had to accept my offer from Z Company. I knew that Friday was going to busy and I wouldn't have time to fill out the paper work for accpeting the offer, so I called Company X Directly and asked about my status. All the recruiter told me was that I hadn't been selected, even though my interview went great and everyone liked me. A little sad, I immediately went to fill out my acceptance paper work for Company Z and submitted it.

That night I got an email from my interviewers at Company X, and they told me that they liked me so much that they were going to try to get a 2nd internship approved for me.

Today I got an email back and they were able to create a second position and they said I should expect an offer by the end of the week

I am torn on what to do because I already accepted the offer from Company Z and they were so friendly and helpful to me, but at the same time so was Company X. I have a passion for Aerospace Engineering and I really want to work at Company X but I also want to do the right thing. What should I do?"

8d8l6q,1,2018-04-18,choosing an internship,cs__throwaway_21,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8d8l6q/choosing_an_internship/,"Hi everyone! I'm trying to choose between 2 offers for the summer, if anyone has opinions or guidance that would be great!
I'm a junior studying CS in NYC, and I'm really interested in EdTech, so I want to do something in the realm of teaching CS, CS curriculum development, or being a SWE at an EdTech company postgrad. This would be my first tech internship, as I decided to major in CS late in my college career.
My choices are:

EdTech Company A: Located in Boston, non-profit, affiliated with Harvard/MIT, provides MOOCs in a variety of subjects. The position is SWE Internship for 12 weeks, and pays 35/hr. There would be a total of 5 interns working there this summer, including me. 

EdTech Company B: Located in Mountainview/Palo Alto, and provides courses in tech fields developed by experts. The position is a Content Developer internship for 13-14 weeks, so it would be both writing curricula and coding aspects of courses, it also pays 35/hr but they are providing a $2000 relocation stipend. There would be a total of 28 interns there this summer. 

For me, both positions sound exciting and I'm honestly unsure how to choose between Content Development and SWE. I'll have to relocate either way, but I can see relocating to Mountainview being much more difficult. Additionally, Company B is a startup, albeit a largish one, so that would give me an idea of what the startup culture is like, especially out in the Bay Area. 

Any thoughts are appreciated, and I can definitely provide clarification :)"
8d8red,6,2018-04-18,"Highly educated, STEM PhD, unemployed... it might be time for a new career.",lifelongstudent4,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8d8red/highly_educated_stem_phd_unemployed_it_might_be/,"Hi everyone. My current career trajectory is not working out, I'm feeling lost, and it might be time to start over. Thanks in advance for any advice. 

I have plenty of book experience, but hardly any work experience. Or rather, no valuable work experience. I find myself struggling to find jobs that are a good match with my skill set. I've been in several late-round interviews for well-paying jobs only to be passed over for candidates with more experience in a specific area. I've signed contingent offers which fell apart after the company failed to win a government contract. I am working on a small project right now for a small company which will pay less than $1k. 

*What is wrong with my current career?* 

Well basically, I'm unemployed (or underemployed) and have been for a year. This is a recurring problem. Since earning my Ph.D. about 9 years ago, I have endured 32 months of unemployment. (Geez, just writing that sentence makes me depressed and worried that there is something deeply wrong with me.) 

I studied quantum mechanics, solid state physics, and materials science. I got a perfect 4.0 my first year of grad school. I did two postdocs. ( *wait, how is this guy unemployed?* ) I find now that my research skillset doesn't overlap with job requirements. Don't get me wrong, I apply anyway, just haven't landed those jobs. I'm a computational materials scientist with no experience in finite element analysis. I'm a computational chemist with no experience in the pharmaceutical industry. I am a scientist who has not performed any experiments outside of a computer simulation. 

Looking back, I'm not exactly sure what my plans were for after grad school. I guess I was following a career in scientific research, which actually might not be a good fit for me personally. I like science and I like to solve problems, but I don't enjoy writing research papers. As much as I like *learning* science there's honestly not much about the *life* of a research scientist that I enjoy... and maybe that lack of passion led to underperformance. 

I am disappointed with my productivity as a scientist (only a dozen publications in 10 years). Friends, family, colleagues, and recruiters tell me I have an impressive resume and tell me to hang in there. But I look at my resume and all I see is a lack of accomplishment and the stigma of employment gaps. Here I am in my mid 30's and the only real job I had in industry lasted three months. 

It's extremely difficult to land a job in academia these days. There are few companies looking for someone with my background and these jobs rarely open up. I faced a really tough job market coming out of grad school and had to settle for a postdoc. **But really, 32 months of unemployment? This is just too much to chalk up to bad luck.** I am ready to give up and find a new career path that is a better fit for me. 

*Moving forward*

I'm not sure what is the best use of my time/effort. Should I network more? Rewrite my resume to land a non-technical job? Should I hire a career coach? Become a teacher? At this point I just need to work. I need to not be unemployed. 

* Positives: Good at math. Good at making connections (Meyers-Briggs INTP). Good at solving problems. Like to learn new things. 

* Negatives: Self-doubt (assuming they don't hand out PhDs to bad scientists). Lack of confidence. Poor self-discipline (especially when it comes to writing). Indecisive, not sure where to go next. 

Okay, so with my background in computer simulations and programming, I got interested in data science. I'm 36 weeks through an online course focused on R. I will move back to Python as soon as that's done. I really like computer programming, but if data science is too much like physical science then I might fall flat on my face when I get handed a real project. Furthermore, I have no professional work experience in this area and it's hard to break into this field. (should I seek an internship?) I'm working on my portfolio, hope to post some example projects on my website (which I have to make) or GitHub (full of stupid Coursera assignments right now). 

As I mentioned above, I am doing some consulting work for a small computational chemistry company. I'm not sure how well that's going to turn out and have yet to issue my first invoice. I've been a substitute teacher before and I've considered a career in teaching. 

*Self-doubt:* I'm generally an easy-going guy, but there's been a few times over the past year when I've been real down on myself. And these episodes have made me question my entire work history and doubt my future career potential. I've made a lot of first-steps down different career paths only to quickly get discouraged or lose interest. I'm getting nowhere because I don't know where I'm headed. I know I have a lot of potential if I stick with something. 

I'd like a fulfilling, well-paying job, but I admit that will have to wait another few years. I don't expect to solve all my problems right away. What I need is that first step. I need a job I'm capable of doing and has potential for advancement. So if you have any suggestions for what that next step is, or how to go about figuring out what it is, please share your thoughts. 

* What is a good job for an ex-scientist that likes to solve problems? (I know this is rather vague) 

* Are there any companies that will hire a PhD making a career change into an entry-level position? 

* Where should I go for career guidance? 

Sorry for the long post, thank you for reading, and thank you for your input. I will be back to answer questions, but right now I need to get outside and get some exercise. 

(Also, I noticed that there are several career advice and career guidance subs, which one is the best?)"

So I’m in highschool right now and I want to go into computer science. I’ve been making games for 4 years now but mostly just he design part, enough programming to know the fundamentals and some of the common practices but nothing in depth. I’m going to a lesser known school so I want to utilize internships to the best of my ability so I’ve been making lists of all the possible places to apply and noticed a good amount of them require C\+\+ understanding so I’ve been working on c\+\+ so I can start contributing to open source in some way with it and making my own projects with it. However c\+\+ as im sure you all know is hard for me to produce any visual returns on the knowledge I’m gaining, I understand what I’m learning pretty well actually just it’s hard to stay motivated when I don’t get to visually see new projects with this progress.

Does the amount of attention I’m paying to C\+\+ really matter or could I switch over to something like the Odin Project which is progress based \(but of course about web development\) and still have plenty of internship prospects.

I know freshman and sophomores don’t typically get an internship but I know it does happen and I’m trying to put the work in to be one of those students.

Side note: I do enjoy C\+\+ a lot learning it makes me think a lot and that’s one of the things that entertains me the most. So this isn’t a matter of enjoying web development more just I feel like I’d see more progress visually through my projects than in C\+\+ where even people learning at an intermediate level are still working in the terminal"

I'm currently a Marketing Specialist at my job. I graduated December 2016 and started my current job June 2017, worked for $15.50, and now I'm full time working at $19.95 an hour.

Working here, over time, I realized that this may not be the career path for me OR the company I’m in/position I’m in (I work in a corporate setting) might not be for me. I'm a people person and am a ENFJ from the Meyers-Briggs test, if you guys know about it. 

I like my job, the company is nice, the people are friendly with some hiccups of people being weird and the usual “office politics” bullshit but I feel like I need to experience new things, maybe try something different, or I don’t know honestly. I feel stuck. I'm creative but not to the extent of being able to make ads and whatnot. I'm also hesitant to move because I work directly with my CMO, CEO, and other members of the company. I'm learning so much from my CMO such as Press Releases, ad design, client PowerPoint presentations, event marketing, Google Adwords/Analytics so on and so forth. I also designed a Social Media Marketing plan for the company, which is gold, but they aren't moving forward with it due to the line of conferences we had these past couple of months and to be honest, I'm not sure if they will go through with it. I would found out later in June. 

I have a job offer on the table right now that pays $25/hour. My mom's friend offered it to me. He works at a new hotel as the sales and marketing manager for his branch (hospitality field). I worked for him as an intern before and he would love to work with me again. My mom said it would be a good opportunity for me since it would be something new and I'm starting at the bottom of the hotel chain and can work my way up to whatever it may be. My job title would remain as Marketing Specialist and the job details are still TBD but would include social media marketing and some administrative work such developing as marketing reports and budgeting reports. 

I'm worried about moving to another job because I haven't mastered all the marketing skills that my CMO has. She assigns me work, I do the work, and she gives me feedback as to how to improve my work. That's how I'm learning and improving my marketing skills. I'm nervous about moving because I haven't perfected it all. 

I have been looking at other jobs that may fit my personality such as Operations Associate, Business Development Associate, Associate Product Manager, Junior marketing communications coordinator, etc etc but I'm hesitant to move because I feel like I'm still young and don't want to fuck up when I move to another job. I’m really good with people and some of my skills are below:

Teamwork Operations (I'm capable of explaining how to run the business more efficiently by assessing how it runs and by understanding who does what); Business development (Capable of assess a business, how they can expand, what markets to reach in, who to market to, what content they need to produce etc etc); Social media marketing (to an extent, not an expert); Multitasking/Management (During college or actually my entire life, I've been really good with managing different projects and monitoring people/pushing people to get things done); Communication; Integrity; Working under pressure; Crisis Management; Teaching skills; Organized; Results oriented; Customer service; Sales; Work ethics; Client services; Building and retaining relationships; On top of things.

So my question is: Do I move from my current position and try something new in another field with some possible marketing involved OR do I stay at my current position, learn everything I can until I become an expert and apply for a more mid-level role?

Money also plays a role but not as much as going for the experience/long run of things but to keep in mind: The new position is $25/hour = 52k a year and will increase by 3% by company standard vs the position I'm in now I'm making $41,500 a year and 3% increase on that isn't so much... 

Thanks for reading. 

TLDR: I'm worried about moving to another job because I haven't mastered all the marketing skills that my CMO has. She assigns me work, I do the work, and she gives me feedback as to how to improve my work. That's how I'm learning and improving my marketing skills. I'm nervous about moving because I haven't perfected it all.  Do I move from my current position and try something new in another field with some possible marketing involved OR do I stay at my current position, learn everything I can until I become an expert and apply for a more mid-level role? Pay for option one is $25/hour with 3% increase per year, current job is $19.95/hour with 3% increase a year.

But, I think my situation is a bit more unique than the average post, since it's happening so close to my start date and I'm still working for them part-time.

Background:

- Interned at this company last summer. Did a great job, thought I wanted to return full-time and wanted to know I had it locked down, so I asked if I could get an early return offer. My manager pulled some strings and gave me an offer before my internship was even over, which is rare for the company. I was given very little time to decide, but I accepted immediately because I wanted (at the time) to work there.

- Because they're assuming I'm going back full-time, they've been letting me work part-time throughout the school year. I still have my work laptop, badge etc.

- Still have a good relationship with manager and former mentors

I was recently approached at a hackathon by a recruiter from a former unicorn asking me to interview. I thought I'd do it for fun (read: free vacation to SV), but they ended up giving me an offer for an awesome team with insane pay. I know I would enjoy this location, team, company so much more than the other company and think it would be great for my career, but I'm worried about the blowback from reneging on the other company.

What's the worst they'd do? If they found out who I'm going to work for, could/would they contact them and tell them that I reneged on them? To be safe, I'm not going to tell my manager/friends at my old company who I'm going to work for now, but should I also not update my job on linkedin once I start at the other company?


tl;dr: about to renege on a company one month before my start date, which I'm assuming will make them pissed. Should I be worried that they'll contact my future employer and tell them I reneged (assuming they find out who it is)? Should I not even list my new position on linkedin for a year or so?"

I’m currently interested in getting a MS in ML from a top 10 school. After talking to some professors, I don’t think I’ll be able to finish it in 2 semesters but will have to add a summer to the end. This will put me at 4.5 years of school (4 full years plus the summer at the end), with 2 internships.

How will hiring be in the Summer/Fall? Would I be able to secure a full-time job in the Spring/Summer for the Fall? I would think most companies wouldn’t be hiring during the sunny months, but rather in the fall. My concern is being unemployed for several months trying to find a job, which I wouldn’t be able to afford.

Too many people at Cornell derive their self worth from their academic performance and professional aspirations. These are probably the same people that can't carry a conversation about anything that isn't technical. I feel like in college, a lot of CS majors lose sight of the fact that life is so much more than your education+career, because that's all they focus on during their 4 years here. 

The thing that really bothers me is why it becomes so damn competitive. People in the CS major here relentlessly talk about test scores, GPAs, internships, projects, connections, etc. So much of it is humblebrag and its honestly disgusting.

""oh, that project took you more than 30 seconds? dude are you sure you wanna do CS?""

""you don't have a 4.33? I feel like they practically hand out A+'s here""

Anyways, ever since February, I've been applying to any job posting I see. The past 3-4 weeks, I've applied to at least 50 internships/full time positions on various job boards like indeed, Glassdoor, and even my own college's job board. Out of those 50 or so applications, I've only gotten one call and the person who interviewed me said they would email me the next week, well, it's been 2 weeks since then and no email has shown up on my inbox. 

This is what is bringing me down. I've applied to many places and only one responded. I don't want to graduate with no experience and I don't really know where to go from here. I want to enter the IT field (SysAdmin, etc.) but I also want to get into IT auditing, risk management, etc. Is help desk the default starting point for every IT student? Are online applications even worth submitting? Should I just go to a recruiter or staffing agency and let them find me a job/internship/opportunities even if it's bad? I just want some experience.

I understand it's probably late to get an internship for this summer (won't stop me from applying), so in case I don't get an internship, what should I do this summer? Try and get any certs? Which ones would make my resume more attractive to land that first internship?

I also would be interested in knowing the opinions of people who have progressed beyond CS 2200 and are alumni and rather or not the skills learned from information internetworks such as networking and info security ended up becoming extremely useful for work. For a typical software engineer, I doubt it matters but I'm still curious. Also curious about people who have switched their threads and ended up loving their decisions."

well, I don't know how I am going to do it, so I am here for some advice. I am French and I hold a bachelor degree in International Business. However, I decided to make a career change recently (I am 22). I am currently learning Computer Science and I already asked the Director of my undergrad program to write a professional recommendation letter around 1 year ago for me for an investment banking internship abroad.

My decision to make a career change came quite late (February 2018) and closing dates for MS in CS applications are often in December. However, I am still in the proccess to apply to 1 school in the US and another in the UK. Both required 3 letters of recommendation. I am not sure I am going to get in. 

If not, I am also planning to apply to around 10 school in the US and in the Canada for September 2019 intake. However, I will still have to wait 1 more year...

So should I contact the director of my undergrad for a recommendation this year? If I am rejected, it's going to be a shame to ask her to another letter. I don't know how to handle the situation...

thanks"

8de010,2,2018-04-19,Passion or Practicality?,AzaleaCartwright,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8de010/passion_or_practicality/,"I'm working in an MUN club as its Program Member and will be Chair for one of its conference in July. Honestly I really love working in this club - I like public speaking, the people in here are nice, and it gives me a sense of community I yearn to have.

The problem is, it takes up pretty much of my time. And I want to go into STEM in college. And MUN is not that related to STEM.

I mean, if I try, I'm still able to fit it in my schedule, and if my schedule is too hectic I can always ask for my work to be reduced. But I'm still a member of the club - I really don't want to slack off and join just for the sake of joining, especially when the conference is so near.

These days, whenever I open my laptop to have an online meeting with my teammates, if my parents happen to find out, they would scold me and not allow me to do anything MUN-related.

The same thing happens with my internships.

Getting to work in the lab has forever been my dream (I want to go into research), and I kept nagging my parents about wanting to get an internship, but they wouldn't consider it. That was until they met a college counselor who promoted having ECs related to my major that they allowed me to.

But even then, internships take up a lot of time, and it's not like I'm allowed to do that much in the lab being a high school student, and that the lab room is rather far from my house. The lab at which I have my internship is pretty chill, like I can come however many hours a week I want to and they still guarantee a certificate at the end. The disadvantage is only on my side, which is that I don't get to work alongside a complete research, thus losing an opportunity to fully understand it.

And so these days whenever I leave the house to go to the lab my parents would be rather annoyed (especiallty when it is the exam season - final exams next week, AP exams in May, SAT II in June, etc.) Like, going there 2 days/week is already little enough for me, now they even want me to reduce it to 1 day/week.

On the other hand, my parents guilt-tripped me into registering for the ABRSM piano exam to get a certificate (with the mind set that it will show the applicant as a well-rounded person, thus increasing my chance). Okay, so it was me at the end who agreed to sign up for it, but how can I not when I keep hearing about how much it will help me woth the application process? The problem is, I'm not that passionate about playing the piano - I don't dislike it, I just don't love it enough.

Like, I would get lazy when I have to drag myself to the piano to practice, but I would not give a second thought to be online and work with my MUN team or sit in a car for 30' to get to the lab room. On the other hand, my parents continuously ""force"" me to practice the piano, but when I wanna do anything MUN- or internship-related my parents would discourage me from it.

But really, my parents have a point.

The Asian educational curriculum is already harsh enough (I'm an Asian international), piling up with all the standardized tests, I really have to focus on maintaining my GPA and having good stats (stats are not everything, yes, but they are something).

ECs related, however much I commit myself to the activities, the list will still be the same - I'm still that MUN club's member and I still get that internship no matter how much effort I spend on it, when on the other hand the amount of effort I put into playing the piano would determine whether I get the certificate or not.

Some of you may say that it would help with my essays. But come to think of it, how much would I be able to include in the essay? My passion is already there; I will never stop loving them. And however much experience I have, I shall talk about them in like a few sentences at most. I guess it doesn't make that much difference.

Here people emphasize a lot the importance of ECs that we're passionate about. But when all things considered, how true is it when there are other things to be taken into account?

What should I do?

TL;DR: There are ECs that I'm passionate about but might not be that helpful in the application process and vice versa. Which one should I choose? Passion or practicality?"

I got my first computer when I was 6, and built my first computer when I was 12. I loved preforming little script-kiddy hacks on the school, and just generally dabled in your average tech nerdiness. I had aspirations for MIT, but that was definitely unrealistic.

From K-6th grade, I attended a charter school that did not use a grading scale, but instead a pass fail system, so I never properly learned the significance of grades. By the time I learned how the grade letter system worked, I already had my first C. From that point on, I kept my 3.0 average but not much higher from there.

Throughout 9th and 10th grade I continued to pursue CS, but I never managed to learn anything more than HTML/CSS and some basic C++. However, by pure luck at the end of  my 10th grade year, I won my school's film festival in first place for my catagory. 

(https://youtu.be/fKJ5eyGE8fM)

This completely changed my career aspirations towards film, and I've worked on it ever since. However, I've noticed that some of the others that seem more destined to move on seem more interested than me. I only tend to do filming when I have to, and while I have a reputation for always doing well, I can't say I always enjoy it. 

In the world of film, I also have connections to a few tv shows and have an internship secured with NBC in NYC. I'm not so worried that I won't be able to make a career out of this, just whether I'll enjoy it. 

Currently, I'm attempting to get into FSU to pursue a bachelor's in film.

What should I do reddit? Should I continue going after film, or go back to computers?

First of all sorry if I made any mistake posting here, this is actually the first time I post something on reddit. Also excuse my grammar (or english in general) as this is not my mother tongue.

So, I'll try to be short on this. I am an european guy in my early 30's, I joined the family business 3 ayers ago after 2 years working for a multinational finance firm in a foreign country. It is something I really wanted to do and after college I was lucky enough to get a grant and an internship in this country.

The problem is that my father runs a successful company of about 30 employees. He was not happy when I told him I got that grant and that I was going to work abroad. The truth is that communication between us has never been near good. We get along, it's just we don't talk too much about serious things as he is a bit of a tough guy and pretty strict if you know what I mean. So everytime we skyped or talked always had to remind me about my low salary and how much money I could make with him or even how shitty the weather was where I was living...etc. He always had comments that actually hurted me. He never had good words or showed pride...nothing (I know I should only care about what i think about myself but after all he is my father, he has given me everything to become who I was).

So I left. The day I told my boss I was leaving I felt like I was cutting my wings off....

Nevertheless I came to work with him and took the opportunity withy open arms, I was really motivated to show I could do it very well, but after 2 months I realised this was not what I wanted for me.

Nowadays: So, after not very good 3 years I am still working here but don't feel I am growing personally at all, I'm stuck. Professionally I am, obviously, but I have the feeling I could be growing more where I was. I actually feel a bit empty, like if I am wasting my life doing something I never wanted to do (working systematically 12h per day doesn't help to look for other things to enjoy with or projects or whatever could make me happy). I need to say like a year ago I got a job in that country but when I told my parents they actually told me such an ""ugly"" and personal things that I broke down and rejected the job....

So, it took me some time with a therapist but now I believe I am ready to take the step and move back where I was really happy once and do what i always wanted to do: make my own path, but as many of you probably know this is difficult as hell .This is certainly the most difficult and complicated decision I have had to make in my whole life. It is so emotive, I fucking feel I am leaving the family, not only the business but I guess if you guys have been in my shoes you know what I mean.

The thing is that I wanted to read experiences of people who left the family business and had to deal with all of the stress and emotions that come with this decision. How did you tell them? How did you prepare yourself for such a huge step? How do you see the whole process now that you are out? I know there's a lot of people who has been in my situation but it is hard to find them so I hope I can hear your stories here in Reddit and hopefully this thread could help some others in such situation.

Thanks in advance to all of you who took the time to read this and specially answering.

Cheers!"

Or do I need to keep learning?,dubiousrex,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8dg5zl/am_i_actually_ready_to_work_or_do_i_need_to_keep/,"I am a college senior graduating next month with a B.S. in CIS. I go to a small liberal arts college that doesn't have a very big CIS program. My school taught us a semester of Visual Basic (as our first OOP class), a semester of Python, and 2 - 3 semesters of Java. The Java classes I took focused on how to code in Java, Data structures, sorting methods, and some application/UI development. I have also taken a class on Databases (MySQL and Microsoft Access), basic HTML and CSS, a System Analysis and Design class, and learned a small amount of C++/C# on my own.

I have applied to a heap of junior level positions for Java development and have only gotten back a few replies (only one of which has gotten to an initial interview). A lot of the positions I've applied for have not only asked for experience in Java, but experience in .NET, PHP, Spring, REST, J2EE, JSON, Apache, Bootstrap, Node.js, SOAP, JDBC, and a myriad of other things across job postings I've seen. It's been stressful. I've felt increasingly that my college education hasn't prepared me for what employers are expecting in an entry-level hire. The biggest red flag for me is that many preliminary questions I get ask what Frameworks I am familiar with, but we have never covered Frameworks in school. This may have been my fault for not researching beyond my classes, but it never occurred to me how much I would need in addition to my classes.

I just want to ask, am I freaking out? Am I not really as horribly under qualified as I think I am? Or do I need to take a step back from applying and take time to pick up all the information I'm missing on my own (ex: Take out time to learn .NET)? I have been contacted by some of those third-party agencies that set you up with 12-week training before putting you with a client. They sound very interesting, but the relocation aspect of those deals make me unsure if that is the right choice. Ex: I have been offered $8-$13/hr for 12 week training with varying relocation compensation amounts. It makes me nervous since the pay is less than the internship I had (which is understandable) but in more expensive areas. 

Thank you for reading and responding."

I then proceeded to alternate fail/pass with C most of my classes at a private engineering\-focused college for the next 2.5 years before I finally realized even if I got through it, a lot of my troubles originated int the fact I hated what I was doing.  I changed majors to CS, transferred to a state college closer to home and have been much happier since.

Problem is, when I transferred, I did not realize my new school was one of the few that included transfer grades as part of their GPA.  I knew I wouldn't get honors or anything, and I knew those classes would be on my transcript, but I hadn't expected to have to deal with that in the GPA the college uses for everything \(including graduation eligibility\).  Kicker is that the college changed policies \(forced by state board to stop inclusion of transfer classes in GPA for NEW students\) after I transferred but continues to enforce the old on people like me.  

So right now I have a 3.1 ""institution"" GPA \(aka my cs major\), and a 2.6 overall/reported GPA thanks to my engineering classes and going from pure A/B/C/D/F to \+/\- scales.  That GPA has basically disqualified me from most internships the school handles, and the outside ones I could apply to I assume I was auto\-screened out as I've had no responses over 2 summers.  I'm also having to move completely outside my school's ""zone of influence"" after graduation \(next semester\).

Like title says, how screwed am I trying to get into CS \(directly\).  Would it be considered scummy/ instant no hire to put my institution GPA on resumes to try and get to an interview in the first place and then later explain why my transcript will say the overall?  Would I be better off grinding out a year or two in a more IT level job for ""experience"" and trying to jump out/up from there?  Would getting something like a OCP or MTA \(database\) certification help offset the GPA enough to get in interviews?  I'm perfectly fine throwing disproportionate energy into virtually any entry level job to start out, I just really worry I won't get the chance to."

Before getting into projects, academically and professionally, I, like many others, thought that gathering people with technical skills was sufficient to reach a project goal. 

I have had enough experiences in groups, teams both professionally and academically that have shown me that projects are benefitted from a more careful/systematic approach than the haphazard approach.  

From what I know so far, it seems that this falls under the purview of ""Project Management"" and ""Leadership""

I am a Junior majoring in computer science here at purdue. I received an internship offer for summer 2018 from a well known large computing company.

I informed my academic advisor of these choice of classes well before hand and she told me it was fine. I met with the ISS at Purdue today and they informed me there was nothing they could do about the situation and I should have been more aware of these rules beforehand even though literally no one informed me of them. Also I feel as if we should have a proactive system in place where when students register for classes we inform them about the consequences rather than after they have conpleted them. I'm feeling extremely down today because my qualifications as a candidate for a full time employee will go down significantly and if I don't get a job before I graduate I will get kicked out of the country.

I finished school in December with a killer resume and a conquer-the-world attitude. I was supposed to have a job lined up working for a former professor. 

January came and the professor was not getting back to me. I wasn't worried, I had some money saved, and I live with my boyfriend who is always more than happy to help cover a few extra expenses (we normally split 50/50 - he works full time in a different industry). I find out that the job is no longer going to work out. Details are irrelevant, but it was no one's fault.

February. I buff up my resume and get several responses back quickly. I'm feeling good. I'm running low on cash, but not out yet. I lean on my credit card because with the rate of response, I'm expecting to be employed soon. That doesn't happen. (For the record, I have industry experience from two internships, and impressive references). A friend almost gets me a job at his company but they announce a hiring freeze the day before my interview.

March. My credit card is maxed. I only paid about a third of the rent. I get a job, only to show up and realize I'm going to be essentially scamming people, and I witness some VERY unprofessional behaviour, so I leave. My motivation is slowly draining. You have to understand, I am a real over-achiever. In school I had a 3.7 GPA, loads of extra-curriculars, and always held down a part-time job (through the school, so couldn't keep it post-graduation). I'm also very extroverted. Now suddenly I'm sitting on my butt all day, accomplishing nothing, on my own. I'm still pumping out resumes like crazy because the few extra dollars I have, I can buy a coffee and sit in a coffee shop to work instead of suffocating in my basement apartment.

April. My boyfriend has to pay all of the rent. I feel horrible about it, but he tells me over and over that he doesn't mind. I see that his wallet is thin now too. My phone bill comes in and I have an anxiety attack. I ask my parents for whatever money they can spare and I get $200 - that immediately gets sucked away by my transit card and my cell phone bill. I am in my apartment seven days a week. I'm getting out less and less resumes because I simply can't find the energy. I get a few calls about jobs here and there, but all of them make it very clear that I am one of many candidates, and none hire me, yet when I have my resume critiqued and practice interviews, the Career Advisor tells me I'm very hireable and just need to be patient. I go for long walks but I'm still isolated. I live pretty far from my friends, so it's hard to even get them to visit, and visiting them always costs money, at least for transit. I miss friends birthdays because I can't afford a meal out. I finally get a part-time job working the take-out counter at a diner, but I'm only working minimum wage 10 hours a week. I can't get another part-time because everywhere I apply wants weekends, which I have already committed to this job. My credit card is maxed and I'm getting calls that they will permanently shut down my card soon. May is approaching and I have absolutely nothing to pay for rent. I have $43 in my bank account. I will also reach my max on my cell phone bill soon and they will turn that off. I'm tired, anxious, and I feel defeated. I have a degree with honours from one of the best schools in the country and can't get a job after four whole months. I am out of ideas and out of energy. 

Thank you for reading this ramble. I appreciate any and all advice. (Except don't tell me to move back in with my parents - Just not an option. Too complicated to explain.)"

Here is kind of an explanation of what has been going on this last few months. I live in the greater Minnesota area. I had a previous internship at a company last spring that was absolutely terrible. I stuck it out until they didn’t need me, but I knew I needed something else on my resume. At the fall career fair, I was talking to a representative at a small manufacturing company, which led to an interview and an offer for a spring internship in my field (Supply Chain). The internship is supposed to go from January until mid-June, and I was excited. Now it is the beginning of April, and I have had my fill on this “internship”. I have strongly disliked it from the first week I started. First off, it’s a 45 minute commute one way. I also attend class full time, and the fact that they told me in the interview they need someone who could work at least 25 hours, and after I accepted the offer I was put on for 31 hours five days a week. Right off the bat, I am working more hours and days than I want for a full time student.

To be frank, this internship has affected me in a way that I don’t like. I’ve become depressed, and dread going in every week. My SO notices it too. The work is not what I was expecting. It’s become boring and stale. It is cold calling. Cold calling 31 hours a week, five days a week, trying to get trucking companies to haul for us. I can’t stand it. They pay isn’t that great either, but this was an internship for academic credit, so I stayed. Knowing how miserable I was and still am, I started looking for greener pastures and found it. A big, well know company in the area, wants to bring me on for a summer internship starting May 21st. The headquarters where I would be working is only 15-20 minutes away, and offer significantly more pay for things I want to be doing in my field. After reviewing the requirements for academic credit, I have exceeded the 240 hours needed to be completed. Even if I didn’t and did not receive academic credit for it, I could just take an elective next semester and still graduate on time.

Here is where things get complicated. First, the company likes me. They have discussed with me about the internship being extended into the summer, and possibly being brought on full time. I like the people there, but I am miserable. I didn’t commit to anything, and told them before I had another offer I would have to make an informed decision. I also found out Friday that another intern is quitting the same time I would be, which would eliminate two out of the three interns. I would also be leaving the internship before the end date of mid-June.

Even though this job has made me want to walk out, I still worked hard and I did the best job I could. I would plan on giving them a two week notice, but I don’t want to burn any bridges. I would like a reference out of this, since my reference from my previous internship is no longer with the company. I guess I am afraid that they will be upset, and will not let me use them as a reference, for leaving the internship before mid-June.

I could use some advice on this. I feel trapped."

I've finished all of my computer-related classes and am pretty good at software development (I'm just taking some science and writing distribution classes now). I have a job lined up to start in a few months, and overall I'm satisfied with the direction my life has taken, and I know I'm lucky to be in this position.

The problem is that my mental health has been steadily declining over the past couple years.  I've been diagnosed with a few different mental illnesses, which work together to ensure that either I'm paralized by anxiety or I feel like everything is hopeless and I can't stop crying.  I'm seeing a psychiatrist who keeps prescribing me different medications (currently an antidepressant to take in the morning, a different antidepressant to take at night, a pill to take before exams, and a strong anti-anxiety pill to take when I feel like I'm on the verge of a panic attack), and every time I start a new one I feel dizzy/naseous for a couple weeks while my body gets used to it.

My declining mental health has paralleled a decline in my grades.  I failed one class last semester, and this semester I'm on track to fail two classes that I need to graduate.  There's a chance that I could pass everything if I work really hard for the next few weeks, but I already feel like I'm working as hard as I can all the time and still falling behind.  The stress makes everything so much worse.

I know that I can be a more or less functional human being when I don't have the pressures that the school environment brings.  Last summer I had an internship with the company that I'm going to work for in a couple months, and I got by really well with just a low dose of an antidepressant.  I still had some bad days, but even on those days I could still get through my 9-5 and then get to bed early and take care of myself.  I need to be out of school and back into a lower-stress environment.

I don't know what to do.  My vague plan is that I'll do my best for the rest of the semester so that I only fail 1-2 classes and will be mostly done with my degree.  Then I could go work for the company that has agreed to hire me (they never explicitly said that I need to finish my degree before I start work, although they did say they would do a background check).  I could spend a year at this company, doing software development and also seeing a psychiatrist to work through my issues and find medications that will work for me.  Then I could come back and do one more semester at university, which would be easier because I would only have 1-2 required classes and could fill the rest of my schedule with low-stress stuff.  At that point I would have a degree, some money saved, and job experience, which would put me in a really good place to move forward.

I don't want to go back to school next semester because I would like some time off to work through my issues, and also I've missed financial aid application deadlines for the coming semester since I wasn't planning on returning, and I haven't found any housing.

The biggest obstacle in my plan is that I'm not sure if the company will fire me when/if they find out that I haven't finished my degree, and I don't know how easy it is to find a decent job without a degree.  Do you think I can find a good job?  Should I talk to the company and try to work something out?  What should I do?"

8dia1d,8,2018-04-19,UCI (CSE) vs. Purdue (CS)??,NeelZilla,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8dia1d/uci_cse_vs_purdue_cs/,"After considering my options, I have come down to two choices: UCI for CSE and Purdue for CS. After cutting it down these two, however, I'm having a hard time deciding between the two schools. Both have almost equal costs thanks to scholarships from Purdue, both have great campuses, both have great extracurricular &amp; job opportunities, and both have great CS/engineering programs. 

At first, it seems like Purdue would be the better choice as it has a prestigious name throughout the world that will possibly open many opportunities during and after college. Many companies have partnered with Purdue to give specific advantage to Purdue CS students for internship and job applications. Also, the resources available to CS students were amazing, and in general the community and professors seems a lot more passionate and supportive. I have also heard from my research online and students I talked to on campus that, even though studying for CS is tough af and an absolute grind, students that go through Purdue's CS program genuinely learn difficult CS concepts very well because of its exceptionally great professors and resources. The weather can get pretty cold, however, and Lafayette is kinda in the middle of nowhere lol.

There are many pros and cons of UCI too. I prefer UCI's SoCal location to Purdue, UCI has a dedicated CS department, and, having stayed there for COSMOS, really like the campus and environment. Also, the Irvine area itself has many great tech companies and LA and SD are very close by. At same time, because of its location, UCI is very familiar to what I have grown up with, both in terms of the physical area's environment and neighborhood, and the student body's culture and demographics. This is a good and bad thing as it might make it easier to fit in, but I also do want a new and diverse college experience that takes me out of the bubble I've always been in. Also, I have heard UCI is a commuter school for a large portion of the students and may not be as socially active as I wish, unlike Purdue, as it is a big 10 school. Also, UCI does not have the same ""brand name"" as Purdue may have. 

Having lived in Cali my entire life and stayed at UCI COSMOS for a month, the emotional part of me feels like a sunny 4 years at UCI would be awesome. At the same time, other than the location and weather, I feel like Purdue is objectively better in every single way, and after visiting, Purdue seems like it would be loads of fun as well and a great learning experience. I would be genuinely excited to join either school, and I'm honestly leaning to Purdue right now. Which school do you suggest? Should I go with my gut or what is objectively right for me? How are you guys choosing between colleges and, if you're a current college student, how did you choose between colleges?"

8die0y,3,2018-04-19,Should I do an internal transfer into Engineering?,cest-la-vie18,Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/8die0y/should_i_do_an_internal_transfer_into_engineering/,"So I'm a rising freshman (class of 2022) and currently accepted into HumEc as a PAM major. I've been thinking for a while and am considering perhaps transferring into the Engineering school for CS.

I'm deciding to look into CS because I'm realizing that law isn't something I want to do. Additionally, law school seems like a long and expensive process that I'm not so sure I'd be totally invested in. Considering other practical careers I may also enjoy, CS is an option. I'm also very impressed with Cornell's reputation and clout with Engineering. I don't particularly have a love/affinity for math, but I'm pretty decent (read: slightly above average).  But if I put in work, I think I could manage. I've done some mediocre work with computers, but didn't take AP CS.

It's just a bit weird to think about since I've been so set on the pre-law track since my freshman year of HS. I do know that Engineering and particularly CS is super cutthroat here. I've been in a competitive academic environment having attended a top private northeastern HS but I'm told Cornell is a different beast. I am very social and am worried about having to sacrifice my social life. Most of the engineer kids I spoke with during Cornell Days were very cynical about their college experience and stressed that they ""sold their soul to Cornell Engineering"" (real quote lmao). Yet many of them also touched upon the great internships and opportunities they were offered which made it all worthwhile.

What do you all think? Is it worth trying to transfer or will I just fuck up my GPA? Any non-genius CS majors? Is this something I should do only if I'm 100% confident in my math skills?

1. I have no family/friends in that city; there's no relocation bonus and it'll be expensive for me to live in it. I've never lived away from home so I can't budget precisely, but I expect the costs of rent+food+transportation to take up about 1/3rd to 1/2th of my pay.
2. Earlier this week, I finished an interview for a very similar internship role in the public sector (government). I feel like I did really well in the interview, and they'll get back to me towards the end of next week. IF I do get an offer, I expect it to be around the same pay based on my personal and friend's experiences.

However, the retail company's offer expires early next week, and I'm not sure if I should accept it, or decline it and hope that I get the government gig. 

Another thing is I'm not sure if it would be better on my resume if I have a private company listed, because right now I already have 1 previous government internship, so if I take another one then I'll have 2, and I'm not sure if that'll affect the chances of me breaking into the private industry later on. 

If anyone could give any advice, then that would be greatly appreciated."

I was in the computing theory research group at my university and the bulk of my research was done in the realm of computability and complexity theory.

I'm somewhat uninterested in continuing down the path of academia so I made the decision to move into industry. While I was a bachelor's student I had two summer internships where I worked as a software engineer so software engineering isn't exactly new to me.

I did my PhD at a top 50 CS program in the world (located in Europe) but I've since moved back to the US and I am staying with my parents in the New England area temporarily while I find a job. I've been applying to quite a few positions and I have had several onsite interviews now. Since my research was focused on computability and complexity theory the algorithm questions in the technical interviews have all been fairly straightforward to me and there hasn't been a single one that I have gotten wrong so far. However, I haven't been getting any offers.

I'm wondering if I am just applying to the wrong jobs. I've been applying to new grad positions as I definitely don't have 3-5 years of experience and experience with all of the technologies listed for mid-level positions. Is it possible that I am overqualified for new grad positions given my background, or could it be something else? "

8djs3v,9,2018-04-19,Ida Black,zimmer199,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8djs3v/ida_black/,"For the past year I've been a medicine resident at a large midwestern hospital. For the most part it's been great, but there's something going on and I needed to tell someone. 

It all started around September. I was on my Gastroenterology rotation seeing consults for my attending. I got a page (yes, we still use pagers here) telling me to see a patient in the ICU, room 219. The page said ""dysphagia."" I was a little confused as to why somebody would be in the ICU with difficulty swallowing, but hey, I don't get paid to question the higher ups. I went to the unit and found a computer. I opened the chart; patient's name is Ida Black, 89 year old Female with past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD, Diabetes, and had a hysterectomy ten years ago. I read the admission note: presented with difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids. Vital signs normal, offering no other complaints. This doesn't make sense, why is she in the ICU? Emergency Dept. note says she's not been able to eat since last week, but nothing about malnourishment, weakness, no fever/ chills. ICU note says basically same thing. I look at the assessment and plan, and the only thing written is ""dysphagia, consult GI.""

There had to be more to this story I thought. I wrote down her vital signs (all normal) and went to see her. I pulled back the curtain and was met with an elderly woman sitting in the hospital bed staring at the TV. I don't remember what she was watching, but she seemed engrossed in it, barely even acknowledging my presence. 

""Hello Ms. Black, I'm Dr. Zim,"" I introduced myself. ""How are you this morning?""

She turned to look to me and started talking. Incomprehensible word salad. Seems like she had dementia, nobody mentioned that. Just to be polite I continued talking to her. 

""I'm with the Gastroenterology team,"" I said. ""The Intensivist asked us to see you for your difficulty swallowing. I understand you haven't been able to eat in a week.""

She nodded and started babbling again. 

""Ok, I think we need to do an upper endoscopy. Basically we need to stick a camera down your throat to see what's going on in your food tube and address anything we find. Are you okay with that?"" I said. I was aware that we would probably need to get consent from somebody else, but couldn't hurt to just pretend to get her to be okay with it. 

She nodded. 

I left the room and found her nurse sitting at a computer behind the desk at the nurses' station. I introduced myself and explained the tenitive plan to do the endoscopy, and asked who should consent. The nurse told me that Ida didn't have any family in the area and her church leader was her healthcare power of attorney. I had never heard of this, as usually they'd at least find the next of kin, but the nurse provided documentation that the church leader was POA. At the time I guess it seemed legit. 

I went back to the GI office and found my attending. He was a middle aged Asian man known for being a very hard working, no nonsense kind of guy. I expected some sort of blowback from him for this case, as it normally happens when you get a bullshit consult. I prepared myself and presented the case, emphasizing that I wasn't sure why she was in the ICU and that most things about this case seemed really bizarre. 

He nodded after I finished my presentation and simply said ""yeah, I agree. Schedule the endoscopy to be done in the ICU for tomorrow.""

That's it? No questions about what's going on? I reiterated that something didn't make sense here. I asked him what he thought was going on. 

""Don't worry about it,"" he said. 

The next day I made rounds. As I usually do, I ended in the ICU with Ida being my last patient. As I went to see her, the nurse caught me. 

""Oh, hey Zim. So Ida's POA was by earlier. She declined the scope. She wants to pursue DNR- comfort care only,"" she said. 

""Wait,"" I said in a state of surprise. ""What do you mean? She's fine. You're not even giving her IV nutrition.""

""Oh, her respiratory status is failing,"" said the nurse. 

""Since when?"" I asked as the nurse walked away to talk to another nurse. 

I went in to see Ida. She was breathing hard on an oxygen mask. It seemed like a rapid decline at the time, but I guess she was sicker than I thought. I asked her how she was doing, to which she didn't respond. I did my exam, and her lungs sounded clear. I would have expected to hear diminished sounds or crackles with how heavy she was breathing, but nothing. This just kept getting weirder. Since we weren't doing the endoscopy, I didn't see anything else for my service to do. I turned to walk away. 

""HELP ME!"" I heard. 

I turned back and Ida was looking at me with fear in her eyes. I stood there in shock for a second before turning back to the curtain. I went and found the nurse to bring her into the room. 

""Oh, she is breathing pretty hard now,"" said the nurse without any concern in her voice. ""Let me get her some more morphine."" I tried to explain what happened, how lucidly she asked for help. But the nurse just dismissed me. 

Her nurse gave her some more morphine and she calmed down. I tried to get her to talk more, but she was too sedated from the morphine and ended up falling asleep. It was my last day on the service so I just let it go. Starting the next morning I'd be handling different patients under different doctors, and I was looking forward to putting this whole thing behind me. I found out later that Ida died that night. 

I spend the next few months doing hospital work and off service rotations. I'd all but forgot about this whole ordeal. Until I had my ICU month. My first day I walked into the unit past room 219 and felt a chill. Probably a leak in the window, it was snowing and it was 5am. God I hate early mornings, and never got why they had to start us at 5am. 

I went in to the room to shut the window. There was some old guy on the ventilator hooked up to several IV drips laying in the bed. Typical ICU patient. When I got there, I saw the window was closed. I checked the vents, blowing warm air. But the room still felt unusually cold. That couldn't have been good for the patient. I asked the nurse if anyone was looking into it. She said nobody had noticed it being cold, but she'd look into it. 

I never had any patients in room 219 for some reason, always seemed to be on the nonteaching service or it was empty. But whenever I walked by that room, it seemed so cold. Was anyone taking care of that? One day I asked my other residents if they noticed how cold the room was. 

""No? I haven't noticed that,"" said one of the ortho residents that was on ICU service.

""Me neither,"" said another resident. The others in the room agreed. Was this all in my head?

To say it was odd was an understatement. But whatever, I was very busy and thinking of it was just a distraction. Besides, I had no reason to be concerned. Then I transitioned to nights for the last five days of the month, and the real fuckery began. 

The first night I was called to room 218, a patient of ours had his blood pressure drop. As I was tending to him I noticed next door frost was developing on the floor in front of the door. I could feel the chill almost blowing at my face as I investigated. One of the nurses later told me that somebody had spilled saline earlier and must not have cleaned it up well. No, this was frozen, I was sure of it. 

The second night I was walking by room 219, I saw the frost again. I figured I was just overtired and hallucinating or something; it had been a long month. Then I heard faint cat-like screams coming from somewhere, the kind old demented ladies make when they think somebody is hurting them. I needed more sleep. 

The third night, I heard the screams again, but louder. I thought I was going crazy as I had pretty much slept from the minute I got home until an hour before my shift started, figure 10hr. No way I was still that level of tired. I happened to walk by room 219, and I got a whiff of this smell. I can't describe it, but it smelled like a funeral home. That smell was ingrained into my head from the time I was 10 and attended my grandmother's funeral and wake. I never forgot it, and I couldn't explain why I smelled it that night. 

The fourth night, the smell and the screams got even more noticeable. Now every time I went to the second floor walking through the door I could feel immediately colder. Still, the nurses didn't notice anything different. I convinced myself that I was just overworked and tried to ignore everything. Then around 3am I was making rounds and I looked towards the end of the hall. Room 219 sat in such a way that the opening was at the end of the hall, and the door was open. I could see inside, a pair of glowing orange eyes. I blinked and they were still there, and they looked like they were staring right at me. I was quite perturbed at this, and silently left the floor and refused to go back. 

The fifth night I refused to go to the second floor. Nurses would call and I would just put in orders or tell them what to do. Normally I pride myself in always seeing the patient and making my own clinical decisions, but not this night. That was until I got a page from a nurse named Jamie. 

""Hi, are you the ICU intern?"" Jamie asked. 

""I am,"" I said. ""What's going on?""

""Well, I have a patient in room 219. He just got admitted. He's complaining of some chest pain. I got an EKG, and I need somebody to read it. I know he's not on your service but I can't reach the admitting doc,"" she said. 

Fuck! I have to go see this patient, no choice. So I go to the room and it's freezing. I look in the chart for an EKG, there is none. The only other papers in the chart are his facesheet and insurance information, and I see his name is John. I look around and there are no nurses. Then I entered the room to see the patient, leaving the lights off as to not disturb the patient. He was a youngish man, seemingly in his early 50s. He lay there intubated on a ventilator. I noticed the vent was giving him full support. He was motionless on the bed. I called out ""Hey John!"" No answer. I rub his sternum, again nothing. ""Are you having any pain?"" I ask. Nothing. Was this a joke? Last day for the new resident gag?

As if I wasn't cold enough, I felt a wave of painful cold sweep over me, and I felt a shiver in my spine. I looked up and in the corner of the room I saw an older woman sitting in a chair. Her eyes glowed a bright orange, and in the moonlight her skin was wrinkled and gray appearing. She had the appearance of death, and her gaze left me paralyzed with fear. She looked familiar but I didn't remember where I saw her before. 

""Zim!"" she hissed. Her voice felt like ice, almost mechanical in nature. ""You could have saved me! You could have saved me!""

The next thing I know I'm running out of the room down the hall. Nurses looked up at me and seemed confused. But fuck that, I wanted to get out of there as fast as I could. As I approach the door that leads to the waiting room, I reach out to push the handle. The door swung open without me touching it. 

Turns out that door was automatic, and that's what automatic doors do. I ran to the third floor where signout was happening. I told the new day team what I just experienced. I told them about Jamie and the strange things that happened in room 219. The senior resident pulled up the census and informed me that there was no patient in room 219, and there hadn't been for several weeks. The charge nurse also informed me that there was no nurse named Jamie who worked in the ICU. Everyone laughed and told me to go home and get some sleep. 

I gathered my stuff and went home. I made up my mind to see a therapist and decided that I would do serious rest on my vacation that was a week away. Maybe I even needed to take a leave of absence for longer. As I drove down the road while the sun slowly rose over the snow, I finally realized that it was Ida. She died in Room 219. She told me to help her, and I didn't. She blamed me for her death. I don't know why, but I definitely think there's something going on at my hospital, and I'm afraid something might happen again. Maybe I need to figure it out, or maybe just bide my time until I graduate and move on. All I know is I can't go back to ICU 219. 

I've since moved onto hospital service, and it's much less labor intensive. We have a closed ICU, so I don't have to go see patients there. I haven't seen or experienced any more paranormal activity since I left the ICU. Well, except for the other day when I got a call from the ER. They had a patient they felt needed to be admitted for social reasons. Those are always a joy /s. This guy comes to the ED and they determine he's not safe to return home because he can't take care of himself. Medicine gets a ton of stuff dumped on us because nobody wants to do it. Anyway, I went to the ED to see this patient and as I approached I could hear the nurse telling him that the hospitalist will be in shortly to admit him to the hospital. With a shrill almost robotic voice I could hear the man say ""I thank you. Say, have you seen my briefcase?""

As I knocked and pulled back the curtain, I saw the man sitting in a chair dressed in a suit with bowtie and wearing a [bowler hat](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2br373/the_men_in_bowler_hats_update/)

I realize there are a ton of these questions out there, and I don't like pulling the ""I'm special"" card but I do believe that my situation isn't as common.

I'm a senior in high school taking cyber security classes. So far I've earned my A+ and Security+, I'll be testing for my CCENT within a month, and by the end of June, I will be testing for Cisco's CyberOps certification.

As of last November, my school has sponsored me to work in the IT department of a government contractor as an intern and it has been great. A colleague of mine is now a freshman in college. He had been sponsored by my school the year before and has the same certifications as I do. If all goes well, they will hire me as a full-time employee for the summer, then I'll go back to part-time when I start college, which is similar to the agreement that was worked out with my colleague.

During a conversation my colleague and I had about saving cars, we talked about how much of our paycheck should go to car payments and I realized he had a much larger budget than I did. I guess he saw my confusion and told me how much he was getting paid (which was 50% more than me) and he told me that it was like that from the start, despite the both of us asking for the same amount when we first came on board. I responded with how much I was making and I received an equally puzzled look.

Again, this is not out of jealousy, but after some of the projects I've taken part of, or led for that matter, I feel like I should at least have a small bump in pay. The company is great and the IT team itself is the best I could ask for so I don't want to come off as an a** when asking, nor do I want to lose my job over it.

Some of the projects include:
- Implementing company wide (With multiple locations) Dot1x authentication
- Unpacking and updating 14th Gen Dell servers to install ESXi
- Patch ESXi and migrate ~75 VMs from old infrastructure to new servers
- Upgrade primary server network to 25G fiber from 1G copper
- Switch upgrades for 3 locations
- Level 1&amp;2 tech support
- Update automated system imaging

Given my situation, how would I go about asking, and how much is considered a reasonable amount for someone with my qualifications in this industry?"

I felt that it was one of the best interviews I've ever had, and was certain that I got the job. As the weeks passed by, I received no call or email, and no information when requesting an update. I had decided to just move on from the position. Unexpectedly, today I got a call telling me that a candidate that they hired has backed out, and I was their next choice. Now, my question is, should I take it, knowing that I  was a second tier candidate to them? Won't everyone in the office know that I was a second choice, and they just picked me to fill a spot? The offer isn't great, so I'm not over the moon about that. However, I also don't have any other offers, so I'm considering still accepting.

A year ago, I met an amazing girl who lives on the West Coast, and we've been dating ever since in a long-distance relationship. Though we fly out to see each other frequently, I always wish we could be closer to see each other more often. 

Recently, I lucked out and got an internship in the city where my S.O. lives, so I get to spend three months in the summer with her. After the summer, chances are the company will give me a full-time return offer for after my semester. I see this as the perfect opportunity to finally be with her permanently, but with one caveat; I will be leaving my family in Michigan, and living on the other side of the country away from them.

On one hand, I am deeply in love with my S.O., and see her as that special once-in-a-lifetime partner that I never want to let go. On the other hand, I feel incredible guilt leaving my parents, especially as they grow old and wish for the company of their son. 

My plea for advice is simply this: should I make the move to the West Coast?
Assuming that:

- My decision doesn't depend on company/job or location

- I will happily remain together with my S.O., should I move out to the WC

- There are no guarantees about the future of my relationship with my S.O, should I stay in the Midwest

I'm graduating from a Computer Science program from a U.S. public university, and the department ranks between 20 and 30 nationally. I really wanted to go to MS+PhD combined program directly without MS, but now I'm in panic and not sure what I should do.. Anyone who has knowledge or experience please help me making decisions!

- I am an international student on F-1 visa.
- gpa 3.94/4.00 for 5 semesters of undergraduate program, and this is my last semester.
- I received an automatic admission to MS program from the department of the same uni. I can start any semester I want for next few years. This is not very appealing, however, because I already took lot of graduate classes of my interest, and the department will not take that as MS credits and will force me to take other classes that's not of my interest. But in the worst case scenario, it is an option. I might have higher chance of getting TA-ship as MS if I come back to the same uni, and there is a professor I like (although he is too busy :/ ). 
- I had an internship and going to work full time after graduation, but I know this is irrelevant for PhD admission.
- I have received a scholarship from my department. (undergrad)
- I have taken graduate level classes, including ML, math, stat, behavior modeling, AI, etc.
- My interest is around NLP&amp; knowledge representation. Not particularly interested in certain methodologies, but those domains. 
- I have some research experience, from a summer and during school semesters. A little conference paper in my home country, but nothing else. I'm currently on a project that I'm really interested in that was suggested by my professor, but it's been a little difficult to allocate enough time for it while taking lots of classes to graduate early. This is where I feel the worst about.

Do you think I have a chance in PhD admission in schools with strong CS programs? (Stanford, UCB etc of course assuming I apply for programs that have professors of similar interest) Or should I give up on that and just do masters first and try to get more research experience&amp;outcomes? Can I apply for PhD programs and still be considered for Master programs at the same time?"
8dmubf,13,2018-04-20,Graduated... what now?,hapachino,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/8dmubf/graduated_what_now/,"So I graduated last month and should be receiving my diploma in the mail in the next couple of weeks, but am struggling on what I should be doing now.

I did well in terms of GPA with one B, but did quiet poorly otherwise considering I did no side projects or internships. Like all things, I started with enthusiasm during the first two or three quarters, but quickly reverted to minimum effort for A's. My plan was always to complete the program quickly and then intern to get my foot in the door. A full-time job would obviously be ideal, but I doubt I'm qualified at this point. In fact, I might have been more qualified earlier on when I had to do more programming from scratch and data structure/algorithms were fresh in my mind. 

I've been reviewing CTCI, but the progress has been glacial at a couples hours a day. My short term goal is to slowly work up to five or six hours a day on job related activities, which is pretty sad considering I'm not working, I'm just that lazy and unmotivated. Learning new things is okay, but review is just torture. I've struggled with motivation my entire life and honestly have just been too comfortable living with family. I'll probably also need to heavily review C/C++ and possibly learn Python, as it's a much more enjoyable language and I'd rather both interview and work with it.

I thought I'd know what I want to do by the time I finished the program, but I don't. I am interested in ML and AI and have dabbled with TensorFlow a little, but I'd probably need a PhD for either field - I might consider higher education later on, but I'm leaning towards working now. I've had this vague idea of wanting to be a software engineer, though that's pretty broad and doesn't say much. I just like the idea of creating new programs from scratch and provide real value to users. But it seems most jobs are web development, so it'll probably be easier to get into that. 

These are my main questions, but would appreciate any suggestions and feedback:

1. Should I focus on C/C++ or some other language? Are side project necessary? Any thing else? 
2. Should I apply for jobs as well as internships? Should I do all the above before first?
3. Any recommended sources for jobs besides the usual Indeed, Monster, etc? Has anyone tried our ecampus career services?
4. How much does an internship influence the rest of your career? Should I be selective or just get my foot in the door?"

I've performed really well in my course, usually top of the class. But I feel like that's more of a reflection of me just being good at exams, rote learning and writing reports. I managed to scrape into a development based internship and I feel like I won't have what it takes to work somewhere like this when I graduate. 

Obviously everyone I work with are qualified, experienced professional developers working in this environment for years. But even compared to the other interns on my team I feel like the runt. I feel like I don't completely grasp foundational concepts within development at times and often forget what simple terms mean and have to google them for the millionth time.

I get my job done, but I have to ask a lot more questions that others and seem to end up asking really obvious, stupid questions. It also seems to take me a long time to perform simple tasks by comparison.

I'm getting worried that I don't have what it takes to put together a decent project for my final year and without the guided curriculum framework of previous projects in college I'll struggle to know what tech to use and how to combine/integrate things. With that I'm getting worried that I'm not going to be suitable for a development role in a team like where I work now because I'm just not good enough.

* Green ~~strikethrough~~ is what I have currently completed.
* Purple is what I am currently doing and about to finish in the next two weeks.
* Blue is what I'm taking this summer.
* Orange is what I am taking in fall of 2018. 
* Expected Graduation is May 2020

I feel like I am just good enough as a programmer to build small applications, but not good enough to see large projects through to completion, because I haven't gained the right knowledge and skill sets yet. This is such a weird place to be. 

I am interested in my different career pathways regarding what I can do as a programmer. However, I want to start specializing right now, specifically I am interested in Android/IOS development, as well as Machine Learning, Data Science, and back-end application design. I want to be an extremely desirable candidate to be hired at the tech companies near me, and I know I need internships (which I'm not picky about, I will take anything I can get), and a project portfolio to set myself above the bar. 


However, I tried for internships this summer, but I went to the spring career fair at my University, talked with around two dozen potential employers but most were full for internships this summer (they filled up during fall) or seeking new grads. The fall career fair was what I needed to go to for summer internships, so that's what I will be doing this coming fall 2018. 

In the meantime, however, I am deeply concerned with how broad a spectrum Computer Science is, and how I feel like many of the classes I take, and the things I learn, are not something that translate over to production environments at tech companies. I am not gaining the specific skill sets at the right level, that I need, in order to be desirable at the tech companies near me. Or at least, I feel like I can be doing so much more, and spending most of my free time if present boosting the skills I need to make myself a better hire. I realize Computer Science is meant to be broad, and encompass many different avenues of knowledge. I know patience and hard work will get me where I'm going, I just feel really lost right now. 

**TLDR** I am going into Junior Year of a Computer Science Bachelor's Degree, I don't feel like my skill sets are good enough to start building big projects or to be an intern or a desirable hire, and that my degree isn't giving me the specific skill sets I want right now. I want to specialize and create a portfolio and build things and gain the knowledge to make me a good hire. But not really sure where to go, or how to do this, as a full-time student.

The department I worked in dealt with security cameras. My team specifically worked on the ""smart"" security ceras that would generate statistics based on counting people entering and leaving the store, seeing how much employees engage with people, and stuff like that.

When I first started, we had just installed cameras at a large department store chain. My dad just so happened to work at one of the branches near by. I told him the company I worked for and he saw the name on the cameras. I thought it was pretty cool at the time that my dad could see the stuff I actually worked on.

Fast forward to Easter when we get dinner together. He likes to talk about stuff that happens at work, especially the like layoffs and such. He starts talking about how they are trying to cut hours on everyone. They were trying to get as many people below 36 hours as they could so they would lose their benefits.

He then starts describing the analytics they used to determine when and where to cut hours. He said that they were counting people entering and leaving the store and they were able to see how much employees engage with people.

Well, those types of analytics sounded very familiar. So, it seems that they are using our system to figure out ways to schedule people less frequently, to make all their employees loose benefits. Now I understand that is kind of the point of the analytics, to save the company money. But like, it's now effecting my dad's job negatively. 

I thought it was interesting to see how something I do impacts other people's jobs directly. Has anyone else had similar experiences?"

8dq7aq,85,2018-04-20,Did Anyone Else See This Ad?,Scott_Savino,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8dq7aq/did_anyone_else_see_this_ad/,"Targeted advertising is getting so out of control as of late. With technology growing at leaps and bounds, you could talk about something as specific as “pointy elf shoes,” your phone **will hear you**, and Facebook will send up an Amazon advert for genuine elf shoes from Norway while you're scrolling the next day.     

I don’t know about you, but sometimes the ads feel so targeted to me personally, I find it rather creepy.
You think of something, and you’re considering shopping around for it, and then conveniently there it is on your phone. How do they do that? While I know they say they don’t share any identifiable personal information, how can you trust them? When Zuckerberg has to give statements to congress? Are they concealing more deceptive practices? What else aren’t they telling us? What are they covering up about these algorithms?     

Reddit has gotten just as bad lately. An ad came up at the top of *this subreddit*, and before I knew what I was doing, I had already clicked the little blue megaphone. I normally wouldn’t do something like that. Who does? What kind of unhinged monster, clicks on the “promoted post” ads at the top of the subs? I can understand doing it by mistake, but ON PURPOSE? And this ad especially...     

I clicked on it. I read through it. It was so compelling I was afraid I might lose track of it--I imagine that’s probably a thing that happens pretty common--so did a ""select all"" and copied it so I could remember to look into it later.

8dq9xa,2,2018-04-20,I can't decide between summer research and a coding bootcamp.,5teeze,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8dq9xa/i_cant_decide_between_summer_research_and_a/,"Hi all.

Just for a little background, I'm currently a freshman majoring in Computer Science with a minor in mathematics and am hoping to pursue a career in software development. I am currently on track to pursue my school's accelerated masters program so that I'd be able to graduate with a masters degree instead of a bachelors degree. I do not plan on pursuing graduate school.

I was recently accepted into an intensive 3 week coding bootcamp for the summer that essentially guarantees a local internship for the next summer.

However I was also personally offered a research position under my cybersecurity professor for the summer that will be 8 weeks long with a $4500 stipend that will be mostly used to cover living costs. The only problem is that these two opportunities are conflicting with each other so I will not be able to pursue both.

Since I want to pursue a career in software development after I graduate, I'm wondering which opportunity will be better from a career standpoint. I understand that both of these opportunities are amazing as a freshman, however I am not sure which one will benefit me more in the long run.

Any input is appreciated! Thanks!"

I don't want to drop business fully given the amount of time and money I've sunk into the degree, and I could do a double degree in five years, but i'm hesitant to take on more debt for the extra year. I'm currently well versed but not quite proficient in C++, C, x86 Assembly and Python, and I earned an A in Data Structures. I've been applying around to internships and jobs, but haven't heard back from many of them. My two questions are, how would entry level internships and jobs consider me right now against CS majors, and at the end of five years, would the double degree be more valued by employers over the four year major/minor option with an internship?"

I’m going to study CS but I already have my foot in the door through internships so I don’t really need a brand name school. I just want research opportunities. 

I also value fun—I need to have a good balance between personal time and school. I’m not a huge fan of extreme stress culture (although I am ambitious and value making connections during college).

I really don't want to run my parents dry or take out loans but I feel like I worked too hard to end up at UCSC. 

***University of Washington***

**Pros:**

* Highly ranked for CS

* Campus is pretty

* Easy to get to by plane

**Cons:**

* Did not get direct admit to CS (although I have most of the prereqs done through community college with all A’s)
* Expensive


***UC Santa Cruz***

**Pros:**

* Way cheaper

* 2 hours drive from home

* I like the surrounding town, nearby hiking, and the foresty vibe

**Cons:**

* Less prestigious / reputation of a stoner school

* No competitive environment to push me to be my best

* I fear I won’t make as good of connections there

***URochester***

**Pros:**

* I LOVE the open curriculum and culture

* Lots of research opportunities

* Campus is nice - I'd go here if costs weren't a thing

**Cons:**

* Expensive af even after 15k merit award

* Remote area / Hard to get to / no direct flight

* Bad weather

I'm praying I get off the waitlist for UC Davis, UCI, or Cal Poly or my appeals to all the other UCs work. However, I have to make plans in the likely case that it doesn't pan out. 

Please give your opinions guys, I can't decide and I've been really stressing out about this!!!"

SUPER LONG: TL;DR AT BOTTOM

Good morning, everyone. I'm in a bit of a strange situation right now, and was hoping I may be able to get some helpful advice here. Using a throwaway, because at least one coworker knows my main. 

BACKGROUND:

A brief bit about my health: I have severe, treatment-refractory Bipolar Disorder NOS (Not Otherwise Specified, meaning I don't fit into any of the neat little diagnostic boxes). I've tried over 20 drugs, of every class, to control my symptoms. For various reasons, I'm unable to take all but one; others have always made things worse rather than better. Despite this, I'd consider myself fairly high-functioning. I hold down a job, take night classes at university, go to the gym 3x/wk, and am a member of two social clubs based on hobbies (my therapist's suggestion). I'm in regular outpatient psychiatric and psychological treatment, and I am 100% med compliant.

For the past 4 years, I've worked at a small company (less than 15 employees, plus the perpetually rotating pool of 3-5 interns) doing clinical trials for pharmaceuticals. I enjoy my job, and I'm pretty good at it. I get along well with all my coworkers, and both monitors and auditors (the scary versions of monitors) have always made a note of how pleased they are with my data and documentation on any study I've worked on. I have a great working relationship with all of them.

The one person I have never had a good working relationship with is my employer. And keep in mind, small business, my employer is the business owner, there is no HR, there is no way around or above this person. My employer is the poster child for hostile work environment, and has been since I've known them. Since I've been there, 8 people have directly cited my employers poor treatment (being *literally* screamed at in front of other employees, personal insults, and punitive measures for any perceived slight or wrongdoing) when quitting. I have experienced this all as well, and consider it a huge accomplishment (especially with a disorder that makes keeping a continuous work history near impossible) that I've managed to toughen up and last this long. For reference: Of those previously mentioned 8 employees, 3 of them lasted less than a month (our record is four days!), and an additional employee suffered a mental breakdown due to abuse by our employer after 3 weeks, and never came back.

THE PROBLEM:

A week and a half ago, I went to a psychological crisis center seeking interventional counseling (I did this after my work day had ended). Unexpectedly, I was involuntarily taken to a nearby hospital for an evaluation, and was discharged the following day with no holds or marks on my record. This is the first time in my life this has ever happened, and NGL, it was fairly traumatic. I kept my direct supervisor (avoid my employer like the plague) constantly updated, but gave very few details. The next day I followed up with my psychiatrist, who was of the opinion that I needed a few (3 total, including the 2nd day of hospitalization) days of bed rest. Still keeping the supervisor updated. It's SOP in my office that if you're OOO for 2 or more days due to injury or illness, you must provide documentation stating that you have seen a healthcare provider. So, on my first day back to work, I bring all this documentation with me: a heavily redacted discharge summary from the hospital, and a note from my psychiatrist stating that I needed to be excused from work for those 3 days. Case closed, right?

I immediately went to speak to employer to give them these documents. At this point, she claims she had sent a FedEx overnight letter (she never did, actually) requesting more, ah...*stringent* documentation. More on that in a moment. I've been working for this employer for several years, I've had to repeatedly submit doctor's notes for appointments, all bearing the signature of a licensed psychiatrist (whom she even knows personally); she is aware that I have a mental illness of some kind and am in treatment for it. She then goes on to tell me how unsatisfied with me she is. I'm not always 100% alert (antipsychotics will do that to you), I seem tired and uninterested (again, see above), that I'm not her most productive worker (true, but we can't all be employee of the month every month; I get my job done), that I'm sometimes late (we've had three separate conversations about flex time and how it's a thing that I get because of my illness, but she never seems to remember that; I always work my required number of hours), and, oh, this is my favorite one: How I *literally*, according to her, spend 1-2 hours of my daily 4 hour shift (one of her punitive measures last year that I actually ended up preferring, much to her annoyance) standing outside smoking. I DON'T EVEN SMOKE. I quit *awhile* ago. So she's blatantly lying there. Not the first time for that.

The next part of the conversation is where I immediately thought: damn, I should check this out with r/legaladvice. She straight up threatens to fire me due to my mental illness, specifically if all symptoms are not eliminated. It's a severe, potentially fatal, lifelong illness. I wish that was an option, but that's not how the brain works. She then complained about the side effects from any medications I've taken in the last year, and actually straight up asked me to stop taking my (life-saving) medical treatment. Her words: "" I don't care, I'm only interested in the bottom line. ...I mean, I do care, but the bottom line is most important, and you're hurting that. Can't you just stop taking it and do more natural methods instead?"" I don't know, boss, would you ask a diabetic to stop taking their necessary insulin in favor of more natural methods? Because that's equally insane. Actually, my case is more insane (no pun intended) because we WORK with the mentally ill. She's worked with bipolar patients for almost 20 years. 

She then told me that she was forbidding me to return to work until she received the documentation she *actually* wanted. What she wants: A statement that I'm currently receiving ongoing outpatient treatment. She already knows I am, but sure, that's not a problem. The problematic ones: she wants a letter from psychiatrist ""psychiatrically clearing"" me to return to work, with the expectation that I'll suddenly become a Stepford employee. Basically a ""You are healed, child!"" letter. THEN she wants me to submit to a number of psychological rating scales, administered by my supervisor, at our office, to prove I'm suddenly not sick anymore. Uh... You don't get that. That's confidential employee health information, as far as I'm aware.

And then the lowest blow of all: ""I know your brother just died in a freak accident, but that's no excuse for this kind of performance."" Count to 10... deep breaths... don't punch her in the face. All good. 

TL;DR

My employer is threatening to fire me for my mental illness and/or my adherence to a treatment plan. My illness is classified as a disability in the state of Maryland, and so I feel like this would be discrimination or wrongful termination. 

My employer is demanding personal and invasive medical information. In Maryland, it is illegal for employers to request, make conditional, or obtain confidential employee medical information.

Tbh, the only reason I'm still there is because it gets me out of the house for 4 hours a day (which my therapist says it's good in building structure), and because I'm trying to rebuild a respectable CV after Bipolar ravaged my work history in my 20s.

My question is, how do I approach this situation? Maryland is an at-will state, so proving wrongful termination would be difficult. I can absolutely get her to repeat everything she said into a voice recorder, but as far as I know, Maryland is a two-party consent state for recordings, so it couldn't be used to prove discrimination against disability. What should I do about her attempting to dig into my medical records? Do I have any recourse at all here???

Thanks for talking the time to read, sorry it was so long. I appreciate any advice you lot are willing to give, thank you!"

**If asking for feedback, please provide...**

a) the type of consulting you are interested in (tech, management, HR, etc.)


b) the type of role (internship / full-time, undergrad / MBA / experienced hire, etc.)


c) résumé or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.


**Common topics**

a) How do I to break into consulting? 

 * If you are at a target school, join your consulting club and work with your career center.
 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  Experienced hires do happen, but often require a combination of in-demand experience and a meaningful referral.

8dxrmi,4,2018-04-21,How to Continue Moving Up as an Overwhelmed 23yo?,MonleyHutt,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8dxrmi/how_to_continue_moving_up_as_an_overwhelmed_23yo/,"**TL;DR:**
I'm 23 with maybe just above entry-level experience. I want to be a network engineer and understand as much as possible about IT. It seems like the gap between entry level and that next step up is impossible to bridge. What would you recommend to me? 

Hey there, IT people!

I've been out of community College for about a year now with a degree in game design and development, and after working a year-long internship at a game company in a Desktop Support role, I've found a passion for IT work. My 23rd birthday just passed by and I started up a new job with a very well-known airline supporting a large number of computers and various other devices. I enjoy working with PCs at home in my spare time, and constantly am on the prowl for new tech info for fun.

However, I'm at a bit of a point where I feel a bit inadequate and could use some help finding a good path into the fields I'd like to learn more about. I'll include as much information as possible about my background and circumstances, but if I leave anything crucial out, I can update my post with whatever would be helpful!

**Background:**
I graduated high school successfully in 2013 and immediately started community College and got an internship for a startup company in a major city doing ""Technology Services"" work. Most of this was imaging iPads and inventory management using Microsoft Access and coordinating A/V equipment needs for events that the business/marketing side of the company would arrange. I would source adapters, cables and the like, ship out mobile devices and ensure they were accounted for in our inventory while documenting their location, destination, and any other info our CIO would need. This internship lasted exactly a year and I was let go due to the company shutting down and laying off more than half of the staff.

I started working for a major retailer about 2 weeks later and worked customer service in the electronics department for nearly a year and a half and got along great with everyone. I left there to focus on school and to try to earn a bit more money doing odd-jobs with a friend of mine that moved in with my family.

For a few months I was doing manual labor-type work making a few hundred every other week, but this was really unreliable and was starting to affect my mental health, and by extension, my grades. So I stopped working for a little while to focus on school and try to get some internships and experience working with game engines and other software. I put out some applications for local game studios, but being located where I am, this was pretty difficult without having the finances to relocate. About 9 months later, I did get a call back from one of them with an opportunity for an internship.

This company was a bit vague during the interview process with what work they would have me doing, but when I interviewed with my potential supervisor (the sole IT guy at the company), he told me what my workload would actually consist of and that it would have NO game design/development aspects to it. I figured this was a good foot in the door anyway, so I took it without really thinking too much about the work I'd actually have to complete.

I ended up finishing my degree up a few months into the internship and was really hoping to be brought on full-time, but after about 7 months, it was pretty clear they had little intentions of actually bringing me on (likely because of the size of the company and the cost of hiring me on full-time with benefits), though many of my coworkers (supervisor included) *did* want to bring me on and had meetings to discuss the notion. Nothing really ever came of it, though. I started looking for work elsewhere, but I had such little experience in game development that I wasn't too sure where I could actually go to.

After a few months of dealing with some minor depression and uncertainty, I started feeling pretty good about working my IT job and felt really competent in it. I started feeling really motivated to learn IT more, and working with technology put me in a state of zen when I would solve a difficult issue. I decided to start actually trying to learn more about technology and all the different fields someone in IT could learn, and the prospect of having so many areas to master while they're all still closely related seemed so exciting! I started looking for full time gigs elsewhere, but didn't really understand much about what my value as an employee is or what I can really offer a company. I can't code, I don't know Microsoft suites, I've never done real imaging, I haven't worked much with networking. I do have good customer service and troubleshooting skills, and I consider myself really good with Windows PCs. At that internship, I primarily built and maintained Windows-based workstations for developers and managed inventory. I did some work with their phone system, and a little with their network, but since I was an intern at a small company with not much tech, there wasn't much to play with and just about everything I had to figure out alone. Many days, I'd be sent home early or just told not to come in since there was absolutely nothing for me to do. Plenty of times, I would have little to no work at all, so I'd take udemy courses or watch videos on how to do specific tasks in different tech environments. But without the practice, the lectures didn't do much good.

**Where I'm at now:**
I just started working as a contractor in a field services role at a major airline, but there is very little I'm allowed to do beyond restarting devices or creating tickets for more experienced techs. It does pay $18/hour, and I'm pretty happy with that as of now, but in a few years, I'd really like to be making a salary and have good benefits. 

**What I want:**
I would eventually love to be working as a network engineer or technician, but I'm finding it a bit demotivating to read so many success stories and read so many things I hardly understand. At the same time, I'm extremely motivated to eventually become someone that can contribute to this community by giving excellent advice, like so many other members of this sub and other related ones! Networking just seems so daunting and interesting that I can't not want to figure everything about it out. Of course I have so much interest in all other areas, like cloud-computing, telephony, VMs, etc. I just find it so daunting where to start and feel so stressed for time. I feel like I need to be so much better at this stuff than I am now, asap. I realize that's more a personal thing and something I, myself, need to come to terms with, but I suppose I'm just venting that. The real part I need advice on is what kind of things should I be learning right now to get to network engineer status in so many years? What can I do to get to that point? 

Thanks so much for any help youall can provide, it's greatly appreciated! Let me know of you require any more information or clarification! "

This June I am graduating from the University of Glasgow. I have done two summer internships during my studies as PHP Developer in a small startup and as a full-stack developer in a pretty big bank and I am feeling kind of uncertain about my future. I have some kind of a plan in my head but I am not completely sure if it is feasible and if it would get me anywhere. I really enjoyed my AI and Robotics courses at uni and I am hoping to have a career in this area.

So, my plan after graduation is to work for about a year and then go on to complete a masters in Autonomous Systems/AI. I have done some research on that and I have set the EIT Digital Master School's Autonomous Systems and TUM's Automotive Software Engineering programs. Does any of you have any impressions from those and do you have any other suggestions for relevant masters?

Also, given my experience, do you have any suggestions on where I should look for a job as a junior developer after graduation?

It would be a huge plus if the job is in the AI sphere, but I feel I don't really have the relevant background and knowledge for something like that. "

I’ve been applying to internships since January, but I’m seeing no success at all even though I’ve perfected my resume and have written personal cover letters to the ones I really want. 

In December 2016, I ran into a tricky situation that caused me a lot of stress and anxiety. I had interviewed for two internship positions and had accepted one that I felt okay with. One day after I accepted, I got an email saying that my application had been rejected. Once I saw that, I immediately accepted the offer to the other company to secure a job for the summer. After a few hours of accepting the offer, the first company got back to me saying that the rejection email was an error on their part. Ultimately, I wanted to work at the first company that reached out to me and as a result, I had to tell the second company the situation. It ended with the second company getting mad at me, understandably so.

My question is, could this past situation put me on a blacklist for future employers to see?"

I quit my accounting job after passing Sec+ and searched for entry level jobs and internships for almost 8 months before I had to just accept an accounting job again. I didn’t even get one interview! I would have thought that after getting my Sec+ I would at least have a little credibility. I was applying for anything and everything internships/entry level from business IT risk to entry level pen testers.

So now my question is, should I take CISSP or SSCP after I graduate? 

I am considering SSCP because my education would fulfill the prerequisite and I would be fully certified if I pass.  But my only concern is that in job listings everyone lists CISSP and am scared that the HR people will automatically assume I am not knowledge or know what it is because it’s not the CISSP.

I would really like your thoughts on which exam to take because I know I can pass either one.

Also I have basic knowledge of Python (enough to know what I am doing) and learning Kali and other tools now. After I graduate I want to take some crash courses in Active Directory and SEIM so that I know I can say I’m familiar with them. Any other advice is greatly appreciated too.

Every internship I have applied to has rejected me (mostly never hearing back) and I'm starting to think its because of the self feedback loop of ""I can't get a job because I don't have job experience because I can't get a job..."". 

The lack of experience being because I have never held a single job ever in my life because from highschool at all and I have no volunteering experience. 

The only experience I sort of have is a research opportunity for machine learning I did as a freshman during my first summer with my professor. (Co-author on a paper not first name). 

I know that we are blessed to be in this field because of the ability of having personal projects to show as experience (which is pretty cheap considering all we would need is a computer and a IDE compared to other careers). But some issues in my personal life and school have not granted me the free time to pursue such projects. (I know I know, no such thing as not enough time but that we don't make time). 

I had only gotten into CS during my junior year in highschool and I havent been
using my free time wisely to create a good portfolio. 

I asked my friends who have internships what to do to make me more appealing to employers and they tell me to learn web development because it is a very marketable skill. As much as I'd like to be a choosing beggar and not learn it because I would prefer not having to learn an entirely new facet of computer science which would make what I've learned with traditional OOP languages and Linux useless, I am inclined to start taking their advice. 

The research I did with my professor has gotten me into a good standing with research with my school so they've been generous in offering me Teaching Assistant ships and Summer Research opportunities but I'm afraid of falling into the academia trap. I've heard that academia experience is worthless to employers in industry unless you are a graduate student or professor. This notion that industry doesn't hire mediocre eggheads has been on my mind recently. 

So for a person with practically no personal projects or job experience (the things that internships want like SCRUM or agile experience, and industry level software engineering experience such as test driven development),  what are my options with how to improve my chances of even getting a call?

After that experience, I couldn't see myself being a software dev. One of the issues I had with it was that when I was coding, I just had the feeling of loneliness. More along lines of just, yearning the feeling of cooperation with humans.

Are there any jobs in CS that strictly involve interaction with people? I feel that a personal strength I have compared to most CS majors is people skills (from what I've seen, most co-workers and classmates in CS are just kind of lacking in this sometimes, and I definitely feel I could excel in this aspect)

This June I am graduating from the University of Glasgow with a BSc in Computing Science. I have done two summer internships during my studies as PHP Developer in a small startup and as a full-stack developer in a pretty big bank and I am feeling kind of uncertain about my future. I have some kind of a plan in my head but I am not completely sure if it is feasible and if it would get me anywhere. I really enjoyed my AI and Robotics courses at uni and I am hoping to have a career in this area.

So, my plan after graduation is to work for about a year and then go on to complete a masters in Autonomous Systems/AI. I have done some research on that and I have set the EIT Digital Master School's Autonomous Systems and TUM's Automotive Software Engineering programs. Does any of you have any impressions from those and do you have any other suggestions for relevant masters?

Also, given my experience, do you have any suggestions on where I should look for a job as a junior developer after graduation and before starting masters? My German is still at a very basic level, so how is the scene for English-speaking Juniors?"

(Not far enough with my classes but I've been playing with circuits for about 14 years now self taught.) Anyways I've noticed most of these internships want some software experience and it occurred to me I have no idea what EEs use. I know ME uses solid works a lot but I've heard of multi sim for EEs but want to know the industry standard and start working with it. Also, I can barely code in Java (I hate coding with a passion). However is there a machine level language I really really really should learn whether I want to or not? I'm assuming C sharp or Python but don't know enough to confirm.

And maybe not even circuit specific software, if there's maybe other software I'm not even thinking of. Would they use AutoCad for large scale circuits? (Like a power station) Or do you just make a circuit and give it high values?

EDIT: I know I am going to have to learn some programming, but something like Java just sucked. I don't mind problem solving, solving problems the way you do with coding. Something like using python to actually interact with my circuits - that's cool though. It's a reasonable requirement of being an EE and for general understanding.. But if I can avoid having to learn C++ entirely that's just ok with me too."

I just wanted to ask the community for some guidance.

Some facts about me.
I was initially trying for a med school. By sheer laziness, I screwed that up, and decided to join the CS department of my local NIT (a reputed chain of nationalized colleges in India).


At the onset of my 3rd year of B-Tech I decided to give coding in general, a try a found I liked and was good at it. Fast forward 6 months I grew a little a tried for ICPC got beaten by my classmates as I wasn't selected. Got determined to succeed and would much of my time learning as much CS practical as I could, did some pet projects. Eventually, I shot myself in the foot by missing too many classes and a professor marked a subject incomplete which meant I had to take the subject again in last semester and was ineligible for campus placement.


That nearly took me to depression as I lost an opportunity to do an internship, and wouldn't get to sit in the placements. Recovered enough and tried for ICPC again got selected this time coming in top 75 teams in the regionals.


Now I have finished my course nearly and have a Gpa of 7.4/10.0 and did a mediocre project that for some reason got a lot of praise from my professors. Appeared in GATE exam got a percentile of ~94.


Now I graduate with no internship or in hand offer. Now i ask you how do I grow further as a person interested in CS without going for my masters. 
I thank you for your responses in Advance, and sorry for this wall of text."

I have a degree in molecular biology from a decent school, and several years of experience working as a research lab tech in biomedicine, including co-authorship on 2 published papers.

However, I have a former big-name boss that hates me and will give me a bad reference when contacted. I could have performed better at that job, but I was also given 0 training, the lab was poorly run to the point where I had concerns about safety, and the position was a poor fit. Afterwards, I held a position for 2.5 years in another lab and co-authored 2 papers.

Recently, I applied for research positions at an Ivy League university across the state (PA). The head of the lab put me through the whole Skype interview, in person interview, reference check process. She extended me an offer through email, told me I had the job, made me commit to a state date, and put intense pressure on me to move across the state ASAP. I told her that in order to rent an apartment I needed proof of income and an offer letter, she told me HR would take a long time to produce one, and so she wrote me up a ""draft"" of an offer letter on official university stationary.

I updated her on my relocation as it happened. After relocating, 1.5 weeks before my supposed start date, I email her and she tells me HR just has to process my stuff, no worries. I called HR (a mistake in hindsight) to check on the status and see if they needed anything, and they were very mean to me on the phone. They said that HR was for employees, that I am not an employee yet, to NOT CALL BACK, and that I needed to go through my department only. Later that day I get an email from HR asking me to confirm and acknowledge that the offer letter I received was NOT a real one, and that I had no actual offer of employment from the university. I was still clinging onto hope for the job, so I agreed like a fool. I think they had already made up their minds that they didn't want me after all, and my would-be boss was trying to feed me false hope so I would agree. Seems like my would-be boss overstepped her boundaries and angered HR, putting heat on herself.

A few days later, my would-be boss tells me HR says my original references weren't good enough. She said I need one specifically from the boss that hates me (I had instead provided a co-worker's info for a reference, one who is now lab manager at Yale-it had been good enough before). I had disclosed in the original online application that I didn't get along with this former boss-I had been 100% transparent in my job application process, which I think makes me a sucker in hindsight. Not surprisingly, I get word a few days later that I no longer have a job.

Anyway, my elderly grandparents exhausted their savings relocating me to an expensive new city. I also went into debt. Now I have no job and am left in financial ruin. All because I had faith in this woman who pressured me to relocate for this amazing opportunity. And because they rescinded the offer AFTER I relocated.

Now I am not sure what to do. Honestly, I was overqualified for the position. It was entry-level Research A or Research I, which requires 0-1 years of experience. I have 3.5 years full time experience, and like 6 total if you count NIH summer internships and undergraduate research.

People are telling me to talk to employment lawyers and sue in order to recoup relocation costs. 

But what really gets me is the fact that I had been getting a lot of responses from other labs at that university. I am afraid I am now blacklisted from all jobs at that university due to how the whole thing went down. HR clearly sent me that email asking me to acknowledge the offer letter I got wasn't real because they are afraid of a lawsuit. 

My partner also got his dream job offer, and now that's working out for him. He wants me to ask my would-be boss and the HR department if it is worth my time to still apply at this university.  In the future, I now know to leave the problem job off of my resume. But my partner wants me to still apply to other jobs at his university, which is a major employer in this city. 

HR people of Reddit, am I now blacklisted from all jobs at this university? Should I contact HR and my former almost-boss to ask if it's still worth my time to apply there? Do I have grounds for a lawsuit (this is in Pennsylvania) so I can pay back my elderly grandparents and survive?

My partner says we can feel out their responses and then take action, even going so far as to record the phone calls.  I feel like they will say, ""Of course you can still apply here."" They would dangle that false hope so I will waste time applying there instead of putting together a lawsuit to recoup my relocation expenses and applying elsewhere. 

I am seriously up shit creek and devastated when this should have been the most exciting week of my life."

After my summer quarter I will be going into my junior year. I have about two years of experience working in universities as a computer lab technician, phone support and faculty support, and IT student assistant roles. Prior to this I have experience in fast food jobs that emphasized customer service and speed.

I'm not seeing myself as being busy enough and want to have at least one internship before I graduate. Does anyone have a recommendation on what is desired in an intern for Cyber Security, helpdesk, or netwoking? There is a LOT of competition I will face with peers, and I don't want to be useless by graduation.

My degree is CIS and Information Security. Location is SoCal. I know I am qualified for help desk, but would rather do an Information Security internship because the market seems to be more focussed on protecting information/data and it interests me on how these tasks are completed to get to an end result. 

Last Question: If I can't get a summer internship and have very little classes left before I graduate, should I slow down on my course load and bump up the search for internships before I graduate?

The end goal: To not be looked down on by recruiters for not having much experience or technical skills with an IT degree. I'm willing to learn and if I need to start at the bottom that is okay. I don't want to be passed up is what I am saying. I've stressed myself out the past 5 years over getting a job in IT. It is not easy, and I'm not giving up."

EDIT: I don't think I specified this enough in the post. I bear no ill will toward my mother; she's worked so hard to get to America, to provide a great life for my sister and I. And I know that she must be as disappointed as I am or even more. She wants me to have the best life I can possibly have and I will be eternally grateful for that. That being said.

I'm reposting most of this but I need to vent, badly. I can't deal with this shit anymore. 

Right now I'm sitting in my room listening to my parents outside discussing why I'm a failure. It's the same fucking talking points over and over again, but the phrase that keeps coming up is ""not good enough.""

I submitted my deposit for UCLA last night, and I should be pumped. I am pumped for the school itself - finally bought myself some merch (I never had any before) - though I never got the chance to visit I've only heard good things about it. Plus three of my close friends are going and I can't wait to spend four more years with them. I should be excited and yet all I can feel is a hollow dread inside. I'm trying to enjoy my last few months in my hometown but my parents won't fucking let me.

I should note that my mom is 100% the source of this. My dad has been supportive all the way through and has admitted to me that he's tired of her refusing to move on.

I got fucked by admissions, hard. Only got into 3 of the 16 schools I applied to. The week of March 28th I got into none of the 9 decisions I had that week. When I got rejected from Georgetown (one of my top choices) all my mother did was yell at me for an hour for procrastinating too much, not studying enough, for playing too many video games, for not making high honors, for not making national merit, for picking the wrong extracurriculars, everything under the sun as if it would have made a difference. I hear her tell my sister to do the exact opposite of what I did my junior and senior years so she won't end up a failure like I did. I've been yelled at for refusing to appeal my rejections even though it's literally not possible to do so. Every time I unwind a little bit I'm ""procrastinating"" and ""falling behind while others study and get ahead."" I've been told to ""just focus on getting into a good grad school."" 

Last time I commented this story I said that ""things change incrementally. My mom has been coming around, slowly."" I spoke way too fucking soon. Every single day it's the same shit I heard when I got rejected from Georgetown. I tried to claim that I got screwed over by forces outside of my control (which is largely true. I apologize if the following comes off as whiny feel free to tl;dr). My year had an anomalously high GPA which resulted in honors/high honors cutoffs being .1, .2 higher than usual. I would have made it easily the year before me or the year after. Instead, I was ""top 11%."" As my school reports by decile, this was a problem. As for national merit, I got a 1490 which indexes to a 222, which makes the cutoff not only in every other state but everywhere in the country before this year. So close, yet so far, always. /rant

Those two things are still sore spots with me but I've been doing my best to forget about it. High school achievements don't matter in college, right? What does it matter if I missed a cutoff or two? Still, my mother refuses to let me forget it. 

I can't shake this attitude of hers that UCLA is a consolation prize at best and at worst, a ""lower-tier school"" (her words, not mine) even though it's a fantastic school and obviously neither of those things. Now her tactic is refusing to endorse any of my ECs - she tried to make me quit the Quiz Bowl team because ""it didn't get me into a good college"" (verbatim) even though Nationals is coming up and I need to be there, and forced me to quit my internship for the same reason (though I was already planning to quit). When I'm at home it's just the same talking points repeated ad infinitum. She says that she's giving me ""important life lessons"" but there's nothing fucking teachable about bring up my failures every day. I'm just tired of dealing with her bullshit when I'm trying to not think about the past and look to the future. I should be enjoying the last months of my senior year; instead I'm counting down the days to September 20 when I can get the hell out. My patience is running out. 

Tl;dr it's been almost a month and my mom still won't get over Ivy Day, and it's preventing me from doing the same. "

I'm currently 23 year's old working as IT technician.

I'm basically doing the internal support for employees and the level 2 support for IT issue related for our costumer support. I mostly support computers and printers. I build and maintain up to date the windows image for the computer for the machine and software that we sales.

Without giving too much detail I was not really satisfied by my current position, too much helpdesk and my boss was giving all the server and networking stuff to a small firm. To add up my wage was at 17$/h (CAD) I started working there as my first real job as IT technician and I did my intern there too. 

I got an offer from a headhunter on LinkedIn for a similar position but with the system administration responsibility. Basically all the stuff that is currently gived to the firm where I'm right now. 

After speaking with the company, they were exactly searching for someone like me, 1-3 years of experience in support, interest in system administration, experience with costumer service and possibly leaving after 3-5 year's for an higher position. 

Since my wage was really crappy and this position was really interesting for me I asked only 40k$. They accepted to hire me.

Once I gave my resignation to my boss with my 2 weeks, he told the raise at 40k$ I asked during my evaluation was accepted to 37k$. 

2 days later the daughter of the owner wasn't really happy of seeing me leaving. She offered me 43k$ and she wanted to speak with me and my manager to know what they can do to satisfy me. After talking they were ok to pay for certifications (suggestions of me) as a benefit and doing some concession to let me partipate on IT decision and working more with the firm.

I asked to help me getting the MCSE since we are all going Microsoft server 2016.

So know I'm not totally sure what to do. I already accepted the other position but with the certification it's around 45k$.

My current questioning if : 

- should I try to ask more to the other job and if they don't do it I stay.

- should I say f*CK*FF and switch(the current company have some poor management, they were so small 2 years earlier 40-50 and know they are 110) 

- if I stay, which platform should I use for certification? I already tried CBTnugget for 1 month. A lot of stuff, but not that much at the same time.

What you guys are suggesting? 


I know that I can get more money in big business, but for a junior you get less responsibility it can take year's to make your way and I like to do support.

The current business where I work have currently 110 employee, but they will probably expand to 140-160 during the next year's. 

Sorry for my  bad English. I typed with me phone and I'm not native a native English speaker. I will try later to correct once on desktop.

This might sound like a ridiculous question, but I'd to know what I can do to boost my chances of getting work experience as a freshman. I'm really passionate about securing an early internship. 


I love computer engineering and want to get some applied knowledge in the field as quickly as possible. I do have a bit of experience from stuff I've done in high school (mechanical/electrical/software) and a few impressive awards. However, I'm not sure if that'll help me in college. 


The school I'm going to next year has a top 10 engineering program, so I know that companies recruit from there. Although they might not be interested in inexperienced people, I want to maximize my chances of getting an internship.


Thanks for reading, dudes."

I am a junior in Computer Engineering at UIUC. I have been planning to do a Masters and hopefully a Ph.D. in CS/EECS since my sophomore year. So far my research experience goes as follows:
I did a 3-month research during my semester in my sophomore year in Nanotechnology. My interaction was mostly with the master's student I was working with and although we did not achieve a lot of the set goals during the semester (partly because I was new to research and partly because it was during the school semester),  we were able to achieve some goals that she had set for me. Unfortunately, that was her last semester and she did not pursue a Ph.D. so I did not get to continue with her (I was dumb enough to not go to the prof. and ask to work with someone else working on the project). After another semester of desperately trying to find some internship or research, I finally got a research with a prof. right after my sophomore year ended. I worked directly with the Prof. on data visualization, machine learning and a lot of automation scripts for his one of the other projects. I formed a good relationship with the prof. and am hopeful that he will give me a good recommendation. After working with him for about a year, I realized that my goals have changed. I am now working with another masters student and hoping to hear from another Prof. soon. If I get a research with this prof. I will be working on some of the stuff I have always wanted to work on. I am also taking some grad courses next semester to help me with my applications (also because they are very interesting)
All this background about me was to ask about some realistic goals that I should set for my grad School applications. Next semester I moving into my senior year and I am very stressed about if I can get into a good Grad School. I don't have unrealistic goals or expectations.  My main interests are Computer Vision, NLP, and medical technologies. I have categorized schools into 2 categories, Dream and Hopeful. Some of my Dream schools are MIT (EECS Ph.D. program), Stanford (Masters in CS), CMU (M.S. in ECS), UC Berkeley, Cornell, and Princeton. My hopeful schools are UIUC, GeorgiaTech, UMich, UToronto, Univ. of Washington. I know these are all really good programs and I don't know if I would be able to get into any of them.
1. What should be some realistic goals and what other universities should I look into. These are some of the best I found for my areas of interest. 
2. How much would GRE impact my chances?
3. What are some other factors that I should look into? 
4. I know recommendations are important. What can be some of the things I can do to get a good relationship with the Prof. if I am not directly talking to the prof.
5. If I don't get the research with the prof., what else should I do? I have emailed about 6-7 profs so far, gone to their office hours to talk to them face to face, have taken their class if possible but they are all full at capacity right now. 
6. How much will be GPA affect my applications (my current GPA is ~ 3.6 which I know is not great when it comes to grad schools and I don't think it will go anymore up than this with my courseload but I am hoping to maintain)?
7. What are my chances for the above schools?
Finally, what else should I be doing right now to make my applications stronger? 

I know this is very long but I am very stressed and no one is giving me straight answers so I can set some realistic goals. (My advisor keeps telling me it's all possible and never gives a clear answer).

Thanks for any help. I really appreciate it."

(cost is about the same and isn't an issue)

NYU Pros:
It's close to home and I love the city, especially the area that NYU is in. After college I'd want to work in NYC, so I think Stern would be better for finding internships and jobs. Strong study abroad and global opportunities. 

NYU Cons:
I won't have a traditional college experience and I'm worried that NYU as a whole isn't as good as Berkeley. Stern is also very finance focused, which may not be the path I want to pursue

Berkeley Pros:
I love the vibe of campus and it offers more of a traditional experience. Haas is also beautiful and probably a more well rounded business school especially because I don't know exactly what I want to do yet (perhaps consulting). It's also a better overall school with students of a higher caliber.

Berkeley Cons:
I've heard that it can be stressful and competitive trying to get into Haas and if I don't get in I think I would regret not going to Stern. Plus it's far from home and the whole housing situation worries me. It's also so big that I feel like I won't be able to connect with professors and find my group of friends within the university. 

Basically I like Berkeley's campus and overall school better, but I like the location and opportunities that Stern offers, especially because it's a private school with a lot of funding. I like both schools for different reasons and I honestly can't decide. "

8e96gv,191,2018-04-23,"I graduate in 14 days with a Mechanical Engineering degree, here are my pro tips:",GoldenTypo,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/8e96gv/i_graduate_in_14_days_with_a_mechanical/,"I decided to pursue engineering because of my mechanical mindset and hobbies. I basically was a straight C student in high school, yet in college i am graduating top 5&amp;#37; of the engineering college. Hey kids, listen to the guy who is days away from accomplishing your current goal:

\- First for my new Engineers, chemistry, physics, and caulculus are all weed out classes. They are designed to make you fail, the ones who truly desire to be an engineer work for it. It gets easier from here, most students grades are at their worst in their freshman\-sophomore year by far. 

\- Find as many internships as possible. I am where you will be one day and **seeking a job as i graduate in 2 weeks,** trust me, experience is everything to your future resume. Do as much as you can in as many different fields while you are at this internship. 

\- If you are sitting through intro classes specific to your engineering pursuit and do not find the fundamentals mildly interesting, this is not the field for you. If you do not have the slightest interest, you will not have the desire to learn the information, and i guarantee you will fail out. 

\- The internet, specifically YouTube, is your best friend. I could not have went through engineering school without it. Free lectures from top schools compared to my ""research college"" which hired people specifically for research, ignoring the fact they speak 100 total words in the english language, greatly simplified these lectures. 

\- If you can afford it, buy a device such as a surface pro or iPad pro to annotate notes in class. Yeah, I was the kid in some classes wrote down every word, in others i didn't write down a single one. Regardless, it greatly benefited me to buy an iPad and apple pencil to download professors PDF's and annotate them as he taught, even if it was a simple word. 

\- Form a small friend group within your classes. Engineers one day are required to work as a part of a team, beginning these skills early is important. Also, your homework wont take you 20 hours. Do not cheat, you will fall behind and not pass, but collaborate to understand the material.

\- Do not try to get by not learning a specific concept. Often times, engineering builds and you can easily be left in the dust for semesters on end. Learn it up front, get better grades, and in return made the future classes easier.

\- Yeah units blow, just throw them in google and call it a day. FALSE. Unit conversion and understanding what ""kilograms per meter per second per second!"" means in relation to what that EXACT technology does will greatly enhance your understanding of engineering concepts. In addition, learning these units in SI and English units will greatly benefit you, im not saying converting \(but also learn this....\) but learn HOW to do it. Those mass and weight conversions between lb mass and lb force are never specific. Also, if you didn't realize i clearly stated the units for 1 Newton earlier, please start reading!

\- With that whole ""engineering builds on itself"" theory in mind, do not blink the first time you hear the words ""Laplace"" ""Frequency response"" ""Transient"" ""Unstable"" ""Stable"" ""Critically Damped"" ""Damping Ratio"" ""Elon Musk"" All of these terms will follow you through your engineering studies until you graduate, learn them early.

\- Learn Matlab and Excel early, it will greatly benefit you later down the road. One day you will be sitting at a desk 8 hours into a Control Systems II homework assignment wondering ""Lord Jesus why can't I just do this calculation once, why must they make me do it with one manipulated variable over and over"" well, thats when excel and matlab come in handy. 

\- Prioritize professors over class time. It doesnt matter if its at 8:00am, if its a better professor you will understand the material much better and be motivated to show up to class. Why pay for the education of you have a professor who speaks 100 total words of english, wake up early and learn. Trust me, it pays off in future classes. 

\- Organization is key. This is a skill i never figured out, to this day I'm still debating organization of folders on my laptop and where the F i saved that one excel file someone emailed me for a project. 

\- This is a tip I wish i realized the true magnitude of the result. DO NOT STUDY THE NIGHT BEFORE. Yeah, you are going to do it, you are going to be frustrated the entire exam knowing you know the information, but can't pull it out of your brain. Start 7 days ahead of time, 3 days later you will be golden, if not use the extra time to study. Almost always, i received a high A when i started 7 days earlier, the night before, always yielded at least a C. It pays off the feel prepared for an exam, and hey **the knowledge will absolutely help you in future classes.** 

\- Dont brag, people are aware engineering is a hard major. But hey if its 2:00am and you're vibing, use that to your advantage, humans are attracted to engineers regardless of your gender.... but for the sake of this being engineering, yes girls will want you. 

Threw this together over a few beers, enjoy kiddos, feel free to PM me im open to whatever. "
8e9bud,1,2018-04-23,Senior undergrad needing reality check,KevineCove,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8e9bud/senior_undergrad_needing_reality_check/,"I'm a senior studying computer science at University of Michigan. I'm surrounded by people getting jobs and internships left and right and being told non-stop that I'll always have a job, but I feel like I'm on a road to nowhere.

Academically I'm in decent standing, I guess. I'm a straight B student (~3.4 GPA, still no Cs yet,) but the biggest strike against me is I'm going to graduate without ever having had an internship.

I still like my major, but my coursework is unrewarding and soul-sucking. It's been over a year since I've studied more than 2 hours for an exam, which is a testament to how little motivation I have. The atmosphere here is impersonal and callous, and seeing companies visit campus to recruit students gives me serious anxiety. All of these events are just a mob of AAA companies looking to hire people that are both more competent and motivated than I am, and I can't see myself going into the industry after graduating.

I was drawn to computer science because I like programming. I like designing stuff, and the autonomy of making programs do what I want them to. But when I think about what it would be like to work for one of these companies I feel like I'd only be a faceless cog in a giant machine. In many ways, this is what my college experience is already. Being too busy with classes to work on personal projects has also given me a bitter resentment for all things academic.

I'm sure there are a handful of options waiting for me when I graduate. I could probably do web design, or some low-level IT job that wouldn't stress me out. But the thought of NOT going into the industry is another stress factor because of how outlandishly expensive my degree is.

One thing I really need to get a grip on is how I'm performing outside the standards of the university. For a while I felt like I was seriously under-performing in my program, until I realized that everyone fails every exam here and the professors just curve everything up to prevent us from failing. It keeps us humble, I suppose, but it's given me learned helplessness to the point where I have no desire to do anything other than get a passing grade.

I guess my question is this: Am I employable? Is there any hope for me to find anything I'll enjoy? Is this path going to force me to choose between making money and doing something I actually want?"

- First one was at a major bank which I left at my own accord since I wanted to move to Germany and the role offered not much growth over time.

- Second one was an internship at an early-stage venture that I was very hopeful to convert to a full-time except that the founder - the one who I was on excellent terms with - passed away, there was downsizing, and my role was no longer applicable. No full-time role and had to look for something new.

- My current role is what I enjoy doing (Jr. Operations Manager) but...as if a stroke of bad luck and before I could gain more experience/skills to make myself indispensable, once again there has been an internal reorganization and my manager suggested I should leave by mid-summer since they need someone more senior for this position. 

OK, that was the bad part.
The kinda-good part is that all of the aforementioned companies are well-known and my references from all my managers/previous companies have been very good. Additionally, I actually did make some noticeable contribution etc. during my time at each role.

I see advice on this sub given a lot when someone says they're bad at data structures and algorithms, and people always respond saying that no one actually really uses algorithms day to day in CS.

Only problem is that I LOVE algorithms. They are absolutely by far my favorite part of CS. When I first picked up CTCI, on the advice of this sub, it absolutely changed the way I think about CS. I read through it cover to cover, voraciously working my way through every single problem in there, one after the other, in a matter of days. Competitive programming has since become my number one hobby, and I spend a very substantial part of my free time looking up algorithms and trying to solve problems with them, reading algorithm textbooks, etc. 

Obviously, this is going to come in handy for interviews, but I fear that the real day to day work of software engineering, if it really doesn't involve algorithms at all, is going to be pretty unappealing to me. The most fun I have with computer science is trying to find asymptotically optimal solutions to challenging and novel problems, and if software engineering doesn't offer a lot of opportunities for that, I fear I might hate it and be better off trying to pursue something in academia.

I'm 29 and dropped out of college after failing out of a large state school. I went into the restaurant industry with massive student debt and decided to go back to school for CS. I just received an offer from a Big 4 in a great location, and I'm graduating in May.

Background:

I went into the service industry with 50k in student loans when I was 21-22. Reality hit me pretty hard that I couldn't afford to live on my 9/hr cooking job. I worked 2 jobs for a year and a half to pay off my old school to get my transcripts and transferred to a community college.

I spent 2 years at a CC and another 2 at a pretty mediocre state school. I managed to land an internship at a big company with an office in my area last summer, and basically begged my manager to let me stay on this year as an unofficial co-op while I finish my degree.

I applied to a bunch of unicorns and large software companies this spring, and I actually heard back from a Big 4. I did an online coding assessment and 5 interviews. The process took about 3 months. I had no idea how well I was doing, but I just received my offer last week!

It was a long process from deciding to go back to school, and actually finishing and getting a great offer (6 years from when I first decided I wanted to go for CS). I'm in a great spot now, and I want to say thanks to this sub for helping me get ready for my interviews.

Edit: thanks for all the support - hope my story inspired someone feeling discouraged.  I lurked this subreddit for years, and I'm going to keep coming back because this shit is really helpful."

I'm improving a lot at the algorithms part of these coding tests, so I can often come up with the right thing to do quickly, but then I just waste the entire allotted time trying to debug some 'index out of range'.

Is there anything I can do to stop making these mistakes time and time again? I know it'll improve with practice, but it feels like I'm wasting a lot of good opportunities because of it, so it's something I'd like to improve quickly if I can."

However, after some consideration I started to worry that I might've made a huge mistake. The role at the company is ""Technical Support Engineer Intern"". I did not think much of this during the interviews and tours as people with this title seemed to be working primarily on code with some typical tech support interruptions from time to time. I was told during the interview that there is a list of coding projects that need to be completed and that I should focus on them during my time at the company. However, I am now terrified that having ""Technical Support"" on my resume might be detrimental to my career later on.

I'm in an unpaid internship and I've been in one for a a long while now, I've done nothing so far. It was something a professor passed along as quote ""potential to be a full time offer"".

He first announced it as paid and when he hired me he told me it was unpaid. Now just recently I'm starting to getting some from end work, and at the same time I just received the new that I'm going to a Big N for the summer. So my motivation level for doing this has gone down dramatically.

So basically I'm going to end it then which is 2 months from now. I asked my Professor to pay me from there on out and he basically told me to do it for the knowledge, and maybe earn a ""full time"" role. He gave me no structure on how I would be qualified for full time or what I would have to do to get the role. Zero guidance, little to no mentorship. I'm basically an on call software engineer with no expectations of pay or full time offer.

So I told him my issue, which is that I wanted more structure and a clear goal of my role and potential in the company, at least some pay. But the guy basically guilted me, told me he expected more from me said that he didn't want me to be a coding monkey yada yada yada, basically called me argumentative (""focused on being right""). 

Now I just want to get some feedback on what my view on this should be. I think they guy is bullshitting me but my other friend who was in the meeting told me that I should also see this as a potential learning opportunity. My counter point was, the guy could at the very least pay me minimum wage, but he doesn't respect me enough to do that.

Now I wanted to get advice from other people on what to do. I just need more second opinions. Just for added balance, I'm a CS student who barely goes to class, but does well on exams and my professor knows this. Should I quit? Should I stay for knowledge even though I'm getting zero to no guidance? What do you guys think, let me know."

my plan is like this and doing parts of it right now so I want someone tell me where I am wrong or what I am doing wrong 

obviously, I study online 

I will state what courses I have finished or planning to take 

general knowledge: cybrary CompTIA A+(done), nand to Tetris 1 (done), I will study some math and physics cause I think they might help as a first principle for things I don't get the big picture for like wireless networking so decided maybe some math and physics might help 

for operating systems: nand to Tetris 2, hack the kernel, I will try tinker with hardware projects to fully grasp how computers work like this one: https://eater.net/8bit/ , maybe other projects will come up I will hope to implement and play with 


for programming: there an initiative called Mohamed ibn Rashid ( ruler of Dubai) to learn Arab youth how to code it's basically udacity intro programming courses and if you are among the  top 100 you will get to study full stack nano degree 



for learning about cybersecurity: that is sans path for different roles in cybersecurity https://www.sans.org/media/security-training/roadmap.pdf I will go into penetration testing path since of course, I don't have the money to take sans courses I will take another free course that matches them from cybrary and other free cybersecurity resources 


notes: 1-as for networking I am learning about it while I am studying cybersecurity 
2-maybe someone will say that I don't need that much of programming but in my country, there's few security-related internships or jobs so I will try to get a job or internship as full stack developer and advance to security-focused job and maybe get some certificates to polish my resume 

3-i am dedicating all time to studying which is 13h every day 


4-my goal is to get a job outside my country maybe in USA or Canada or the UK so I can move there, have many issues in my country 


5-i have 3 years before I finish my college do you think I might be able to be in a ""good place in my career "" to get a job in security?

8ef93u,4,2018-04-23,How much is it going to hurt me if I take a major class pass/no-pass? Feeling extremely conflicted.,Dagg19,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/8ef93u/how_much_is_it_going_to_hurt_me_if_i_take_a_major/,"I've never taken any courses for my major pass/no-pass (I'm a double major in history and philosophy of science and cognitive science). I have a high GPA - 3.8 - and a chronic health condition that has forced me to go part time this quarter due to flare-ups. In addition to this, I'm involved in a fellowship that could potentially be huge for me if I give it the attention it deserves this quarter, as well as an internship that could be equally good for my career. 

Graduate school isn't off the table for me, and I'm absolutely terrified that if I go pass/no-pass in a major course, it's going to be a red flag. *Particularly* during a quarter when I'm going part-time as is. The class is way outside of my comfort zone (computational linguistics), and I'm really disliking how the course is taught. I tend to avoid courses where attendance is absolutely mandatory due to my health, and this class is exactly that; heavy emphasis on lectures, and no real comprehensive textbook to fall back on. I also find the directions for assignments to be confusing and unclear, and the subject matter to be boring. 

I'm considering going pass/no-pass. I can admit that I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and not getting an A is really going to bother me. Even more than that, with the way things are going, I don't think an A is even going to be possible. I think I would have to work very hard to achieve a B, and I'm afraid of what the stress could do to my health.

I want to give myself a break. I want to use my time to focus on things that are more important to me. But I'm worried that having one of my major classes pass/no-pass, especially if it's in a class that looks ""harder"" and more STEM-ish on paper, is going to really hurt me if I end up going to grad school.

I accepted one for the summer, and am debating taking the second one for the fall.

This second internship would require me to drop that fall semester to work full time. This would delay my graduation to the next year (so 5 years total, would graduate in 2020 instead of 2019). I spoke with a faculty professor who worked at this company, and she told me that they don't generally hire interns in the internship program that I got an offer to. Another person who has worked here has also said the same thing to me. However, this is a prestigious location and that's the only thing really holding me back. Just having their name on a resume would be great, even if they don't end up hiring me for a full time job.

Other things to consider is that I have a scholarship for that fourth year, but only if I stay full time student. This scholarship is basically the same amount as working at that second internship. 

So that leaves me with two choices:

1. Turn down the second internship, and graduate on time with a scholarship that pays the same as if I worked the entire semester at that second internship. I would still have an internship before I graduate (the first internship for the summer that I already accepted). 

2. Take the second internship just to add more to my resume (according to my professor and others, this company, although prestigious, doesn't really hire interns unless they are year-round interns which I'm not). Doing this means I lose out on the scholarship money and delay my graduation. 

My professor preferred the first option. My professor argued that it would be worth more of my time finishing my degree, graduating, and working as an actual engineer, instead of delaying that to take a year of more school and an internship. Especially since I would already have one internship under my belt from the first offer in the summer.

 Since money wise, it still balances out (scholarship and the second internship's total pay were basically the same), I guess the question is: 

Is it worth it to delay your graduation to take an internship (when you already have had an internship) at a prestigious place just to have it on your resume?

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
- Good battery life is very important for when i'm attending classes, going to cafes, etc (but so much when gaming - when gaming I should always be plugged in!)
- Good specs matter too - im spoiled by my desktop if ill be honest (gtx 1080, m.2 ssd, 165 hz, etc...)
- Needs to have a sturdy build quality to it, since I will be carrying it around all day for classes, work, etc.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
I need to carry this laptop around for classes and internships all day, so weight matters. The lighter the better honestly but I know that's tough with the specs i want. I just dont want a heavy behemoth gaming laptop.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
 Windows preferred since its difficult to game on macs. screw the ""industry standard"" 

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
Around 15 inches is fine.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
YES. 
Gaming - fps games like overwatch are common. I would like at least 60 fps for those kinds of games.
Needs to be able to run all programs of the adobe creative suite!! I also plan on taking classes that require CAD/vectorworks/Rhinoceros to be used eventually...

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 As stated before, I would like to be able to play games like overwatch at at least 60 fps, medium-low graphics are OK. *if this is not possible for the weight/size I can drop heavier games from my wants for this laptop... design programs must stay however*

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
- GREAT quality screen/display for color oriented design projects. needs to be color accurate
- Touchscreen not needed (i never used it with my current laptop)
- A responsive keyboard would be nice since I have a mechanical keyboard for my desktop ive gotten used to...

8eg9i3,6,2018-04-23,UCR or UCSD???,okpeach,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/8eg9i3/ucr_or_ucsd/,"I can't decide between UCR and UCSD. 

I’ve been accepted as an Economics major at both UC's, but I plan on changing my major since Econ doesn't interest me anymore. I want to switch my major to something in STEM, but I’m not sure what yet. I don’t know what I want to pursue, and I’m not sure if I want to go to graduate school :/

Here’s the situation: 
UCSD has the better reputation, which might mean more opportunities for research and internships. It has a wonderful location (close to the beach and San Diego), and they have a six college system that seems interesting (I got into Warren college, which is far from most classes, but close to the Price Center and library). SD has nice gear, a beautiful library, and I have a close friend going to SD (ERC College). However, it's been said that SD is socially dead, and I'm worried about the competitiveness of the school (When I visited on Triton Day, people seemed stressed/tired; It didn't feel like there was much of a community). For dining, I've heard Warren food sucks, and I know that it's a dining dollar system, not buffet-style, and that turns me off. Additionally, I feel like UCSD's Warren College has harder GE's and that switching majors would be harder at SD than at UCR. I don't know if I'll be happy w so much competition/stress.

At UCR, I received the Chancellor's scholarship, but the cost of attendance for both schools is roughly the same. I was also accepted into the Honors program, which means that I will be dorming at Pentland Hills if I decide to go thru with the program. Anyhow, UCR has a modern-looking and centralized campus, so I won't need to walk as much, and I heard it's good for pre-meds (IDK if I am going into pre-med though). I feel like I would do better in my classes at R than at SD and stand out more. There seems to be more spirit as well. However, the reputation is not as good and I dislike the location (hot+nothing to do). The gear is also not as nice. Plus, I know a lot of people from my HS going to UCR, and I kinda want to avoid them LOL. I also know more people transfer out of UCR so I think that's saying something.

Anyway, from my home, UCSD is a two hour drive, and UCR is one hour away. I will be dorming at both schools.

I’ve been accepted as an Economics major at both UC's, but I plan on changing my major since Econ doesn't interest me anymore. I want to switch my major to something in STEM, but I’m not sure what yet. I don’t know what I want to pursue, and I’m not sure if I want to go to graduate school. I don't know if undergrad even really matters :/

Anyway, here’s the situation: 
UCSD has the better reputation, which might mean more opportunities for research and internships. It has a wonderful location (close to the beach and San Diego), and they have a six college system that seems interesting (I got into Warren college, which is far from most classes, but close to the Price Center and library). SD has nice gear, a beautiful library, and I have a close friend going to SD (ERC College). However, it's been said that SD is socially dead, and I'm worried about the competitiveness of the school (When I visited on Triton Day, people seemed stressed/tired; It didn't feel like there was much of a community). For dining, I've heard Warren food sucks, and I know that it's a dining dollar system, not buffet-style, and that turns me off. Additionally, I feel like UCSD's Warren College has harder GE's and that switching majors would be harder at SD than at UCR. I don't know if I'll be happy w so much competition/stress.

At UCR, I received the Chancellor's scholarship, but the cost of attendance for both schools is roughly the same. I was also accepted into the Honors program, which means that I will be dorming at Pentland Hills if I decide to go thru with the program. Anyhow, UCR has a modern-looking and centralized campus, so I won't need to walk as much, and I heard it's good for pre-meds (IDK if I am going into pre-med though). I feel like I would do better in my classes at R than at SD and stand out more. There seems to be more spirit as well. However, the reputation is not as good and I dislike the location (hot+nothing to do). The gear is also not as nice. Plus, I know a lot of people from my HS going to UCR, and I kinda want to avoid them LOL. I also know more people transfer out of UCR so I think that's saying something.

Anyway, from my home, UCSD is a two hour drive, and UCR is one hour away. I will be dorming at both schools.

8egih2,1,2018-04-23,Taking a second internship at a prestigious company and delay graduation vs. graduating on time,actuallydumbquestion,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/8egih2/taking_a_second_internship_at_a_prestigious/,"I have an internship offer (this will be my second internship) for a fairly well-known and prestigious company. This will have to be in the fall semester however, and will require me to drop that semester. It is in a industry/field that I am very interested in. 

However, after speaking with some faculty advisers on how this will affect my graduation dates etc, we found that it will delay my graduation by a year. I will end up graduating in 2020 instead of 2019. This same adviser also worked with this company before, and said that they don't really hire interns from my internship program. They only hire interns from their year-round internship program, which I'm not in. 

My adviser felt that it would be in my best interest to drop the offer and focus on graduating on time. They argued that I'm essentially trading the pay/experience of actually working in the field as an actual engineer for the pay/experience of working as an intern. 

In addition, I've also received a scholarship opportunity that pays just as much as the money I would make if I accepted the internship and worked that semester. However, this scholarship opportunity requires me to be a full time student, and therefore, I would not get it if I accept the internship offer.

Money-wise, either option I'll end up the same. However, I have two choices:

1. Take the internship just so I could put down a really prestigious company on my resume, and delay my graduation.

2. Turn down the internship and just graduate on time

Normally, I think the first option would be the better one, but the scholarship + the fact that the company doesn't really hire interns from my intern program is making me lean towards the second option/choice. In addition, I do have an internship so it won't be like I'm graduating with no experience if take option 2. 

What are your thoughts on this? Would I be competitive enough with just 1 internship? Or would being able to put the second internship's prestigious company on my resume be worth delaying my graduation? "

I got amazing grades on my midterms. But now I've lost all motivation to do classwork like labs and homework. I can't bring myself to do anything.
This is supposed to be my last semester before I finish my degree. But I have a week and a half left until my math midterm and I'm so far behind with homework that I don't think I'll make it.
That, coupled with the fact that I don't know what I'll be doing at the end of this summer scares me.
I'm an ftm transsexual, and I haven't been able to start hormone therapy yet, because I don't have my own health insurance. I don't want to burden my parents and have them pay for it since I'm still on theirs until I'm 26, and they refuse to pay for it anyways. So I've had to ask my doctor about finding providers so I can start discreetly while paying out of pocket. But my doctor hasn't returned my call. I wanted to maybe start before my internship this summer. But it doesn't look like that will be happening anytime soon.
Mom gets pissed and uppity with me when I mention my identity issues so I've had to hide it and continue lying to myself. I keep living this lie day after day but I'm cracking, I don't know how long I can keep this up for.
My two cats are the only things keeping me from offing myself. I don't have a lot of IRL friends, so I don't have a lot of people that I can turn to.
I want to call the suicide hotline. But I don't want to be hospitalized; not again. It happened before a few years ago and I promised myself I wouldn't end up in that position again. But it's happening again and I don't know what else to do. I'm tempted to drive out to the freeway and run into an oncoming semi.

Right before and after graduation I probably applied to about a little over 100 jobs, had some interviews but never got past that. I graduated with a 3.5 gpa. I recently got a job as a desktop support tech. I guess my question is, is this a good job to gain experience and to grow in my career? Some of my classmates I graduated with have gotten jobs as consultants and account development specialists, and they seem to make a lot more money than I do (not that it matters but I have students loans to pay). I noticed most people in my current job don't have degrees. I'm kind of lost as to whether if I'm going down the right path or not. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

8egxst,2,2018-04-23,Internship contract for Agency,MasterPublishing,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8egxst/internship_contract_for_agency/,"So some quick info on me. I'm from the United States, Pennsylvania, and I'm trying to start a business that is in direct niche correlation \(It's the exact business model\) with a company agency that I'm looking to be doing an internship with.  I am by no means a legal expert \(or even remotely novice\). Now obviously I won't be copying the exact design / word for word of their business, just the services, but I'm a little worried for my future business if these guys can come after me. I'll be asking them more questions later, but I want some more perspectives if anyone is willing to chime in \(whether that be questions I could ask the company for further clarification, or personal opinions regarding the contract\). Directly for me, I only want to know one thing so far, which is:

Laments terms for the part of SEVERABILITY PROVISION, where in the first sentence it mentions ""for any other reason""... that just seems to me like a very broad general term that could possibly be used against me when I try to start my own agency.

Which leads to the main question \-

When I create my Agency that I modeled from the previous internship, what can ,the company that I worked for during the internship, come after me for \- assuming the business is only similar?

Here is there contract \-

""NONCOMPETITION PROVISION

1. The Contractor specifically agrees that for a period of 6 months after the Contractor is no longer employed by the Company, the Contractor will not engage, directly or indirectly, either as proprietor, stockholder, partner, officer, employee or otherwise, in the same or similar activities as were performed for the Company in any business which distributes or sells products or provides services similar to those distributed, sold, or provided by the Company at any time during the 5 months preceding the Contractor's termination of employment.
2. For a period of 12 months after the Contractor is no longer employed by the Company, the Contractor will not, directly or indirectly, either as proprietor, stockholder, partner, officer, employee or otherwise, distribute, sell, offer to sell, or solicit any orders for the purchase or distribution of any products or services which are similar to those distributed, sold or provided by the Company during the 5 months preceding the Contractor's termination of employment with the Company, to or from any person, firm or entity which was a customer of the Company during the 5 months preceding such termination of employment.

NONSOLITICATION OF CLIENTS PROVISION

Contractor agrees that for 12 months after Contractor is no longer employed by the Company, Contractor will not directly or indirectly solicit, agree to perform or perform services of any type that the Company can render \(""Services""\) for any person or entity who paid or engaged the Company for Services, or who received the benefit of the Company's Services, or with whom Contractor had any substantial dealing while employed by the Company. However, this restriction with respect to Services applies only to those Services rendered by Contractor or an office or unit of the Company in which Contractor worked or over which Contractor had supervisory authority. This restriction also applies to assisting any employer or other third party.

NONSOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES

For a period of 12 months from the date that Contractor is no longer employed by the Company, Contractor shall not take any actions to assist Contractor's successor employer or any other entity in recruiting any other employee who works for or is affiliated with the Company. This includes, but is not limited to: \(a\) identifying to such successor employer or its agents or such other entity the person or persons who have special knowledge concerning the Company's processes, methods or confidential affairs; and \(b\) commenting to the successor employer or its agents or such other entity about the quantity of work, quality of work, special knowledge, or personal characteristics of any person who is still employed at the Company. Contractor also agrees that Contractor will not provide such information set forth in \(a\) and \(b\) above to a prospective employer during interviews preceding possible employment.

SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS PROVISION

This Agreement may be assigned by the Company in the event of a merger or consolidation of the Company or in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's business.

SEVERABILITY PROVISION

The covenants of this Agreement shall be severable, and if any of them is held invalid because of its duration, scope of area or activity, or any other reason, the parties agree that such covenant shall be adjusted or modified by the court to the extent necessary to cure that invalidity, and the modified covenant shall thereafter be enforceable as if originally made in this Agreement. Contractor agrees that the violation of any covenant contained in this Agreement may cause immediate and irreparable harm to the Company, the amount of which may be difficult or impossible to estimate or determine. If Contractor violates any covenant contained in this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to equitable relief by injunction or otherwise, in addition to all other rights and remedies afforded by law.""

My goals are pretty simple. I want to do the internship \(for around 2\-3 months\), leave, wait 6 months, and create the agency using the experience I got from the internship. Yes I've spoken to the contractor. No I have not signed the Contract.

Thanks for reading,

Cheers

Unfortunately, whatever I learned in school does not seem to be translating well to practical work skills.

Currently, I have an internship at a company that produces a Windows desktop application. My job is to fix the bugs/new features that are sent my way. However, I'm having difficulties understanding the code and coming up with code to fix the problem.

Initially I thought the reason might be the code quality. The product has been written since 15-20 years ago, I've been told it's over 300,000 lines, old code isn't removed but commented out, code isn't documented much besides having the bug number and title, etc. Due to the relatively large and relatively old code base and code being commented out, I've had trouble finding what section of code I should be modifying. Since code isn't documented much, I try to set a breakpoint within functions to figure out how I should be using them. And setting a breakpoint and making it hit is always difficult for me since I can't find where I shoudl be setting the breakpoints.

However, it's been 3 months and although I do have some general ideas about certains parts of the code, I still have difficulties reading and writing code. Other coworkers are doing fine, even the newer employees whose only been around 1-2 years. I thought that the old code could be part of the problem, but even when working with newer code that been recently written, I still have trouble reading and writing code. At this point, I'm pretty certain there's something I'm missing. I've taken 20-40 hours to fix 2-5 hours bugs and I think once I've reached close to 50 hours for a 3 hours estimated bug. And those fixes ended up being small as well.

I've worked with other people's code in school with group projects and tutoring other students from lower division CS courses and did fine with that. I've also written my own code and did fine with that. Of course everything I've done was on a much smaller scale compared to work, but I've expected that I'd be able to transition smoothly over time, which I haven't. It's like I have a venn diagram of school skills and work skills and while there are some in common, there are some crucial skills in the work skills set that's not in the school skills.

Has anybody experienced this and if so, what was the problem and how did you overcome it? If not, does anyone have any advice for me? I don't even know where to start in order to improve myself since I don't even know what I'm missing/doing wrong."

general knowledge: cybrary CompTIA A+(done), nand to Tetris 1 (done), I will study some math and physics cause I think they might help as a first principle for things I don't get the big picture for like wireless networking so decided maybe some math and physics might help

for operating systems: nand to Tetris 2, hack the kernel, I will try tinker with hardware projects to fully grasp how computers work like this one: https://eater.net/8bit/ , maybe other projects will come up I will hope to implement and play with

for programming: there an initiative called Mohamed ibn Rashid ( ruler of Dubai) to learn Arab youth how to code it's basically udacity intro programming courses and if you are among the top 100 you will get to study full stack nano degree

for learning about cybersecurity: that is sans path for different roles in cybersecurity https://www.sans.org/media/security-training/roadmap.pdf I will go into penetration testing path since of course, I don't have the money to take sans courses I will take another free course that matches them from cybrary and other free cybersecurity resources

notes
 * as for networking I am learning about it while I am studying cybersecurity 
* maybe someone will say that I don't need that much of programming but in my country, there's few security-related internships or jobs so I will try to get a job or internship as full stack developer and advance to security-focused job and maybe get some certificates to polish my resume

* i am dedicating all time to studying which is 13h every day

* my goal is to get a job outside my country maybe in USA or Canada or the UK so I can move there, have many issues in my country

* i have 3 years before I finish my college do you think I might be able to be in a ""good place in my career "" to get a job in security?

So I did my Masters program in Edinburgh and upon its completion I got a part\-time job working retail while I looked for a full\-time position in my field. About mid October I was offered what I thought was my dream internship with a company in Cardiff. I quickly accepted it and agreed to work remotely until I could make the full move at the beginning of December.

It is now almost May, the internship turned into a full\-time job offer which I accepted, and I have not settled into my new city at all. in fact, it has been so hard going on me that my anxiety has come back full force and I feel as if I'm just drifting through life. I'm not enjoying the job as much as I would have liked either and find that I'm regularly distracted at work, constantly thinking about when I'm going to make it back to Edinburgh. I recently made a trip back and came to the conclusion that it is worth it to be amongst friends and in a place I love rather than holding onto my current job simply for monetary security. 

I've only been with this company for six months now and if I did leave, I would have to give a three months notice as written in my contract. I feel trapped and the only solace I really have right now is applying for jobs and checking my emails for responses, but it's hard for me to remain patient while battling this daily depression. 

Part of me is tempted to put in my notice now, job search those three months and prepare for the move. But that would also be putting me in a financially vulnerable position if I didn't secure anything. I'm trying to think through this situation logically and not act out of emotion, but I'm in a really bad place right now and I'm losing sight of what would be best for me. 

Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks xx"

Bit of backstory, I graduated from a pretty highly regarded university last May, but unfortunately due to a few personal reasons and never really getting the right guidance, I don’t have any internship experience and have only been spending the time since graduating learning some new frameworks/technologies. 

I have a few small projects on my resume, as well a somewhat related position as a T.A. for an upper level CS elective that taught web development, but I still feel like my lack of experience makes it hard for me to get my foot in the door.

8ekwwk,12,2018-04-24,Is it feasible for someone to work full time (40 hours/week) and enroll part/full time in college,theif519,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8ekwwk/is_it_feasible_for_someone_to_work_full_time_40/,"One thing that has been bothering me quite a bit is the fact that there are those who are less fortunate that do not have the same opportunities that I have. 

For fields like the Humanities and Arts, I can see it being possible, albeit difficult to obtain their degrees, although their curriculum is much less rigorous than STEM. It seems the average hours per week for liberal arts is ~10 hours per week. For STEM fields it can easily be ~20 hours per week, perhaps more depending on the major and the ability of the student. Someone who is a genius/highly intelligent or at least had some intuitive grasp on the concepts could possibly get by on less than half of that. However, it shouldn't go unsaid that some CS homework assignments are extremely lengthy, and so you can easily take more time from writing and debugging code (especially from the latter). Lets estimate the number of hours per week as [10..20], if you attend every single class and you have [8..15] credits, that's [18..35] hours on, meaning the range of hours per week spent on education and a job (+40) is [58..75] per week. Not to mention if you are aiming for a 4.0 or some high GPA, you definitely will take more time than [58..75] hours.

Now for most majors, the only kind of experience you are expected to gain are internships over the summer, but that also poses a problem in and of itself. If you work [58..75] hours per week, when do you have time to perform any networking? Even if you do secure yourself an internship, what about your job? If you do not get an internship, you do not have experience, and without experience it will be extremely difficult to transition into a job within your own field. The only type of internship I can think of with such versatile hours to allow you to keep your own job is either freelance work or perhaps something like Google Summer of Code (although good luck finding a project if you have a 40+ hour commitment, plus most projects require some experience in the technology you will be contributing to). 


Note as well that the [58..75] hours does not include time for commutes, sleep, recreational time, breakfast, working out, etc. The final nail in the coffin is that, unique to Computer Science, you're expected to have some side projects. When would you ever have the time to also work on side projects, your GitHub portfolio, etc., when you barely have the time to satisfy your basic needs.  Even if you do manage everything, you could end up without a job, as you lack the necessary experience. As you lacked the time to network within your field you will have a harder time even getting an opportunity to interview and getting through HR. 

I'm not trying to discourage anyone, but from what I have seen, my fellow students that I have graduated with that struggled to find experience, had to work jobs over the summer, and one who even had to work part time concurrently with school, most of them are having trouble finding jobs or working in non-CS related industries. I just want to know any opinions, stories or anecdotal evidence that others have that help establish feasibility in someone less fortunate going into CS. (Note I am not talking about self-teaching, I mean a full on CS curriculum at an accredited institution)."

I'm a second year CS student.  
Little premise: I love coding, any coding, is what I like more in my degree and in my previous work experience, I just like to spend day programming anything.  
Now, to the question: for next summer I got offered 2 (maybe 3) summer internships, that are all different and they have their pros and cons. I will be using two main and one secondary parameter to describe the three offers and I just want to have a little advice.  
  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Job 1:   
Big company, leader in the sector for years, very famous. The internship is not great, I'd be doing mostly boring stuff and 0 programming BUT it will look amazing on the CV. The job will also be in my home town, so nothing too special about the location.  
CV: Excellent  
Job: Meh  
Life-experience: Not so good  
  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Job 2:   
Small startup, really interesting stuff, using blockchain and some other new technologies and I'd be doing mostly coding. The job would be abroad, so big plus on that.  
CV: It's a startup, therefore not known  
Job: Nice  
Life-experience: Good  
  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Job 3:  
Average of the other 2. A decently famous company and a pretty nice job, in my country but not in my town  
CV: avg  
Job: avg  
Life-experience: avg  
  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Which of these three parameters should I prioritise? All three jobs are good of course and I'd learn something from all of them

They explained the position wasn't just a normal tech support position and involved working directly with the software team. I accepted the offer because I figured any internship that is somewhat in the field of what I want to do is beneficial plus I will probably learn some valuable skills and make some connections.

I become a shy, introverted (perhaps not quite the word), anxious mess.  I immediately lose confidence and become really self-conscious.

This depends on the situation, as the title of my post suggests.  If I'm speaking over the phone, or I'm with friends who I'm comfortable with, I can carry on a conversation, and behave normally without too much anxiety.  It's only these social situations, where I have to deal with small talk, and approaching people I don't know well, that I completely shut down.  I really want to get over this. 

I've been trying little things - going to meetups, and talking to people I haven't met before, getting on stage and doing things at bars, stuff like that. I still have this issue.  I really want to get over it. I'm sick of being a lovable introvert at family gatherings.  I'm not asking to be this great lively person, I just want to get over the anxiety, and be able to say hello, how's it going, and make small talk with people I don't know well without hiding in a shell and that's literally what I do. When people visit and I'm at my parent's house, I hide.  I go to my room and shut the door.  I used to pretend I was studying, otherwise, I'll hide somewhere else and watch TV and pray that nobody comes downstairs.

I just shut down. Even in the work place I've had this issue.  I get anxious, and hide.  During my internship I spent the first 3 or 4 months eating in my cubicle.  I eventually got the nerve to go and sit down with everyone else and eat.

Again, I don't have this problem if I'm with a small group of friends or talking to an individual friend. It's just groups of people who I don't know well, or unfamiliar situations or venues."

**I am a foreigner without green card**. So a lot of government options are not available. 

A few years ago after my MS in informatics\(no in US\), I decided to work math but it looks like it didn't worked for me. I mean doing a phd is find but  doing 2\~3 postdoc before landing any tenured position looks awful for me. So I decided to leave academia and to find a job in cs.

I am trying to find a summer intern and it looks like the job market is really full loaded with entry\-level  programmers and the competition is heavy.

I have been searching for summer intern from the end of February but the market is harsh. 

I have a few options on mind as said in the title and also a few issues needed addressed. 

My MS taught the basics of Algo &amp;DS, DB, System  and OS. But it has been years ago and my knowledge is really rusty. I did not done any project because my thesis is in CS theory.

My biggest weakness is **I don't have any intern or real project done yet**. I chose to do all the theory stuff. But it looks published papers not matters to the recruiters.  

I received a few rejections and I am kind lost in browsing  LinkedIn and Glassdoor. I find that most summer intern either required you know something like Node.js or Json which is not taught in school, most of them looks front\-end or some famous companys asking for 3 year experience in Java or C\+\+ .

One issue is that while I am find with learning or relearning these things, I don't know where to find 

a place to do some side project to stuff my resume. This really bothers me a lot. 

There are three options I am think about to explore more, but I need somebody more experience to advise me on the pros and cons and which should I go further. It is obvious that I cannot study for all these three kinds.

1 Software Engineering 

2 Data Science/ Machine learning.

3 Quant.

Here are some my own pros and cons.

1  Software Engineering .

pros:

1.  plenty of interns 
2. Material allover Internet if one wants to study.
3. Solid career that guaranteed in the future.

Cons

1. so many competitors 
2. Low entry\- bar so self\-taught can do it which  comes back to 1.
3. No maths involved.
4. kind of hostile to postgraduate degree.

2 DS/ML

pros

1. Kind of new and market is needing more people
2. Math needed
3. Playing with data is fun

cons

1. I don't know where to start except study books 
2. It's very expensive to do deep\-learning on one's own computer because the limited budget versus data size. I see my friend doing it in their lab and super jealous.
3. I am not sure how long this ML bubble will hold. not so determined to dive in.

3 Quant.

Pros 

1. PhD friendly
2. Heavily math invovled
3. Good pay.

Cons

1. More friendly to Physics and applied maths phd than pure maths
2. very limited positions.
3. I have no idea what exactly is this job is like. Some company claim they admit people with no finance background but they probably wants somebody with an IMO gold or ICPC finalist which unfortunately I don't have any. 

So any option or advice is welcomed. I am eager to hear what you guys in think about. "

I was hoping to get your feedback.

My four-month Cybersecurity internship is coming to an end as of this week and I'll be graduating after this work term! Earlier today, my manager offered me a full-time position at the firm, which is great! But, this is where it gets ugly.

Prior to receiving this offer, I accepted a DevOps position with a known retail company. According to my colleagues who work there, it's a great opportunity that I shouldn't pass up.

If I were to take the Cybersecurity offer, it would be possible for me to get high-quality training and courses (namely the OSCP and GPEN). Since this is a consulting firm, I'd also have the opportunity to bridge into different fields like Machine Learning, DevOps, and Networking. To top it off, my teammates are highly skilled and I like what my manager has envisioned for the team. Everyone's cool and a pleasure to work with. In regards growth, my manager has given me the go-ahead to apply for a future PenTesting position, which is also something I would be extremely excited about. But, this would also mean burning the bridge with the work arrangement that I have made.

The DevOps position gives me the opportunity to rotate positions every 8 months. I'd have the opportunity to get training and would also receive an allowance to pursue some courses. Some of the alumni from my college work there and have said positive things about the place. Additionally, the work arrangement they've provided is quite flexible. I don't know much about the team, but the manager sounds professional based on our phone conversation and he seems to know about networking and development. I'd have the opportunity to get involved with Cybersecurity as well, but I wouldn't have the same access to training as my current place. There are also some pretty cool opportunities to find positions in AR and VR and work with innovative technologies as well. If I accept this position, my current manager said that he'd welcome me back, but I would also have to compete with potential new hires.

Should I stay in Cybersecurity and burn the bridge to the other company? Or should I test the waters and see if I would like it in retail?

TL;DR - I accepted a DevOps position prior to my internship, but my manager is offering me a full-time opportunity in Cybersecurity."

I did extremely bad on the first exam, studied like my life depended on it, redid all the labs and practice exams, went to too many OH to count, and I know for a fact I failed the second prelim. And what makes it worse is that it seems that everyone is going to do better on this prelim and I'm just floundering. I just can't figure out how to do well on the exams. I also struggle with the assignments and end up getting below the mean (but not as bad as the prelims).

My life has generally been heading in a darker direction and I've had some people suggest CAPS but I really don't see how going to CAPS will help. I mean, I could rant about being a failure at CS and my inability to get internships, but all the counselor would probably do is tell me that I'm more than just my grades or achievements. And I suppose that's true, but to the CS department, that's what I am essentially and if I'm not a grade they'll like, I'm getting kicked out. 

I don't know of one person that's struggling (and not struggling and still exceling but struggling and getting no better), so I just feel alone in this because I constantly hear people talk about how poorly they do, but in CS land doing poorly is like getting an 80%.  I'm in that boat where I don't know if I can get even a C-. I have As in every other class, but 3110 is like that storm cloud that's gradually turning into a thunderstorm. I work at least 5x as hard in 3110 as I do in any other class and devote 90% of my time to 3110, but nothing gets better and all my work is for nothing.

I think my mental health and quality of life has also taken a major downturn; I have a certain spot on campus where I go to cry when 3110 gets unbearably difficult. The stress has messed up my sleep schedule and I think I'm developing problems with my heart from all the stress and anxiety. But it's just one big feedback loop and more failures means more stress which means less mental acuity which means more failures. There hasn't been one day in the past month that I haven't been stressed, depressed, or sleep deprived.

I don't even know why I wrote this post but I just needed to let this out because my friends in CS would probably call me a dumbass if they knew how my grades in 3110 really were; I already know I am, I don't need them to remind me. I just can't find the light in the tunnel with anything 3110-related."

And those have been bizarre encounters - these interviewers have been clearly looking for someone with years of real world software engineering experience, not an intern looking for entry work experience. An interviewer grilled me for 20 minutes on the ins and outs of dockers, security frameworks, and F# - my best friend's a senior dev at Epic and he couldn't answer the questions I shared with him. And this has been consistent with my few other interviews, too.

I am unsure what schools I have a realistic chance of getting into. What should I do to prepare to apply to grad school next year (other than take the GRE ASAP). I’ve talked to professors about grad school, and most of them would be happy to write letters of recommendation and such, but suggest that I should try to work in the field doing software development for awhile first. Thanks for any advice. If there are questions please let me know.

I am thinking about UT, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Caltech, and maybe one international school. Are these choice too “pie in the sky” (unrealistic, not possible, etc...)?"

So I got an internship for the summer at a small securities firm. This would be great but I have some concerns:

1) They have TERRIBLE reviews on Glassdoor, saying the culture is horrid and the owners are the most unethical people on the face of the earth. Some reviews also stated that if I were to take the job that'd I'd have to make sure I get any and all compensation in writing.

2) This internship isn't paid by the hour. They said I'd get a stipend at the end of the summer. This seems a little fishy to me and until I get an actual amount I won't know if I'm getting underpaid.

3) This is unrelated to the internship but my friemds and I have been working on a ""start-up"" of sorts making a SaaS for a niche market. We already have our first customer for when we release in December. Taking the internship would mean I wouldn't have much time at all to work on this. This product isn't ""drop out of school"" lucrative, but it has the potential to be a steady income and is in the field I want to work in.

You can probably tell I'm leaning towards not accepting the internship, but would turning it down be foolish and hurt me in the long run?"

I have sent out a bunch of applications so far to everything in my area that I have felt even slightly qualified for, and so far I have only had one interview, which I have not heard back from three weeks later.  Unfortunately, I feel that there are many internships that I cannot apply for due to lacking the necessary skills for the job or due to some gpa cutoff (my gpa at my current school is only a 2.75, but at my previous school I had a 3.75).  I also have no relevant work experience and have spent my previous summers doing summer school.

Is there anything I should be doing to help better my chance for getting an internship right now?  I live in a large city, but should I start looking for internships elsewhere if I am having trouble finding something here?  Should I start applying to IT internships as well, even if it is not something I would like to do after graduation?

First of all I want to apologize if you happened to read this post earlier today, I accidentally deleted it an am unable to retrieve it.

I am a senior about to graduate from a Big 10 school with a reputable CS program, and I have been really trying to move to Chicago for a while now. I have a decent GPA and I interned at a Fortune 50 company in Minneapolis last summer, and luckily I was extended a full-time offer from them, but I love the city of Chicago and I really, really am trying to relocate after graduation (either this summer or Fall).

I have been applying to several companies based in Chicago, but I have not heard anything from them (Groupon, United Airlines, Accenture, Deloitte), and I interviewed at a small private one who although they were impressed with my past experience and me making it into the 3rd and last round of the interview, for some reason they decided to move on with other applicants...

I currently live in Wisconsin. The company that extended me the full time offer is in Minneapolis, but Chicago is the place I feel I belong in. Any advice on where to go from here? Having experienced and thrived in the corporate life from my internship, I was hoping to end up at a relatively large company instead of a startup, but beggers can't be choosers so at this point I am pretty open. I just feel like if I stay with my current company I will be anchored in Minneapolis long term, so I want to move while I am still young. I know this sounds like the biggest first world problems, but the pressure is really stressing me out..

Any tips, connections etc. on what to do from here? I feel like I have the qualifications, I am also well spoken and able to make a conversation, but I am not getting a reply at all (not even rejection) from companies I have applied at..."

I am debating which exam to take or I should take both.

If the expensive cost of taking the exam is not my primary concern, 

Will I be better off taking CKE 1 exam first and see how things work and take CKE 2 exam after?

I feel as though I’ve got a good understanding of concepts and usually know how to make things happen in code, but I find myself constantly looking up syntax on the internet. Sometimes I just get languages confused and can’t remember stuff like if I need to use a parenthesis or bracket, exact method names, placements of periods/semicolons, etc. Most of the time I think I know the right answer but maybe I’m too quick to look it up because I don’t want to write it out and test it to see if it’s correct first.

I did an internship as part of my program, and I had to reference the internet constantly, but of course this was acceptable because I was there in order to learn and I was using frameworks/platforms I had never worked with before.

Sophomore CS major here. I recently turned down a return offer for my previous .NET internship in my hometown and accepted an offer for a Data Analyst internship. Not sure how I got the job - I kind of stumbled my way through the statistics portion of the interview since I'm no math major (they made the offer knowing full well I'm in intro stats), though I did well on the programming - but working with stuff like web scraping, databases, and NLP sounded like a worthwhile learning experience to me.

However, after doing some research on this sub (I know, I know) I can't help but feel a little worried.

I’m a senior AP student in high school, and our school has a program where, after the AP tests, all seniors go on an internship instead of going to classes. The one requirement, however, is you can’t fail any class any quarter of the school year. My AP physics teacher just gave us the test for the final chapter of the year, and the only test the last quarter of the year. Every student bombed it. It was unbelievably hard, even for my physics teacher. And, since its one of the only grades for the last quarter of the year, he singlehandedly fucked over almost every student out of their senior internship.

There are other grades in the quarter to recover from, like a lab report and online work, but thanks to both my depression and my birthday being the same day they were due I couldn’t do either of those. I didn’t even enjoy my birthday party that night because I was so worried about how the rest of this school year is gonna end.

I also haven’t slept well the past few days because of nightmares and sleep paralysis popping up out of nowhere. With how bad they were, I just don’t want to sleep anymore. Some examples of these nightmares include
  - Fifty people (including myself) killing themselves by gun for no reason. The rest of the dream was me staring at my own corpse, and I could feel the blood slowly running down my entire body the entire time and even after I woke up.
  - Watching a total stranger slowly and methodically kidnap all my friends, line them up in a row, and shoot them one by one. This repeated in my head for hours until I woke up.
  - Hearing my sister attempting to scare me by shouting “boo!” into my ear, only to realize when I jolted awake I couldn’t move and my sister has been at work for hours.
  - Getting screamed at by my parents at the volume of a megaphone for not doing any of my work non-stop. During the screaming, I was slowly sinking lower and lower into the couch I was sitting on until it felt like I was suffocating. I barely got up for school in time because the volume of my alarm felt muted out compared to how loud they were shouting at me.

I can’t focus, study, sleep, or feel happy anymore, and I just want some small advice that could get my life back on track at least a little bit. This is also my first real experience with persistent nightmares, and I need advice on how to deal with that properly. Thank you so much to anyone who even reads to the end."

Not because I don't want to but because it's too busy to take the time to do new things]. 

However, now I am looking for a new job in the Detroit area. I am very open to learning on the job and good at it but because of lack of experience even with a degree, would it be acceptable to ask for 40-50k for IT/ network admin or software production? 

What job would be best to look for? There are quite a few but 1) I'm not a 100% what to ask for and b) how I can learn to do more to find good jobs.

I am working on my ccna cert which will help me majorily [or so I hope], working on programming languages, and going to grad school in the fall (for cyber security which I really enjoy but have not yet had enough experience outside of the classroom).

I'm a junior at my state's university, and I recently added Computer Science as a major. I originally was planning on pursuing a graduate work in Mathematics, but I took some upper level courses and really struggled and didn't really enjoy them that much, so I ended up deciding to add Computer Science and pursue that as a career. I lucked out and landed a BigN internship doing some Automation/ML work, and have no clue on what to expect for my first internship.

1. Am I expected to come in knowing a bunch of stuff? \(It's a junior internship for a full\-time position, and a lot of the advice I see on here tells freshmen/sophomores to not worry about it too much\)
2. Is there anything I should be studying besides keeping my coding and data structures/algorithm skills up to date?
3. Should i be looking up project management methodologies \(like Agile?\) to get an idea of what to expect in terms of meetings?
4. Should I learn GitHub? \(During my previous internships, if I did any programming, it was solo so it wasn't too bad if I didn't use version control\)

Cynic in me wants to say people were projecting their insecurities or envy or assumed I was a humble brag, but I'm not sure. I will approach my post differently and post with the TL;DR version, clarifying with details if anyone asks for it.* 

________________

**TL;DR don't know whether choosing a PhD program or a well-paying, but less interesting job is a better choice for my long-term life satisfaction**

Hoping to get some constructive responses here and I'd appreciate any advice anecdotal or not. 

Background: I am a junior with 2 years research experience in a lab starting sophomore year. The professor views me favorably for maintaining interest and consistently doing work in the lab. I am a coauthor in a minor paper. The research area(s) I am interested in is human intelligence / computational neuro / AI. I am planning on applying to around 5 grad schools for research in/related to AGI, and think that I will have a favorable chance for admission into some of the programs. 

In my past summer internship, I worked as a software engineer intern, and this coming summer I will be a trading intern at a prop shop. Though it isn't guaranteed, I am confident in my ability to secure a job at a well-paying software company or financial institution after graduating from undergrad. 

I know with these jobs in industry I would have more free time, be more relatively stress-free, and have a ""comfortable"" life with a great salary. The money and the ability to splurge with a high-income lifestyle might be lame, but it's very appealing to me. I think my growing up in a very poor family affects how badly I desire financial security and freedom. 

On the other hand, I am legitimately interested in human intelligence and my researching with my professor these past two years haven't just been to pad graduate school admissions. I am genuinely interested and actually get excited when it comes to the topic. For some reason I also have an innate desire to just make a big and significant contribution to this during my lifetime. At the risk of embarrassment, my dream is to be able to provide change via services/products related to my research topic of AGI at the level that people like Musk and Bezos are doing today. I think a PhD would better enable and prepare me to make that kind of change (though the odds are infinitesimal to begin with). 

I keep struggling with myself with thoughts like ""choosing a comfortable industry job over a PhD is settling, and not achieving your full potential"", ""Money could buy you lots of comfort, novel experiences, goods to splurge on..."", ""Money won't make you happy in the end, you'll just realize a decade in that you made the wrong choice going for money over an interest you have a passion for"".

I would love any advice on how I can clear up my priorities for life, how I can determine what would bring more satisfaction, any personal anecdotes, similar situations, etc. Apologies for the rant-like formatting. The time is drawing so near for me to make such a huge decision in my life and I really don't know what to do. "

My first was in chemistry.  Before going to school I ran and owned a lawn care service.  I'm 27, if that has anything to do with it. I have had no luck finding a job over the past year.  The job search stress is literally tearing apart my family and my relationship and friendships.  I can't make my student loan payments or pay my other bills, nor am I eligible for any unemployment benefits so I'm really struggling right now. I have been arriving to the conclusion that perhaps there simply aren't any opportunities in the engineering fields due to the fact that it seems that employers want to hire unicorns who somehow just graduated college with a 3.5+ gpa and 3-5 years of engineering experience and 2 Olympic gold medals.

I have done the following:

1) Networked, extensively.  Via linkedin, family and friends.  I've contacted many hiring managers who replied with ""I really like this resume and your experience however we have no positions available where you would be a fit for"". I've even networked with a couple regulars at my gym.

2) Had my resume critiqued

3) Had my interview skills assessed and improved

4) Attended career fairs

5) Applied to over 1,000 positions where I meet the requirements (some engineering positions, others non engineering)

6) Tailored my resume and cover letter for every position I apply for

7) Applied to places in all 50 states of the USA

8) Contacted recruiters

9) I've never been asked for my gpa, although it is sub 3.0

10) I had paid internships in pharmaceutical manufacturing as a student

11) I had an undergraduate research position in a material science lab while I was a student

12) Volunteered to help program a pressure safety control program for a major company after graduation.

13) I've called companies

14) I've done everything I could possibly think of to get noticed or hired. 

I have no idea what other careers that I could go for. Would I have better luck applying for office jobs or as a manager somewhere? Especially as an older graduate who has work experience running his own operation?  Time for me is more important than for the typical grad because I'm 27, rather than 21-23.

I'm a sophomore in college whose just recently switched to a Computer Science degree, and this summer I was fortunate enough to land a software engineering internship. However, all of my classes at school and thus all my programming experience has been in C++, while for this internship I'll be mostly working in Java. I'm almost done with school for the year, and I'll have a couple weeks of nothing to do before my internship starts, so I'd like to dive in and start to familiarize myself with Java. What would be the best way for me to do this? 

I've already looked over some of the key differences between Java and C++, and I completed the CodeAcademy course on Java, but I found that it really only covered surface-level stuff. Ideally, I'd like to find something similar to the CodeAcademy course but more in depth and more tailored for people with previous coding experience, so any suggestions in that area would be greatly appreciated. From what I can tell, Java and C++ are very similar, but I'd still like to get some structured practice with Java to learn the nuances and better prepare myself.

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions."

I am deciding between to of my top choices right now: Berkeley and Yale. I have received a regents scholarship at Berkeley to study EECS, therefore I have priority class enrollment and guaranteed on-campus housing. At yale, my net cost is almost half of Berkeley's (although finances aren't an issue for me.)

Yale's CS is notoriously theoretical, meaning there are almost no classes that focus on practice and applications of CS. I want to explore different fields of CS so I would have to do it on my own time. Berkeley's program is great, however. I don't think the competition at Berkeley would be an issue for me.

I like Yale's friendly atmosphere and that things are so conveniently places together. This is especially helpful in the winter, meaning I probably won't leave my residential college. I'm from California and I prefer the weather here (so Berkeley takes this.)

 I hope to have internships in silicon valley for all of my summers. I hope to move to silicon valley after graduation also. 

Your comments will help me a lot. Thank you!"

Let's assume I'm not a moron who doesn't know how to google, I have basic computer skills and practices, and I actively try to implement any procedure that improves my computer's health (and my sanity). Wherever you smell something fishy, don't be afraid to call me out for bad practices and do improve it as much as you can so that I can make your life (and my life) easier. I want to be as pro-active as possible when it comes to the computers I use and work on, especially if my livelihood depends on them.

* Who am I? (and other basic information)

&gt; Engineer (currently a student in Uni) with a client work computer running CAD software (Solidworks/Autodesk with PDM tools), project management software (probably MS Project or Jira), Office 365 suite (especially Excel with VBA scripts), and miscellaneous tools to work with raw data (STL or CSV files) and whatever proprietary formats are thrown at me (think software that requires administrator's password but is common enough to be granted access easily). I also use a personal computer (described in detail below) use for work-related tasks I'd rather not do on my client computer in addition to my personal use. I'm competent with programming (and the inevitable debugging) and I'm familiar ^^^^cursed ^^^^by ^^^^being ^^^^the ^^^^youngest ^^^^one with debugging common issues on colleagues's workstations.

---

* Configuration and needs 

(this similar to what I've used in the past (with a lot of them currently being used). I'm really aiming at future-proofing for security and stability reasons and I'd love to know where I'm going wrong.


DESCRIPTION: Devices Overview: 

&gt; Office PC : Windows 10 (software described above and shouldn't cause issues in any workplace).

&gt;  Personal laptop : Macbook '14 with Linux (openSUSE) (explained in detail below) 

&gt; Cellphone: (cheap) Samsung with Android (exclusively for work calls and separate from personal phone that is never connected to office infrastructure).


DESCRIPTION: Personal Computer:

&gt; Used for mostly non-work related or personal software I don't want to install on a client computer. Most important uses I can think of include: 

&gt; 1) running emacs+org-mode for meeting notes and other text files, 

&gt; 2) maintaining a personal mediawiki for work documentation about common workflows &amp; procedures that involve another department (because such documentation was usually sparse/non-existent in my previous workplace), 

&gt; 3) running a personal task manager that I can view on a separate screen for convenience, 

&gt; 4) developing work-related scripts (mostly Excel VBA scripts) using an actual development environment on an OS that doesn't crash (emacs + windows in virtualbox). Developed scripts are transferred to work computer for actual use.

&gt; 5) non-work related programs &amp; scripts - usually my podcasts or music for routine tasks and personal scripts that are unrelated to work (an example would be a script to check if my personal website is still up and to inform me if it's down since I have servers and services that are located at that domain). 

&gt; 6) as a functioning computer (with the software I use pre-installed w/ Windows via Virtualbox) to debug stuff if my work computer crashes/freezes and as a general backup computer if my workstation is unreliable and needs to be fixed. Because debugging Windows on the same malfunctioning computer is hell and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.



POTENTIAL SECURITY RISK: WIFI access for personal device: 

&gt; I would probably request access to the office WiFi for my personal machine because I can only do so much without the internet. **This hasn't been as issue so far but might be a security issue in the future**. If you run a workplace that restricts WiFi for personal laptops belonging to employees (as opposed to phones which are usually allowed), how would you deal with this scenario? **Optional** If you restrict WiFi for all devices and only use Ethernet with client workstations (I'm guessing for security reasons), how hard ^(read ""annoying"") would it be to request Ethernet access for a personal device (assuming I'm familiar with setting up security credentials, and I get buy-in from my manager). I understand that such decisions depend on the sysadmin and office culture I work with but I'd like to know what your decision would be (and why it makes sense for you to do so.) Always liked knowing the reason behind something that annoys me instead of blindly blaming the IT department.


POTENTIAL SECURITY RISK: USB Port Access: 

&gt; I will almost always request USB access if the ports are software blocked (can't really do much if the physical port has been disabled) and would happily use a USB hub if required. I use a hard disk frequently (for backups) and I would like to use a USB to move very large files that can't be reasonably transferred over email/cloud storage. **This hasn't been an issue so far but could be a security issue in the future.** If you run an workplace that disables access to USB devices (no exceptions due to security concerns), how do you deal with users who need to transfer large files quickly without uploading them to the cloud (uploading to the cloud takes an inordinate amount of time). 

&gt; **Optional** Would you agree to USB access for a specific device if the user is somewhat competent and can deal with whatever security requests you have (especially for a port reserved for backups and nothing else)? AFAIK, USB ports are usually blocked because of concerns about malware - such concerns shouldn't apply to a device attached at all times to a client and if the user isn't incompetent. (The last place I worked at didn't block USBs and I'm pretty certain the next place I work at will have greater concerns about security - which will disrupt how I transfer files quickly.)


POTENTIAL SECURITY RISK: Hourly backups on personal hard disk:

&gt; I'm very insistent on regular backups because I'm paranoid about losing files and progress (I maintain a hard disk and a paid Dropbox account for local and remote backups for work). I used to maintain personal backups of my work PC in addition to the backup that the IT department provided (their backups are usually a day old and IT is usually too busy to restore my backup in a reasonable timespan.) **This hasn't been an issue so far but could be a information security issue in the future** It wasn't a issue in my previous workplace despite the fact I routinely worked with confidential information - in fact, most employees who cared about backups made a private Dropbox backup for special files in addition to the office backups and I made hourly system-wide backups without concerns from IT (I did ask them before making the backups). I haven't heard of hourly backups for employees (perhaps I'm mistaken) and I don't expect it in the future - keeping a hourly backup on my work computer might only be possible on a personal hard disk. I wouldn't mind wiping said hard disk upon leaving the company if required.

&gt; **Wait a sec, hourly backups? Why on earth would you need that? Isn't that a bit too overkill?**

&gt; Keeping hourly local backups that I can restore quickly in a couple of minutes is almost a necessity to ensure that my files were always available &amp; safe with the shit hardware I have. While I might not be taking important meeting notes in the future, I'm pretty sure I'll need that kind of stability if I am to be trusted with important work - it's far too easy to be the new over-achieving engineer who is initially known for getting shit done and then be stuck as the new engineer with a bad reputation for losing important notes (even if I was the main reason such notes even existed in the first place.) 

--- 

* User behavior 
(mostly to give you an idea of what I'm like when shit hits the fan. Hopefully this give you an idea of my computer competence and even help you improve/replace bad or missing procedures)


General software debugging: 

&gt; I actually read error dialogs and can debug common issues with them (grew up fixing my parent's, friends', and teacher's computer issues and I've always been surprised at how most people ignore the software trying ^^^^really ^^^^nicely to help them). I'm probably not as familiar with proprietary software as I'd like to be when it comes to debugging (think weird error codes with MS Project) but I can mostly manage on my own ^(Stackoverflow and Google are divine gifts to engineers and programmers alike). 

&gt; (On a related side note, on the one occasion I have had to ask my sysadmin for assistance, I apparently made him quite happy when I gave him a USB containing crash dumps of my work computer with an attached Post-It note with the error code I saw, general instructions on reproducing the error, and plausible reasons as to why it occurred along with the assurance that I had already restored my system to my most recent backup and that I would inform him if a similar crash happened. According to him, he's used to dealing with people who could only complain that their computer was ""broken"" with no meaningful information about what could have led to the system crash. Not sure if I was supposed to feel proud or sad. Exactly how bad are most sysadmin's expectations &amp; experiences with the average engineer/worker at your workplace?). 

Windows crashes &amp; the blue screen of death (because they always happen at some point): 

&gt; While I've never analyzed Windows crash dumps myself, I'm told they're useful for troubleshooting and I always record crash dumps using BlueScreenView and save it to free USB for the sysadmin/IT guy to look at (although this doesn't happen often). I haven't yet used Windows 10 in a client workstation in a work environment (used Windows 8 before returning to uni) so this might not be as big a deal now but if it still is and you'd recommend a specific tool(s), I'd love to know.

Separation between work and home (for general data security and sanity regarding work devices): 

&gt; I maintain a separation between work and home devices &amp; files as much as possible. As mentioned earlier, I keep a separate phone for work (a cheap Samsung (with android) that allows my to check my work email on the go). I fully expect my work phone to be wiped if/when I leave the company in accordance with security procedures (although it hasn't happened yet). As a general rule, I don't send work-related emails outside the company and clients (I'm sure most companies frown upon sending company-specific information outside the company and clients, even if they don't enforce the policy with an iron fist). 

Possible security procedures that involve wiping personal laptops upon exiting the company:

&gt; While I do try to maintain work-home separation with my devices other than my phone, namely my personal laptop, I usually have to accept that there will be some overlap (especially more common now as companies now tend to encourage bring-your-own-device policies and often don't explicitly inform their employees about security procedures upon termination). **Perhaps I'm being paranoid - I'd love to hear your take on this.** 
&gt; 
&gt; I think I'm ready for the worst case scenario (my personal computer completely wiped and my BTRFS backup partitions removed) -

&gt; 1) I maintain up-to-date configurations &amp; dotfiles for my personal computer (Ansible is wonderful),

&gt; 2) I always store personal documentation (media-wiki &amp; meeting notes) in an encrypted folder that is also backed up in Dropbox. 

&gt; 3) I backup the handy personal programs &amp; scripts I've developed at work (mostly VBA scripts to automate Excel inputs and batch report generation using Word) in a separate encrypted folder that is also backed up in Dropbox. 

&gt; 4) My personal files (such as music files and videos) are mostly saved on my home NAS (although it's mostly because my laptop is a piece of crap with next to no storage). 
&gt; 
&gt; In short, I think I'm prepared for my personal laptop to be wiped without notice (in addition to losing it altogether due to unforeseen circumstances) while keeping most, if not all, files that are important to me.


General computer hygiene and practices: 

&gt; 1) I'm not the type to use the office internet to download torrents ^^^despite ^^^the ^^^sweet ^^^sweet ^^^download ^^^speeds and dodgy executables ^^^because ^^^I'm ^^^not ^^^a ^^^stupid ^^^troglodyte. If it isn't right to steal office supplies, it isn't right to use the office wifi for torrenting. Also, I'd rather not provoke IT if they haven't already disabled it.

&gt; 2) Although I do have a personal website &amp; server that I'd love to use for personal convenience, it uses ports and protocols that are usually blocked by IT's firewalls; I avoid using them completely to prevent alarming IT too much (not interested in being on their radar due to unusual competence instead of the usual extreme incompetence - even if it forces me to use Dropbox and USBs instead of using my nextcloud server and a temporarily mounted folder on a FTP server). 

&gt; 3) I recognize phishing emails (and my previous IT department was super paranoid after an exec had an issue) and I know which files I've downloaded and need to run as opposed to random executables that come from Satan's bottom.

&gt; 4) I try to be pro-active when it comes to USB devices by flashing personal USBs before use and running anti-virus ^^^^a ^^^^personal ^^^^copy ^^^^of ^^^^Kaspersky ^^^^if ^^^^the ^^^^office ^^^^doesn't ^^^^provide ^^^^a ^^^^reliable ^^^^one on anything I plug into my system so that I can minimize attack vectors for malware (especially since I can't really trust my colleague's computer hygiene). 

&gt; 5) I disable Cortana and the Microsoft advertising bullshit that comes on Windows 10 and is likely to stay there because Microsoft is rolling around in ill-begotten money while laughing at the world. Not sure if I can do this on a work computer I use in the future but I'm gonna try, goddamnit. Hate that forced shit so much.

&gt; 6) I update regularly and perform re-installations on Windows on my personal computer when required (the one I run using virtualbox and on the personal Windows system I used to use) - mostly to get rid of any surprisingly large update files and files that stick around despite my best efforts to get rid of them ^( why is Windows shitty like this D: ) If even remotely feasible, I'd request IT to perform regular updates and yearly re-installations on my work computer just for peace of mind.

&gt; I try to be as diligent as possible about keeping my work computer and files clean and usable. I'd like to think I take my computer's health seriously and if there's something in here that is outdated knowledge or something that actively harms my computer, I'd highly appreciate it (I no longer use Windows as my personal driver and I'm afraid I'm a bit out of touch when it comes to its eccentricities).

* What I want from you? (btw, thanks for reading so far - you're awesome!)

&gt; How do I make life easier for you and what software and skills do I need to learn so that you can fix them easily. (Assume I have non-trivial googling skills and that I won't annoy you with five-minute fixes I can debug on my own). 

---

* Why am I asking? (and why does a (hopefully not too naive) college student care so much about this?)

&gt; I'm asking because I've seen too many highly-skilled colleagues (people I genuinely respect a lot) who astound me with their (lack of) computer skills - they usually don't have a clue as to how their computer works beyond their favorite application and it often leads to them losing work that's critical for deadlines.

&gt; During my internship, I hated and loved the fact that I could solve really simple tech issues that my much older (and far more experienced) co-workers had issues with - I could score easy brownie points while maintaining small-talk and looking impressive but I also knew that those same people should have learned these skills a long time ago (which makes me sad because how do you not learn them over the span of some twenty odd years?).
I'm certain you don't like dealing with engineers/workers who don't know how to use their computers properly and inevitably blame you for their fuck-ups (I'm pretty certain you absolutely hate dealing with that) - I'd love to not be that guy when I ask for assistance in the future and I'm sure that if something makes your life easier when it comes to my computer, it probably makes my life easier too. (Also, I'd rather not deal with issues concerning Windows and my shitty workstation because hell will freeze over before I work at a company that upgrades their computers before the current ones are old and beyond repair)

---

* Conclusion (because this long post definitely requires one)
I'd love suggestions/tips/advice on 

&gt; 1) improving basic procedures and hygiene standards when it comes to my computer (in addition/replacement to what I already do).

&gt; 2) common software that should really be used but usually isn't because of an under-qualified or inexperienced sysadmin, - I don't mind being the kid who bugs the sysadmin to get shit procedures and software changed to the correct way because he's a stubborn bastard (especially if it's my work on the line and because I do enjoy being that annoying bastard when deserved). 

&gt; 3) suggestion on improving and maintaining best practices with my colleagues (who might not be the best at taking care of their computers) - I'd be delighted as I hate dealing with fuckups I did not cause and I'm usually the one stuck dealing with them before they ask IT (which took forever to respond in the place I used to work at)."
8f4vrr,23,2018-04-26,My coworker is friendly with my abusive mom,[deleted],AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/8f4vrr/my_coworker_is_friendly_with_my_abusive_mom/,"My coworker is friendly with my mom. They used to work together in the same workplace many years ago and have a friendly relationship. I occasionally had dinner with her during my high school years.

Now I intern at a law firm. It's a law firm that caters mostly to Chinese speaking clients. When I started working there, I found to my surprise that my mom's friend also happens to work there. This friend \(I call her ""A yi""\-Chinese for auntie\) had always been very kind and friendly to me, so I personally have nothing against her.

Recently, my mom's friend told me that she thought it would be lovely if she invites me and my mother to dinner. I'm panicking right now. My mom was abusive to me for many years, and I decided to cut contact with her. To outside observers and friends though, my mom is super sweet and friendly, so nobody would ever guess how abusive she could be. For more info about the type of abuse I went through, read this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/8ee17x/why\_do\_so\_many\_people\_seem\_to\_consider\_abuse\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/8ee17x/why_do_so_many_people_seem_to_consider_abuse_to/)

My mom's friend is completely oblivious to the abuse my mom subjected me to when I was younger and probably considers this a nice dinner where she can catch up with an old workplace friend whom she hasn't spoken to in a very long time. She doesn't know I've gone no contact with her, and I don't think I can tell her. I am wondering what I should do. I really don't want to see my mom in person again because I'm filled with so much pain and anger just thinking about what she put me through. Should I go along with this and pretend to be sick on the day of the dinner? Should I go to the dinner for the sake of maintaining appearances and politely make small talk during the dinner? On the one hand, I just know that if I see my mother again, she'll try to find an excuse for us to be temporarily alone, she can try to guilt trip me into re\-continuing contact and gloss over the past. On the other hand, I know I should try to maintain a friendly relationship with a workplace colleague, and this friend will probably suspect something if I become sick every time she happens to arrange a dinner with me and my mother."

Recently the place has been going through cutbacks and the atmosphere is just not fun to be in.

My masters project is coming up and I was asked to come up with something that would help them out , so I did . Originally I want going to , but I ended up going for it.  Anyway, my actual formal presentation for the project is tomorrow in front of the board who decides on the projects viability. But after a ""discussion"" with my manager today a few red flags are up and I'm not sure I want to stick with these guys.

Essentially, I am doing the work of a fully paid software testing engineer for 1/3rd what they make, because I'm an ""intern."" Recently the product experts have all grouped up and demanded that they not be asked any questions because it stresses them out too much. 

But, the documentation is exceedingly poor and half of the historical knowledge is ""tribal"", i.e only known by having been there.  All efforts to automate things done manually are continually shot down by this same group of people, leaving me with piles of work that have nothing to do with writing software. 

Basically, I am being pushed on to do more work, with less resources all while making less than 1/3rd the pay off the guy who sits 1 cubicle away. 

 I know this is the nature of the beast sometimes. But it seems like I am shooting myself in the foot by staying here for another year to finish my masters thesis with them.

Should I just swallow my pride and trudge through ? Should I just burn them and do my own project ? With the recent cutbacks, it pretty obvious that the company isn't going to be hiring again anytime soon. 2 people out of a 5 person team have already transferred to different departments and their spots have not been filled, almost 9 months have passed. At a meeting with the regional director, he basically said we are lucky to not get layoffs and to not even try and ask for more help. So I won't exactly be burning a bridge on a job here. 

I'm tired, sick of school, and this job is burning me out before I actually get my damned degree. But if I leave, where am I going to find anything in the field during the summer ?"
8f5xlx,1,2018-04-26,Should I bother taking a developer crash course?,throwawaysnwi71838,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8f5xlx/should_i_bother_taking_a_developer_crash_course/,"So I’m a recently graduated university student, but my degree is in Medical Sciences. I want to work as a developer. I’ve worked with basic, java, JS, C, and am currently learning python and Q#.

My question is, how important is having some sort of educational background in CS to pursueing a career in CS?

I feel competent in my ability to understand concepts, problem solve, and learn. I’ve never actually taken formal education in any of the languages or computer science in general. I just learned through StackOverflow and googling questions I had about certain problems. 

It feels like I can self-learn anything I need to off of the internet or through books, but I’m concerned that since there is no tangible evidence of my knowledge or ability to apply it, I won’t even be invited for interviews or considered as an applicant, especially considering I’ll be competing with people who have done this for the past 4 years and without doubt have a more encompassing or broader knowledge base of how computer systems operate.

So if the answer to my question is ‘very important’ or ‘important enough’ even, then what is the shortest amount of time I should spend ‘building my resume’? Ie. crash course, 4 year university degree, google nano-degrees.

If the answer is ‘not very important’, what steps should I take to maximize my chances of being hired? Ie. internships, volunteering for projects, etc."

8f6n9n,0,2018-04-26,Does Undergraduate Prestige Matter? (USC v NU),throwawaycolegio1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8f6n9n/does_undergraduate_prestige_matter_usc_v_nu/,"I'm currently deciding between USC and Northeastern, planning on majoring in CSBA (might do pure CS) for both. I am blessed to have two amazing options, but now I'm in the dilemma of choosing between the two.

Northeastern

*   Location: It's close to family and friends. I have been in Boston for 18 years and it's pretty stale, but I still great (even its winters!).

*    Prestige: Northeastern's gaining in prestige, their CS program is fantastic (#20 on csrankings.com), good UG research opportunities. Not much brand name due to its recent history though.

*    Internships: Co-Op allows for three 6-month internships, lots of experience after I graduate, Boston has plenty of companies for hire.

*    Finances: Should be covered for housing and tuition by parents, received heavy scholarship from Northeastern. Honors program allows me to travel for a short stint with dialogues if I ever want to too.

*    Fit: I feel at home and there's comfort in knowing I'll receive a great education and most likely get a job due to being a big fish in the pond with co-ops. The people are cool but I'm concerned I'll be bored due to lack of sports, greek life, parties.

USC

*    Location: New experience and being away from parents forces me to learn to be independent. Feeder school for Silicon Valley (+Big Four recruits much more heavily) and the startup scene there is enormous. However, I'll rarely see my friends and family being so far away and I don't know anyone there.

*    Prestige: USC's CS program is top tier (#14 on csrankings.com). If I end up switching majors, their other majors in data, business and engineering are also top notch.

*    Internships: Trojan family and I'll be in LA/ California so they'll be abundant. However, it's much harder to coordinate internships with school and find them as I'll be competing with others.

*    Finances: USC is 30k more and LA COL is high, but I'm able to afford it bc I am a spoiled child. Parents will cover it and I won't be in debt, but is it worth it?

*    Fit: Social life fits me well and their more creative, variety of student body also does, too, personality-wise, I'm a work hard, play hard kind of person. The USC student body seems stronger and more connected, so it'll be more competitive. I am concerned about the stereotype of snobby, rich kids though.

1) I know prestige doesn't matter too much for CS, but is the recruitment by Big4/Unicorn or entrepreneurial atmosphere differences between the schools considerable enough?

2) How are the schools viewed by the industry?

3) Boils down to ROI for me. Finance-wise, CS is generally lucrative, but are the entrepreneurial/industry connections associated with USC's brand-name and social life worth the extra price?

8f6p7r,9,2018-04-26,Due to recent financial Troubles my phone plan has been canceled and my number deactivated.

A consequence of this is that I could not afford to continue paying my phone plan.

I’m in my Junior year (of 5 planned) and am a Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science double major at a relatively large, average tier state school in the Northeast. I have had a total of 2 internships so far, and am going for my third this summer. My first was in Project Engineering, and my second (and soon to be third) are in Controls/Automation Engineering at a large pharmaceutical company. 

One thing I’m wondering is whether or not it is worthwhile to compile a series of programming projects in a few different languages that I’ve worked on together into a Github and link it to my resume, and perhaps do a similar thing for my projects that relate to Mechanical Engineering. Has this actually paid off for anyone? Would it necessarily pay off for me?"

I'm interested in working in a Big N company in the future. I'm not sure if I want a masters yet, but I want to keep my options open. I got into UIUC as an out of state student for the combined statistics and computer science major. I heard they get similar internship opportunities and job opportunities as the CS majors. However, I'm not used to the cold weather, it is far from home, and it costs more than UC Irvine. On the other hand, UC Irvine has a subpar CS curriculum relative to UIUC. However, UC Irvine is only $34,000 a year but I like Irvine and its weather a lot more. An important note, however, is my parents will be paying for my education so I will not be taking out any loans. I'd rather not waste my parents money if I don't have to. 

The main thing stopping me from UC Irvine is that I don't see many people with Undergraduate degrees in CS from UC Irvine get jobs at the big N companies on LinkedIn. All I see are foreign students with masters at UC Irvine who get those jobs. On the other hand, UIUC has a lot of undergraduate CS students in the Big N companies.

Suggestions? I need to make a decision by tonight!"

I was a decent student, but I didn't have any internships because where I was living required a car to get anywhere and I didn't have one at the time; however, I did work for my school's web development office for a year mostly doing backend Java stuff. Out of the resumes I put out I got two automated invitations to HackerRank technical challenges, both of which I bombed spectacularly. I didn't even get brought in for an interview for the permanent webdev position the school was hiring for around the time I was graduating. I needed a job to pay rent so I got a temp helpdesk gig with a major retailer before my buddy got me in the door at the IT firm he worked for. I've got a great team and the work arrangements are really good for dealing with some extenuating circumstances that have developed since graduation, but I'm not applying my education and I do not like the work. This isn't somewhere I'm trying to be for a long time, but I can't help but feel some serious impostor syndrome when I think of how I can transition to development. I feel like doing HackerRank challenges to build the skills I was lacking in those technical interviews isn't enough to mean anything to interviewers, but at the same time when I survey open source projects to potentially get involved with so I can point to concrete work I've done I feel like I'm totally out of my league in even trying to get started.

Sorry that this is poorly edited and probably hard to read, but I'm kind of stream-of-consciousnessing this to express what's gone down. It's not that I feel like an impostor, that I can deal with; it's that I feel like a failed impostor. Am I? How do I turn myself around?"

I'm considering doing a level 8 computing course \(not in Dublin\) in September as I want to get into java development. I'm not a total noob to programming as I have an electronic engineering degree and have built some basic apps using c/c\+\+, java and swift.

I would really appreciate any answers to the questions below.

1. Is a computing course worth doing if it doesn't have an internship? 
2. What are interns typically paid?
3. How do employers generally view add\-on/conversion courses, even if the graduate has a STEM degree that included programming modules?
4. How hard is it to get an internship/job outside Dublin? Would I more than likely have to move to Dublin in order to get something worthwhile?
5. What does a typical working day involve for a graduate/junior java web/android developer?
6. Do employers discriminate against graduates over 30 when hiring? 
7. What would be considered a good java based \(java ee, spring, android\) FYP that would be worth putting on github?
8. What sort of side projects should a graduate developer include in their github profile? Is it worth including projects that would be classed as trivial projects in your github profile?
9. What do employers expect of graduate developers technically? Would I need to have a very good understanding of topics such as algorithms and data structures, software design, testing and databases?
10. How important are soft skills in the software industry these days? What is expected of graduate developers in relation to presentations etc."

I've been in an Android Internship that recently decided to go in a different direction (languages/frameworks). The pay for full-time is very low and I'm trying to decide on my next move. I don't see learning something completely from scratch when I have some foundation in other languages.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm thinking of Java or Android because I have had the most experience with Java in college, and my internship was in Android (although I am far from an expert or confident in either).

&amp;nbsp;

I'm basically wondering first: **which has more job prospects (Java or Android)?** I've  tried researching on glassdoor and google and found some interesting articles, but they didn't mention all cities, just some (http://www.itprotoday.com/software-development/coding-language-use-and-popularity-us-varies-city-survey) (https://insights.dice.com/2017/05/10/programming-languages-popular-city/). I would like to move to Austin if possible, or potentially Houston (but am not completely closed off to other cities). *Any additional thoughts on specifics per city*? And which typically ends up making more in the long term in their career?

&amp;nbsp;

From my job application research so far, it seems that if I go a pure Java route they want me to know the frameworks (Spring, etc), which I will need to take some time to learn. However I feel like I have been seeing more jobs in Java than Android(especially since a lot of Android jobs seem to want 5+ years bare minimum experience). Is this accurate?

I'm graduating in about two weeks from college. I know I'd like to pursue my Master's degree but I am so conflicted with what program to select for my graduate program. My interests are going in so many directions and I know I'd like to intern as a researcher to gain some experience and skills.

However, my parents want me to go to grad school right away. I kind of understand how I could lose my routine of going to class everyday and such, but I am not sure how to let my parents see things from my point of view. My ultimate goal is be knowledgeable and not have a degree just to solely have a degree, but because I want to know I've achieved something great in life.

I am so stressed about graduation and everything after that because life is hitting me so hard right now. I can't believe I'll have face to the real world so soon; I'm honestly really bummed about it. I don't feel hopeless but I just feel like because I'm not going to grad school right away, I'm wasting my potential.

 In addition, I'd like to have more skills and seem like a well-rounded applicant for whatever grad program I am planning to pursue, that is if I find one that suits me well.

Furthermore, my mom has also invited about 16 to 17 people to my graduation and some of them don't even know about my major being switched a couple of months ago. How do I shut out everyone else's opinions and just live unapologetically?

Also - does anyone know what happens at a graduation ceremony? Or has anyone taken some time off before grad school? Can you please offer me some advice?

Thanks!"

Also if this is the wrong subreddit please let me know!

I am currently attending my Junior year of undergrad at a state university and have way more questions than I should this late in the game.  To give some back story, I went to community college for the first two years of my college career and transferred to this uni last fall.  My GPA is fairly solid, a 3.82, although I am picking up a C this semester (first one in college ever), thanks to me taking 19 hours because I thought I could handle it. The rest are A's and one B.  The reason I attended community college was a) it was free for me and my family was poor b) My high school grades were not great enough for the school I wanted to be in and c) My family support system was in fact trash. (Abusive step dad, neglectful father,yadda yadda). I started working the day I turned 16, and have (basically) worked 30+ hours a week since, I would consider myself a hard worker, and hopefully this is a sign of that.

Now, for the meat and potatoes of my post.  I desperately want to get into a PhD program in the field of molecular biology.  I have found several schools that I think I may have a shot at getting into them, but I'm not really sure what course of action I should be taking to reach this goal, or realistically if I can get in to my schools of choice.  I currently have a 3.81 GPA as mentioned, but I expect it to land somewhere around 3.7 - 3.75 due to the work load that I have thrust upon myself.  I have an internship through a professor lined up to start this June, and am scheduled to take the GRE the beginning of August.  I hope to do well on the GRE, and the internship seems like something I am going to absolutely love doing (working with electrocommunication in fish, how cool is that?).  The LOR's should come from that as well as a couple of professors I have spent time with in the past, but I hope to do more internships honestly to get those covered. 

So, my questions:
Do I have a shot at any schools listed below? (assuming I do decent on the GRE).
Should I take a year or two off of school after graduation to focus on more research to build up a better CV before I apply?
If yes to the last question, what exactly do I do while I'm in this gap year? Take more classes and a job in the field?
Is all hope lost and I should just quit now and become a dishwasher at the nearest restaurant to my house?
Am I doing the right things, should I do more?
The schools I am interested in are: University of Colorado Boulder (Molecular Bio), University of Oklahoma (GPiBs program) , University of Washington, and as a reach somewhere like Duke.

Tl;Dr I am lost and don't know if I am on the right track."

Typing this up late on the phone.

About me:
25
Served a stint in the reserves out of high school so go started late.
Have been self employed through college basically returning computer hardware for resale. I guess you could say sales is my area of comfort. 

My degree is MIS with a concentration in IS security.
Most of my degree has been sql related, modeling and analyzing, etc. The security classes included vmware to use for pen testing, using Kali linux for a few of it's  many operations, domain controlling functions with a vm of server and win 7, security policy modeling....you get the gist.

I'm posting to ask what first jobs people in the field would suggest for someone starting out.  I haven't been formally employed by someone else in years and while working for myself has its perks- I need something concrete that wont ""just"" pay the bills on time every month. I have 3 more classes scheduled in the fall 2018 and the entire summer off to work.

It seems like most all the jobs and internships listed on handshake (my universities portal to employer postings ) want computer science majors  only. One local government job I applied to turned down my application due to having a major that wasn't IT/comp sci/related field.

Any suggestions or advice would be great.

1. Internship with professor \- working on os systems/security \- don't have too much knowledge on this topic and would require a lot of new learning. Also he wasn't very clear on what exactly I would be doing
2. Internship with professor \- would be working with PHD candidate not and most likely wouldn't actually be working directly with professor. 90&amp;#37; in Java \(language most familiar with\) and seems like I would have the most contribution in. 
3. Internship with professor \- Would be working on bayesian systems. Most likely not doing very much and just looking at databases.

So I know it sounds like I should take number 2 but I had some questions. Is there a difference in the significance of \(working/letter of rec\) with/from a professor vs phd candidate to colleges.

I want to be a teacher and wish to maybe go to grad school or some teaching program, but my GPA when I graduated was a 2.8. Also because of my depression and other mental health issues going untreated for a while, things didn’t get better for me so the bad GPA persisted throughout all my seven semesters of college, which means I can’t say “at least I improved” as a reason.

I graduated from a prestigious university in a STEM field and I understand that I have privilege in that aspect. But anytime I voice any problems, a lot of people say that my worries are unwarranted because of my school and major; yet here I am, still worried. I haven’t been able to find any internships as an undergrad because of my GPA and have actually been called stupid and lazy before which was discouraging to say the least. Extracurriculars have mostly been based on music ensemble and the non-English language I’m fluent in, but nothing academic. I’ve always felt so incompetent and so frustrated with myself during my undergrad. Since I’ve graduated a semester early, I’ve been using my “eighth semester” to take a break and have tried to get my mental health and my life under control.

But now my anxiety has sky rocketed once again. I am planning to talk to a professor from a state school regarding a post-baccalaureate program for teaching (she seemed interested thanks to my big name university), but I’m so scared about her seeing my GPA and telling me that I’m too stupid to teach. Should I just choose a different career path? Have I screwed up my prospects? It’s gotten to the point that I can’t sleep and the bad feelings I’ve had back in college are rushing back. I am terrified that I’m going to go back being the way I was. I don’t want to feel that way again.

I don’t know what to do and I just needed to express this somewhere. I feel like I’ve let everyone down, especially my family who’ve worked so hard to come to the United States for our future and the teachers who have inspired me to want to go into teaching. I know that no one can really help me because what’s done is done. I just needed to vent because I feel myself going crazy with anxiety that it’s blinding me from thinking straight.

I am trying to break into computer science after a bachelor degree in business and few experiences in investment banking. I was talking to  a graduate consultant and he told me that it's going to be much more better to have practical experience before to apply for a Master in CS. 

I just finished my internship in investment banking and I need to use the next few months properly to land to my dream school (deadline usually in december). He suggested me 2 options (while I am learning CS by myself) 

1) Get a gig in a tech start up in the business side and try to move internally, not at 100% but try to get involved with the tech team. But I should tell them first what is my plan. 

2) Volunteering in a tech start up

I guess the option 1 seems to be the most efficient? 

Thanks"

Work 60 or 80 hour weeks just to be competitive. Always be busy because that's an accomplishment; always be one day away from a nervous breakdown because crippling anxiety is a badge of honor. 

At one point I thought I was just lazy &amp; unmotivated because I couldn't live like this. After being medicated, I made it a point to live like this so I could prove that I had it together. Like my ADHD was shameful and I needed to show everyone that I was valuable and useful and worthy of respect because I could push myself just as hard as they did.

But I'm exhausted. I'm so tired of trying to catch up &amp; stay ahead. I don't want to download one more productivity app or have another overcomplicated ""system"" just to prove myself to others. I don't want to work full time and go to school full time and have a part time internship. I want to achieve my dreams but not at the expense of my well being. 

And it's not that I don't want to work hard, I just don't want the measure of my value to be how quickly I managed to work myself to death.

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I'm tired of not feeling like I'm good enough. I'm tired of crying because I can't do what everyone else can do, when no one is supposed to live like that in the first place. Can we just opt out of this?"

I guess I’m having trouble imagining what it’s going to look and feel like. I have to choose my next move (job) soon and have 2 options right now:

1. a position at my internship, is more ADHD friendly where I have lots of projects in and out of the office but the management is pretty bad and there’s about to be a very large restructuring. No idea where my position would end up.

2. A position at my PT job that’s 99% office work but seems to have much better management and environment. I do it once a week now and it’s hard to stay focused (but I’ve been off my meds, tbf) so imagining 40 hours a week is difficult. They’d add on other projects though.

8ff59c,5,2018-04-27,My experience with anxiety throughout college. Graduating next month.,alilextrasocks,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/8ff59c/my_experience_with_anxiety_throughout_college/,"All throughout college I'd tell myself, this is when I'm going to try my hardest to get out of my comfort zone. I realized I had social anxiety when I was in my second year of college. In my class we were going over our study guides and everyone was going to get called on eventually to answer a question with no particular order. After the tenth or so person was called on I was shaking, sweating, feeling choked up, all that fun stuff. I dipped and had a panic attack in the bathroom crying. I never went back to the class again.

The following summer I told my mom. I only told her because we were hanging out and she was like let's go see if these places are hiring so you can get a job. I said no and she told me I was acting like a baby. I had a panic attack again. We left and tried to talk about it and I felt attacked from her because she was stressing over the fact that I had anxiety. And she kept saying I can't deal with this I already have so much to deal with. My dad was deployed so she was pretty much alone. And I felt bad that I had social anxiety. There was other shit but that was years ago. We're good now.

My mom made me start going to a few therapy sessions and I tried a few people out. I got to my third therapist and actually liked her but I never had another session because I felt like I said everything I needed to say. I feel that I know the solutions to my problems but nothing has worked instantly so I just gave up? I don't know. 

I tried medication but didn't take it long enough to know if it would work. I had a point where I was deeply depressed last year. I actually swallowed a whole bottle once thinking I would die. But I guess you can't die from these type of meds. I woke up drunk and groggy a few hours later because I was throwing up all the pills. Beforehand I cleaned all my shit in my room, threw out a ton so it wouldn't be a pain to pack up when I was dead. I cut my arm a bit but I didn't realize how thick our skin is... and I was like shit I'm weak I can barely cut my skin. I have scars now. When I was questioned about them I just said I ate shit and people believed me. I told two of my best friends from another city what happened and I don't know if I'm relieved or not that they didn't tell anyone. But not too long after that I decided I wanted to make changes in my life.

It took until my final year of college to actually get a job and it's nothing relevant to my major. I just needed financial support. My parents support me almost entirely so I've always taken advantage of that. Always thought I don't need to work because I have their money. So I have just spent my free time kinda just being depressed. I went to a couple club meetings. Attempted to get an internship and did the interview (which went alright) but then I desperately needed money because I got scammed and lost $3000............ dumb on my part. So I got a job as a behavioral interventionist. Well was supposed to. Did the training didn't show up to the exam. Abandoned the job. I told everyone else they never gave me hours but that was bs. A month later I got a retail job. I think I did pretty damn well in my interview. I mean I HAD BETTER. I rehearsed my answers for 4 hours or more beforehand.

While not working at my retail job I mainly just do homework, watch shows, eat shitty food, and get high with my two best friends that I've made at my school. One because we were roommates the first year at the dorms and the second because my roommate and her friend worked together. I've made other friends in school but many transferred or most of the time it's those friends that are just your friends in class. And I never really knew how to go about asking for their numbers or social media stuff so.... once the class was done, our friendships were done. But I mean I'm really happy with the two best friends I made. All about quality over quantity but it wouldn't hurt to have a few more friends. And then on the weekends I hang out with my boyfriend and just tag along with him and his roommates to things. It basically took me til the third year of college to feel comfortable around them and even til now I still feel kinda awkward with them. But I think that's my fault because I just don't know how to hold a conversation with them. They drink heavily pretty often and it would KILLLLLL me whenever they did drinking games. My boyfriend didn't understand why I felt the way I did and why I just didn't wanna drink to feel comfortable. Usually my anxiety made my performance in the games go downhill. So sometimes I would just sit out and watch or just go upstairs and try to sleep.

My boyfriend has a lab internship/job at his school and has befriended everyone. My boyfriend also used to be in a fraternity. He has pretty much worked a job since we graduated high school. He's accomplished a lot and is a bit of a social butterfly. There have been about 5 occasions when he's asked me to hang out with his lab but I always say no because I'm tired or that I just don't want to. Although once it was true that I was genuinely tired, most of the time I just feel intimidated. I'm not down for them to ask me about my future plans because I feel that I haven't accomplished anything great other than the fact that I somehow managed to graduate college in four years. I just feel that he's friends with a great deal of accomplished people and for whatever reason I feel that that's gonna get shoved down my throat. NOT ONLY THAT but my boyfriend at one point had a crush on one of the chicks in the lab and that was just a shitty point in our relationship. Nothing happened between them and my relationship is 10/10 right now. I just personally don't want to hang out with his lab friends if she's gonna be there. Is that so wrong? I do think it's sweet that he really does want me to meet his lab friends though so it's also killing me to be the way that I am.

My boyfriend got into a grad school on the east coast and we have plans to move there in a few months. I don't know what I am gonna do with myself there. He sounds rather confident about me finding a job and that's reassuring. I just don't find myself to be competent to get myself a decent paying full time job in the city. Im shit at saving money and I don't think I can realistically live in the city... But I'm hoping for the best. I'm meeting a career counselor on Wednesday though so let's hope that goes well.

Usually I'd spend hours trying to proofread this but I'm just gonna submit it as is.

I'm 27 and graduating in 3 days with a B.S. in physics, from a school that has literally zero programming courses available besides a short introduction to MATLAB. This last year, my interest in physics research was completely destroyed - they've been throwing students at a failure of a project for five years now, and it just sucked. I realized that academia is just not for me. So here I am - looking to take a different route, and I do *not* want to go back and get a CS degree. I am however going to take whatever online courses are necessary.

My background out of school is this:

* I was a network tech/engineer working for a regional ISP for 3 years, and have an expired CCNA that I studied and got on my own.

* Since middle school, I have programmed off and on with small projects, but never made any kind of full application (only small games and scripts).

* I have written stuff in ActionScript, C, C++, C#, R, Python, MATLAB, Octave, Javascript, Arduino, and Verilog. I've helped people troubleshoot code in a whole lot of other languages like VHDL, LabView, and more that I don't remember. I wouldn't consider my experience in any of them very extensive, though out of all them, I have the most experience in Python and MATLAB.

* I've worked on software for games, physics simulation, bayesian networks (and the first-ever quantum version of them), FPGAs, and data analysis/image processing.

* I have worked one month-long internship for a small startup where I helped them organize their class structure to make their platform more usable.

So...I'm not a complete noob, I have worked on a lot, but have near-zero formal education on the subject of programming. As you can see, my experience is also all over the place - at this point I'm basically a jack of all trades. I am confident to throw myself at just about anything, but honestly I don't know where I should start in terms of a career. I've wanted to develop fast physics simulations (real-time, ie for games) but my lack of deeper experience in computational physics/algorithm development isn't confidence-inspiring. That interest has expanded to include ASIC design for further physics simulation speedups, or I'd even be happy just developing any way of speeding up a typical computation by toying around with FPGAs.

Honestly though, I don't mind the idea of getting a job in whatever is immediately available. I figure that along the way I will figure out what I want, and in the meantime, I just need a job ASAP - but I have no idea what kind of place accepts people with my kind of background, so here I am! I'd love and appreciate any kind of advice you guys can give me!"

Senior finishing up a CSE degree in Silicon Valley, not a top school but I’m in the area. I’m not a die-hard coder, I don’t do projects on the side and although I enjoy learning, I find finishing projects to be more of a relief than pure enjoyment. I see many classmates with big name internships succeeding due to their love and passion for the field and the work. 

My priority is to lessen the financial burden of my upbringing on my family, they’ve sacrificed a lot for me and that’s what I feel obligated to do right now. 

I’ve swung from both sides of the spectrum, from spending all of my free time composing music (when I rejected any obligation to my family) to strictly studying leetcode. I’m only in my first internship due to past anxiety and depression, but it’s currently a remote, unpaid, part time startup so I’m having trouble gauging if I’ll have the stamina to make it in this field. 

I feel that my strengths are largely interpersonal rather than technical. I have a 3.4, not pushing excellence, but not failing. 

Does anyone have any insight on passion vs. success in this field?

8fg1xu,2,2018-04-27,How to get an internship as a sophomore/frosh?,zucchini_tempura,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8fg1xu/how_to_get_an_internship_as_a_sophomorefrosh/,"So the *prestige* of the internship the summer after junior year is the most important thing for an undergraduate looking to go straight into industry after graduation (it really doesn't matter *what* you did/accomplished at the internship, but rather that you interned at some big-name company).  Yes, the student still has to pass the interview for full-time but (1) Studying DS&amp;A / LeetCode, while requiring a lot of hard work and maybe even some luck, is relatively straightforward and (2) if the student gets and accepts a return offer from the internship, no interview prep is even needed.

But to get an internship at a big-name company, you have to have a *prior* internship (it's just too competitive otherwise).

So how does a sophomore or even freshman even go about getting an internship when some companies explicitly say that they do not hire freshman/sophomore interns?  (I've experienced this at the school career fair.)  Some thoughts:

* This is why I think going to a target school (I couldn't make it into one) is beneficial.  Somehow I just can't help but think that students at places like CMU/Berkeley/UIUC simply have much better access to internships (being able to get interviews and not be ignored) as freshmen/sophomores.

* Another reason that I think target schools are beneficial is because of the critical mass of very talented/hardworking peers.  This part is not mentioned frequently enough on this sub, that you can learn as much or more from your peers compared to your professors.  Moreover, you can build connections with peers and that helps as seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8fc6qq/after_3_months_of_internship_hunting_my_friend/)

THAT BEING SAID, outside of the target school stuff, what would help?  Are open-source contributions more highly regarded than personal projects, generally speaking?  Do the people filtering out resumes even have time to look/care about personal projects (let alone verify that YOU were the one who made it) unless there's some quantitative measure of its awesomeness as a resume bullet point (e.g. an Android app that had 239842342 downloads in the Google Play Store)?  Do recruiters actually care if you win a college hackathon even if it's not the equivalent of the Boston Marathon in terms of prestige?

I just feel like this ""getting an internship as a sophomore/frosh with nada experience"" business is like a secret language that undergraduate students from ""meh"" schools generally just have a much harder time understanding.  It's easy to understand failing an interview because you didn't study DS&amp;A hard enough or you were unlucky or maybe you're just not bright enough.  But failing to get an internship interview in the first place without prior internship experience and overcoming the ""chicken vs. egg"" situation is just so much more of an opaque problem.

Thanks in advance."

I'm massively interested in machine learning and AI, but I also like the software development aspect of computer science.
Today I got rejected from my dream school for reasons unknown to me. There is no point in sulking, and I'd rather get started on the rest of my life right away. As it stands I've narrowed my options down to two main offers and I hope you can help me decide between them. 

1) UCLA Applied Mathematics BS followed by an MSc in Computer Science?

2) UCLA Applied Mathematics and CS double major or CS minor (not sure I can do this yet)
 
3) UC San Diego Computer Science BS

I understand I'm gonna need a math background either way, but I think option 3 will allow me to enter the workforce sooner. This is important to me because I come from a low income family and it's time I start giving back. 

I was also hoping you guys could tell me what I should focus on as far as internships and material for self learning.

8fgsgi,1,2018-04-27,Transfer Student Dilemma,IamMike63,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8fgsgi/transfer_student_dilemma/,"At my community college I have been double majoring in Business and Computer Science. I did not take the Physics series so I did not meet the requirements to a few universities under their CS program. 

I am interested in data science and machine learning. Here are the schools I'm considering:

UC Riverside (Computer Science w/ Business Applications)

UC Los Angeles (Business Economics)

UC Irvine (Business Information Management, waitlisted)

All schools are offering great financial aid packages that will not leave me with much debt. So cost is not a factor. I've been to all three campuses and think they each have their individual merits. 

I am really fortunate to have gotten into UCLA because my GPA is middle of the road. But, how likely is it to break into data science with a BA in BizEcon? My mentor mentions that it is possible if I pursue a MCS following my BA and even argues that an Economics degree will prepare me for that field. And the LA area may make it easier to find an internship. 

At UCR, I have already talked with a few professors and have been told that I am a great candidate for their ML labs. 

I guess my issue really lies in - will I be more competitive for a MCS program/data science field coming from UCLA's BizEcon or UCR/UCI(if I get in) CS oriented degrees?"

8fh1hh,1,2018-04-27,Feeling sad + how to live unapologetically?,avrism,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8fh1hh/feeling_sad_how_to_live_unapologetically/,"Hello.

I submitted a post last night about post-graduation but I've really analzyed my thoughts and realized maybe I'm sad?

I've been feeling really down about something and I'm thinking it's because I'm about to lose the routine of going to class everyday and being able to socialize on my own terms as well as dress comfortably without my mom watching my every move.

I'm a closet lesbian but out to friends and tend to dress in a masculine manner. I've found my personal style over the past year I've been able to exude it while away at college. However, I am about to lose this because I am moving back in with my mother after graduation and I am feeling really sad about it.

In addition, I am not ready to face real world? I know I'd like to pursue graduate school but I did not apply and am working on applying for summer internships. Furthermore, I'd like to have another degree under my belt because I genuinely like learning.

I am having instances where I am contemplating hurting myself by either falling down the stairs or something similar. I'm not depressed but maybe it's because I am worried about the commencement ceremony. Unbeknownst to my extended family and some friends, I switched my concentration from biology to arts and media. I didn't get around to elaborating this change to some of them and I am very worried about their opinions so much that I am contemplating not even walking at the ceremony.

I used to think I have a healthy self-confidence but I do not think I do. I'm not sure how to block everyone's else comments. For example, my dad is really negative and brought up how I did not go to a prestigious university. He made some negative remarks about the current school I'm currently about to graduate from. I know that my dad has a very superficial view about education because in my opinion, anyone that is brainwashed into believing that solely going to a prestigious school guarantees you success is narrow minded. I mean it is partially true about some success but if the person isn't willing to work hard and strive for greatness, how can that work?

Anyway - I'm wondering if I can get some advice as to how to overcome these feelings and not be bothered by comments by my family?

I used to think I was able to block out people's comments (friends, for example) but for some reason, why it comes to family, it irritates me the most. 

Also, any advice towards my anxiety about my commencement ceremony?"
8fh2h3,2,2018-04-27,I'm scared that I might've ruined any chance I had for a normal life and career,IlParnassoConfuso,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8fh2h3/im_scared_that_i_mightve_ruined_any_chance_i_had/,"I'm a MtF transgender, meaning that as far as the world is concerned I'm a man, but I want to be a woman. 

I'm 22, and for over a year now I have been living as a reclusive, hardly ever getting out of the house and not working. I graduated college in the end of 2016, and the only work experience I have is an internship I had for a little over a year. My skills in my field are average at best, and I made no connections during in college as I was the weirdo who never talked to anyone. I saw classmates get prestigious internships and job offers in cool offices, and I wanted the same so bad. I used to daydream about working in this great creative office in Europe. I thought about studying abroad after finishing college, but it obviously never happened. I was stubborn and didn't wanted to pursue a postgraduate education because I saw it as holding me back to those goals, but Instead I wasted an entire year, and I'm soon will have wasted two years of my life by doing nothing at home.

I know I have to work to become independent, but what incentive I have? My parents don't support my transition, I would have to pay for everything myself, and at 22 I have already lost any chance I had for looking like a woman, I'm all male now thanks to puberty. I have so many things wrong with my appearance to fix, even those not related to being trans. Even if I start now, when would I even begin to look less bad, in my 30s? I wasted my teens and now I'm throwing my 20s in the garbage, the years that should be the time of my life. I'm so jealous of people around 14-16, they have their entire lives ahead, and by the time they are in their 20s I will be old and even more depressing.

Besides, with my worrying lack of skills, a nearly empty resume with a one-year-and-growing gap, no nice office will ever consider hiring me. My life is awful enough, I think if I end up working in a shitty place with no aspirations I might as well just pull the plug now. I like some expensive things too, I need a job so that I can afford it, I can't rely on my parents for ever. 

Besides realistically I would need to move out, but where? how?? I don't know how to do anything in the real world, I don't know how to do taxes or pay bills. 

I feel like a kid waiting for my life to start, but I don't think it ever will. I hate myself so much, I don't have any friends and I'm getting progressively worst with my parents. I just want to be like all the other girls, be pretty, find love, get married, have children. But who will want anything to do with a disgusting masculine looking transvestite? I will never know love, know what it is like to carry a pregnancy or give birth. I'll never be a mother. I hate my body and my face so much, I feel so disgusting that I sometimes avoid looking at myself in the mirror because I can't stand it. 

Sometimes I get glimpses of hope. I think that if I am realistic I can go for a slow transition as some nice people have advised me on reddit. I could work on fixing my posture, then my voice, my hair, take hormones and only fully come out when I feel ready. But it's too late now, it will never work.

I know my parents have their share of blame, but I can't help but feel sorry for them. They didn't signed up to having degenerates as children. I wish they could've had more children, at least one normal one to make up for it, maybe that way my parents wouldn't be so miserable too. 

Maybe not everyone is meant to be pretty or happy, but why should I continue to endure it? I wish a plane would crash into our house and kill us all, so my parents wouldn't have to suffer because of my death. Our dog is getting old and I don't think I could bare its passing either, so that would really be for the best.

I've been seeing a lot of positive posts lately that make me smile, so I thought I'd share mine!

This is my first year teaching, and I'm doing it as part of an internship program for a master's degree. So I skipped the student teaching part and went straight into teaching my own classroom. 

Today, my capstone project was approved with a perfect score. So I'm a fully certified teacher and will have my master's upon completion of my thesis this summer. Hooray!!! 

It's been hard. It's been frustrating. But it has also been so. much. fun! I actually really enjoy this field, more than I thought I would. I love the kids, even when they're idiots and I want to strangle them. I love my content. I've developed true friendships with my coworkers, and I've had the amazing opportunity to have an incredibly supportive admin this year. My mentor teacher has been so awesome throughout all of it. Every day is different. It's never boring, and while that can be exhausting it's so much better than any other job I've ever had. I love feeling so in charge of my day and my work space. 

I've gotten good evaluations, with those showing a good amount of growth over the year. And I've had a *lot* of evaluations between my admin, my mentor, and my university professor coming in my room every other week it seemed. I learned to use their evaluations to work on myself and my classroom, and it's really paid off. 

I'm doing this all while being a mother to 3 young children. My husband deserves some serious accolades for being an amazingly supportive partner and even more amazing father.  

I went from working 60+ hours a week at both school and home at the beginning of the year to spending 45 hours a week at the school and hardly ever bringing work home.  

Admin has asked me to transfer from my science position next year. With 2/4 teachers leaving, they want to overhaul our math department. I'm going to be taking over the pre-ap courses and working closely with the high school algebra teachers to make it as effective as possible. I'm really excited about the change, even if it means having to start all over again, and this time with 2 preps instead of 1. I'm super flattered (and excited about the additional stipend!). 

Here's to actually loving the job! 

TLDR; I'm super proud of myself, and the first year teaching doesn't always have to be hell. "

8fi2ue,2,2018-04-28,[22m] Unemployed for 9 months. Parents divorcing soon. I cant keep repressing emotions any longer and I dont know how to fix my life.,Green_Skye,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8fi2ue/22m_unemployed_for_9_months_parents_divorcing/,"This post may be a bit long winded due to me rambling and not really knowing how to deal with these multiple problems. Thank you in advance for any advice.

I am currently a 22 year old who studied hospitality management and have so far completed 3 years of 4, I currently do not think I will be able to complete my fourth year of school due to money and as such decided to finish a final internship to get a college certificate at the least.

I moved back in with my father and younger sister in Canada to look for something while also saving some money while living at home. Its been nine months so far however and not a single hotel or restaurant has gotten back to me with an offer. Last November my father told me that I needed to get any job at all so I wasnt at home all day wallowing and playing video games, I sent out many many applications looking for anything but I couldnt find luck at even retail or fast food. 

Explaining further, my university has international internship programs however since I am a third year student according to university rules I can only work in my home country, Canada, for my university to accept it. My father about two months ago told me I should complete my internship in Pakistan as I am half Pakistani and my school approved of me going as long as I have a hotel contract since it is a home country of mine. This past week i have been debating in my head as to go or not. My father believes that only working there for 8 months would be good for me away from my PC and since its been nine months since Ive just been sitting at home doing nothing. 

My father and I have a pretty rocky relationship as he used to be abusive and my mother an alcoholic, me and my sister as well have not gotten along well but recently all of us, my father and sister, have been growing closer since we live together however we still have arguments every day or so, but it is much better than it used to be. My mother also currently lives in Dubai as both my parents want to get divorced, they've talked about it and argued about getting one since I was about 13 so ive gotten pretty good at repressing and running from my problems and internalizing them as I dont really have anyone to talk to aside from my high school friends that I am extremely grateful to have. 

My father also lost his job about 1 month ago and now sits at home and gets irate, he worked the same company for 23 years so a large part of his life is gone, he is also older and has back problems developing now but I still live under his roof with him paying for everything for me and urging me to get a drivers license since I cant use my Dubai one anymore. However I want to help my dad out but both of us being unemployed while my mother wants to take half of his money (he's the only person in our family that worked and gave his family in Pakistan money every month since they dont work). My younger sister also needs to go to college soon and is depressed about living at home since she needs to repeat her last year of high school after a suicide attempt. 

On top of this going and working in Pakistan isnt something i want to do, but i myself am indecisive on the matter as I know he wants me to succeed and finish the internship so I have some certificate from that expensive university. He paid for a gym membership for me too and a trainer but I stopped going cause I'd just be depressed and wake up around 12pm every day. 

Thank you to anyone still reading this long winded essay, I tried to shorten it as much as I can. But I dont know what to do now. I was never a fan of working in hospitality since all my relevant experience is service related. My dream is to become a history teacher and I wanted to study Anthropology in Vancouver. 

Now however I see all my friends getting ready to graduate college soon or heading to their last year, while I sit at home. I know I shouldn't compare myself to others but its hard not to after 9 months of being inside, forgot to mention but I live in a pretty dead city. 

I want to be a good brother to my sister who suffers from depression and self harm and to tell her to look forward to the best years of her life in college but it doesnt work now. 

I want to know how to deal with this coming divorce emotionally since i am emotionally stunted. I want to know if it is a good idea for me to work any job in Canada to save money and go to another uni to study or if i should go to Pakistan. These decisions keep me up every night and I have nobody to tell me what I should or could be doing differently.  

I basically feel as if my life is totally fucked by my own wrong decisions but I want to fix it, help out in some way. My goal these past few months has been to find any job and maybe try and move out so im not a financial burden, but now with my dad getting older I want to stay home to take care of the family too. I think about the fact that my father was thrown out of the house at 21 and still made something of himself but for me I honestly cannot see the light at all. Every day I feel the need to just cry and video games are not doing it for my escapism anymore. 

What should I do?

Syblex Network+ Study Guide by Todd Lammle
-This was pretty in depth book on all the objectives. I would say at times it was a bit too much information, but if I was ever confused about an objective I could always find the answer in here. 

CompTIA Network+ app 
-Came in handy just for remembering different topics and objectives as I went about my regular day. Would try to get in a couple quizzes each day. I made sure not to just memorize the answers but to try and understand each option presented and why it was right or wrong. 

ExamCram Network+
-This is used all of this week preceding the exam. It was a bit like the Sybex book but just skimming things and not going into super detail. Probably not the best thing to use as your sole study tool but combined with other things it was super helpful. It also has some useful Exam sheets in the front and back that have most all the acronyms, protocols, ports, etc. on them which I carried around and looked at between my classes. 

All in all I studied off and on for about 2.5 months, with a majority of my studying being done in the past few weeks.  I've been seeing all the other posts on here about everyone who has passed and I'm stoked I finally got to make one too. Good Luck Everyone!"

8fkdc9,1,2018-04-28,"Ed Program and Student Teaching were Difficult, Unreasonable, and Judgmental on a Personal Level",permanentfatsuit,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/8fkdc9/ed_program_and_student_teaching_were_difficult/,"This is my first post, and I'm hoping that you fine people can tell me if what I experienced is normal, explain the mentality of my cooperating teachers and professors, and tell me what (if any action) I should take.

It was always my dream to be a pre-k teacher, so when I paid off my loft and had a series of large professional wins in my field (Marketing) I chose to leave to pursue my dream of being a teacher.  I entered a two year Post Bacc program at a local private college after researching the five colleges within driving distance of my residence.  I took two years of education classes (all the non-gen ed classes that people are required to take to become teachers) and completed two practicums, student teaching, my OAEs (state licensure exams), and edTPA.  During my last semester (student teaching) spring break, I interviewed with several private schools, received three offers, and accepted one and start in August.  The program itself and student teaching were horrid and I want to know if I had a typical experience (and am being sensitive and dramatic) or if this is abnormal experience.  If it is abnormal I would also like to know what action I should take to address this.  Here are the details broken down by semester:

Semester 1: Upon entering this program, I was assured I could continue a presence of about 20 hours a week at my marketing job without issue.  This was not the case.  My workload as a fulltime student was 3-4 times higher than when I had initially completed a Bachelors degree from 2001-2005.  I spent 5 hours per day on homework, seven days a week, in addition to classes.  I would describe the assignments and instruction in general as vague and non-sensical.  The sillabi would change at least once a week and it was difficult to track the constant changes.  Additionally, we were required to attend volunteer functions as part of our mandatory assignments.  Frequently we would not receive an address or call time.  Our time was monopolized to a point that I went from working 9 times a week to 0, and the only personal care I had time to continue was showering and brushing my teeth (and shaving on weekends).  I was up until 2-3 am every night doing homework because the volume of work was very high.  Our school has a gate system and at the end of the semester I was one of the lucky ones who passed the gate after an interview and continued in the program.  They judged both our academic performance and also our ""pedagogy"" which they defined as our disposition for teaching, but to me, I later found that this was used in my opinion to judge people on a personal level.  We tutored first and fifth graders once a week at a local school in addition to our course work.  My academic performance was 3 A's and 2 A-'s.

The next semester (Spring), we returned and continued our weekly tutoring.  The volume of work continued to be unreasonably high, the instruction continued to be very vague and non-sensical.  We did not have access to tutors through our school or a tutoring center if our grades did not fall below a certain threshold (our grades were too high to qualify for tutoring).  I had hired a private tutor near the end of the first semester, mostly for emotional support since we were not getting any encouragement from the professors at our school, and we felt that they were trying to discourage us and weed people out of the already very small program.  So, I continued in the program and continued to meet with my tutor and she would sit with me and chat while I did my homework.  We also added a practicum experience (Field I) to this semester.  Field I was supposed to be 75-100 hours of observation with 5 isolated evaluated lessons.  I completed 100 hours in Field 1.  The cooperating teacher was difficult to work with and asked me to sharpen her pencils, do filing for her, and many other tasks which were not observation.  She complained to my program about me that I asked if a child should be given childrens tylenol when they complained of a headache, and complained that I had not logged my exact start and end times.  These complaints were valid, and I was unaware we needed exact start and end times if we exceeded 75 hours of observation.  My boss at work told me to choose the program or coming back to work fulltime in January, and I chose the program.  I ended the semester with all A's and A-'s again including an A in Field 1, but having to give up my job and not getting a reference from my Field 1 teacher.

That summer I took my 3 OAEs (licensure exams) and passed with high scores, completed and internship with the Children's Education program at the Natural History Museum (it went great), and completed 3 summer classes.  Two of the summer classes were from my school and one was at a competing university because my school didn't offer it.  No issues with any of the classes except to say again in one of the classes, there was a gotcha moment where our take home final was to create an entire website (in addition to the website we had already created) in 3 days and the assignment was given on friday after business hours and I think due Sunday, so if you were not checking your email over the weekend, that could have been a very negative thing.  There was no gate over the summer and I continued in the program.

Because I had taken 3 classes over the summer, my fall sesmeter was light (only 11 credit hours) and it was an acceptable workload that one might expect.  This semester was fine.  Also, during this semester we completed Field 2, which I had arranged to take at a private school where I was well-treated, respected, and my cooperating teacher did not take advantage of having a field student present.  This was a great experience and a positive semester.

Over winter break I asked for information on edTPA and was told (rudely) that it would not be furnished until the following semester, so that is fine.  I prepared myself by reading the available handbook, instruction guide, and third-party instruction manual.

During my final semester in the two-year program, things really hit the fan.  Two of my friends who I was very close to had already been denied access to student teaching because they had not completed their OAEs successfully in time to begin, so they were delayed from Spring to the following Fall.  For the students that remained in the program (and our numbers had been dramatically reduced), we were expected to complete 15 weeks of full time student teaching (arriving at 8:45 am or earlier to our placements, and leaving when our teachers left -mine left around 6:20 pm), and complete seminar on some, but not all, mondays, and complete edTPA (which is a high stakes exam that seeks to answer the questions is this pre-service teaching candidate ready to be a teacher in a classroom of their own?).  So, we had five days off of student teaching that we had to go to the school to work on edTPA.

My cooperating teacher gave me low scores on my isolated lessons and mid term and final evaluations, which I felt were out of line with my performance.  I continued to go in every day and do the majority of his work for him while he walked around the building gossiping and went into the office everyday to talk to the principal because they were best friends.  I was getting very little support or guidance from anyone, and I don't know the term in education but in business we call it completing assignments blind, or with no information or support.  So, I ran this mans classroom for him and was used as an unpaid assistant who did filing, laminating, and general things like that.  So, I also completed edTPA during this time, which takes a lot of time.  We were pulled from Student Teaching to go to seminar on mondays from 3:30-4:45, we were pulled from student teaching 5 times on fridays all day to go to our college and work on edTPA (it was just study tables- we received no guidance or support).  

My family asked me to ask my dean (who is my advisor) for a certificate to say I completed this program.  I responded by telling my family that this would be a bad idea and my college is generally uninterested in accomodating student requests, and they like to stick to the bare-minimum.  I continued to be persisently asked by my family over several months and finally agreed and sent an email to the dean/my advisor to ask if this request could be accomodated.  She replied rudely (which I expected) and the answer was no.  My family reacted poorly and we ended up making the request to the President of the university, who sent it to the VP, who agreed, and sent it to the head of registrar to work out the details.  Long story short- my dean was displeased that we had gone over her head.  She reacted in a way that was unexpected.

So, earlier that afternoon, I had asked my university supervisor if everything was good and I was on course to finish without issue and she had told me yes.  That night around 5:40 PM I get a very alarming email that says we need to meet the following morning at 7:30 am to discuss my ""behavior"" during student teaching.  It became apparent to me that my dean had asked my supervisor to call the school and badger them for negative infomration on me.  The next morning, in this meeting, I was told by the dean, ""something that has bothered me about you for a long time is that you always ask for more"", and I was thinking, oh, this is obviously in response to me asking for a certificate to say I completed this program.  Then she mentioned everything I had done wrong in student teaching, including issues that had been addressed only once several months ago such as entering the school through the wrong door (I was told by the school I could use that door), or meeting my cooperating teacher on weekends to plan (this was at his request, and not mine).  I was made to sign a paper that said I was not ""putting the safety of the children first"" and I asked in what way I had ever done this, and the response was ""using the same door as the children makes them think that adults can enter through that door and that is unsafe"".  It stated in this paperwork that if I were late one more time that I would be pulled from the placement.  To be fair, I was constantly late to student teaching, but always arrived before the students.  I tried to address one of the many other illigitamate complaints and my dean told me ""We are not interested in your excuses"". So, I didn't understand the point of the meeting if I was not able to speak at all.  Another complaint was that I asked the principal if there was a quiet room I could do a phone interview in, after getting permission from my cooperating teacher.  This was seen as another absurd diva-demand by my college.  Fine, maybe I should not have done that.  After this, the college sent a very unprofessional email to my student teaching placement, copying me, in which it was implied that I am difficult to work with and they appreciate the school bending over backwards to help me so much.  I was slightly annoyed by this because I was getting little out of the placement and basically free labor for them for 15 weeks.

There were three weeks left in the semester at this point, and I finished the last three weeks without issues.  I scored in the 97th percentile on my edTPA (even though we received no support from our college, and no direction or instruction - we all completed it blind).  Despite the email my college had sent to my school stating I would complete Student Teaching ""Satisfactorily"", I received a high A in student teaching, and my cooperating teaching offered to be a reference to me.  I accepted, as I stated at the start of this post a high-paying job in a private school and moved on with my life.

I just don't understand basically the level of drama or stress, or the workload that this program was.  To me, teaching is a career of altruism that nice people who want to work with children and help children learn go into.  I didn't understand the level of judgement and criticism I was exposed to.  I also did not like that many of my friends were ""managed out"" by the end of the program.  I just want to reiterate that I did not appreciate being judged by my college professors on a personal level- or based on my personality, because I believe they are there to judge our academic performance.  Any feedback, even if you have harsh things to say to me, is appreciated and I'd like to know what you think.

This will basically help me emotionally support my friends who are still in the program as they move through the program and (hopefully) complete it.  "

8flkkq,2,2018-04-28,Help Me Decide,ahhhhhello,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8flkkq/help_me_decide/,"Hi! I would greatly appreciate some help in choosing a school.

My Options: UCLA, University of Toronto, UC Davis (Regents), UCI (CHP), UCSD, Virginia Tech

Major: Computer Science and Engineering at UC schools, General/Undeclared engineering at U of T and Virginia Tech 
(I’m not 100% sure about my major)

Am I missing out by not considering the other schools as much? 

I'm mainly considering UCLA and U of T. Which school should I go with and why?

**UCLA**

Opportunities

* Lots of research (~30% undergrads do) and internships (~50-60% undergrads do) options

* Research accessible to even freshman for after first year

* Many orgs to help you on start-ups, if I’m interested in start-ups

* How supportive is the academic environment at UCLA? I'm okay with being independent

Student orgs

* Many CS orgs will supplement UCLA’s theory-oriented classes by teaching practical skills and offering mentorship

* Lots of things that I would enjoy, not just in my field (ex. choir/a capella, writing)

Student life

* LA! But in a suburb, transportation isn’t the best but it’s doable. Super safe

* Great weather! Might be a little hot lol

* Said to have more “typical social life”

* The school seems to sell itself as a place for students to be well-rounded

* Easier to visit home! I could visit a lot more easily since it’s closer to home (without being uncomfortably close)

Other

* My impression of my college visit: it was nice. The weather is great and so many students love the campus. Bruin Day was a little disorienting and didn’t help me get a feel of the school as much (so much to do!), but Engineering day was a little more helpful. 

**U of T**

Academics

* On par with UCLA, one of the best schools in Canada. Apparently harder than UCLA(?), but both will be hard. (I'm concerned about this since I want to have time to do my own projects)

* Unsupportive environment?

Opportunities

* PEY- year long internship. Good opp, but delays graduation by a year (but also get to earn $$ and no tuition paid that year). Probably also good research and internships?

* Good machine learning/AI opps (not sure if I’m super into this)

* Centre for Global Engineering- I LOVE this. It’s basically a center for engineering solutions to global issues. I think UCLA has Eng. w/o Borders and does lots of globally oriented work anyway, but not sure of the full extent of that. 

Student life

* Toronto! In the middle of the city

* Have heard mixed things. Seems like it has a good social scene, but the subreddit for the school seems to have a pessimistic outlook on social life

* Colder weather

Other notes

* Not going to lie, haven’t opened my mind up to this school as much. Also, I don’t have a good sense of the school culture, which worries me; I’ve never visited, and what if I don’t like it? Anyone want to speak to this?

* I’m a dual citizen of the US and Canada, so living in Canada isn’t too much of a problem. 

* I would prefer to work and go to grad school in the US

Thanks in advance for any help!"

8fn0b9,1,2018-04-28,What to focus on?,Kameoxylon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8fn0b9/what_to_focus_on/,"I'm going on my senior year as a CS student for my bachelors and after many months, and applications, searching for a software developer/engineer internship I was finally able to land one and will start soon. I really want to focus this summer on gaining as much experience as I can from my first internship, and focusing on what's needed/popular in the market. The two main topics I've seen for internships have been machine learning, full stack (front-end &amp;/or back-end), and mobile. Are there other fields out there that I'm missing? What would be a good area to focus on for projects?

Also, I've been mostly practicing coding questions with java, but don't really have any projects with it. Besides mobile, it almost feels pointless to try and ""master"" java if most of the internship job postings I've seen aren't really looking for java developers."
8fn6r5,2,2018-04-28,What do you think I should learn over the summer?,Crazypete3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8fn6r5/what_do_you_think_i_should_learn_over_the_summer/,"So a little bit of a background on me. I'm a computer science student at a local university. I've taken courses in C++, Algorithms and Data Structures, Assembly and Organization, Discrete Structures anddddd that's about it haha. I'm taking database, AI, info systems in the fall and I have to take a language (c sharp or Java), theory, compiler, software engineering, and an elective (parallel, neural nets, etc.) before I graduate in December 19. I feel like this covers a small and narrow but deep and fundamental understanding of computer science.

The problem I have is that I feel like I'm learning the fundamentals or base of a lot but I'm not going to learn the tools itself. Like I have no idea how to build an app, all of my c++ projects regardless of how in depth they are they just show up on a console screen with ascii characters that make me feel like I'm building apps for the 1980s. Now please don't get me wrong. I can just Google anything and all I have to do is look up how to build an app. I have some cool ideas but I need to have the right tools for them. I also understand the reason for my courses to be like this, is because it seems better to learn fundamentals because that learning method or brain construction I'm doing with my courses will apply to all languages or teach me how to learn any language I don't know better. For example if I'm a wiz with loops in C++, I'll have a better fundamental idea of control structures with Java or that one cat language that starts with Hai lol. 

But with this being said, what should I learn for the summer? I didn't do so well on internships and the one interview I took u did good but not good enough, so I'm gonna be slaving at Walmart this summer. But I want to make the most of it and learn something that will be fun and also fodder for applying for internships next year. What do I want to do you may ask?? That is a good question, I want to build a website, app, or game as a side project. I have some ideas of what they'll be like. But I don't know which one I should I do? It's like I need someone throwing a target in the air and telling me to shoot it. Maybe I'm just not mature yet or creatively there enough to pick my own targets in nature. Maybe I just need the right gun to shoot that target. No sense in using a shotgun for a target 500yard away. But it's hard for me to choose a target in nature if I've never shot a target at all.

Sorry for being long and complicated, I just didn't want to seem like a throw away question cause this is important to me. I love this field so I'm down to do anything. The jobs in my area (Nashville) are more centered on Healthcare and a bit of .net or database stuff. But I've also wanted to make an app too because I'm not going to just atone for passion in cs by doing only what a job wants me to do. I'll extend myself further and maybe build Tony Starks Jarvis. So in your personal and expert opinion what should my target be? There's too much out there and I don't know what I wanna hit first. If I look up xxxxx language on Google it'll give me a lot of results, any reccomendations? Thanks for your time! "
8fn9yq,14,2018-04-28,Academic Suspension Appeal Letter.,Kasault,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8fn9yq/academic_suspension_appeal_letter/,"Hey guys, I was writing an appeal letter for SAP and am nervous. I was wondering if you could look over it and let me know how it sounds. Any advice is appreciated. 

To the Satisfactory Academic Appeals Committee,

 My name is Kasault and I am a Biochemistry student. As of the end of the 2017 summer semester I have been placed on my second academic suspension from Auburn University disqualifying me from financial aid. I understand the reason behind the suspension and take full responsibility for my actions that led to this point. I am writing this with hope to express the importance of my academic future and to outline the steps I plan to take in order to step back onto the path for academic success.

During the Fall 2016 semester my aunt, who was a strong role model for me as my dad was often deployed and my mom worked in order to provide for the family, passed away. This event was jarring for me and I was unable to properly process the emotions resulting from it. As the semester went on I saw my grades start to slip and noticed worrying trends of laxness and nonchalance regarding my classes, I noticed these trends too late and finished the semester with an embarrassing performance. This was the first real sign that there was an issue with myself and I slowly took steps to improve it. Over the next semester I started psychotherapy to come to terms with myself and hopefully eliminate the habits that caused the trouble initially. Unfortunately, I rushed myself back into classes with the eagerness and mindset that if I didn’t attend college there would be some sort of divine repercussions and subsequently did poorly in my returning semester. 

Faced with a second and final academic suspension I took a step back from academia and worked towards changing myself to truly succeed in my future. I realize now that my laxness, along with not attending classes and refusing the numerous resources available to help students did the most to lower my performance academically and lower my overall GPA. Oftentimes I would ignore office hours and decide to do poorly on concepts I didn’t understand instead of seeking help in understanding the topics. Alongside all that, my study habits left much to be desired for any standard college student. Taking these mistakes in stride I have a plan that I truly believe will allow me to be successful in this upcoming semester. This plan includes using organization techniques such as a daily planner to restrict procrastination as well as a more solid and earnest work ethic brought in part by the internship I was thankfully able to acquire through social networking. I have made it a point in the past year to be punctual, attentive and most of all driven, so I can correct the mistakes I have made and continue my path for the future. I believe that following this plan will not only lead to more opportunities in the future but allow me to raise both my GPA and my expectations moving forward.

Looking back on my actions that resulted in my academic suspension I feel nothing but shame and regret knowing that it is no one's fault but my own, however every mistake is a learning experience and I am hopeful I can show exactly what I've learned from this and I look forward to being back on the course to success.

Was there for 8 years. All my co-workers would mainly just do what was assigned, got their work done, and went home. (I would guess that most worked less than 40hr weeks, sometimes not even 35hrs.) None of them stayed up to date, did anything extra in their personal time, went to conferences, etc. I would definitely not describe them as passionate about what they did. There were also no code reviews, or much mentorship. I also got used to this and ended up doing the same, well I realized I was stagnating and never really grew. 

I decided that I needed a change and thought, hey... a startup sounds like the perfect next move. That will really shake things up! The people I work with now are all very smart (all of them are senior-level/architects) and very passionate about what they do. it's a small team of 8 and we're doing well so most likely will be growing very fast over the next few years. Man, even some of the interns we've had (who were high schoolers btw) I feel like match or even exceed (in some areas) my skills. One of the interns I know spends his free time creating games or working on open source stuff. This is all very... different and eye opening for me, coming from my last place. 

I was the first hire who wasn't a senior. The reason I received an offer was because they really liked me and I showed I had promise according to my recruiter. (I applied for a senior level role, but got hired on as mid-level.)

I know one of the advice that's often give is to surround yourself with smart people. Which I feel like I did... but now I'm feeling ... lost, in a way? I can't help but compare myself to the people I'm working with and looking back at the past 8 years... it's like a hard slap of reality. WTF *had* I been doing in in all that time?! Then there's also some dread, that I'm not going to measure up and some concerns over being able to keep up. Or that the next hire will be my replacement.

My 1 year review is coming up and I'm a bit worried how that's going to go. (Mainly over how slow I've been in trying to play catch up and learning the system...) I haven't gotten any outright complaints or anything, but with all the hand holding I've needed, it's definitely not confidence boosting. 

How do I stop comparing myself and just focus on the positives (e.g. how much I'm learning compared to before)?"

I am a junior transfer finishing up my first year up here at UCD. This first year has been great, I been taking my major classes, joined a club, and even picked up a minor to work on. However for me to graduate on time (June2019), I have to get lucky with class schedules and their possible overlaps. 
Here is my dilemma. I have two more of the major courses to take in series, but the first one has a stats prereq that I need to take. So for me to finish my major that's 3 classes all in different quarters. For my minor, same deal, I need 3 classes as well all in series.  
I have a summer internship and was considering taking the prereq course over summer, but I would have to forgo the summer internship. Not to mention pay a lot out of pocket for summer classes. 
As of now, I have decided to keep the summer internship and just hope that there are no schedule conflicts so I will graduate on time. Fall quarter looks good, but I am worried about winter and spring. If I get class conflicts then I will have to take at least another qtr here. Im not to concerned about having to spend another qtr here, but I rely heavily on financial aid. Almost all my costs have been covered. I am wondering if I had to take an extra quarter would my financial aid award be a lot less since it has been more than two years?

How much might a killer GRE compensate for a mediocre GPA? Would a gap year of working full time help?

My main issue though, is I really need input on how to weigh ""fit"" or enjoyment vs academic and career prospects for college. If I was to go to UT, I'd be enrolling in the Plan II program (which looks amazing) Undecided, hopefully picking up a double degree in business. I've seen mixed opinions about the strength of UT for undecided, with a lot of people saying there isn't much flexibility outside of liberal arts. And while I'm not interested in picking up a stem degree with Plan II, I am concerned I won't be able to pull off McCombs, and that even if I did, it wouldn't be worth it in the end.

Since I didn't apply business directly, I'd have to do a standard transfer into the business school- most likely have to pull a &gt;3.8 GPA taking both the prereqs and the tough Plan II courses together. Coming from a less-than-rigorous HS, with no calculus experience, and in the first year of a distraction-filled city, I'm really concerned I won't be able to meet the expectations. 

That'd leave me in P2 doubling in something like Econ or Poly-Sci unless some other subject clicked for me, and I'm not sure how worthwhile that path would be unless I went the grad school route. And if I did get into McCombs, I'm not sure how well the degree would serve me out of Texas (which is extremely likely) compared to Notre Dame which is my other top choice (and where transferring into business is a good bit easier). It seems like BHP get the pick of the resource litter in McCombs, and that even the internship opportunities of Austin would be hard-fought compared to ND. There's a chance I'm completely wrong though, feel free to correct me if that's the case.

Anyway, what's keeping UT in the running for me is how enjoyable (I think) the four years here could be. Even though I'm a bit sick of the Texas climate and landscape, it checks off a vast majority of the things I'm looking for in a school fit-wise. I love being able to get a small community on a big campus, I love the urban setting and the resources of Austin, I love the huge variety of student culture and the social life that comes with that, and I love that the low cost would free up possibility for study abroad, extra amenities, outings etc. The school seems like an awesome choice, and even though the location isn't as incredible as a place like Wake Forest (also considering), I could really see enjoying 4 years here.

But not if it sabotages and limits things after those 4 years. In addition to the huge worries that I'll be swamped with work from Plan II, business transfer, and whatever second major I go with, and that UT and/or McCombs won't take me as far across the country as ND, I'm also concerned, knowing my bad habits, that with all of the city and social distractions, being surrounded by such familiar settings and such a huge sea of students, I might end up ""coasting"" like HS and under perform despite the big expectations of P2 and/or business. That the environment might not raise me up like that of a Wake or ND. There's a lot to love about UT, but I don't want to make a mistake just for a more enjoyable social life.

Have any of y'all had similar concerns? Is going in undecided, or betting on a business transfer, a bad plan? Am I really overestimating the regionality of McCombs? Is it smarter to head to ND for career prospects, or Wake for location? What should the balance between fit and value be? Would you all pick UT again, or would you pick it in my situation? I really appreciate any help at all to any of these concerns. Best."

Upon reflection, I realize that I want to internally transfer to EngSci, as my interests fall in line more with the Machine Intelligence and Engineering, Math &amp; Stats majors.  Few quick questions for those familiar with these programs:

1. Is the EngSci workload much tougher than the ChemE one?
2. Do you have stats on the internal transfer admit rate/percentage into EngSci?  How common is it for people to transfer into EngSci?  Would 1st year ChemE course credits transfer over?
3. Do I have to wait until the end of freshman year to transfer, or is there any way I can switch my department before entering college this fall?
4. Unrelated, but is there any real benefit of going to a US college over UofT for internships, OCR, etc.?  I'm deciding between UofT and Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA \(which will be considerably more expensive, as I'm Canadian\), so I want to make sure the transfer option is feasible before I commit to UofT.  I'd like to eventually work in the States.

Thanks in advance!"
8fq0hy,17,2018-04-29,Winging (and winning!) Prom: my experience,duehvdke,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/8fq0hy/winging_and_winning_prom_my_experience/,"This is a wall of text, but it was cathartic to write. Read it or don't, it has advice in a convenient numbered list in the middle.

Before prom, I asked 4, count 'em, four girls to go with me and they all turned me down. One even said yes but turned me down later for some Machiavellian partner trading thing to get somebody else to commit. I've been single for 95% of high school because of a heavy load of AP classes and two years of football, and my social circle is honestly pretty small and focused, so I was going alone. That being said, I have been working on myself as I have an internship with the Texas Rangers and just worked the NFL draft, so I have some cool stuff to talk about and post on Instagram. Before prom, I rented up my suit with black on black, a red bowtie, and a white jacket (I looked sharp). My dad drove me over to the convention center in our neighbor's Lexus, and against my better judgement he convinced me to stay in the car in the AC to not sweat while people lined up less than 30 feet away in the 90 degree heat and socialized. That was a good call, and once I was in the door, I checked in and started talking to people. I used a few principles at the prom that I'll line out now:

1. Talk to everyone you know (and even people you don't know): this made me really comfortable in the environment
2. Compliment everyone on something: people love compliments, and they'll usually return them
3. You don't know if you don't try: this works for lots of things, not just dances
4. Choose the partner that chooses you: this is because of some initial chemistry or you fitting their profile of people to be with
5. Hold the right expectations: stuff like ""have a great night"" ""meet new people"" or ""dance and party with friends"", not ""get laid"" ""get a certain guy/girl"" or ""focus in on one person""
6. Have a strong frame of mind: don't let pissy people ruin your night and don't rely on other people to make your night (side note: other people can make your night, just don't rely on them to)

Using the first two principles, I talked to around 40-50 people, which isn't that much considering our class size of 800 plus, but still a reasonable chunk. I talked with friends from football, people I knew from classes, people from my internship, people I'd just seen in the halls, and the dates of all of these people. Basically, anyone I talked to, I had a shred (no matter how tiny) of an introduction to start the conversation. This isn't the best way to go to start conversations, but it's easy, and that helped. I did run into my ex, and she asked if I was alone, so I said I was single and she looked smug, but I brushed it off and really didn't care (principle 6). It's liberating to not care about stuff like that. Then we sat, ate and talked, which was fun because I switched tables to a table of people I knew better than my original table, and we talked about stuff I was into and stuff they were into. Now this next part is gonna take some context. I had been posting cool stuff on Instagram all week and one girl, let's call her A, was liking it all. This stood out to me because I'm just getting into Instagram and have just over 60 followers, where she has 800 and follows 600 people. At the dance, however, she was always two feet away from another girl, E and a fat guy. I never caught her away from them to ask her to dance, but I saw them and I know A saw me. After a half hour of vigorous solo dancing in the crowd, I got some water and saw a group of 3 girls I knew. I walked up, complemented them, and started dancing. Suddenly, a slow song came on, and two of the girls coupled up, leaving the last one, who I knew the name of, O, from some SAT prep course two years ago, but it stuck and we hit it off. She's a kind of nerdy girl, but I think that's kind of cute. We slow danced, we group danced, we danced to club music, and just had a blast on the dancefloor. I danced with a few other girls, one of which even approached me. O and I kissed twice (my first kiss), and I got her number. We'll probably hang out in 3 weeks after the AP tests are over and when I can chill a bit. Any criticism or comments is/are welcome, and I'm on cloud 9 writing this 4 hours later. Major shout-outs to r/howtonotgiveafuck for principles 1,3,5 and 6, to [alpha m on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/AlphaMconsulting) for principle 2, and to David deida's book ""the way of the superior man"" for principle 4."

I’ve lived in Upstate NY my whole life and went to school here and I want out. I have gotten an internship with a public works engineering division and plan on doing one with a private company before I graduate (December 2019). My tentative focus is water resources engineering in the area of storm water. 

Teachers have talked to me about doing grad school and it interests me, but I have absolutely no idea what I would want to research. I’m starting research with a professor next semester so I can at least get somewhat exposed to research. Besides all the benefits of a higher degree, I see grad school as a first opportunity to get exposed to the world outside of NY because I plan on going somewhere outside of NY. 

I don’t absolutely hate it here, but the beginning of my career seems like the best time to think about starting over in a new place.

What I wanted to ask was about the process of starting a career in a new location:

-Would a company cover moving expenses at all, if so how much? 
-Are companies even interested in interviewing out of state candidates that would need to move there? 
-I know I need to have money saved, but how long would I expect to live off what I have saved? 
-How would accreditation transfer work between countries if I chose to go to Canada? 
-Is grad school a good option for establishing myself in a new area? 
-Am I aiming to high to try and move out of state right away? Should I get a job here first so I’m not just another new graduate applying? "

So a little background about me. 24F in NYC, spent the first 2.5 years of my career at a starter job. My industry notoriously doesn't pay well, especially starting out, but while I accepted that as a growing pain, there are some things I'm having trouble letting go of. For example:

-First boss was friendly but favored a senior co-worker who stole credit for my work and intentionally misdirected me to work on low priority assignments. Because I was an intern before being hired, my boss took my complaints less seriously and my credit stealing colleague was basically given carte blanche to manage me in any way she wanted when I was full time. My boss was barely engaged.

-This colleague was also a bully who said snippy things about my lunches in the kitchen, tried to make me look stupid in front of coworkers, and mocked my mistakes to my boss. 

-Malicious gossip train and loads of politics. Dramatic layoffs and restuctures happened 2-3 times during my employment and people were always fighting and stepping on each other. Partly because...

-Job security was horrid. My department was blamed and tormented by out of touch and mean upper management if we didn't hit company wide sales goals. I saw our CMO make people cry, humiliate people on public email threads for mistakes, and send messages after hours and at ridiculous times of day (e.g. 10 PM).

-I was grossly underpaid within a year because they never updated my salary to reflect market rate. I got a better boss later who went to bat for me when I asked for a raise multiple times but HER bosses said there wasn't money for it. Then a few months later they promoted a director in the same department. I guarantee her increase was higher than mine would have been.

-I introduced my boyfriend at a holiday party and the executives acted like I wasn't important enough to be speaking to them. I worked with them daily and I was basically holding the entire department together. They knew this because they had to reorganize the entire company when I left and I was a star performer, regularly pulling numbers like 600%, 1000% ROI (marketing).

Fast forward to now: I eventually got out a couple months ago. Unfortunately my industry is very tiny and opportunities don't come along often so I felt stuck for a long time. Fear of a worse situation and an opportunity to learn new skills in my last year made me tough it out.

The success story is that I'm now making ~15k more, and 5k higher than average top of salary range for my job now that I'm at a place that values me and wants to grow me. The problem is that I was meeting some old co-workers for drinks and the credit stealing one found out and is now coming. She's been messaging me since I started my new (well connected) job and not a day before. I'm trying to move on but the reminders are hard.

I also was treated badly by my old company when I left. Usually their policy is to have you give two weeks notice and work through that time. But a competitor poached me instead of taking a business deal with my old company that could have made them thousands of dollars. Because of this, they forced me to leave early and cut off my pay and benefits for those last two weeks. The whole way out the door they acted cagey about thinking I'd steal proprietary info (never signed an NDA), and were just generally rude.

My most recent boss there (I admired her so much) offered to take me out to buy me lunch or go for drinks. She scheduled a calendar date but it never happened. When I followed up, she said ""No thanks, I have too much to do"".

Basically, the whole experience has left me feeling angry, sour, and tired. I don't want it to tarnish my amazing new job, but it naturally comes up every now and then. How do I deal with reminders of that old, terrible colleague and get over being mistreated by that old company? I'm a notorious try-hard and I care passionately about my work and being understood. But in this case that fixation is getting in my way.

TL;DR: Toxic people and interactions at my old job are still making me angry. How do I let go?"
8frjir,3,2018-04-29,"Life decision, need advice",Chgem239,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8frjir/life_decision_need_advice/,"Hi! 

I’m 23 years old french girl studying in NYC &amp; 
I have a very important choice to make hence why I’m posting here (not sure if it’s the right sub?)

Back story:  
I came to the US in order to get into NYU, which always been my dream school. 
I worked very hard at community college &amp; ended up applying to NYU Arts &amp; Science for Econ as a transfer with a 3.8, a tech start up internship, involvement at NYU itself, and a lot of ECs related to my major. I speak 5 languages and my English is now fluent (I believe). Along with that I submitted 2 letters of recommendations, one of my finance professor and one of my advisor/faculty mentor who wrote about me leading my schools team for the Fed Challenge.  

I talked to many people, professors, NYU transfer &amp; Econ students, literally everybody told me I’m a shoe in and i shouldn’t “stress”, that i would get in so I was pretty positive.

I got rejected and did NOT expect it. NYU was the only college I applied to. (Dumb I know, don’t tell me)

My lease is up May and I have a flight to Paris May 28 so I’m VERY stressed about what’s next. 

Now my alternatives in the US are, since most deadlines passed, either 
1) stay at my community college and finish to get my associates (I got one last semester)
2) going to Baruch (automatic transfer since I go to CUNY) or Fordham which I’m not fond of. 

That would mean I’ll have to come back to the US, reapply for a visa, find a place, get a storage etc etc. which is basically annoying. 
I’m not even sure that I can transfer if I choose 1) because I been at this community college since Fall 2015 (took me longer to graduate because I had an F and dropped a class)

I recently started reevaluating staying in the US. 
I am thinking about going back to Paris to transfer my credits to American University of Paris so I would’ve not wasted my time and money. 

The main reason for me wanting to go back home is, in the 3 years I’ve been living in the states, i been very depressed and alone. I have no family members, relatives or friends in the USA. I know some people from school but I don’t have close friends. I truly miss my parents and home in general. I basically feel like I wasted my time living here but it is what it is. 

My main concern is, is it a good idea?
I plan to go to grad school in England or the US.

Should I transfer to American University of Paris (which is waaaay cheaper than a low tier US college AND I get financial aid since I’m french, also I’ll be rent free) or stick it in and go to Baruch/Fordham?
Would I be able to get into a good grad school if I get my bachelors from American University of Paris ? 

I was seeking prestige when coming here but at this point I need to pick the best option for me &amp; my career goals. 

My parents can’t give me advice or connect me to opportunities like some kids so the school I choose is kinda a big factor that’s why I’m so stressed out. 

Thanks a LOT for any advice. I love Reddit it feels like a family I can reach to.

8fscjl,4,2018-04-29,Is it normal to feel overwhelmed at your first entry position?,CovfefeDrinker,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8fscjl/is_it_normal_to_feel_overwhelmed_at_your_first/,"So I've been recently signed on to a company with an assurance of full-time employment (i.e. ""As long as you don't do something like crash the entire database, you'll be getting an offer."") and they even did not have an end date for my work term on the papers they signed--just a start date, so I am pretty happy about that. They even started referring to the next wave of students coming in this coming week as ""the interns, who we definitely won't be allowing to touch the data, or giving keys to, etc.""

This isn't a place where we are going to be just fixing dinky bugs or unit tests--no. We have been given full access to all of their data, and are expected to be adding things on within the next few weeks. We are working with a very obscure language called WLanguage, using an environment called WebDev22.

That being said, I have retained quite a bit from the pair programming we have done, I am still feeling... somewhat overwhelmed. I feel like somehow I don't deserve this level of responsibility, and intrusive thoughts of self-sabotage have been popping up. I keep thinking about a scenario where they are all sitting around the table telling me that my performance has been lackluster, and that they have decided to move forward without me. I just have a weird feeling that that'll be how it will play out... IDK why. I mean, they haven't given me any reason to really believe it, it's just a weird ""gut"" feeling.

The other two new guys (one is an intern, one is full-time 'cause he already had a work term) seem to have an overall better grasp of how everything works than I do. I don't know if it's stress, my anxiety, or my ADHD, but when they started talking about things related to the bigger picture (i.e. how the data and pages all related to each other), I'd be sitting there, silently... trying to process things in my head, wishing I could just go to my computer and go through things myself, because I like tinkering with things in my own way. I like seeing how everything is intertwined, and I felt like I would be holding them down if I got them to go back and check things. I think this is why I am having these feelings--because I'm not completely grasping everything right out of the gate, and they seem to be. I've grasped quite a bit, but not everything... and the way they present themselves, they seem to have a much better understanding of everything.

In that vein, though, there have been times where I looked at what they were doing... made a suggestion, they said ""No, that definitely won't affect the process."" I would be adamant about testing it (they were hesitant), and it actually turned out to have a big impact on how the data was processed.

So overall, are these feelings all normal? I did quite well in school (80s - 90s), have written my own REST-based API as well as even tinkered on my own programming language, but I just feel like... IDK, maybe I'll just end up slowing them down because of my ADHD/anxiety. Maybe I'll just end up costing the company more money than what it would be worth to just fire me. I really love the work, there are just a lot of doubts going on.

I'll explain my predicament regardless. 

I am currently a senior in high school, intending to major in Computer Science, faced with an impending college decision. I won't bother you with the specifics, but optimizing for cost does factor into the eventual decision, along with a determination regarding whether or not I'll pursue AI(Natural Language Processing to be specific) at the graduate level(I'm an incoming undergraduate). 

This may be premature, but I'm fairly set on delving further into AI/NLP, having taken MOOCs on Coursera, building personal projects using the TensorFlow and scikit-learn APIs, then using my experience to secure an internship this past summer at a cloud services startup. I've also supplemented my knowledge in the subject by reading the Deep Learning book by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville and hence consider myself fairly well acquainted with the fundamentals of machine learning(both theoretical and implementational). 

**Now, without further ado, here's the crux of my question - will a potential master's/doctorate in AI lend any more weight to an application than a simple undergraduate degree(with AI coursework baked in and some, albeit limited, experience with AI research)? Will the rather exorbitant cost of attending grad school be attenuated by the employment options that grad school could potentially open up?** 

Thank you for reading this long-winded question in its entirety if you did indeed read this far. I genuinely apologize if this was irrelevant or if I came across as hubristic in any way. 

Edit: To clarify, employment doesn't constitute the whole picture for me. I genuinely love AI, and ideally, I'd have dedicated myself to research. However, external circumstances dictate that I find a steady income stream sometime within the next few years.

I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina, a pretty messed up county right now, and i being fully exposed to the internet, grew up learning about technology to the point where it's my biggest passion. Right now because of political and economic reasons, access to technology in this country is terrible. We actually have the worst internet in the world, out of the countries that do have a working infrastructure. Tech related companies in here aren't really a thing either, everything is imported by multinationals. I wanna go to the US because it has relatively easy and cheap access to the latest tech stuff, and specifically in Austin, Google Fiber, so 1Gb up/down at $90/month. That's my dream, a decent internet, and being able to buy a $2000 PC for $2000, and not $4500 because of greedy politicians. So plan basically is get into computer engineering/science, get an internship ideally at Dell (based on Austin), other options are Google, HP, IBM and Cisco. Then when i finish college (6~ years from now), look for a full time at the company i did the intership and be like ""ay i speak fluent english take me to your country pls"" and hope everything goes well. Problems: Plan might be naive/childish, too idealistic. Please give some advice, as it's much appreciated! 

Some other notes: I know there's Google Fiber on some other cities too, and i'd be ok living in those, but of all of them Austin is the one i like the most. It might be naive to look to move to the US as an argentine so fast, so again, correct me if my plans need refinement. I'd be ok with waiting longer or living/working in other places first before reaching the end goal (decent internet+access to tech+work at tech+ideally at US)."

I’ve been debating posting on different subreddits for probably the last 2 years, but I’m a bit timid on social media and haven’t felt like it. However I am truly struggling with dealing with the stress of grad school and a major professor that I feel has overstepped his bounds. For a little background I am in my last few months of my master’s degree in engineering. At this point all I have to do is finish up my thesis. I have defended and while I passed the oral defense, my thesis needs some work.

For further background I have been working on my degree for 2.5 years now. The first year of my degree I was being paid but I turned down further payment because working with my professor is so distressing that I would rather go into debt than let him continue to manipulate me. Over the year I worked for him he continually threatened to take away my funding if I wasn’t available at any time he wanted. I mean I’d wake up to emails sent at 1 am telling me that if I didn’t respond he’d kick out of the program. I got to a point that when I’d hear my phone email notification go off that I’d break out in tears. He’s called me names (manic, a witch, schizophrenic). He has insulted my relationship and family (called my long term SO worthless and if he was my father he’d have some serious concerns about me dating the person I am). For context my SO is very caring and basically cooks for me every night since I don’t have time to make my own food. My professor has also lied to me about requirements on my degree causing me to waste 800 dollars on worthless credits. One time I tried to bring up to him how stressed I was and how I wasn’t managing the work load and he told me “This is good, mental breakdown is up here, and I need you right, here just below it.” While motioning with his hands at the levels of stress and the “correct” amount of stress being just scraping the mental breakdown line.

I have tried to bring issues up with student services and the office of graduate studies but I have received no help. I have talked to other teachers in my department (he is the department head), and have received no help. I have been told I can either bow down to his wishes or drop.

I’m not a terrible student. I might not be the best, but I am certainly not even the worse out of his students. I am the major author on a published paper and my research has received praise from many other teachers and students. I know part of the problem is I took an internship last summer and have remained there working part time. Half the reason I took it was I needed a break from the grad school mania. My professor doesn’t like this because it means that I have less time for him, but I love my job. They want me to work there full time when I graduate or potentially work at our sister site on the other side of the nation. Also I have only been in 3 credits since last spring so working part time hasn’t really taken me away from required work at school. And my professor did approve the position before I accepted it.

I am at a loss of what to do. Even with my defense last week he hadn’t read my thesis (I gave the first draft to him over a month and a half ago). He’ll flip through a few pages, see that I don’t have a schematic he wanted in the introduction, and hand it back as ‘unacceptable’. It’s a 100 page document, I think it takes a little more time than 2 minutes to evaluate. He has told me that he wants my introduction to be part of a literature review that he can publish once I am gone so even if it’s not applicable to my research he wants certain things in it. He has certain visions for graphics that I’ve tried my best to create, but they are what he wanted so he’ll hand it back. These graphics aren’t even applicable to my research half the time.

I’m just so tired. I have threatened to drop in the past, which is when I took those extra credits. The credits were for a plan B so that I wouldn’t have to do a thesis just a report. When I later asked him about things he told me that the credits ‘were just a placebo to make you feel better’. I have no help from my school and I’m so tempted to just walk away. Any advice would be great, though just writing things down has been helpful in venting.

TLDR: My professor is an ass, he has lied to me, and I have no help from my school. I really want to graduate (only have to get my thesis done), but I am also really tempted to just walk away.

8fvy1n,1,2018-04-29,Please help me before May 1st! (Brown vs. Berkeley OOS vs. Duke: CS/applied math/finance),technologicalbae,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8fvy1n/please_help_me_before_may_1st_brown_vs_berkeley/,"Hi everybody!
I was fortunate to be accepted to many great colleges, largely because of the reddit community's help, and I've narrowed my choices to Brown vs. Berkeley (OOS) vs. Duke. After taking numerous coding classes in high school and doing many hackathons, I've figured out that I'd love to pursue CS and dabble in entrepreneurship and finance.
I'd hope to eventually work in either Silicon Valley, Boston, or NYC in the future. 

To sum my major preferences, the internship scene/alumni connections to Silicon Valley/Wall Street is most vital, but I also want an energetic, collaborative environment where people love solving real-world problems.

For a more detailed list of pros vs cons:

BROWN:

-Pros:

--- Open curriculum (I'm interested in CS, finance, applied math, so it'd be easy to tie together in the open 
curriculum and become a well-rounded curriculum) (most important)

--- Very collaborative/tight-knit CS community (very important)

--- Close to home (I live in MA)

--- Large focus on undergrads, giving access to research, clubs, etc

-Cons:

--- Not too well-represented or respected on Silicon Valley or Wall Street compared to Berkeley and Duke respectively 
(most important)

--- Facilities/dorms/living spaces/campus seems run down

--- Endowment is the smallest, which is visible in facilities and career center lack of staff

--- Food isn't that good

--- Atmosphere is kinda too laid-back

DUKE:

-Pros:

--- Great Opportunities for all my interests (majors in CS and math, along with markets and management certificate) 
(most important)

--- Beautiful Campus with a large endowment

--- Just lots of opportunities in general (Duke Engage, Duke Focus, etc)

--- Career services tends to be really strong in recruiting/finance (very important)

--- Great school spirit/ amazing alumni network

-Cons: 

--- In my opinion, the weakest CS program of the three and not so-strong recruiting to Silicon Valley (most 
important)

--- Some people were too fratty and just made me feel a bit uncomfortable (though most people were very kind)

--- Administration tends to be more secretive/not answer questions directly (they usually darted my ""hard"" 
questions)

--- Many programs like Duke Engage were application based

--- Atmosphere is kinda too laid-back

BERKELEY:

-Pros:

--- The best CS program by far and strongest connections to Silicon Valley (most important)

--- The best applied math program

--- Beautiful campus

--- Lots of opportunities to work with the brightest (very important)

--- Very straightforward professors who answered my questions very honestly

--- Very energetic campus with people bubbling to make a difference in the world with CS

-Cons:

--- Class sizes are too large and student-teacher ratios are even bigger, so I fear being lost or getting the help I need 
(most important)

--- Dorms are tiny

--- Stressful atmosphere/lack of support/competitive to get research/join top clubs (very important)

--- Administration is tough to deal with

--- Relatively large, but weak alumni network (very important)

--- Difficult to stand out when applying for internships/jobs (very important)


Ultimately, one major question that's in my head is whether I want to choose a small, private university that is
mediocre at CS but offers many accessible opportunities or a large, research university that is the best at CS and has
the most opportunities, but whose opportunities are hardest to get.

Also, money isn't an issue, as all the schools cost around the same.

Thanks so much!"

Let's say that I'm not the common 18 years-old. I came to the United States three years ago and while I've learned English. it's really hard for me to have a normal communication with someone to the extent that I feel socially awkward. I have always had a good relationship with my family and I fell that I'm not ready to go away.(  my family has played a huge role and it has been there when I'm having a rough time) while I know that four years would pass fast, I do not know if it is worth it to go away.

(Cost is not a factor since I receive enough financial aid that any of these schools would cost me less than 3k each year)
Cooper Union would provide me with a great education in engineering. its small class would allow me to work closely with professors. it would also provide me good internship opportunities. I really liked the building when I visited the building and the student body shares many of the characteristics I am looking for. on the other hand, Cooper Union is not a well-known institution out of New York City and it something that afraid me when looking for a job, the small class( positive in certain aspects) does not diversity, there are not clubs or any activities. Lastly, I'm not sure whether I want to major in engineering or economics so going for an only-engineering
 school would ""force"" me to go to this path.

NYU is also in the city which is a big plus, I got into CAS so I have the possibility to explore many areas. the economics major is superb and the possibility to do internships in the academic year is wonderful. I would also have the possibility to double major, or even travel abroad( something that Cooper does not offer). the extensive school body would allow me to join all sort of clubs.

Lastly, Jhu would provide me a different experience, it would push me out of my comfort zone. I would have a superb education in a top-tier institution and it also offers many of the benefits that NYU offers. I would double major in economics and some sort of engineering. I would probably be more independent. However, the idea of being away from my family really scares me, I fell that I have not matured yet and it would be really hard for me to have a good mental health knowing that I am away from my family.

I would greatly appreciate if someone could weigh in their opinion based on the info above—which school sounds like a better fit? Thanks!

Long story short, I don't really have a passion for engineering anymore. I have the capacity to do it, but the passion is no longer there. I'm a junior, and the past 3 years have probably been the worst of my life. My health has suffered \(fat and depressed, the ultimate combo!\) and I'm unhappy. There was a time when I was young and enjoyed learning, but I have never felt that way in college. Even in my business classes I pay more attention than in engineering classes. I've stuck with engineering because I have done pretty well \(3.7 GPA\). My GPA will drop though since I've been depressed, missing class, and underachieving. it'll drop after this semester. Plus my parents want me to do this. 

I hoped that my GPA would land me an internship but had only gotten two interviews \(which I bombed\) by the middle of April. Then, I received acceptance from an REU program I applied to. I accepted it, because it was at the deadline, I had no internship offers, and I'll be making more money this summer than I  probably would have an intern. Plus I am looking forward to spending time with the other REU students. It seems like a great program. This REU program will help me pay for grad school, GREs, and a whole ton of other things. I'll be paired with an engineering professor for the summer.

However, I don't see myself going to grad school. At the state I am with engineering now, I don't see myself being able to finish a PhD. The stress is too much, and will only be amplified in grad school. My plan when I started college was to work as an engineer and write fiction on the side, hopefully until I could write full\-time. Writing tons of papers in grad school could help me hone my skills and reach that goal. But, as I said before, the passion is not there. If I were to go to grad school, I'm not sure what I would even want to research in engineering. There are some concentrations I am interested in on a surface level \(acoustics, nanotechnology, design\) but the deeper I dive into them the less interested I am. Even if I was to switch to a different department I'm not sure what I would want to study in those either. If I was to study writing, literature, or English, I probably wouldn't end up making much money at the time being, and would be better off getting an entry level engineering job.

This is a great opportunity, but I do not know how to maximize it, nor do I even know if this is the right path for me. Advice? Thanks for reading the post."

Earlier in the year i was given my retrenchment notice, but since then, I've failed to secure a job. Im currently working in the IT department of a university until my contract officially ends on May 16th. The job was offered to me during my internship and i decided to take it instead of going ahead with my degree because it was good money and i didnt feel like owing the government anymore than i already did. I've recently been paying off my existing student loans with my paycheck, so its not like im buying expensive clothes or splurging on five star restaurants. Im very frugal with my earnings. I have a diploma in creative writing which i now realize was a waste of time and money. I suspect the companies I applied to are looking at my job experience as an IT assistant as incompatible with the position that I am applying for, mostly in the editorial department (as that is where i feel i would most excel). I've submitted my portfolios, articles and essays i've written for my highschool newspaper and some of my college assignments, but I feel like that wasnt enough to even secure me an interview. However, I feel like i will always have the shadow of my IT background preventing me from ever breaking out of this industry when i want to pursue a job that is more relevant to my qualifications. I dont wanna do IT anymore, but I cant get a writing job with my current qualifications. Am i doomed?

Now that I am getting it treated, I appealed the dismissal and the school allowed me back under a 2-semester academic plan... but then I immediately received a notice from the financial aid notice saying my grades have made me ineligible for any financial aid.

I appealed it but the dean said my school's financial aid office is notorious for rejecting these. The financial aid office website says if my appeal is rejected my only option is to secure my own funding. I can't afford to pay my bills and 2 semesters out of pocket. They said an option is to find a private loan, but I'm not sure if I can do that -- my state offers private loans but I don't have a cosigner, and even if they didn't require one, I am really nervous about being charged a predatory amount due to my income and lack of cosigner.

So it really looks like I can't afford to go back to school, which is sad because nearly all of my CS reqs are complete -- I need another 45 credits to graduate, but that's all gen ed reqs, I am only missing 2 upper level math classes for my CS reqs. Even if I completed all of those reqs at another school, I'd still need to return back and pay for a full year to return to good academic standing and graduate...

Does anyone have any advice? Should I ask my previous internship for a job? (I'm pretty sure their answer would be no based on their culture but I could still ask?) I am about to start another internship as well, should I try to network to try to get them to hire me without the degree? I haven't met anyone there yet so I don't know how successful that would be."

I'm currently working on building an Elastic stack for my internship but I'm facing a small problem. The actual architecture resembles this :  
Filbeat (on 6 servers ) -&gt; logstash -&gt; Graylog -&gt; ( Elasticsearch -&gt; Kibana ) ||  Neo4j [simultaniously]
So basically there are two elasticsearch nodes which contain indices set by Graylog. All of them begin with graylog_xx . My problem is that i want each app/µservice to have its own index name for instance : app1-xxxx-xx-xx , app2-xxxx-xx-xx etc. for that I use filbebeat to tag each log file with the corresponding app name and then use logstash output to create the index with a custom name directly on elasticsearch. The ops want to keep Graylog along with the elasticstack. So is there any way for graylog to read from an existing elasticsearch node (I sorta want to make elasticsearch the main focus of the architecture and have graylog and kibana plug onto it ) ? Or at least display custom index names for each app on graylog ? - I don't know if what I'm saying makes any sense :s . I'm open to all suggestions guys ~ Thanks in advance ."

I was recently accepted to Waterloo's CS co-op program so I immediately accepted my offer and decided that it's the best path for me. However, now I'm having second thoughts. Anyway, here's an updated version of my previous post.

**Situation:** My family is moving to California after I graduate high school. My dad recently started the green card process, and I might turn 21 before it's completed (and if I do turn 21, I will have to apply on my own). In order to be close to my family, I plan to work in California.

I have offers from both Canadian and American schools—while I first ignored these US schools due to their outrageous price, my wealthy aunt is offering to pay a portion of my education if I go south. No matter where I attend, the price will be comparable.

**Offers:** I have an offer for Computer Science co-op at Waterloo. In the US, I have offers from UCLA Math of Computation, UCSD Data Science, and Cal Poly Software Engineering.

**My thoughts on US:** US schools definitely have the edge in terms of recruiting and networking. Most students who I would go to school with will likely end up in California. The weather and school environment will be nice too (though that would be secondary). 

On the other hand, despite how F1 Visa students have work authorization, employers still discriminate in hiring them (""why should I hire this kid who's gonna stay here for 4-5 years when I can just hire a citizen?""). In addition, having someone pay for a part of education can be risky. If my aunt, undergoes financial trouble or just doesn't want to fund me anymore, it's over for me.

Then, the majors I was accepted at UCLA and UCSD to might pose a problem. UCLA Math of Computation means a lot more math classes than CS classes. UCSD Data Science is really new and narrows my skillset to data science/machine learning (which often includes a master's which, at that point, I likely cannot afford).

**My thoughts on Waterloo:**  From what I've heard, Silicon Valley recruiters love Waterloo so going to the US and spending all that money isn't worth it. I'll have two years of work experience because of co-op and since I'm a Canadian citizen, I'll have access to various loans, scholarships, and internships that I would not have if I were to go to the US. 

One thing is though, I really have no evidence that Waterloo is a good CS school other than from a few news articles and anecdotal evidence from Reddit. Even on rankings, it's pretty low (I know it has to do with research but research seems to be correlated with school quality like how Berkeley, CMU, MIT, and Stanford are all ranked high). 

**Final Thoughts:** I know I'll always wonder *what if* no matter where I go, but I don't want to think back about how dumb I was in high school to have chosen **X school** when I had an offer from **Y school**. Any insights, opinions, facts, or anything about my choice? Am I crazy for turning down some California schools for Waterloo CS?"

I did this because I felt that I didn't have good enough knowledge and understandings of CS to actually get a good internships and I am instead going to spend the summer trying to enhance my knowledge and work on personal projects. 

However, I'm rethinking this because I was told that most freshman get an internship and that by doing this I will be lacking behind everyone else. Is this true and if so, should I apply for internships even if I feel like I'm not there yet?"
8g17ut,2,2018-04-30,Summer job employer not responding to calls?,Apprehensive_Way,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8g17ut/summer_job_employer_not_responding_to_calls/,"So, at the beginning of April I got an interview with a small not-for-profit doing digital marketing work for the summer through my university's career portal. The woman who interviewed me was very soft-spoken and nice, and she admitted not knowing much about digital marketing. She also said I was the only person they were planning on interviewing because I had the only resume that outlined experience planning events and running communities for school clubs through social media. The interview wasn't really an interview, but moreso a tour of the workplace and an outline of what my responsibilities would be. The interviewer told me to send in my references, and I could start at the beginning of May. She also told me that I could I call her if I had any questions. I emailed my references the next day and assumed I was set to start working. 

I gave the position little thought until my exams ended 3 weeks later. After a day of relaxation, I called into the workplace to reconfirm that I was hired. The receptionist who picked up the phone told me that my contact was in a meeting, so I gave the receptionist my information and told her I'd be free for the rest of the day. Never got a call back. Called again a day later, also didn't get a return call. So, I tried to call the interviewer's cell phone number, which I used before to set up my initial interview. I left a polite voicemail asking her to call me back whenever convenient. This was on Friday. Again, no call yet.

The suspense is killing me. As a business student going into 3rd-year, I was really hoping for a summer job related to marketing that I could use to boost my resume for when I have to start looking for internships in my program. Should I keep looking for summer jobs? If so, where? (I'm in the Hamilton area of Ontario if that's any help, and I have my own car so commuting isn't an issue as long as it's within an hour's drive outside the city). I feel like I'm on a ticking clock, as the longer I wait I know the fewer summer jobs there will be available that aren't retail and food service positions (and I have lots of experience working in both already). Or, should I hold out on hope that, as a small not-for-profit, the employer just isn't on top of phone calls, and they're planning on contacting me in May as that's when they said I'd start? Does anybody have any similar experiences? "

I am coming from a very over expecting family, I am their only child and they are way older an average parents, they conceived me after 25 years into their marriage.


I joined a reputed engineering college in my state where I live, everything was fine until I started getting medical issues. A sharp pain in my right abdomen started get in between me and my studies. My father was since jobless for 4 years, and we are basically living on his savings. I wasn't able to complain anything to my parents, because they thought that I am weaving a fake story to earn more pocket money, which unfortunately wasn't. Eventually, I ended up losing in many of engineering subjects. I can hopefully write them again and pass.
The above scenario really hurt my coding skills and prowess, I was once an early adopter of every new programming language and all, now I couldn't quite do it alone. I feel like having a remote internship or a mentor will really help me out. I will be hugely benefited by a mentor because I am not streamlined as I used to be. I am presently in my sixth semester and we are required to find an internship job before seventh semester. Due to my introvert attitude, I do not have much contact anywhere. :\( The last hope is finding someone coming out of nowhere to help.


I am posting in the belief that there might be some else in this world, who might have gone through similar fate. I really want make everything right and I will forever grateful for any nice replies you may give, I will pass the niceness I may receive to whoever in need.


My area of interest : Web Development, Web Designing, UI/UX, Backend development.
Programming languages I know: I am a stack overflow person as of now, That why I feel like I should have a real remote work or a mentor.


TLDR; I am presently having a bad situation; I need to find an internship, due to poor health I have quite few backlogs; parents are pressurizing, and I am not able to concentrate on certain tasks like I used to. I would be benefited from a remote internship or any person who is willing to guide me, I am not able to find mentor in my close circle due to my introvert attitude."
8g24vv,9,2018-04-30,Not Wanting to Work in SF/Bay Area - Advantage or Disadvantage?,milksteakmmm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8g24vv/not_wanting_to_work_in_sfbay_area_advantage_or/,"Hello, I'm currently a rising senior studying Statistics and some CS at UC Berkeley. I need to start job hunting fairly soon, and after my 3 years of living in Berkeley/getting to know the SF/Bay Area, I've come to realize that I really do not want to work or live here (nothing against people that do); I would much prefer to work and live in the East Coast.

But, I know there are A LOT of tech-related opportunities in this area. Thing is, I'm not exactly a competitive applicant. I have a sub-3.0 GPA, 1 mediocre internship, but a number of personal projects, small-medium scale (nothing groundbreaking, mostly local-machine applets/programs written in R/Python, like a ""weight-loss/weight-gain helper,"" using ML packages like statsmodels/sklearn to build ARIMA models to forecast).

I don't really have a desire to work for the Big 4 (I don't mean that in an arrogant way; it's not like they'd even hire me lol) straight out of college.

Given my preferences/circumstances, do you think it's an ""advantage"" (in the sense that I don't have to compete against some of these Berkeley code stars), or a ""disadvantage"" (lack of opportunities perhaps?) that I do not wish to stay in SF/Bay Area? Any advice on maybe changing my outlook/knowing where to look would be greatly helpful. Thank you!

EDIT: Just to clarify, the reason I do not want to live in the area has to do with me just not liking the area/it not being a good fit (the same way a person might not want to live in Boston/LA/wherever); it has nothing to do with the competition here. My line of thinking was that ""if I'm moving out of the Bay Area anyway, will the (perceived) lack of competition (since the Bay Area is one of the most competitive) work in my favor?"". But thank you for the responses! If staying here will help me jumpstart my career much more than elsewhere due to opportunities, of course I will stay here, build some experience, then move to EC. I don't want to be too picky for my first job (if at all)."

However, I've noticed that most job postings for data scientist roles highly prefer masters or doctoral degrees. I don't plan on getting a PhD, however I'm interested in getting a masters after maybe a few years of working. I managed to get a research assistant role with my data science and machine learning professor, but is this enough to be considered for a MS CS at schools like Stanford, USC, or the UC's? It seems like I would need to get published papers to be considered by Stanford and the UC's, but I doubt that I can accomplish that in a year.

I also currently have a 3.85 cumulative GPA and did some internships in the industry. Thanks."

I'm going to be entering grad school this fall to attempt to get my Master's in Computer Science, and I had some questions about loans that I can't get a consistent answer on.

Essentially, I want to focus my time and energy on school and really make it count.  I'm going to have to take out loans to pay for tuition and most likely to supplement my cost of living (since I will no longer be able to work full time while going to school).  The question then becomes:  should I just get loans to cover my entire cost of living for the duration I'll be in school (~2 years)?  I (optimistically) plan on having a decent career coming out of school, so significant student loan debt seems worth it, but I'm not sure how others feel about it.

I've talked to friends who have been/are in grad school, and their experiences are varied.  Some have taken out significant loans even during undergrad (I currently have 0 student loans), and some paid out of pocket while working during grad school (albeit, in a program that might not be as intensive as the one I'm going into).

How much is too much?  Or should I plan on working half-time during the semester?

I'll also note that I'm dismissing any possible scholarships or internships for the sake of simplicity and covering my bases.  Essentially I'd like to know that I have everything covered going into school, and anything I can take off the top I will as I go.

Thanks for any advice!"

8g2xtv,5,2018-04-30,Haven't been able to get a job for two years despite having a college degree in a town supposedly hiring right out of college. Thinking it's time to throw in the towel.,Luster-Purge,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8g2xtv/havent_been_able_to_get_a_job_for_two_years/,"I graduated in 2016 with a degree in Computer Informatics (the more IT sided version of Computer Science) looking to get into what I was told was a rapidly growing industry.

It's seriously gotten to the point where having spent all those years getting a degree in Computer Informatics feels like the biggest waste of money and time, because it's gotten me absolutely goddamn NOTHING. For two solid years recruiters have given me the runaround, I've only sparingly had interviews which all *routinely* told me no, if they even bother getting back to me at all! 

""No, you're just not trying hard enough"" people tell me, ""you're in one of the big tech cities of the country!"" - notably not ONE of those people ever tell me where these mythical jobs are. Entry Level stuff is rare and somehow, despite meeting all the qualifications, I am rejected more often than not. I've done everything - resume is only a page, I've spammed the thing everywhere, but it's like I'm cursed or something - it's like everybody knows ""oh don't hire this guy"" and nobody will even give me a chance.

I desperately need a job and after two years of the IT industry screwing me over, I don't know what I'm to do. I honestly don't have any real skills other than computing and even there I feel like I got let down by my college. The only tech experience I have is a three-month internship from 2015, but I just got a letter from that same company telling me they have passed on me. I literally WORKED for them and somehow that wasn't enough for an entry level position full time doing the exact same work!

I'm at my wits end. How do people even get past this? I have no real work history beyond the internship and a short stint at Target for a few months, but I feel because of that, I can never get a job doing what I have a bachelor's for - because that bachelor's has gotten me a big fat NOTHING for all the trouble it was to get and how everybody thinks it's so important. Do companies even look at that stupid slip of paper? And what good will it be to try getting solid, full time work in another industry that I DON'T have a proper bachelor's for? My life is going nowhere and as far as I can tell, there's nothing I can do to fix it.

8g35f5,1,2018-04-30,I was fired from first programming job. Advice for moving forward,throwaway77891234,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8g35f5/i_was_fired_from_first_programming_job_advice_for/,"So I was recently fired from my programming job. The reason I was given for being fired was accessing network drives that I wasn't supposed to be accessing. I had been accessing a drive that displayed everyone's clock\-in/clock\-out times and had been using it to keep up with my hours every couple of weeks. I had also opened up a drive that contained corporate banking information \(they were just numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...\) multiple times trying to find the one that had the clock\-in data \(I just remembered it was one of the lower numbers\). 

One of my coworkers who saw this thought I was doing something horrible by looking at the clock\-in data, told the higher ups, and then an audit showed that I had been accessing all these different drives. They couldn't determine if I had changed/removed/added anything, freaked out, and fired me at the end of the week. I didn't think looking at clock\-in data was a big deal, and had even said something to the network admin in passing that I had noticed the banking information sitting exposed on one of the drives, because I thought that was something that shouldn't be sitting exposed. He denied I had ever said anything, so I was kinda left hung out to dry. As far as they were concerned, I guess I was some sort of spy or digging through information that was highly confidential. 

I'm pretty salty about the situation overall, as I honestly didn't think what I was doing was wrong and would have never of done it if I would've known it would have gone so poorly. It wasn't like I was hiding it, as I even showed it to other people because I thought it made it easier to keep up with your hours vs scrolling through the hundreds of lines of logs on the scanner. You would've thought I was some corporate spy the way I was talked to. 

Anyways, this all feels really weird now. I haven't talked to anyone about it other than my girlfriend since I'm so embarrassed to have been fired. I'm certain I will be asked about my firing in interviews going forward. This was my first programming job out of college \(hired as an intern, had the job for 2.5 years\), and my boss straight up said to not ask him for a reference when I left. I've already filed for unemployment, though seeing as how I was fired for ""cause"" I guess I might be denied. How should I deal with this going forward, especially in interviews? "

While the pay is nice for this point in my career, I really don't enjoy the work I'm doing nor do I see any future growth.

I feel like I have significantly stronger problem solving skills than my current position requires and this position doesn't let me utilize them. There's been so many times that I found flaws with our software that I'm not allowed to fix because I'm ""just an analyst"". I've requested to move to the software division on this team, but they are adamant on me requiring a CS degree. Instead, I have an mechanical engineering degree (from a top 10 public school).

As of right now, I've been doing a significant amount of online learning; I've pretty much learned the basics to the MEAN tech stack. I've also done significant study on Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, but that's useless unless I actually get an interview. If I wanted to get into Software Development, should I simply consider going back to school for a bachelors in CS, or continue with self learning and making personal projects? 

I feel like all my applications aren't even being read because I'm applying for entry level developer positions without a degree. I'm also wondering if it would even be possible to get an internship after being employed for 3 years, because that's definitely an option for the right company.

Thank you all!"
