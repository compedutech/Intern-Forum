I cried in the shower until the water ran cold against my body. It wasn’t until then I realized I was being selfish, ungrateful, and blind to my blessings. 

Currently I have 8 college acceptances. 4 instate, and 4 out of state. An accumulation of $60,000+ in scholarships. They’re all great in their own way but as the months have passed I have been anticipating a “Congratulations” from my top choice. The top university in my state. 

I spent three summers on the campus of my top choice in middle school for a program, spoke on a panel on campus just two years ago, and both parents have attended this university. The past 4 years I never dreamed of attending Harvard, or even Cornell which I spent 6 weeks at for a summer program two years ago. My dream has always been to stay near family, community, connections, and my beautiful home city. 

I don’t have the best scores or grades. I threw myself into full time college for double credit during junior year, I am an entrepreneur, captain for my sports teams, have been offered internships from county elected officials, and represented all 35,000 students in my district on the school board. But still that wasn’t enough for my top choice, but regardless, I am still enough for the 8 others. And I should be grateful that I have been accepted to all of these amazing schools. 

So many students worldwide apply to schools all over and won’t always be accepted. Nor can everyone afford the top schools. No one prepares you for 6 months of waiting, or rejections. 

Cry if needed, but remember you’re enough and the school doesn’t define you."

I was wondering if it's worth minoring in CS while getting a BSI from the School of Info. Would it make a big impact on your future job offers, or is it not worth it? I know that internships are easier to get after completing EECS 281, so i was considering the minor, but I also dont want to take on a courseload that is heaver than it really needs to be. Any input is appreciated. Thanks!"
fsqyd4,26,2020-03-31,[Rant] It’s official. Due to COVID-19 I’ve now had my 3rd job accepted pulled right from under me,BaysideStud,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/fsqyd4/rant_its_official_due_to_covid19_ive_now_had_my/,"Wow. What a year it has been. Came into this semester motivated more than ever to work hard and get a job after I accepted a job after successfully completing my summer internship. The airline industry had a down quarter and began making early cuts after word caught on that COVID could start affecting the everyday business back in December. I was a little bummed, I lost my free flight benefits, but now I knew I could use my soon to acquire master’s degree and probably be a little bit happier with my work.

I thought, nbd, I’ll go to the next job fair since I generally have good success there. I show up, land 5 interviews, and accept a job within the next two weeks. Then a month later, I receive a phone call from my soon-to-be manager, he sounded a bit awkward and began explaining about how work has been running dry due to the virus and had to respectfully retract their offer that we have verbally agreed upon. Now, I start becoming a little nervous about the future job outlook for those of us graduating this spring and in the summer. From here, this is how big of an impact this virus has had globally, and how this could be worse than watching my parents struggle in the 2008 recession. 

I move forward to linkedin, start spam applying to as many jobs as possible hoping to get ahold of anything. Then I receive an email from a company I thought would have no interest in contacting for any reason, I have been selected to an interview, I fly out in 2 weeks. Awesome! I thought all my hard work is paying off. This was big, I would be designing water treatment systems for outer space which was part of my speciality. I show up, nail the interview, and now we wait. A week goes by, nothing. Then I receive a phone call from HR, I have been selected for the job, shortly after I celebrate with my friends, and call my parents in tears that my dreams were finally coming true! The next day, I receive a call from the same area based on the caller ID, and a different HR rep from the company is on the line. The phone call initially started off very awkward, like very awkward, there were way to many uhhh’s and ummm’s to start the call. The HR rep proceeds to tell me THEY OFFERED THE WRONG CANDIDATE! Wow, was I heart broken. I was an absolute wreck the next few days, skipped a few classes and drank a lot which is not like me.

I’ve interviewed for possibly my last 2 jobs of the semester last week, and just received word from one that they cannot offer me anymore due to work running short, but we will remain in contact if anything comes up in the near future. The other told me that my offer will be in by the end of the week and haven’t heard back from them yet. I’ve followed up shortly after not hearing back from them, and no response yet. So i’m afraid I will now be graduating with a master’s degree without a job due to the dry market.

I’m sorry for the long rant, this has been a long semester. Graduation has been cancelled those of us this semester and possibly the summer graduates as well, the market has been very dry, and we’re in the middle of a pandemic. But we’ll get through this. I wanted to share my experience for those who may be feeling down as well. This has been a great community to follow throughout my college years, and have enjoyed the memes, celebrations, support, and the don’t forget the +C. Y’all are awesome and don’t ever change. Did I mention don’t forget the +C

Update: As of today, the final company called back and offered me the job after a long year. I had them reassure this wouldn’t be pulled by global pandemic, and they said it was 100%. I’ll officially accept the job tomorrow and begin the next chapter of my life after completing my degree this semester"
fsrapj,1,2020-03-31,Advice on any skills I can develop during this shelter period. Mechanical Engineer. Not a lot of work experience.,Jgraybeard,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/fsrapj/advice_on_any_skills_i_can_develop_during_this/,"So I have been having trouble finding a career path and getting a job BEFORE this pandemic and finding one after is going to be even more difficult. So I need to make sure I come out of this with more employable skills. Here is where I am at now with skills and work experience.

Graduated in May 2018 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Worked as a Lab Manager until Jan 2019. Worked at a restaurant until June 2019. Had an internship for 16 weeks at a start up company in electric aviation that ended in Oct 2019. (This is a field that I would love to be in, unfortunately I was not hired afterwards). And I have been looking for a job ever since.

I want to be in the field of renewable energies. More specifically electric vehicle transport, battery storage, or advocating progressive policy. However, I have kept my options very open to anything related to renewables and the environment. I would prefer a smaller, start-up company because I like the concepts of 'wearing many different hats' and the general tight-knit culture of smaller companies. I don't want to be an entry level drone for some of these larger companies, although, I will if the values of the company align with my own.

However, given that I have wasted so much time without getting a 'real' job, I feel like many companies are passing due to my lack of experience and skills. I also dont qualify for 'graduate' positions anymore due to that I graduated almost two years ago.

So what can I work on at home to put on my resume. The only thing I can think of is learning programming. I have been working on a Python bootcamp, but it is hard to develop skills without a real project to work on. I already have a good grasp on Revit (CAD), MATLAB programming, and writing for technical research. However, these have not gotten me very far.

So any tips on:

1. Technical Skills that I can learn for relatively cheap that would look good on a resume
2. How to break into the fields listed above as an 'entry' level engineer
3. Any SPECIFIC roles for someone of my skill. I am a personable person and would do well in any position that requires a mix of technicality and inter-personality, like sales.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really feel stuck and unemployable so any advice is welcome. Thank you!"

My Situation:

Originally from Toronto Canada, but graduated from an out of town East Coast Canadian University with a Computer Science degree (not uWaterloo) about 20 months ago (End of Summer 2018).  

During school I had completed 4 co-ops/internships in the town of my University. I also graduated with relatively OK grades (3.5 gpa) and without a significant side project.

After school I was incredibly burned out and depressed, so I moved back home and planned on taking a few months off, then starting the job search anew back in Toronto.

Unfortunately my ""few months off"" has turned into 20 months and counting. I did not spend my time doing anything of real value in regards of my career (no side project/ practicing leetcode/ interview prep).  I haven't applied to a single job after graduation because of what I think is a serious case of impostor syndrome.

The problem is that I really don't understand why I am feeling this way! Every time I think about opening up an IDE to start practicing I get a horrible pit in my stomach and feel like crying. This time in quarantine has forced me to really rethink about what I am doing with my life. If anybody has been in this situation before I would love to hear what you have done to come out of it / ""fix"" yourself. 

Should I try to contact my old internships and move back to my University town?  Should I just be truthful during my interviews about why I haven't done anything of value during these days? Please, I need some serious guidance here. Thank you for your help."

fsuz6l,1,2020-04-01,My CS new grad journey till now and need some advise !!,jugnuji,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fsuz6l/my_cs_new_grad_journey_till_now_and_need_some/,"Hello, fellow Redditors,

Brace yourself, it'll be a little lengthy. A little bit of background about me. I graduated last year with a bachelor's in Computer Science. In my coursework, I had the opportunity to do a variety of interesting courses such as compilers, OS, functional programming, embedded systems, NLP, ML, CV, etc. I had two RA(research assistant ) experience writing some python/bash code with two 4 months internships (data-engineering and scientist). I slacked a little bit in December and started applying by late-January.

(First question)

Surprisingly, I received 4-5 phone-calls for mid-senior level positions which I believe I don't qualify for. Why is it that?.

Back to my story, during this time, I received a homework assignment for a ETL interview developer. I wrote the code, provided some comments(how to improve functions,other good libs to use in Python) with Docker to run and sent. Then after 5 days, I receive rejection email with no specific reason. I checkon online and I  noticed another job posted from the company with SENIOR label in job-title with same job-description which I applied for.

(Second question)

I was rejected because they thought my skills were mid-senior?? (and that were reflected in my code that probably I am junior types)?, specific to hiring freeze (I can see a job posted few days back so I assume they are actively hiring still)?. Any other red flags in homework assignment (it was writing code for some data-manipulation with JSON) possible in your experience? algorithmic? too much commenting? not using external libraries? (Note: i was given 7 days to complete hw assignment where I submitted my code within 3rd day)

Later on in my story, I had another opportunity for a system-level programmer in Feb(C, OS,data-structures, low-level stuff), so I asked for 4 months period before interviewing to make sure I know stuff. Now, this interview is anyways delayed for a few months. I learned assembly x86 and reverse-engineering stuff(I wanted to do it for a long time, now I am graduated and have time on hand). This got me reading about how executable works, how C is interpreted into the assembly, shared libs, virtual memory, using tools(debuggers, disassemblers, decompilers) for RE(reverse-engineering). Learning.

(Third question)

To prepare for system-level programming job-interview, I found online on glassdoor to do some data-structures, know about C/C++ specifics, memory segments, debuggers etc. So RE stuff can prove useful for this interview I guess(its also fun). I am also doing hackerank(for C questions, its better than leetcode). I am also working on a personal C/C++ project on making a my-own debugger( cpython, and c ). What are your other suggestions to prepare for the interview? (Note : My only experience of C/C++ is from OS and embedded course. no experience in industry though)

&amp;#x200B;

I whole-heartedly thank you for reading the whole thing. If you can relate to my situation, or had a situation like this, please share your insights and suggestions."

When it comes to coding skill, I'd say I'm average to above average at my school. I've done one internship and I'll likely be graduating with 2 more co-ops. GPA 3.7 if it matters. I'm not gunning for one of those Bay Area FAANG jobs or crazy $150k+ TCs right out of school. I simply want a SWE job in the US with a path to Green Card (I'd be more than happy with an average SWE job in the midwest). I want to immigrate because I've lived most of my life in the US, have all my friends/relatives there, and just feel more at home there. However, when I see people from my school making it to the states, it seems that the vast majority of them go to FAANG level companies. I'm not sure if these are just the companies most likely to take Canadians on TN visa or because  Canadians generally don't go south unless it's worth it for them (i.e. FAANG level salaries). So I wanna ask: 

1. How hard is it for a non-superstar Canadian CS major to make it to the US? (Disregarding impending recession). 
2. What can I do to maximize my chances at finding a US company that would be willing to take me and eventually provide me a path to GC sponsorship? (Please keep in mind I'd be open to many options like midsize of F500 companies). 
3. Any Canadians here care to share their stories of applying in the US to a broad range of companies? Were non-FAANG companies much less responsive?"

 so my questions are:

1. Can I claim the tax back?
2. Do I have to still be in Germany to claim the tax or should I wait until I finish my internship and fly back to England?
3. Is it possible to change my tax bracket now?
4. Can I stop putting into a German pension and just recieve the money

I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. 

Young male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.

Since school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).

Escaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections. Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice. And NOBODY will employ you at any job in the US if you are not citizen. 5 stupid years wasted + 8 years of home training.

I came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job. I faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here, there are just too many doctors today. I lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available, but then COVID-19 happened. My country is in lockdown, I'm quarantined, unemployed, with no money, no financial power, living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime (paralized temporarily due pandemic), living off the charity of others, unable to move, unable to sleep due suicide thoughts, and writing this. Most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries. I feel like i'm in the starting line. I'm now almost 30 years old, indebted, single and poor. I'm ashamed of what I experienced, I'm ashamed to say I'm unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job, and still hunting for one. I'm a miserable unemployed doctor.

 You want to make it worse? Law in my country requires me to serve in the COVID emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse, totally UNPAID or I could be charged a fine or brief jail time.   

Failure is the word to describe what I am. I hate myself, I constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and I blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of God despite me being religious. Education was in vain in my life. The only thing that prevents me from commiting suicide is my parents, but after I bury them, I think I might take the shot. 

I'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls. Then why can't I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story. I will read you thoroughtly"

I'm about to graduate with a BA in Political Science and I've taken about 3, maybe 4 CS classes (two of which were hands on, one of which is primarily theory but now that we're online we're getting hands on practice with the principles). Outside of classes I'm currently volunteering with a nonprofit to help build a website (started off writing React code, now moving into helping with UI/UX), and my internship which should have been focused on policy at a nonprofit turned into building them some software. Not complaining, VERY happy I had the experience, but it wasn't at all expected. 

I've kinda seen the writing on the wall, and want to get into this field. Ideally, the plan is to go abroad. What I'm quickly finding out though is that it seems as if my lack of theoretical classes is actually hurting me.. despite stellar grades in classes where we had to produce things for what amounted to a code review each week. Effectively my options are to go into another 40k of debt for a Computer Science Masters at my current institution, or go abroad to Canada, Singapore, Korea, Estonia, maybe Netherlands... and obtain the same degree at a much cheaper price point with possibly a higher degree of academic rigor. 

How possible is this degree/career switch? I know for a fact it isn't possible in Germany.. which sucks, but until i get my EU citizenship that's kinda life.

Better question, is it necessary at this point? I've never done Leetcode (but have done similar kata type exercises in the past), and when I've looked at some of the problems they seem a little out of my league. Not in concept, when I read the answers I fully understand what's going on, just the way its presented is hard to wrap my head around."

I hope everyone is doing well, given that we are going through a horrible period of time. It has taken me about 8 years to graduate with a bachelor’s degree, but I will finally do so next month! For \~3-4 of those years I was suffering from chronic health issues, preventing me from continuing school, but am finally managing them.

Not the best time to do it for anyone, but I have started applying to jobs. I feel as if I am not fit for any position as I feel weak on nearly all my fundamental CS topics and am afraid of messing up in interviews. To attempt and remediate this I have been working on Leetcode and CtCi problems. My areas of interest are front-end development and Python. During my off time from school due to health I worked on personal projects in these areas and built websites for friends that I have now included on my portfolio website. I have also had an internship for \~6 years as an intern doing geospatial analysis, were I sometimes incorporated the use of my software skills.

To increase my job prospects, I am applying to both front-end and Python job postings. However, I feel that doing this has led me to developing both skills without grasping either very well. Would you all recommend I just focus on the one I am most interested in rather than continuing my current plan?

I had thought about mentioning that I have health problems, will have them for the rest of my life unfortunately, and they could unexpectedly interfere with work. A friend and previous manager stated I should not mention my chronic health issues at interviews since I have a handle on it now and it would only act against me. I wonder if being open about this might do more damage than good?

Thank you all for any advice, stay safe!"

I've only been full time for about a week. I just got a phone call from a different company I interviewed for weeks ago saying I got the job. I have a week to sign the offer letter. I'm not sure what to do especially in the current environment.

For some context, I graduated in December with a degree in Computer Engineering. I stayed on as an intern at my company post-graduation since the department said they couldn't hire me full time but urged me to apply to different departments. I managed to get a job in a different department but the work is not software or cs oriented. However, I have greatly enjoyed the work so far even though I am still in the training phase, and my coworkers are all very nice and patient with me learning the ropes. The other position is for a Software Engineering position at a very well known company, and I know my career will benefit from that. I am mostly afraid of getting my offer rescinded, but I am currently employed at my current company with total security.

I've also been afraid that i might not be cut out for SE since i did struggle in classes in university. i'm very afraid of underperforming at this other job. I am very comfortable with the work at my current job as it is not very difficult, which is fair since the pay is also not as high as what the other job is offering. I'm not sure what route to take right now and could use some advice.

Edit: To add to this, with hearing about all the companies currently rescinding offers after the fact, at what point am I safe and a company cant rescind? I just want to be careful with whats currently happening right now."

My teacher connected me to a local company who offered me an unpaid summer internship. I was extremely suprised and excited that I could even get any sort of offer, as I only started programming at the beginning of the school year. 


Problem is, the company is 30 minutes away. I also make 12 an hour at my fast food job, and usually during the summer I can work around 60 hours per week and make overtime pay. So if I took this internship, the opportunity cost would be thousands of dollars, plus I would have to pay for gas and I don't know if my car would be able to survive that much driving through the whole summer. Driving it on the freeway is very sketchy, it starts making lots of scary sounds. Was planning on fixing it up this summer...


So I'm just wondering would having a unpaid HS internship help me get into college, and get college internships? Would it be worth the money? If the company was close by and I didn't need the money I would definitely take it just for the learning experience alone, but I don't know what to do given the circumstances. Would taking it help me make more money in the future?"

EDIT: [Resume, as requested.](https://imgur.com/a/293FDZN)

I am on the fence with what my next steps should be in attaining a computer-science-related job. I never had a CS job, but I would like one, preferably remotely due to circumstances. An internship is fine too, as long as it makes me more worthy of a paid position.

I am trying to decide if I should continue studying JavaScript (5+ years studying, website portfolio) along with all its frameworks and libraries **OR** if I should start fresh and study Python. I understand the syntax of JavaScript and am most familiar with it, but I am not sure if it's future-proof job wise. My reasoning is that there are more jobs in Python, and it seems a lot more interesting.

**Indeed Job Search Results**

|Search Terms|\# of Search Results|
|:-|:-|
|Python remote|4,375|
|JavaScript remote|2,901|
|Ruby remote|985|

About 5 years ago I hunkered down to learn as much JavaScript, CSS, and HTML as I could. I even went to a coding bootcamp that guaranteed a job and where I was used as an example of a 'great programmer'. **After 300+ job applications (with only one interview that went nowhere and was for SQL) I took a break and thought I was not good enough.** Now I am back at it again.

I would be eternally grateful for any help or advice on what to do. My apologies for typing in caps but I was hoping it would catch your attention. Thank you for reading.

**TL;DR** \- Studied full-stack JS for 5 years. Went to a coding bootcamp. Applied to 300+ jobs. No job. Is JavaScript worth pursuing if I hope to get a CS Career? Or maybe I should start fresh with Python, which shows promising job growth."

The title is an actual statement that my mom actually made. Oh nooo, she says now, the virus is totally real, but only old people get really sick from it and it's no worse than the flu. It's just that, in her words, ""the libtards"" want Trump out of office so badly that they are making the virus out to be an actual fucking pandemic all so they can make the economy tank so that Trump will look bad and not get reelected. 

Like has she not looked at the CDC or WHO or expert epidemiologists or even a single reliable news source and seen the UNDENIABLE exponential growth and the fact that even young, healthy people are getting put on ventilators and sometimes still dying?!?!?!?! And when there is an extremely young case right in front of her face, it's ""oh they probably VAPED."" 

And I also do not appreciate her using the ""-tard"" suffix to make the word ""liberal"" derogatory. People with disabilities do not deserve to have a slur about them used ever for any reason, especially not to refer to what she perceives as an immoral, intellectually inferior group. FUCK that.

And that doesn't even begin to cover my dad. He's ""essential"" so he's still working (which I am economically thankful for don't get me wrong) but he literally BRAGS about the fact that they have thousands of people there every day and he actively tries NOT to follow the 6 foot recommendation out of spite. I mean if one (1) of their thousands of employees gets this virus, BAM that's hundreds if not thousands more cases within weeks, if not days. But this self-important asshole is convinced it's a hoax so 🤷‍♀️.

That's not even the worst part! The news was on today and the reporter said there were hundreds of thousands of cases with many being elderly, and that economically disadvantaged populations were being disproportionately impacted. And this man, I shit you not, says: ""GOOD, then they will be off social security and welfare and not be able to mooch off of hardworking people."" 

He. Was. Being. SERIOUS. When people say that some well-off people genuinely want poor people to die, they are NOT exaggerating. I mean good for him that he lucked into a good job and has succeeded at it, but he talks and acts like he is some kind of god that we should all bow down to because of it.

And THEN the reporter dared to say something about looking into how prepared (or not) the state is for millions more filing for unemployment and he yells ""Just get a job!! Walmart is hiring!!"" I'm at a loss...he can't actually think that Walmart can hire 3.3 MILLION (probably more now) people within the next month? And he can't actually think that an entry level job at Walmart would even begin to support an entire family?

I literally sit there and bite my tongue until it bleeds because I am ""a dumb, entitled Millenial"" (I'm gen Z but it's all the same to them) and since I'm on dad's insurance and I moved back home during college to save money since I can't work my on-campus job anymore I don't have the right to disagree with anything they say. Their house, their opinions only. And I hate how their opinions are rubbing off on my younger sister and how she views people different from herself - I got started down that path, but college opened my eyes, and I can only hope and pray that it does the same for her.

I have considered just moving back into my off-campus college apartment, but I just can't justify spending the money to live on my own when my parents are doing fine and my summer internship will probably get canceled so I'm going to have to scramble to even get something much lower-paying lined up. The only way I'll survive this is by staying away from them as much as possible and plugging my fucking ears every time I hear them talking from downstairs. HOW can they be so ignorant and have absolutely NO compassion? I am confident that the ONLY way they will take this virus seriously is if they get it, or if someone close to them dies from it. And obviously I would rather them stay this ignorant than have that happen.

I'm sure nobody has the time to actually read all this, but I do feel a little better getting it all out somewhere."

There is much room for improvement and I hope this reddit can help. I was wondering what school to transfer to in NYU or what program. What should I improve on and just overall what to do!

I got accepted and plan to go to Fordham University as a comp sci major but im probably going to change that to a undecided major and what is the easiest major to transfer to in NYU."

My major for UCSD is Cognitive science and for UCSB/UCI my major is prebio, however these majors are subject to change. I am having a tough time deciding between the three. Due to this coronavirus I haven’t been able to make any visits so I am still unsure about each school’s environment and campus. I am someone who is serious about my studies but am pretty laid back so i’m also looking for a good social college experience. The campus for UCSD Sixth College and UCI are very nice and pretty new, but the thing that worries me is the social life at UCSD and the diversity at UCI. And the thing that worries me about UCSB is their facilities, future internship opportunities and surrounding town (looks like there isn’t much to do there). I just hope where ever I choose I’ll have a fun time and also be on a path towards future success! Any info will really help me!"

Unfortunately, I'll have to pass a notoriously difficult math course this summer in order to graduate. The difficulty will be exacerbated by the fact that the course is 100% online (due to COVID) and it's been a long time since I've taken one of the pre-reqs. I've never failed a course before, but I'm kind of freaking out now because the stakes are so high. My offer letter states that if my graduation date changes, they will attempt to convert my offer to an internship.

I can choose start dates in September, October, November, or December. I am considering the following options:

1. Select a December start date so that if I happen to fail, I have time to retake the course. The downside is that I'll likely pass my course and then have to wait for 4 months to start working.
2. Select a September start date and deal with failure if it happens. Maybe the company would be willing to accommodate.
3. Ask the recruiter for their advice. I feel silly discussing this with my future employer, but maybe it's for the best?

Any advice is much appreciated."

Me and a friend are picked and I don’t want to talk about how incompetent he is. I got hired. I didn’t know this until l chatted with my supervisor. 
Now for this term, I only got 3 interviews so far and I performed bad. Even for part time jobs, I still failed. I worry about my employment after graduation as an international student. 
Sometimes I don’t even know what I’m talking about. English is not my first language. I didn’t even speak English until I came to Canada. I competed with articulate and smart compsci students. I have so many disadvantages. 
I hope to have the opportunity to talk with natives but people always say it’s hard to make friends in this university. As an Asian man with not so good English, it’s hard for me to make friends. I don’t even have good friends from my own country. I feel discouraged. 
Damn, but I do learn new programming languages on my own. I just finished a full stack project on my own because my partners ain’t doing nothing. I took several crash courses and finished it. I’m proud of myself. I’m not stupid. I hope someone can find my shining points and give me a chance. But I don’t expect more.

so I just started my CS journey this spring semester. I am currently taking intro to CS class taught in Python and Math classes, and a majority of my other CS classes for the next few months will be in Python. The issue though is, I have an opportunity to intern for the company I currently work for as a software engineer in Jan 2021. They only write code in C, C++ or Java, no Python at all and I can't use any of these languages in the program I am in. I have no experience with any of these languages like I said I am new to coding. How do I go about learning a new language outside my new curriculum without sacrificing in-depth knowledge of Python or basically overwhelming myself while in the program since I work full time and go to school full time.  If anyone has had experience doing this, any tips would be greatly appreciated. 

Also what language would you guys suggest I learn first from the 3 (c, c++, Java) mentioned if that ends up being what I have to do?"

I have completed coursework in economics, math, probability, and accounting, but I have no computer science proficiency whatsoever. 


A few questions about computer science and IB:

• How important is it for a university student that aspires to work in IB to be proficient in a relevant programming language?

• For positions that are not explicitly cs-related, how much programming experience are firms looking for? Is basic proficiency in Python or Java acceptable, or are firms looking for more?

• For positions that do not require cs in any meaningful way, will it *still* be more difficult to get a job offer if I do not know cs?

• How much cs, if any, is necessary for sophomore or junior summer internships in roles that do not require cs in any meaningful way?

I am willing to learn cs (I do not have some fervent opposition to it), I just do not know any at this point, and will not get the opportunity to take a cs class until sophomore year.

Thank you!"

fthfyf,1,2020-04-02,Should I follow my ambition despite my worrisome ex?,KomfyKoala,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fthfyf/should_i_follow_my_ambition_despite_my_worrisome/,"Hi Reddit, I created a throwaway account, because I'd like to avoid sharing my potential plans with my ex. If you can't be bothered with the backstory, I'll add a tl;dr at the end of it.   


**The backstory**

To give a little backstory, I was in Australia doing an internship about 3 years ago, I absolutely LOVED it. The city was amazing and I felt at home within the first week. I met a guy there and we started dating. The second week after we had hooked up for the first time, I kissed another guy, which was really messed up and to this day I deeply regret it. However, we talked about it and decided to continue our relationship (which was mostly long distance). Throughout the entire relationship he'd have these switches between being really sweet and complimentary and being really, really mean. He'd judge me for my past before him a LOT, despite me having only slept with 2 people before him and him having a long list of which he lost count and if he wasn't in a good mood, he'd say the nastiest things to me with the only purpose to make me feel like shit, always justifying it with that slip-up I made at the beginning of our relationship. Honestly, I should've left way sooner. Looking back I realize a lot more things than I did during the relationship, he was manipulative, a compulsive liar and a racist. Needless to say, we've broken up now and the break-up did not go down well at all.   


The final things he said to me hurt me deeply, amongst which threatening to share private photos I gave to him (which frankly I never wanted to send to him, but he guilt tripped me into it). Overall he's just an incredibly unpredictable person. He even ended up mass ordering food to my house after we'd already stopped talking (for which you pay at the door in my country) and at one point I had three delivery men at the door from various food places and multiple angry owners calling me not believing my ex from Australia did this to me.   


tl;dr: went to australia for half a year, absolutely LOVED it, started dating a guy, things became nasty and we broke up. 

**The actual ""I need advice"" part**  
So now that that's all behind me, ideally I'd just continue my life here, away from him, away from Australia, but that's where my issue comes in. The place I had my internship at offered me a temporary work visa to come work for them for 2 years and potentially leading to more. After all that went down with my ex, I spoke with them and told them it'd be wiser not to go. My parents weren't too fond of the idea of me going back to that city, knowing my ex is around there too. Understandably, because I'm not too excited about that prospect either. 

However, it's now been almost a year since we broke up and I haven't heard from him since. I work full time in my own country but I just know it's not what I want. Everything in me screams that I want to go back to Australia, to that particular city, because it was perfect for me. Size-wise, temperature-wise and location-wise. The only thing keeping me back being him. 

I think if I were to go back, I'd be able to avoid him for a while and he might not even know I'm back in Australia for the first half year. However, I'm sure he'd find out one way or another eventually and I just have no idea how he would react or behave. I know the safe option is to just make different plans, but I can't seem to let it go.   


I don't really feel like I can talk to many people about this, my friends would all prefer it if I stayed and besides I don't think they fully understand why living abroad is so important to me. My parents are a definite no, considering how they want me to stay and definitely not go to the place where my ex (who they never *really* approved of) is.   


So I was hoping one of you would be able to offer me some fresh insights, because I just can't decide what to do. Thank you so much for reading this."

I'm currently a junior in my spring semester and was wondering if anyone could give some feedback about my chances of acceptances at a couple schools - my top 3 picks right now are Yale, Johns Hopkins, and Vanderbilt. I'm interested in political science for Yale &amp; Vandy, and pre-med/biology for Johns Hopkins.

***Background:***

Female, Chinese American, middle-upper class

I live in Dallas, Texas. I go to one of the best public schools in the Dallas region. We are competitive academically, and have great athletics.

***Course load/Teacher Recs:***

For the most part, I take the most difficult classes my school has to offer. This year, I'm taking AP Chem, AP Calc AB, APUSH, AP Lang, and AP Art History (plus Varsity Tennis).

I will probably get my college recs from my APUSH history teacher (it'll be a great one, we are good friends and I work hard in APUSH and perform well) &amp; my AP Lang teacher (also should be good).

***SAT/ACT/AP Exams/PSAT:***

I've only taken the SAT, and I've only taken it 1 time (August 2019, fall of my junior year). **I got a 1490 (740 Reading &amp; 750 Math)** with pretty minimal prep - I just wanted to take it as a benchmark to see where I could improve. I got a 19/24 on the essay.

I was planning on taking SAT subject tests this coming May, but they got cancelled because of COVID. I am still planning on taking the June SAT w/ essay. I am doing prep, and I am aiming for a 1550.

I've only taken 4 AP Exams my freshman and sophomore year. AP Bio (4), AP Human Geo (5), AP World (4), AP Comp Sci Principles (3). Will be taking 5 AP Exams this spring (coronavirus is making things interesting, though). My score predictions are AP Calc AB (5), APUSH (5), AP Lang (5), AP Art History (5), AP Chem (4). Doing really well in all those classes this year, and I know the material.

Took PSAT 3 times. Freshman yr 1450. Sophomore yr 1450. Junior yr 1440.

***GPA/Rank:***

Our school does GPA on a 100 point scale (+7 for Honors/PreAP and +10 for AP) so I did my best to convert. My unweighted GPA is a 95 ish, **so should be a 4.0**. My weighted GPA is around a 104... no idea what that converts to on the 4 point scale.

I was ranked 21/685. Should be going up after this semester, probably 15/685. Tennis counted into my GPA for 4 semesters (all of freshman and sophomore year) and brought down my GPA considerably.

***Volunteering:***

COVID-19 Projects (Beginning of March 2020-present) --

* Grocery Delivery Service -- I founded a grocery delivery service for seniors &amp; immunocompromised in my city, free of delivery fees. I just started the service a few weeks back and we make deliveries regularly. I was also published in my city's magazine.
* Feeding America's COVID-19 Response Fund -- Fundraised $2000 for Feeding America

TSUP Teaching Assistant (2017, 2019) -- I'm a teaching assistant at a summer camp in China. I've gone twice (2017 summer, 2019 summer). It's 2-4 weeks every summer (around 200+ volunteer hours). We teach English, speech writing, and speaking to kids in cities all across China. 

Tennis volunteering -- I was a Special Olympics tennis volunteer for 2 years, every Sunday afternoon from 2017-2019. Met and got to work with some great kiddos who are so bright and talented. I'm also a tennis camp volunteer every summer (around 20 hours each summer)

UNICEF (2018-present) -- Co-founded the UNICEF club at my school, was Vice President for one year. I'm still in the club and we've done a couple of volunteer events. Our UNICEF club is not very active, though, and we don't meet very often.

Toastmasters Youth Program Teaching Assistant (2018-2019) -- I was a teaching assistant for our city's Toastmasters Youth program (it's kind of like my other teaching assistant position). We work on speech writing, speaking skills, etc.

***Extracurriculars:***  
Varsity Tennis Team -- We placed 3rd at 6A State this past fall. Our tennis team had never made it past regionals, so this past fall was monumental for us. I play in the lineup, both singles and doubles. I'll be team captain next year (my senior year)

\*I also play tennis outside of school. I'm a USTA SuperChampionship level (highest level of junior play in Texas). Not ranked high though

SKIL -- I'm in a city-sponsored program called SKIL. 20 kids (in my grade) from my school get accepted every year (10 girls, 10 boys). We work with the Mayor, Chief Deputy Director, and other city leadership and learn lots about city management, planning, security, etc. I have an ""internship"" with TD Ameritrade through this program - we go every month and spend a day at TD Ameritrade working with employees and learning about their stock brokerage company.

CMA -- I'm in a school program called CMA. Around 50 kids in each grade are a part of this program. We take advanced science courses all throughout high school (I took AP Biology and Honors Medical Terminology my freshman year, PAP Chem and Honors Anatomy and Physiology my sophomore year, AP Chem my junior year, and am going to take AP Physics and Honors Biotechnology my senior year). In CMA, I've had a couple leadership roles and awards -- Freshman Class Rep, Student of the Year, and Volunteer of the Year (twice).

\*I was supposed to have an internship at a medical practice / hospital this summer for CMA, but because of COVID, I'm not sure if that's gonna be possible anymore.

National Honor Societies -- I'm in my school's National Honor Society, National Math Honor Society, and National Social Studies Honor Society. Probably will get a couple leadership roles in those clubs my senior year (we aren't allowed to run for office until then).

Scholastic Writing Competition -- I write a lot of short stories and poetry. I won the Scholastic Writing Competition Gold Key Award for my Poetry collection my freshman year, and moved onto the national competition. I won the Silver Key Award for my Poetry collection my sophomore year, and then this year, I won Honorable Mention for one of my poems. It's not much, but just thought I'd throw that on here.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's it! Thank y'all so much for taking a look, I really appreciate it. Please be honest- it won't hurt my feelings. I just want to be realistic."

I work as a regular backend developer in a small tech startup, under 50 people.

Company's more than capable of providing him with a computer, and we don't have more than 2-3 interns at a time.  


I have a strong feeling that I should raise this issue with management somehow. On the other hand I'm quite afraid that I can create a negative impression - either with said intern, or some other people in the company.  


What's a professional way of handling this issue? Are there any risks, or are they imaginatory? Maybe I should just ignore this?"

I’m a third-year student majoring in CS at UCI. I would like to become a software engineer/ data scientist. I also have a great interest in finance, business management, and stocks. 

I’m fortunate enough to have the tuition fees covered and even get 14k/academic year from grants and scholarships. I’m living with my parents, so my cost of living is not much. According to my plan, I will finish the requirements for my major as soon as June 2021. After that, I have 3 options:

1. I will continue to stay in school for 1 more year to double major in Computer Science and Business Information Management (a combination of business administration and information management courses)

* Pros:

\+ I will have BS degrees in CS and BIM without paying any tuition fees and even get 14k for one year in school.

\+ In that year, I will have time to find internships or part-time jobs to get some savings.

\+ BIM is considered a hot major in my school.

* Cons:

\+ It will cost me 1 more year, and the total is 5 years for 2 degrees in CS and BIM. (My school doesn’t have 4+1 = BS+MS program)

 2. I will graduate with only the CS degree and apply for a master's program.

* Pros:

\+ I will get the MS degree which is also my educational goal.

\+ A master’s degree is the minimum requirement for a career in AI/ML which is my desired field. 

* Cons:

\+ It costs me at least 1.5 – 2 years to finish the MS degree.

\+ In the worst-case scenario (no financial aid, no scholarship), I will have to pay 30k – 50k for the graduate program. I don’t have that much money unless I decide to take out student loans. 

3. I will graduate in the next year and look for a job.

* Pros:

\+ It saves me years in school which means more years of experience in the field.

\+ If I'm able to find a decent job, I can start making money without worrying about student loans.

* Cons:

\+ I will not have a competitive advantage since I only have 1 degree.

In this economic situation. what should I decide? Are there any pros and cons that I have not taken into account? Will the BIM degree benefit me enough to forgo one year of working? The opportunity cost needs to be carefully considered here. 

I would love to hear people’s thoughts about this. Any advice is welcome and appreciated. 

Thank you and stay healthy!

&amp;#x200B;

But when creating a research prototype, none of these architecture seems to help. Usually, I start by creating a python package for say Approach ""A"" for solving a certain problem. I create a bunch of classes, a [utils.py](https://utils.py) module (contains helper functions), and possibly a script or two which uses these classes to accomplish a certain goal. Now, when I create another python package for say Approach ""B"", I find myself importing stuff from Approach A's package. It seems to be violating the software engineering principle of high cohesion and low coupling. What do I do in such an instance?

&amp;#x200B;

There are other problems as well that I face when maintaining research prototypes. Are there some good resources (books/blogs/videos..) on how to keep a clean codebase in research projects?"
ftjzxe,1,2020-04-02,[Career in CS] I need some advice and thoughts about double majoring in CS and BIM.,menk96,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ftjzxe/career_in_cs_i_need_some_advice_and_thoughts/,"Hello everyone, 

I’m a third-year student majoring in CS at UCI. I would like to become a software engineer/ data scientist. I also have a great interest in finance, business management, and stocks. 

I’m fortunate enough to have the tuition fees covered and even get 14k/academic year from grants and scholarships. I’m living with my parents, so my cost of living is not much. According to my plan, I will finish the requirements for my major as soon as June 2021. After that, I have 3 options:

1. I will continue to stay in school for 1 more year to double major in Computer Science and Business Information Management (a combination of business administration and information management courses)

* Pros:

\+ I will have BS degrees in CS and BIM without paying any tuition fees and even get 14k for one year in school.

\+ In that year, I will have time to find internships or part-time jobs to get some savings.

\+ BIM is considered a hot major in my school.

* Cons:

\+ It will cost me 1 more year, and the total is 5 years for 2 degrees in CS and BIM. (My school doesn’t have 4+1 = BS+MS program)

 2. I will graduate with only the CS degree and apply for a master's program.

* Pros:

\+ I will get the MS degree which is also my educational goal.

\+ A master’s degree is the minimum requirement for a career in AI/ML which is my desired field. 

* Cons:

\+ It costs me at least 1.5 – 2 years to finish the MS degree.

\+ In the worst-case scenario (no financial aid, no scholarship), I will have to pay 30k – 50k for the graduate program. I don’t have that much money unless I decide to take out student loans. 

3. I will graduate in the next year and look for a job.

* Pros:

\+ It saves me years in school which means more years of experience in the field.

\+ If I'm able to find a decent job, I can start making money without worrying about student loans.

* Cons:

\+ I will not have a competitive advantage since I only have 1 degree.

In this economic situation. what should I decide? Are there any pros and cons that I have not taken into account? Will the BIM degree benefit me enough to forgo one year of working? The opportunity cost needs to be carefully considered here. 

I would love to hear people’s thoughts about this. Any advice is welcome and appreciated. 

Thank you and stay healthy!

I have an cs/ strategy internship on my campus that I work during Fall and Spring semesters. It’s not the exact field I want but I’m still figuring out what I want to do when I graduate. but it looks good on my resume and I think it helped me get my summer internship ( which sadly got cancelled but not the point) I recently got asked by one of my professors to be a TA for a CS class and I don’t know if I should quit my internship job to do that. I’ve only worked at my internship for sophomore year and I also had a different job on campus during freshman year so I don’t want employers to think I’m jumping around. But I also don’t know because I’m not sure how valuable a TA position as opposed to an internship would look on my resume.  Any advice would help!!

Hi,
I’m a junior living in Dallas, TX. As APP season is just around the corner, I am stressing out if I have what it takes to get into a top tier school.
Can you guys please look at my stats and EC’s and tell me what you think my chances are. 

Intended Major: Biology

Here are some of the schools that I want to go to:
- UCLA
- UT Austin
- USC
- UPenn (maybe)
- Stanford (maybe)
- Rice (maybe)

(this does not include my safety schools)

Background: upper-class Indian American Male

STATS:
- 3.92 UW GPA
- 4.6 (out of 5.0) W GPA
- 1500 SAT
- Top 10% of my class of 500. I go to a really competitive school.
- Not taking ACT
- Planning on taking Math 2 and Bio subject tests after the summer

Total APs in HS (including senior year): 12

ECs:
I mainly focused on two things that I am passionate about: Chess and Medical Field

Chess:
- I play in USCF rated tournaments and won a bunch of tournaments and competitions since 6th grade. I also went to state a few times.
- There used to be a chess club in my school, but burned out due to bad management, so I created my own. My chess club is not an ordinary chess clubs where we just sit around and play chess; I started a system of inter school tournaments in my district and that was a huge success. I also started charity tournaments where everybody pays to join and all the money is pooled to be donated to charity. I also initiated a program where we go to senior care homes and play chess with the seniors as a community service. Recently, I applied for the chess club to become an official US Chess Federation club. And later got a message that it was accepted and now the chess club is an official US Chess Federation club. Starting this chess club is a way of showing my leadership because I was able to change a lot of things and inspire/encourage a lot of people to play chess and share the same passion that I have. I feel like this is better than being elected as a club officer because staring a new club requires more work and shows true leadership.
- Every week I teach chess classes to little kids. I have 12 students and they pay $5 per class. All the money goes towards children’s education in India. 

** The main reason I put a lot of emphasis on chess is because it is something unique and shows my “spike” **

Medical Field:
- I volunteered for a hospital over the Summer and got 40 hours.
- I’m in HOSA
- I advanced to regionals for medical math competitions and dental science comptetions
- I shadow an oral surgeon (the career I want to pursue) and worked with him to create two original projects. One is a website for post-operative surgical care and another is a post-operative protocol for fixed hybrid dentures. These projects will be implanted by his company after a pitch to the board. This shows my passion for the career I want to pursue and that I have made an impact to the field at a young age.
- I applied to a few intern research programs for over the summer.

Other: 
- I have a 150 hours
- In NHS
- In Key Club

Awards: 
-NHS
- Black Belt Dan Certificate
- chess tournament awards (5+)
- Went to state for chess
- HOSA regionals (2)
- AP Scholar

DISCLAIMER: I didn’t say any of this to brag and if it seemed that way I am extremely sorry. Also sorry for any grammar mistakes.

I hope you guys can give me constructive feedback

Thank you

P.S. I don’t really have any sad back stories so this is all I have to work with."

For quick background, I used to be a loser with no real path forward in life. But know I am trying to live my best life. I have a career plan I'm happy with, I'm pursuing my artistic projects (music, writing, artistry,etc.). I am dealing with some financial issues right now but it's nothing I know I can't get out of. Fortunately I'm an intern as a web developer, so being able to work from home has saved me from the recession going on right now.

For some reason though, I still feel hopeless and empty. I'm currently taking anti-depressants, and have seen counselors/psychiatrists before, and am somewhat aware of therapeutic behaviours and have tried to implement them. Listening to Jordan B. Peterson's lectures have helped me a lot in the past. I also don't have any real family issues or childhood traumas. I've been pretty fortunate with the life I've been provided.

Although no matter what, I still feel like it all doesn't justify the shitty decisions I still make, and I'm convinced that even if I make headway with my goals, they will either come crashing down, or something worse will come along to take it's place.

I've even tried seeking God, to see if there's a higher purpose to my life that I haven't recognized, that would make my suffering worthwhile. But no matter how often I call out, he never responds. I'm not sure how much a sentiment like this will click with Reddit's tendency towards athiesm.

I tried short drop suspension about a year ago, and I think I was doing it wrong, because you're apparently supposed to just pass out somewhat quickly, but it wasn't happening to me. So I had let it go and still tried to live my life. This was before I had my life more together.

For the past week or so know, I've been desperately trying again, for many nights in a row. Apparently it's supposed to be painless, but every time I try it, it makes my head pound with pain and I loosen the noose with a pounding pain in my temples. Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong? I've tried it in a various places on my neck and I still get that result.

Tldr: I've tried everything to make my life worthwhile, but no matter what, I still feel like the pain far outweighs the good. I still have many flaws/issues that never go away, or they get worse. Can someone please help me figure out why the short drop suspension method just gives me a massive headache instead of killing me? Or I guess you could give a shot at trying to convince me life is worthwhile. I'll try my best to carefully consider it, thanks."

Could I have some help with this decision?,word_vomiter,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ftqkuu/corona_tanked_my_research_this_semester_could_i/,"I started doing undergraduate research for credit this semester. This seemed awesome as I want to spend my EE career in the design of scientific instruments and my lab builds them to measure aerosols.

I got assigned my work in the beginning of the semester and it becomes apparent that my programming skills are not sufficient for this level of research. I had barely scraped by in my embedded programming course and had had a poor foundation in my community college programming course that covered 25% of the material at the university I attend. 

I was given a new research project that was much more doable from my skill set perspective, working on a temperature controller. Then Corona happened. UG students were banned from labs.

The research involved heating and was unsafe to do outside of the laboratory. She suggested dropping it after safety issues were assessed. After talking with my parents, I asked if I could be assigned an incomplete grade.

She said that if this was to be assigned, I would go back to the original project and I would have to improve my programming skills. I had trouble doing this the summer before retaking the embedded class after withdrawing. I know more programming now and am currently doing it for my senior design but I am still fearful.

I have a summer internship in microwave engineering in my home area. It is 40 hours a week. That would leave my nights for programming but I would also like to enjoy my summer, as it will be my last in university.

I am worried that I will not learn enough over the summer and possibly fail research in the fall. The necessity of  programming for signal processing and data acquisition in instrument development is not lost on me. I just lack faith in my ability to improve quickly this summer while balancing the other facets of my life (play, church, friends, job)."

That being said, I've recently had a pretty difficult time dealing with two major rejections in my own life, and its been brutal for my self esteem. First, I was rejected by a girl that I'd been talking to for a few months who I really liked, and most recently I was rejected from an internship opportunity that I was looking forward to. I've tried to look for any positives from these outcomes, but overall I just feel worthless. Over the past few months I've been making significant progress in overcoming my anxiety and depression, but now I feel like all that is gone, and that my confidence and self-worth have been shattered.

Sorry for the rant, but I just want to know what are some of the ways that you guys cope with rejection?"

I am honestly stuck in a standstill because both seem like such amazing schools with great opportunities. I'd really appreciate any advice/anecdotes/tips, etc.


Some fast facts if they make help: I didn't get *any* scholarships/financial aid for either, I don't really plan on going to parties/rushing but I do want a campus that has a pretty decent social scene. 


**UCI**

**Pros**

*Campus*: looks safe, easy to navigate, has that traditional ""college"" look to it

*Location*: Orange County seems like it has a lot of fun, urban activities. Disneyland/Knotts, night markets, Newport beach, boba, KBBQ, etc. 

*Culture/Diversity*: Irvine itself is a pretty young demographic, pretty Asian. (I'm Asian btw and I feel like the fact that it's both a blessing and a curse to be in a 63% Asian school). Not as cutthroat as UCSD/UCLA/UCB

*Academics*: Strong health/bio and business programs from what I've seen. Engineering department (hey, that's me!) is pretty good. Close to the aerospace industry. 


**Cons**

*Campus*: I couldn't think of a con for it, but let me know if there's anything I should know about the campus!

*Location*: A lot of the activities seems to be ""food"" or ""shopping"" based. I can't afford Disneyland.

*Culture/Diversity*: I'm going to be in the ""Asian Bubble"" which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I've grown up in one so... 

*Academics*: UCI's engineering department is considered less prestigious than UCSD. I don't know if UCI being closer to aerospace industry *actually* gives me a leg up for internships.




**UCSD**

**Pros**

*Campus*: I'm in Sixth College which will be right in the middle of the campus and is going to be brand spanking new. 

*Location*: Lots of outdoors activities. It's only a 10 minute walk to the beach! Zoos, Balboa Park, Legoland (haha), etc. Great tacos! 

*Culture/Diversity*: More diverse than UCI. I'll get to meet a variety of people and learn more about different world views, experiences, etc. The people seem more chill/laidback from what I've seen.

*Academics*: Engineering powerhouse, highly regarded by many. 


**Cons**

*Campus*: It looks kind of drab and unfriendly to me because they tried to make it look ""modern"", Very spread out. 

*Location*: La Jolla is where a lot of retirees are and it's not really a college town.

*Culture/Diversity*: More cutthroat than UCI and it's called UC Socially Dead for a reason.

*Academics*: More cutthroat? I couldn't really think of a con here."

I've had the idea of residing in Canada for a while now and was thinking about future preperations for when it would be feasible for me to achieve this. 

My inital idea was maybe in the coming 2-3 years after my graduate scheme is completed. Assuming i'd be able to save 20% of my income after tax, I would meet the financial requirement for entry (which is what I was most concerned about failing).

I was just wondering if there was anything I could plan/do in the meantime to increase my chances of being accepted on the Express Entry program?

I would be curious to hear from anyone that's been through this process, any advice would be appreciated.

[edit] I thought I should also mention that I have 1yr experience in a Cyber Security related role (internship).

Also the job lined up is with a large global company - it's may be possible to be transfered internally after x period of time, though I would have no idea how the motions for all of that works. Again if anyone has any experience in a similar position, any advice would be greatly appreciated :)"

I am a BS software engineering grad and an intern of now 9 months working predominately with angular, angularjs, and a fist-full of other related web-technologies.  I work for a sector which was originally its own company but had been acquired soon before I was hired.

As my now 'sector' (as I like to call it) navigates it's fit into the family of other sectors and products offered by our now parent-company,  the parent-co decided to close our home office and sever non-essential staffing just 3 months after my hire. Over the last 6 months, I have worked remotely.  Many, many developers have picked up and moved on.  It seems that for them, the writing has been on the walls that an end is in sight... or simply they have found better compensation elsewhere and our now parent-co, (recent owners of a product which has probably not earned it's price of purchase since being acquired) did not feel it necessary to make a reasonable effort to keep them.

But I am still here.

Reason for that, I am sure has much to do with the fact that one of remaining 4 senior devs on the team has been a close friend of mine since childhood.  He is the reason I was hired in the first place.  (not to discredit the additon of my own personal merit until that point.)  He volunteered to burden the responsibility of being my mentor; and he has done so amazingly under the circumstances.

I have learned, and continue to learn a lot.

However, I have always been under the assumption that there just isn't much work to go around.  Other than myself and the other senior devs on the team, much of the labor is outsourced to europe and south america; so as soon as a ticket is up, it is often snatched before I can hit refresh.

My mentor reassures me not to worry and encourages me to participate in self-directed learning. (Don't get me wrong, I LOVE THAT.)

So much exploring of the code-base, documentation, online-tutorials to hone my skills on the tools that we use, etc.

MY QUESTION TO YA'LL:

When the project board is dry, and you've had your fill of endless learning activity for the day-- How can I continue to meet tangible goals.  Small tasks that the team might not even know they need. ?

I am always upfront and let my mentor know that I am available for anything he feels I would be an asset to.  He is also really great at assigning me on tasks and applauds my initiative.  I just want to make sure I am an asset so that one day when the world is no longer on fire, I come out to an employment offer/contract.  Or at the very least, can feel comfortable with the idea of considering/venturing elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, I am enjoying my work and I am getting paid.  I am loving life one day at a time.

Just felt it would be nice to gain a perspective of someone further in their career path than I.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading, I know it was a lot!

Brian

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

As I was writing this, I made a note to formulate my concern appropriately for my next 1:1 meeting with my team manager.  However, the overall up and down nature of team moral has not been lost on him.  I seem to be the only one entirely psyched just to be employed, especially in times like these. "

I asked around from students of both schools to get a feel and really can't decide where I want to go. I came here to try and get some perspective, not necessarily exact answers.

I was recently admitted to Georgia Tech and Northwestern and wanted to know how much of a role college education plays in cs career overall. Georgia Tech is obviously very strong in Computer Science and is a good school overall, but Northwestern is a more ""prestigious"" well-rounded school with less of a focus on computer science. Both schools for me are at least ""semi-affordable"" with financial aid, though Northwestern would allow me to graduate pretty much debt-free and Georgia Tech would probably place me at around $40-50k of debt.

In the hopes of not writing a paragraph, I'll ask a couple questions in a bullet-point format:

\- How much of a role does the school you go to play on your cs career?

\- Can independent projects make up for the difference for ""weaker"" curricula?

\- How difficult would it be to obtain internships for companies that don't directly recruit from these schools?

\- For those that went to college for CS, how valuable is the experience? Do technical schools have a more ""enriching,"" collaborative environment?

\- How valuable is the networking you do in college, CS or non-CS-wise?

\- How much burden does student debt place onto graduates?

\- For those familiar with either of those two schools (or schools like it), what's your overall impressions?

Even a single answer to any of these questions or more insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

And, A big part of me also wants to study business, economics, do some research, etc. and not be a \*full\* Software Engineer for my life, so I'd like to have options. But, Software Engineering is the one constant in my life that I've been interested in and have devoted a lot of time into, so I know at least that it's a safe bet.

Thanks so much."

Does anybody understand the process involved in here? Is there anything I'm doing wrong with my resume?

I've applied to over 250 internships for this summer, and I just can't seem to land one.

Even so, I've gotten interviews with 14 companies this cycle (not necessarily big companies, but I'd honestly take anything), but I just never seem to be able to land an offer. I'm naturally very nervous and not a great interviewer, but I've put a lot of time and effort into improving that, and I thought I was at least a decent interviewer by the latter half of this cycle (actually made it to the final interview a few times), but still nothing.

I know it's a weird time for this and a lot of people are losing their internships, but I'm still just really  worried about what it will mean for my future if I graduate with no internship experience. Is anyone else in the same boat?"

**TL;DR**  
What are topics are an absolute must for a software development internship? Data structures/algorithms? Front/backend web dev? Language variety?  
  
I currently work doing research at my university in which I gather/visualize large amounts of data using Python, which is originally what sparked my interest. This coming summer (providing that we’re aloud to leave our houses by then here in the states) I’ll be working in the computer science department doing research to find better methods of early breast cancer detection using Python and sensors.   

I’m currently entirely self-taught with most of my knowledge coming from Udemy, YouTube, and personal experience.  I’ve recently branched out into both introductory backend and front end web dev with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Flask.  
  
I’m starting to become overwhelmed by how much information it *seems* like I need to know (ex. Data structs and algos, data bases with SQL, various languages, API’s, etc.) and would like some professional input on what’s *actually* expected of an intern.  
  
My situation differs a little because I’m not a CS major, but I’ve had no trouble with the self-teaching process so far.  
  
Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"

Hi,
I’m a junior living in Dallas, TX. As APP season is just around the corner, I am stressing out if I have what it takes to get into a top tier school.
Can you guys please look at my stats and EC’s and tell me what you think my chances are. 

Intended Major: Biology

Here are some of the schools that I want to go to:
- UCLA
- UT Austin
- USC

(this does not include my safety schools)

Background: upper-class Indian American Male

STATS:
- 3.92 UW GPA
- 4.77 (out of 5.0) W GPA
- 1500 SAT
- Top 10% of my class of 500. I go to a really competitive school.
- Not taking ACT
- Planning on taking Math 2 and Bio subject tests after the summer

Total APs in HS (including senior year): 12

ECs:
I mainly focused on two things that I am passionate about: Chess and Medical Field

Chess:
- I play in USCF rated tournaments and won a bunch of tournaments and competitions since 6th grade. I also went to state a few times.
- There used to be a chess club in my school, but burned out due to bad management, so I created my own. My chess club is not an ordinary chess clubs where we just sit around and play chess; I started a system of inter school tournaments in my district and that was a huge success. I also started charity tournaments where everybody pays to join and all the money is pooled to be donated to charity. I also initiated a program where we go to senior care homes and play chess with the seniors as a community service. Recently, I applied for the chess club to become an official US Chess Federation club. And later got a message that it was accepted and now the chess club is an official US Chess Federation club. Starting this chess club is a way of showing my leadership because I was able to change a lot of things and inspire/encourage a lot of people to play chess and share the same passion that I have. I feel like this is better than being elected as a club officer because staring a new club requires more work and shows true leadership.
- Every week I teach chess classes to little kids. I have 12 students and they pay $5 per class. All the money goes towards children’s education in India. 

** The main reason I put a lot of emphasis on chess is because it is something unique and shows my “spike” **

Medical Field:
- I volunteered for a hospital over the Summer and got 40 hours.
- I’m in HOSA
- I advanced to regionals for medical math competitions and dental science comptetions
- I shadow an oral surgeon (the career I want to pursue) and worked with him to create two original projects. One is a website for post-operative surgical care and another is a post-operative protocol for fixed hybrid dentures. These projects will be implanted by his company after a pitch to the board. This shows my passion for the career I want to pursue and that I have made an impact to the field at a young age.
- I applied to a few intern research programs for over the summer.

Other: 
- I have a 150 hours
- In NHS
- In Key Club

Awards: 
- NHS
- Black Belt Dan Certificate
- chess tournament awards (5+)
- HOSA regionals (2)

DISCLAIMER: I didn’t say any of this to brag and if it seemed that way I am extremely sorry. Also sorry for any grammar mistakes.

I hope you guys can give me constructive feedback

Thank you

P.S. I don’t really have any sad back stories so this is all I have to work with."

ftys3a,1,2020-04-02,[LONG] Best friend actually doesn't care about me?,ZandeRainbow,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ftys3a/long_best_friend_actually_doesnt_care_about_me/,"So back in freshman year of highschool, I met my best friend who I now live with and have a career with. We make music together and we're pretty good at what we do. We've played some decent sized shows, and released on some significant labels. We moved out together and surprisingly, our friendship didn't skip a beat. A lot of people comment about how ""living with your best friend might be a mistake!"" but living together has been fun as hell.  
In highschool people would treat us like one person. We had the exact same schedule, sat together in every class, we did group projects together so often that eventually teachers stopped trying to get us to work with other people. More importantly, we dropped half our classes to pursue an internship with local music event companies. By the end of senior year, I was doing all of his homework (because I was good at school and he struggled), I was a speaker at our graduation, and was regarded as many of my teachers' ""favorite student"". Meanwhile we both were so focused on our art, we would hold each other up to such high standards that we would genuinely get upset if the other person even had any games installed on their phone. And this WORKED for us. We made some of our best music, played our best shows, and got all the hot girls into concerts for free bc we knew the venue owners by name.  
Because of our music success and internships - *and his inability to succeed academically*, we decided not to go to college. We moved into a 2 bedroom house with another friend of ours, got favorable day jobs, and made music every second of our day. For me, everything seemed solid, it was only a matter of time before we'd make that one track to grab the attention of the right person, and make a full career out of music. This was the case until we had a casual conversation one night.

I had recently stepped back from the music to build up our social media profiles, press kits, study the industry, etc. In this time, he focused on music as he always did, and naturally got a bit better than me in most places. Eventually I mentioned I was glad he was keeping up on the music, but that I was ready to jump back in and have my creative voice heard. He responded with something along the lines of ""I don't think you're ready to work as hard as me.""

what?

I had just spent some time off building up other essential assets. Was I not working hard?  
This conversation evolved into him claiming he works harder, and likes his own music better. I questioned if he was trying to go solo. He said ""absolutely not"". I asked why he didn't like my music. He claimed I wasn't as good of a musician, he didn't need me, but preferred having me in the project. I was offended to say the least. I was the one who introduced him to releasing music as an artist in the first place. I was the reason we got booked for all our live performances. I had an equal hand in writing our best tracks too, and now he didn't need me?  
Then I started to realize how much I actually did for him. I did all of his homework because he would have failed his classes otherwise. I was the one driving him and his younger sisters to and from school every day because he failed his drivers test twice. I was the one driving around town selling tickets as a promoter so we could get into shows for free. I was the one who got our internship set up. I did the house hunting, wrote his emails and his resume for him, got his job interviews, enrolled us in music programs, set up our photoshoots...  
And now he doesn't need me?

By the end of this conversation, one thing was clear to both of us. I lived my life as one half of ""us"". He lived his life as ""him"", and expected me to do the same. Seems reasonable, but what that means is I was wrong for ever putting in extra effort for his life, with the expectation of anything in return. He never ASKED for me to work on the social media accounts, so he's not required to thank me. He never ASKED for me to do his homework, he would have been fine failing. He never ASKED to become a promoter for all the venues in our city, he would have been fine paying ticket fees for the hundreds of shows we saw.  
But this was not some big emotional *""I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS!""* fight, it felt more like a casual *""btw i dont owe u anything""* comment.

Fast forward about half a year. We're both laid off due to the pandemic. I've stopped making any meals for him or making sure he's eating. When he asks me for help, I tell him to look it up. I have a note in my phone keeping tally of how many times he says ""thank you"". It is consistently blank, as it always would have been. He got upset with me for not trading him my instrument cables because his started to hiss, and he refuses to buy new ones. Last night he kicked me out of our studio mid songwriting session, because he wanted to play video games with his cousin online with the powerful computer, rather than just his laptop. He lays in his bed watching videos about poker on his phone until 4PM, eats ramen twice a day despite our full fridge, and still claims I have no grounds to criticize his work ethic.

Here's where I need advice, what the **FUCK** do I do now? This was our career. We are successful together. We just got a new manager who landed us one of our bucket list gigs. We have an EP out soon with the biggest label we've ever released with. But he's becoming the most difficult person to work with. I can't abandon him because I would lose all of our pending deals, half of our gear, and the only person I've been able to write good music with. Can we be music partners without being friends? Is it a waste of time to try and help him? Did I fuck my life up?"

All 3 of them are state schools but really great state schools. One of them is even T10 for engineering.

Obviously my top choice is the T10 school for the research opportunities, networking and internships but I'm worried that I'll not be able to adapt with the academic rigor of a T10 engineering school. Do you guys think it's better to go to a lower ranked school, hoping that the rigor will be easier? Maybe I'll get the big fish small pond effect.

For context, I'm thinking of majoring in ME and my stats are mediocre at best for an engineering student especially considering that I'm a male international Asian in STEM.

Thanks."

a. A beautiful campus and a beautiful city. I should settle in Santa Cruz, CA after I retire.

b. Better in prestige. It is a UC.

c. Lots of tech internships available since it is the closest UC campus from Silicon Valley.

d. Cheaper, I got around $7K including In-state and FAFSA discounts.

e. UCSC Engineering school teaches a good computer game design programs, which is exactly the field that I want to study in college.

UCSC Cons:

a. I live in Southern California, which is 5 hours away from UCSC. Because of that, my parents cannot assist me whenever I need help. Plus, I cannot renew my health insurance since I registered my health insurance in LA County. Without insurance, I will not be able to receive medical treatments whenever I need to.

b. It is a UC so academically challenging.

&amp;#x200B;

Chapman Pros:

a. Pretty close to where I live. More parent assist.

b. Located in a nice neighbourhood in Orange County. I should settle in Orange County after I retire, too.

c. Smaller class size and more support since it is a private school.

Chapman Cons:

a. Expensive, I got around $25K including FAFSA discounts but my parents said that they can pay all my tuition for Chapman.

b. Way low prestige compared to many UCs.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents want me to go to Chapman, while all other adults I know believe that UCSC is a better choice for me. My heart is at UCSC right now though I still want to receive medical insurance in college."

i’m a first-year studying cs trying to get an internship for this summer. i reached out to the founders of two small tech companies in nyc through my hs alumni network and have yet to receive responses from them. it’s been around a week. should i bump them or would that be deemed inappropriate? if i were to follow-up, i’d note that i’d be happy to work for free (both pay min wage but i don’t want financial reasons to prevent them from hiring me, especially given the impending recession). more generally, is it inappropriate / worthwhile to ask for summer internships during this time especially since many are getting canceled? 

there are more people i could contact (start-ups + financial/investment banking firms, tho im sig more into tech) but i’m hesitating due to the current pandemic. i think that realistically i’ll have to stay home all summer. i’ve got a few projects in mind though that i want to experiment with - what did you guys do during summer leading up to sophomore year?"
fu0z99,0,2020-04-02,Help please! USC vs UT vs Northeastern for Business,texangirl101,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fu0z99/help_please_usc_vs_ut_vs_northeastern_for_business/,"Hi everyone! I'm a current senior from Texas (peep the user). As you could probably tell from the title of this post, I am choosing between 3 colleges: University of Southern California, University of Texas Austin, and Northeastern University.  


A few things about me: I am a business major with premed (I want to own my own practice one day), but I am not 100% set on medicine. There is a chance I will want to change this later down the road because I don't know if I can stomach medical procedures.  


USC: Pros = I really like USC because I feel like there are a lot of valuable connections there, the campus is gorgeous and has lots of school spirit, there are small classroom sizes with a great business program, and lots of help for internships, jobs, etc. from the college itself. Cons = However, you are kind of stuck on campus. 

UT: Pros = I really like UT Austin because it is close to home (this is also a con), its business program is great, and I love my home city. Cons = However, I am not in Honors and there is a sink or swim vibe since it is a public school (which may be beneficial in the future when you have to vie for yourself anyway). 

NEU: Pros = I really like NEU's co-op program, Boston, and I am in Honors. Cons = However, I've heard NEU is a commuter school with few parties/school spirit, very few people graduate in 4 years (which isn't great if I want to go to med school or get an MBA), and I've heard you have to fight with other Boston college students (like from MIT, Harvard, etc) for internships. Although, another thing to consider is that the co-op program may allow me to decide between business and medicine.  


With UT as a baseline (since it is cheapest), USC is about $40-50k TOTAL more than UT and NEU is about $25-30k TOTAL more than UT (and that's IF I graduate in 4 years with 2 co-ops, which honestly I've heard isn't likely).  


Are there any other things I have failed to consider? Which would be most beneficial in the long run (especially in recruiting)? My parents are trying to leave it up to me, which honestly makes the decision harder. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

Ranked 3rd best high school speaker there. Received most outstanding student and integrity award at my school in 10th grade. Service award from a congressman in the states for some online journalism I did. Also wrote a national level business award (kind of like FBLA/DECA to my understanding)

**Extracurriculars** (as I wrote them in the app, can't be bothered to write down all the times but I invested a lot of time into these things):

1. National Debate Team (12)

Selected as one of the final five to represent Team (My Country) at (Competition Name) in 2020. Training every week to the competition day.

2. Student Government - Class Rep in Junior, Vice President in Senior(11,12)

Established school's core values as the representative of the students to be taught school-wide and to parents and reopened negotiations for a lock-in (bit of awkward phrasing now that I look at it)

4. Internship for small NGO throughout summer before senior year focused on helping unwed and single moms (12)

10. Big Brother Program (10,11)

Selected to mentor maladjusted elementary students through teacher recommendation. Led them in socialization, education, and cooperation with others

**Subjective:**

I don't like rating my own LORs : /

Teacher LOR: I sucked ass at science, I would go to help from my science teacher almost everyday. She's written incredibly positive things about me in her report card comments. On the contrary, since I was pretty good at history, I would never go to my history teacher for help. But he wrote about my talent in history and active participation in class, so I would say it showed my aptitude for social science.

Supplemental LOR: Got an outside recommendation from my debate coach who has seen my debate career grow since 7th grade.

Counselor LOR: I don't expect anything good. Counselor came at beginning of senior year and didn't get to know a lot of us.

**Interviews:**

So I didn't get a  lot of interviews. Got only four. Georgetown Princeton UPenn and Brown. I didn't really vibe with my Penn interview, but I think I absolutely killed the other ones. The interviewers all ended with saying something along the lines of ""I strongly hope you get in, you're a great candidate"" It made it more painful to know I got rejected from all of them :,)

**Essays (Oh boi):**

So essays.... Looking back I have quite mixed feelings about them. Idk they feel quite generic? Perhaps there could have been more spark I could have made.

My main essay was about my background as a kid who grew up without a father. No formal divorce, he just left us one day and never came back. Talked about how that impacted me as young kid. I didn't know what it meant when other kids said they had a father to hang out with or to play sport with. I thought I was ""special"" when I was younger cuz I thought my mom gave birth to me asexually (lol). In high school, I volunteered at a place that required me to interact with other kids who also didn't have dads. I quickly became a mentor of sorts for them. I figured out later that what made me distinct wasn't my conception, but rather the fact that I was able to connect with them instinctively and understand their hardships. A lack of a father figure was what made me be able to grow into one. 

Supplements ranged from my experiences teaching debate at school, debating, my internship, why school and why major, and other random things, but it was mostly centered around the first three and my motivations on why I wanted to study what I wanted to study.

Ivy Day definitely stung, but I was able to get over it. My dream school was Yale, and it hurt to get rejected. A lot of people had high expectations for me (which I really don't like because situations like this happen) and it just made it a lot worse when I had to let them down. But I'm still thankful I got great offers nevertheless. I'm going to pursue Stanford's waitlist for now and I'll see what happens. But until then, I'm currently stuck between Duke and Williams. The process has definitely solidified what I wanted to do in college, and that is one thing I'm grateful for.

SAT IIs (idk if they give any credit): 800 math 2, 790 physics, 740 lit

With that in mind, is 3 years possible for me? I am planning on doing either CC or freshman edge over this summer as well, in order to get ahead. I will try to do internships over the summers, (besides this one, my internship got cancelled cuz of covid-19) so i may not be able to do summer sessions to get ahead. If i dont manage to land any internships though i will definitely spend that time on classes.

What path should i take if i wanna wrap up in 3 years? What are some of the big disadvantages of doing so?

Also semi-related question: my friend whos a freshman at ucla is taking their equivalent of compsci 161. Is it at all possible for me to take cs161 as a freshman at uci?"

I was wondering if anyone is thinking similarly. I didn’t get an internship this summer and I’m kind of thinking with everything going on that it may be better to just give up searching for an internship for the summer and concentrating on building my resume and technical skills (shaking off the rustiness, maybe picking up Java, getting comfortable with interview/whiteboard coding) to start searching again in the fall. I got some interviews but I didn’t really do particularly well on any of them and so it kind of feels like a futile search at this point. What do you guys think about that? Anyone in the same boat?"

fu8tf2,38,2020-04-03,Pros of quarantine: Seeing less of your peers can be a good thing,umdcsguy,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/fu8tf2/pros_of_quarantine_seeing_less_of_your_peers_can/,"I miss my friends on campus, but to be honest I'm kind of glad not to be surrounded by other college students all the time. CS is a pressure cooker. The classes are hard, but if you want good job and internship opportunities then it's not enough to do well in your classes. You need to develop projects on your own time and practice algorithm questions on your own time. 

Let's say that you feel like it's impossible to do everything listed above during the school year. Your peers are. You'll never be able to shake the feeling that no matter how much you do, you're doing less than your classmates -- there's always someone getting better scores on exams than you, getting more prestigious internship offers than you, working on cooler projects than you, all while they're partying more than you.

You know it's just noise, but it's impossible to tune out. You inevitably end up *constantly* comparing yourself to your peers, and rediscover time and time again that you're falling behind. Social media (LinkedIn is to career-oriented college students what Instagram is to teenage girls) only makes the problem worse. Pretty soon, your primary goal in life is to beat your peers, or at the very least to avoid losing to them in a particularly conspicuous fashion. You lose sight of all of the things about your field of study that were once meaningful or transcendent to you.

This feeling isn't rational, but it's safe to say that if I feel it then a lot of other people feel it. I'm not a bum by any means -- &gt;3.5GPA, good internships, some decent projects, have a good social life. People who have been less successful (as defined by conventional standards) than me must feel this more strongly than I do. Can't imagine this is limited to CS either. It's probably at least as bad as this for premeds, business majors, prelaw students, or anyone else on a preprofessional track.

One of the major pros of quarantine so far is that I spend less time talking to other CS majors. I spend more time learning at my own pace and working on things that are truly meaningful to me. Just wanted to let anyone else who has a small part of them that is kind of relieved by quarantine know that they have company."
fuadyz,0,2020-04-03,"Help Me Decide My College (UChicago, NU, UF, Gtown, etc.)",Gildaniel2002,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fuadyz/help_me_decide_my_college_uchicago_nu_uf_gtown_etc/,"My studies/career goals: I want to study finance as my major in college for sure. At the moment I plan on doing finance for 4 years of undergraduate, go to an MBB Consulting Firm, eventually a MIT Sloan, Stanford, or HBS for my MBA, and finally end up in Venture Capital in Boston, LA, or the Bay Area. In addition to finance, I would like to do a minor in computer science or cognitive science for professional reasons, and fashion design or food science for personal reasons.

Finances: I did file for financial aid everywhere I applied and unfortunately was not rewarded any need based aid. I received some merit scholarships, but no full rides. My family is on the higher side of income, so I wasn’t expecting much anyways. I have a couple outside scholarships totaling $5500. I live in Florida, so I also have the highest level of Bright Futures and Florida Prepaid.

Campus and Social Life: I am a more social guy for sure. I like doing things out a lot and talking with people. It’s difficult for this category cause I find myself attracted to not the frat, football, and going out lifestyle of a large public school, but also the going out to eat and longer more relaxed conversations found at my academically focused private schools. I am definitely looking for a traditional campus with lectures halls, courtyards, and nice looking buildings.

People: Of course coming from Florida, I will already know I lot of people going to Florida and Florida State, which is nice having a preset group of people I like/can room with, however the opportunity to reinvent myself somewhere new is appealing.

Location: I am definitely a city guy, but college towns are interesting to me too if they have some of the resources I am looking for. I like art, exploring, cooking, and restaurants. Music, concerts, clubs, and festivals would be a nice bonus. I live in a pretty warm climate, so I know the cold might be a tough transition. Most importantly I would like the opportunity to do internships in a reasonable distance from my campus in my related business fields. 

Study Abroad: I know nowadays it seems as though everyone has the same study abroad opportunities, but just to say it, I am particularly interested in Zurich, Singapore, Oxford, Japan, and South Africa.

The Overall Question in my mind: At which of my options will I find academic and career opportunities to reach my high goals while providing me with a strong social balance at a price that is easy to pay off now or could help me easily pay it off in the future with it’s opportunities?

With that being said, my options are as followed:
1. The University of Chicago - 45k over 4 years.

2. Georgetown University- No Scholarship 

3. Northwestern University- No Scholarship

4. Northeastern University Honors Program - 35k a year

5. University of Florida - No Scholarship (But is basically free with bright futures and prepaid).

6. Florida State Honors Program - 10k over 4 years (Basically free with bright futures and prepaid).

7. Fordham- Full Tuition Scholarship

8. University of South Carolina Honors Program - Instate tuition reduction + 8k a year."

Now I’m stuck deciding which one I should attend and it’s so hard because there are different qualities I like about all of them. I’ve kind of narrowed down my top options based on financial aid so I’m currently deciding between Ga Tech, Notre Dame, UChicago, and Rice.

Major: Neuroscience (not certain)
Pre-Med
Feel free to give me any input on my other options -Fordham, Emory, Furman, Northwestern

Georgia Tech
Pros:
* In my home state- more familiar surroundings and weather plus I’d be able to visit home more often
* Full tuition covered so cost is about $19k
* I know people going there 
* I’d have a lot of AP and IB credits transfer 
* Lots of internship opportunities 
Cons:
* This year they had issues with dealing with Covid-19 so this may a bad sign 
* Lots of students graduate in 5 years which is worrisome 
* Have to declare my major as a freshman so there’s less room to explore
* I know people going there (a double edged sword because I don’t want to be stuck and I’ve heard a lot of hs groups stick together) 
* Really focused on engineering and CS
* Food sucks and housing isn’t great

Notre Dame
Pros:
* Apparently 85% of pre meds get into med school which is nice to hear
* I’m Catholic so it’d be easy to grow my faith, plus emphasis on community service
* Good financial aid (my cost would be about $20k)
* My only option that has a good football program and culture- seems like fun
* I think its workload is the most manageable out of all my options
* I like the minor options
Cons:
* Never visited
* Small town so I’m worried about internships and involvement in health care 
* Not used to the weather
* I know the least about this school as I kind of applied on a whim

UChicago
Pros:
* I really fell in love with the campus and it’s overall feel over the course of applying
* I like the core and it seems like there is a lot of room for exploring what I truly want to study 
* Big city to explore plus lots of student perks 
* Good fin aid (my cost would be $18-$19k)
* University scholarship + Deans scholar award (gives me $5000 to fund internship, research, etc)

Cons:
* I feel like I’d have imposter syndrome and it seems really intense especially with the quarter system
* Very far from home- would make my family sad and i may get homesick
* Not used to harsh cold weather 
* They assign dorms and roommates which is stressful

Rice
Pros:
* My OG dream school- after visiting I fell in love + good opportunities for pre med since it’s next to largest medical center in the world 
* Everyone knows this is my dream school so it’d be hard to explain why I’m not going 
* I’m used to the hot and humid Southern weather (although I will admit it’s a diff type of heat than Atl)
* I love the residential college system and student life seems A+
* I have family in Houston so I wouldn’t be completely alone

Cons:
* Fin aid wasn’t close to what I was expecting (my cost is about $30k)
* Imposter syndrome seems big here
* Very far from home- farthest out of my options"

What should I do to keep learning and become a good candidate,mbdavid297,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fueemd/i_feel_stuck_and_want_to_get_better_and_cs_to/,"I'm a recent CS graduate (graduated last July) from Spain. I did an internship during my last semesters at a local consultory and after graduating I started working at a govn research institute in the field of space research (it's CS, in particular AI, but applied to space). I'm very happy because I love the field and because I'm learning A LOT (like way more than during my degree) but I feel like if I don't do something I'm gonna be stuck here for a while (I don't mean this job in particular, but in general), and I've also always wanted to work in another country.

For a while I've had a more ""relaxed"" mentality of ""I'm just gonna work for some smaller companies and not worry about all these insane leetcode stuff going on in order to get into a big N"", but I've had this feeling growing for a while and I don't want to stay here and be such a conformist. I also want to end up in the big tech scene at North America, I know it's gonna be incredibly hard to get into a big company (getting in + visa problems) but I wan't to try nonetheless.

So, how should I go about this? Obviously apply apply and apply (North America and also at NA companies here in Europe), but besides that I feel like having that ""comformist"" mentality hasn't helped and I want to fix that and become a better candidate.

What do you think are some things one should do to keep up to date with the sector and keep growing and becoming a better candidate? Below is an example list of the first possibilities that come to mind.  Obviously if time allows I would try to do most of them but if I were to prioritize, which would you say are most relevant and will prove to be more useful in the future (of these and any others that you may suggest):

\- Start doing Leetcode stuff (I would have to look into this because I'm not even sure about what it is about smh)

\- Taking Coursera courses (like the ML one, I've always been interested in it)

\- Contributing to open source projects

\- Getting some of the books I see recommended here often (stuff like ""cracking the interview""

\- Working on some personal projects? Perhaps trying to start something with some CS friends?

Thanks for the help and happy coding!"

fuf05n,5,2020-04-03,I'm crushed cuz I think I kept Mum's hopes up and disappointed again,cassienutcracker,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/fuf05n/im_crushed_cuz_i_think_i_kept_mums_hopes_up_and/,"Hi! I need to get rid of this feeling, it's not ranting as this is something I personally don't know how to settle and I don't feel pissed about it. I just needed some advice to live while bearing weight lighter than how it is now. I think it's guilt, but I let you guys decide. I'm fluent in English so do correct me if I've made any mistakes. It is long so bear with me. TLDR at the bottom.

Background:

In diploma, I'm currently in the final year, in fact, I've just received an email on graduation notice recently. In the final year of diploma studies, local universities will start giving pamphlets and advertisements in mails and school roadshows, as well as opening up their applications for diploma students.

The good thing about a diploma is that students are exposed to the work culture as they have internships in the final year. Diploma graduates are competent to start working full time but just lower paygrade as degree holders. So it is not necessary to go to university after diploma, it depends on the student's own choice.

There are many reasons for a diploma graduate not to go to university, it can be money issues or taking a break from study first, or lack of motivation hence the break time, or even just want to start earning money.

Story:

Last year, my mum talked to me about my future, I initially told her, despite being in IT studies now, I might not pursue that in the future, as I'm interested in law, I might take that IF when graduation comes and I want to go university. She sounded very proud of me as I am making my own decisions. But she kept it somewhat low as I've also said not to say too much as I might want to work first.

January came, I went to research on the local universities to see how each school offers their law courses and the amount of compatibility needed from my current study. I narrowed down on one school that has a really good range of offers. Coincidentally, I have a colleague (part-time job) that is about to enroll in a law course in that same school, so I approached him for advice.

After the interaction and consideration, I've decided that since I'm starting to not have the motivation to continue study yet, I will take a small break and work first. I told my mum everything. She was disappointed, but I kept firm and said that it's my decision and hopes that she can respect it. She mildly accepted it but it was obvious she is upset. She talked to me about my initial ambitions on going to university after I graduate from diploma studies. I just took it in, as talking back is rude.

From then till early March, there were letters about that one school I was looking at. The school letters came 3 times in the span of 2 months, it's just an invitation to apply to their school. No specific reserve or anything, it's commonly seen as a ""welcoming"" sign. My mum was so happy as I have received an invitation to apply.

I was definitely tempted to give it a shot despite a low 3 GPA and decent English (Law courses requires proficient English), but I stood my ground, it can be a chance for me, but I find that if I really were to get accepted, I will not be ready. I told mum I won't go for it. She went a good round of talks about how my older siblings got degree certs and law is good, why don't I go for it, its a waste of opportunity and other Asian mum excuses anyone can think of.

I snapped, I told her I have 0 motivation to study now, if she forces me to study, she can see me dropping out in a year, and that will waste her money. I won't study when I don't have the motivation to. Also, I am willing to work first, if I get my pace and motivation to study, I will apply for it myself.

I felt guilty for standing my ground like that, but it's my very first step in making my own decisions so I am proud. But as the days pass, my mum got agitated at me easily, the applications are closing and I'm not making my move to apply at all. I told my sister, she supported my decisions, my brother with a degree cert also asked me what I wanted, I lay it out for him, he respected my choice.

My mum had no choice but to accept it since I am making my own life decisions. She might not be able to let go of the fact that her youngest child has grown older, but she has to let me go eventually. Now that it seems to have come down to a proper consensus, I suddenly feel very heavy and felt like every day is a torture whenever I see my mum, her disappointment is buried deep into my memory and when I am proud to stand up for myself, I can't bring myself to feel happy.

How do I get rid of this feeling? It's the opposite of how I should feel...

If there are any questions, I'll answer them to my best ability.

TLDR: Diploma graduates can either start working full time or pursue a degree. University law course I'm looking at has been sending me letters. I've talked to my mum about it. I plan to work first then eventually find the motivation to continue to study. My mum's disappointment (guilt trip?) loses out to my firm decisions, I am proud of standing up for myself but I can't bring myself to feel happy with the heavy feeling I have now. Please help."

After going there and learning about the program I found out only one faculty member has the kind of background I have. I am happy to venture in other backgrounds. I was just surprised a lot faculty in the program are more of a Molecular Biology  background (wet lab). I really want to do academia in the future and I want to help Merced expand in terms of Bioinformatics and other quantitative biology programs wether it is adding new courses or sharing my experience with others. I have some industry experience through internships as well. Any ideas on how can I contribute those skills to the growth of the program and myself?

I’m a Lab Technician in the herpetology department; that’s the branch of zoology that studies amphibians and reptiles. I’ve been working at this lab for about a year, now, having graduated from College of Charleston with a degree in Biology a couple years ago. I’ve also been in a relationship for a couple years. I met her my senior year of college. Lately, it’s been… okay. The passion’s gone. I find myself gravitating more toward adult sites than the bedroom. 

Anyway, the lab tech gig has been a great job and I spend a lot of time working under Dr. Connors, a zoologist with a very strange job title. He’s a snake milker.

If you don’t know what a snake milker is, it’s basically a person who wrangles highly venomous snakes and extracts the venom from their fangs. The venom is then used to make antidotes for the snakes’ bites. 

As you might expect from someone with that sort of job title, Dr. Connors is an… interesting fellow. He’s a middle-aged guy with round, thick glasses and a bald head and tan skin like leather. I enjoy his stories of snake wrangling and wilderness exploration. He used to be out in the field much more often, channeling his inner Steve Irwin (RIP, you wonderful man). The story that struck me most—as it would anyone else—was about the time he got bit by a Black Mamba.

When he was 30 years old, Dr. Connors set out to photograph and catalog various snake species across the globe for his comprehensive science book about reptiles. You can actually buy the book, now, but for the sake of protecting Dr. Connors identity and the reputation of our lab, I’m neglecting to share a link.

Anyhow, Dr. Connors was somewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa in search of a Black Mamba. They needed original photographs, something hi-fi, something awesome. They soon found a burrow where a 14-footer was coiled up. They drew it out of its burrow and into the field, and the thing went nuts. If you’ve never seen a black mamba being aggressive, it’s a terrifying sight. The front third of its body rears up and it moves with incredible speed, 12.5 miles per hour when they need to. Dr. Connors and the crew had the intention of wearing it out to the point that they it would be still and they could photograph it. 

I’ll never forget how Dr. Connors described it; this black mamba was quicker than he’d anticipated and, with its fangs bared and its hood up, lunged at Dr. Connors and sunk its fangs into his leg. Blood spurted out from an artery that the fangs had penetrated.

Now, you already know that Dr. Connors survived the incident, but what you likely never would have guessed is that he survived without treatment. There weren’t any hospitals nearby, but even after 3 hours (pretty much the maximum length of time before a black mamba bite kills you) Dr. Connors was fine. Most of the crew agreed that it was either A) a “dry bite,” in which a snake’s fangs do not inject venom, or B) spurting blood from Dr. Connors’ artery had expelled the venom. But Dr. Connors had another hypothesis, a hypothesis that I believe is correct. Since he first began handling snakes in college, Dr. Connors had been micro-dosing snake venom to develop an immunity. Now, he claimed, his blood was “snake-proof.”

When he first told me this, I told him there was no way. That’s when he showed me. He took me to a room tucked in the backend of the lab, and he uncaged an African water cobra, one of the most venomous snakes in Africa. Before I could even ask what was going in, he placed his forearm right in front of its fangs and it bit him. I still remember my knee-jerk reaction, which was to shout “What the fuck?!” at the top of my lungs. My eyes were so wide I’m surprised they didn’t pop out. Dr. Connors just smiled and placed the snake back in the cage. He told me not to call 911 but I ignored him and did it anyway. Turned out, there was no need. He was fine.

I thought this was some sort of trick. He invited me to examine the bite marks on his forearm. There were two pairs of bite marks; the thing had bitten him *twice* and I hadn’t even noticed when it happened. No way they were both dry bites. What had happened defied all logic, but as a scientist, I had to accept the facts as they’d so clearly been presented to me. Dr. Connors… one crazy bastard.

Having a snake-proof immune system is all well and good, but lately, I’ve been worrying about Dr. Connors. He recently went through a nasty divorce with his wife; she took the house, the kids, the whole nine yards. We’ve all heard that story before. Rumor had it that Connors wasn’t a blameless victim, though. He’d allegedly been hooking up with one of our college interns, who cut things off not because he was married, but because of his “kinks.”

Anyway, the past couple of weeks, I kept noticing that Dr. Connors would stay at the lab later and later. When I would leave work, I would ask him if he was leaving too, to which he would always reply by saying, “Right behind you.” I chalked it up to him throwing himself into his work as a way to deal with the pain of the divorce, so I wasn’t too concerned at first (there are certainly more destructive ways to deal with a divorce). But then, I noticed the snake bites.

The bites started to show up on his arms, which were usually hidden by his lab coat, but I noticed a few of the bites one time when he rolled up his sleeve to give his arm an itch. They started showing up in other areas; his wrists, his palms, and even his neck. He tried covering the bites with makeup as though they were hickies, or something. 

Then came the fateful evening, the evening I’ll never ever forget. I was about to leave work and was halfway out the door when I thought of Dr. Connors. Curiosity got the best of me and I went looking for him. I mean, was this guy really sitting around the lab at night, allowing snakes to bite him? Were these the “kinks” that had caused that college intern to ghost him?

Connors wasn’t in his office. I kept searching and eventually I heard some grunts and moans from the down the hall. They were coming from the room where we keep the snakes. As I got closer, the moans grew louder. I couldn’t decide if the moans sounded more like somebody who was getting stabbed or like someone who was getting off. It was a strange blend of the two. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to proceed, but I did.

I opened the door and saw something I never thought I’d see. There was Dr. Connors, in the middle of the room, leaning his back up against the side of a table, six different snakes clinging to various parts of his body with their fangs. He looked like some tentacled creature. His head was tilted back and he was groaning, his face looking like he’d bit into a lemon. I shrieked like a little girl and ran out of the room and dialed 911.

I visited Dr. Connors in the hospital, the next day. I expected him to be in horrible shape, but when I entered the room, he was beaming at me. His skin—which I’d expected to be pale as paper—looked healthy and full of color, rid of any and all blemishes. His mood was better than I’d ever seen it, even better than when I’d first met him. You would think he had just one the lottery. I asked him what was going on.

“Curtis,” he said. “Last night… I went somewhere, somewhere I think I always knew existed, but never thought of going to until recently.”

“What are you talking about?” I asked.

“Listen to me. I always knew there was something special in the venom of those snakes. Something forbidden. Each and every time I was bitten, I felt it stronger and stronger. And then, last night, I knew I was so close and I couldn’t take it anymore. I brought myself to the limits. Well, close to the limits, anyway.”

He was talking different, now, like some Ancient Greek philosopher. 

“I don’t understand,"" I said.

Dr. Connors took my hand and grasped it gently in both of his. His hands were so warm, but not feverishly so.

“Last night,” said Dr. Connors, “I was filled with the venom of those five snakes. It was a perfect volume, just *barely* a level that my immune system can handle. See, I don’t even remember you finding me. I don’t remember the ambulance arriving. I don’t remember any of it. Their venom, it took me somewhere else. I was with her.”

“Who?”

“The great goddess, Renenutet. Oh, Curtis, she is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. Her hood and her shining scales and her magnificent physique. My word, I’ll never know the pleasure of another single thing on this Earth, because it all pales in comparison to her.”

“Where were you?” I asked.

“I was in her realm,” said Dr. Connors. “I was in a realm that few have entered. The only bad part… was leaving. Oh, and the women! You should have seen them, Curtis. She brought me my very own brothel of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen, more beautiful than the most beautiful woman on Earth. Goddesses in their own right. Oh, it was glorious. If I’d known the best years of my life were through those serpents in our lab…”

“Wait, doctor. You were only out for one night.”

“No, no. For you, maybe. For me, it’s been *years*. Years and years of limitless heaven, limitless pleasure, boundless gratification. My nerve endings grew nerve endings of their own. And now…” His face sank. “…I’m back here, in this dreadfully boring world. No matter, though. I’ll go back.”

“I’m not sure they’ll let you go back to the lab for a -

“I’m going back!” Connors hissed. He was suddenly like Golem with the ring. He’d been corrupted. He was right about one thing; a man like this could *not* live in our society, or in our world for that matter.

It wasn’t even a full 48 hours before we found him in the back of the lab again, this time with a dozen snakes clinging to him by their fangs. The EMT’s weren’t fast enough, and he went into a coma. 

While he was in his coma, something happened that basically proved everything he had told me. The doctors were baffled by Dr. Connors’ brainwaves. His pleasure receptors were off the charts. 

\*\*\*

I enter my apartment. My girlfriend calls my name from the bedroom. She’s about to give me pity sex. Starfish position, that’s what I call it; she lays sprawled out, frozen in place, just waiting for it to be over. What she doesn’t know is that I always want it to be over, too.

I tell her I’ll only be a minute. I go to the bathroom and lock the door and set my duffel bag down on the toilet. A light but aggressive *hissssss* emanates from the bag. I unzip it and gaze down at the King Cobra that is coiled up inside. I pull out my phone and dial 911.

“Nine-one-one,” says the operator, “what’s your emergency?”

“I’ve been bitten by a snake,” I say. “I live at 6205 [omitted], apartment 303.” 

“Okay, sir, what kind of -

I set the phone down in the sink. Response time is pretty good around here, plus I’ve been micro-dosing venom for a while now. I should be fine.

The road to the great goddess, Renenutet, begins here. I put my hand in the bag and await the bite."

------------------------

Post anything related to recruitment advice, company / group research, or general insecurity in here. 

**If asking for feedback, please provide...**

a) the type of consulting you are interested in (tech, management, HR, etc.)


b) the type of role (internship / full-time, undergrad / MBA / experienced hire, etc.)

c) geography


d) résumé or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.

Misusing or trolling the sticky will result in an immediate ban.

**Common topics**

a) How do I to break into consulting? 

 * If you are at a target program (school + degree where a consulting firm focuses it's recruiting efforts), join your consulting club and work with your career center.
 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through target program undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  
 * Experienced hires do happen, but is a much smaller entry channel and often requires a combination of strong pedigree, in-demand experience, and a meaningful referral.  Without this combination, it can be very hard to stand out from the large volume of general applicants. 

b) How can I improve my candidacy / resume / cover letter?

 * [Read wiki on what firms look for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/lookfor)
 * [Read wiki on resumes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mcresume)
 * [Read wiki on cover letters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mccoverletters)

c) I have not heard back after the application / interview, what should I do?  

 * Wait or contact the recruiter directly.  Students may also wish to contact their career center.  Time to hear back can range from same day to several days at target schools, to several weeks or more with non-target schools and experienced hires to never at all.  Asking in this thread will not help.

I have a question. I'm thinking about doing a minor in data science and later on maby a master. I'm doing a bachelor in marketing, and right now I'm doing an internship in marketing insights (research). I have really taken an interest in data and statistics and also data science. I would love to learn more about it but there is one thing holding me back.

 I am dyslectic and I have discalculia, both diagnosed at a very young age. There both not as severe now that I'm older. Mainly I'm bad at spelling and mental arithmetics. But I will also  misread numbers or letters or remember them wrong fairly often. So this might lead to small errors here and there.

On my current internship it's not a super big deal because we always look over everyone's work before sending it out anyway. 

But I guess my question is to anyone reading, is it a stupid idea to get into data science with these learning disabilities because I'm probably more prone to making errors? 
If there is anyone working (or studying) in data science who is dyslectic or has discalculia I would love to hear about your experience.
Don't be afraid to give me an honest answer, I want to know.

fujyo0,2,2020-04-03,Advice? I feel like I am losing my mind.,crazeeflapjack,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fujyo0/advice_i_feel_like_i_am_losing_my_mind/,"Hi everyone,

After working in defense for three years as an intern, I landed my first full time job in finance, and I really don't know how to describe how I feel other than lost and confused.

I work with a small group of developers, all of which are extremely bright and intelligent, and I can't tell whether or not I fit well in the environment they provide. Being a small group, there is not much documentation, as most questions and conversations are verbal. This has a lot of advantages to IMs and email, but also has disadvantages.

For one, certain conversations are misheard or outright misremembered. Not a big deal, until throughout the fluidity of conversation, a contradiction arises between what was being said in the past and what is being said in the current. Adults can work this kind of stuff out, but it's a lot harder to do in a flurry of engineers talking over each other and interrupting. It got so bad one day that the whole group code reviewed the wrong branch for one of my projects, and I couldn't get a word in to correct them. If I want to get a word in, I have to be rude. Speaking over people, raising my tone, and showing a little arrogance are the only ways I have found that work. Even then, there's always the chance I'm being off-putting without realizing it, and I'm afraid of it being a learned behavior I take to my personal life.

The most recent issue this has caused is my being a over a deadline for a project. I couldn't figure out how to get a test to run correctly, and was reprimanded by not asking for help. This was after I was instructed a week ago not to ask one of my coworkers for help on the project because I had done a similar one about a month ago. I apologized because I ended up asking the coworker for help on a different aspect of the testing anyway, and it's an uphill battle to win a he said/she said against superiors. I get dinged for days over assignments for issues like this all the time. Some I would attribute to my own fault, but some I would not.

This leaves me confused; I'm not exactly sure what the purpose of the deadlines given to me are. I think I have missed every single one I was given in the past three months. It wouldn't be fair to entirely blame myself for all of these shortcomings (I have been blocked by other departments in a few cases), but I have no sense of whether or not me missing deadlines like this is an actual problem.

I think what my supervisor is trying to do is give me deadlines before the actual ones as a time buffer sort of thing, but this is just a guess. They are either being set poorly or I am under performing. I can't figure out how to judge my own performance against others, as I am the only new person in my group. People aren't being overworked; I am the only one that's ever had to work a weekend and group retention by years is about double the average for programmers. I really just want to ask the guy ""hey do you think I'm incompetent or what the hell is going on here?""

That's an extremely huge question I feel blind to. Nobody can convince me I am stupid, but the perception matters when a job is on the line. I just got out of a meeting where my supervisor got mad because I didn't know the line number in code where some schema parsing happened, and I hadn't seen in it in over three months. That's the rule of thumb right? If you haven't seen code in three months you might as well have never seen it before. How are my coworkers handling such an egregious scenario? Does it just not happen to them? Do they actually remember line numbers? Maybe after a while there's just a small number of slocs memorized against the lead's blind spots. Or maybe they're just taking the brunt of an unreasonable lead with me? It's bullshit. Not normal. But employees stay here. I don't get it.

They have made it very clear that I am a junior engineer, and that one of the things they are trying to do is give me work in a serial fashion because mentally context switching between tasks is hard. By the job titles on my resume, I am a junior engineer, yes. But I've made it explicitly clear that I had three class workloads throughout the entirety of my internship, where I was given 30 hours of work any other engineer would be given after an initial three-ish month tenure. Before this I had a few years of retail experience. My schedule has always been super tight, and I feel like I would know how to juggle multiple deadlines if I actually knew the true due date of my assignments. Every time I was blocked on one task I could have been switching to my next one and saving time overall. I want to be direct about asking my supervisor about task switching like this, but between my current performance and the interrupting thing I don't think that concern would be heard.

I don't know where to take my career with this mess. Is it even a mess? It's less stressful than my work/school workload, which was preferable to retail, but it's still miserable. I get stress based reflux, and it's the worst it's ever been. What should I do? Seems like a terrible time to look for a new job, and I feel like I only have one solid reference from this job if I leave early. But they might be looking to can me anyway? Do I just stay until that happens? I have 2 months of savings (I can stretch to 3), and I don't know if leaving or staying is the bigger risk."

GPA (unweighted) : 3.90, GPA weighted: 4.50, SAT: 1470 

So I'm a decent-ish student and I applied to all the UC's and got into all of them except for Berkeley and UCLA, and got waitlisted for Davis which makes sense because for the past 4 years I've only focused on medical so I had no computer science experience whatsoever when I applied. I wanna stay in NorthCal (I'm from Bay Area). Right now, **I wanna decide between Merced and Santa Cruz just in case I don't get into Davis.** 

I wanna go to graduate school for sure so I wanna spend most of the next 4 years getting as many experiences and internships as possible so I wanna go to a university with opportunities. I'm also an outgoing student so I'm willing to go out of my way to get them, but it would be nice to go to a uni with connections. I also think that going to a smaller and less competitive university such as Santa Cruz and Merced would make it easier for me to stand out amongst my peers.  

I've also thought about double majoring in either biology or business. I'm not too sure about any of that right now, but that's also in the back of my mind when making this decision. 

And that's pretty much it about me. I know this post was all over the place (essentially just a brain vomit) but taking all of this into account, **which UC would you guys prefer: UCSC or UCM?** 

Also, is Merced's reputation really that bad? I wanna go to a competitive graduate school so does the undergraduate school matter as much as what you do during that time?"

3rd year CS major at ucla, graduating in June 2021. Plan to do a summer internship at a finance company this summer. Just started leetcoding again to prepare for fall recruitment, but doubt if I should switch to GRE prep instead"

The COA is more or less the same, and I plan to go on to grad school, so GPA, research opportunities, and ease of minoring matter to me 

UoT:

Pros:
&gt; Cs at St. George (best campus)

&gt; trinity college

&gt; Canada (easier potential immigration)

&gt; no grade deflation 

Cons:
&gt; the weather

&gt; it's a huge school, and I don't really know how internships/ research work in Canada

Purdue:

Pros:
&gt; Honors college, so I get priority registration and a more individualised curriculum

&gt; Bigger brand name, especially in the US (?)

&gt; Easier to take on a minor/ pursue interdisciplinary classes

Cons:
&gt; Grade deflation

&gt; US, so there's always an uncertainty over visas (also, the current scenario isn't helping)

Yeah that's pretty much all I can think of rn. Please tell me anything else you know for/ against either of these schools. Also, advice from current students will be amazing.

I went to school for four years and racked up 20,000 dollars in debt getting my degree. I graduated in May 2019 and completely and utterly failed to find a job. I searched for internships during school and probably should have taken the dozens of non-responses as a hint, but it turns out the bona-fide degree was equally useless. I've been living with my Mom and stepfather, mooching. My Mom gave me a car three years ago because she was super proud of me doing well at college. 

With the job search failing I needed an alternative. I've worked some random jobs but none of them have been enough for me to move out so far. So I gave into pressure from my family to apply to Air Force OTS. Once again, everyone super proud of me. Great career move, reasonable salary, benefits.

Thing is... I absolutely do not want to join the air force. Nothing about it appeals to me. I did JROTC in high school and even that was terrible to me. BS heirarchies, never having free time or sleep. My family encouraged me to apply to positions related to my degree, which meant rated positions, which carry a minimum 10 year commitment. 

Board results were supposed to come out today. They're delayed, and the recruiter asked for our ""patients"" during this time. I am desperately hoping I get rejected, but rumor has it there's a small pool of applicants so I'm likely to be accepted.

I can't do it. I can't sign myself up for 10 years of unhappiness. Maybe that makes me an ungrateful asshole. But I'm hoping someone understands and can help me on how to talk to my family about this. I feel like a fraud, and the prospect of telling my Mom that I don't want to go down the career path of my grandfather and instead mooch off of her until a date TBD doesn't sound like a good option.

I have been doing as much research as I can on each school to try to educate myself in order to make the right decision yet I still have my doubts. I like the Learn By Doing approach the cal polys pursue as oppose to the theoretical approach done by the UC's yet I feel UCLA and Berkeley have a overall better college experience. I kind of feel silly for even factoring in the fact that I want to have some type of ""college experience"" yet at the same time, I've been working hard towards this goal so I feel like I at least need to enjoy my experience. If possible, I would love if alumni or current students from these students could give me their experience. If you are or were a transfer student, that would be a plus!  

Thoughts on the engineering program? How hands on was it?

How challenging was it to find internships?

How was the housing situation like?

How is social life at your school? 

If you were a transfer student, was it difficult adjusting academically and socially?

Graduating near top of the year, strong dev experience and ability, with good reputation at my job.


I'm a dual UK/US citizen, and I've been entertaining the idea of moving to the states after a few years, and just wanted some advice/anecdotes from people who live there or have made similar moves. Things like ability to purchase property, living costs, places to live, settling in, meeting people, where would you advise going, etc etc. 


Honestly I'm not all too sure why, I think I kind of want something bigger, to try a new country, but I'm also worried about what I lose by uprooting my life, what I'd miss by not being here, and if I'd do it permanently, and then if I move again, same conundrum. Also, big tech players offer salaries magnitudes higher than what I could ever achieve in the UK.  I have some family in the US, in MA, who I've visited sometimes, and being there is fun, people love the British accent (couldn't tell you why, but I love American accents too, so eh), people are nicer, more outgoing, weather isn't crap all the time. The main detractors from the states are the potentially dangerous culture, guns, the healthcare, the fauna, moving continents, and maybe earthquakes on west coast, I hear they're undesirable. 


I'd probably be looking at west coast - Seattle, San Fran, LA, Palo Alto areas, which is where most tech seems to be. I quite like busy cities, I currently live in a 15 minute bike from my city's centre, but granted cycling is probably not as viable in the US given the reliance on cars. I'm fairly salary oriented, but one of my goals is to actually get on the property ladder with a nice place, which may be counterproductive when living somewhere like these places, whereas my job in the East Midlands in the UK is great for my salary/value ratio. Kind of similar to living in London without a partner, getting housing that's not way out of the city is nigh impossible unless you get studio apartments or similar, which are still £300k.

I know my ECs are very weak. However, right now, I have a lot of free time due to school being closed, so if yall have any tips on how I can improve my ECs, they are greatly appreciated.

Essays/LORs/Other:

I think my LORs will be decent but not too great. However, I think I can grind out a pretty good essay, hopefully 8-9/10.

Also, I will be applying for must of these schools EA (especially Tech).

One other thing is that I will be taking GT Math next year, and I have heard that this improves your chances of getting into Tech (if you do well in the class). I believe I can do well in the class (a low-mid A) as I have always been kind of a math student."

If I were to stay in Australia, I would do my BS from a lower ranked university compared to ASU, but plan to do my Masters from University of Melbourne(higher ranked than ASU). If I choose ASU, it would be harder for me to pay for graduate school. The expense required for an ASU bachelors would pay for both my undergrad and masters in Australia. However, I want to move to America for my career. I understand an ASU has a relatively reputable CS program (top 50 in the country) and if I were to not choose studying there, I would miss out on some good internships and networking opportunities. All I’m saying is, is the MS from the world ranked Australian university more valuable than a BS from ASU if I want to work in America?

I know that I spent a lot of time on this subreddit looking at posts just like this, so I hope this is helpful to someone in the future.

**STATS/INFO**

* GPA: 3.9, California State School, B.S. in Chemistry (graduated in 3.5 years)
* GRE: 164V/166Q/4.5AW. I didn't take the chemistry subject GRE.
* Research: 1 year in a lab at my undergraduate institution doing computational physical organic chemistry research. One summer NSF REU at University of Wisconsin-Madison doing experimental organic methodology research.
* Publications: 1 in prep at time of application (it's published now :))
* Posters: UW-Madison End of Summer REU Symposium. I said in my statements that I would be presenting a poster at ACS Philly but that obviously didn't happen lol.
* Other relevant experience/things: 1 year long industry internship at a local environmental lab. 2.5 years as Supplemental Instruction leader (basically a recitation TA if you're unfamiliar). One semester as an organic chemistry lab instructor. A couple other tutoring/mentoring jobs. 3 awards from my school's chemistry department, one of which being an ACS award.
* Rec letters: 1 from each PI from my 2 research experiences. The professor at UW-Madison is quite well known. 1 from a professor that I took 3 classes with and was the faculty contact for Supplemental Instruction, so she knows me quite well.
* Personal statement: I talked about my accomplishments, my research experience, and my broad research interests. I also mentioned that my career goal is to be a professor and that I am passionate about increasing higher education diversity in STEM because I'm black and female and very rarely see people who look like me in chemistry or other sciences. Several people I spoke with throughout the recruitment process mentioned that my statement was very strong.
* Demographics: black, female, US citizen

**WHERE I APPLIED AND RESULTS**

All of these were chemistry PhD programs and I applied for the physical chemistry path with a focus on theoretical/computational chemistry. I was admitted to every program and I have provided the date of acceptance in parentheses.

* University of Georgia (11/25/2019)
* University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (12/09/2019)
* University of Wisconsin-Madison (12/19/2019)
* University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (01/04/2020)
* University of Houston (01/09/2020)
* University of Pittsburgh (01/17/2020)
* University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (02/12/2020)

I did not apply to schools like Cal Tech or Berkeley because I don't want to live in California anymore. I didn't apply to schools like MIT or Columbia because the east coast is really unfamiliar to me. Also, all of these top tier schools had pretty high application fees that I did not have a waiver for, and I was not interested enough in any of those schools to waste $100+ on a possible rejection. Of the schools I applied to, I only had to pay for the University of Georgia application fee, which was $75.

**HOW I DECIDED**

I just typed up a very long explanation detailing my decision progress for each school then realized nobody wants to read that. If anyone has any questions about my opinions on any of these schools, feel free to message me or ask in the comments. For context, I visited Georgia, Houston, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Illinois, Michigan, and Pittsburgh had virtual visits, but I have visited Illinois before. Here is a short description of the factors that I considered:

* Location: Houston is too big of a city, too hot, and not particularly safe. Illinois is in the middle of nowhere and seems boring. Pittsburgh might be too east coast-y for me. Wisconsin and Georgia are in college towns, which is attractive to me because I've never experienced that, and I want to move somewhere that is bike friendly with great public transportation so I don't have to buy a car. I also have family in Georgia.
* Culture: Illinois has reputation of being super competitive and often overworking students. One of the grad students I spoke to had a lot of negative things to say. The culture at Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Georgia was wonderful, all of the students I met seemed really excited about their research and happy with their choice of school.
* Research: For Houston and Georgia, I essentially applied to work with one specific professor who was doing the specific type of work I thought I wanted to do (computational organic research). I am now unsure if that is what I want to limit myself to, or if I might want to explore other options. Illinois had one really amazing lab that I was interested in and one that I was kinda interested in. Pittsburgh had a bunch of great labs I could've joined. Michigan had a few lab options for me, but none that I was particularly excited about. Minnesota has a phenomenal theory program with two labs that I could be happy in. Wisconsin's theory program is not quite as great as Minnesota, but they do have a few good professors, and they are planning on expanding. There are several labs at Wisconsin that do combined theory and experimental research; there are no labs at Minnesota that do this.
* Other opportunities: A program focused on preparing future faculty is something that I am super interested in, and I essentially ruled Pittsburgh off the list because they didn't have this. Georgia also does not have a program. Minnesota was the best in this respect, but Wisconsin also has a pretty good program.

I am about 95% sure that I am going to choose Wisconsin. I really enjoyed my summer there last year, and every professor and grad student I have spoken to throughout this process has been amazing. The students at Wisconsin are happy and have a good work/life balance, and I was there for 2.5 months to confirm that this was not just a front for the visit weekend. Though Minnesota is best for theory specifically, Wisconsin is stronger in physical chemistry in general. Wisconsin also gives me the best opportunity to explore what type of research I would like to do, which is important to me because my research interests are quite broad. If I decide to do pure theory, there are good professors I can work with, but there is also a lot of opportunity to do combined theory/experimental research if I decide I want to do that. I like the location, Madison is not too big but not too small, and there is plenty to do. I have turned down all the other schools except Minnesota, I am just sitting on my decision for a couple days to make sure I don't change my mind again.

If anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask! Thanks for reading if you did, I know this was long despite my best efforts to make it shorter.

I decided I am done and I know how I plan on dying. My biggest fear with suicide is my father seeing my lifeless body but I have a plan. I have this little metal job boat my plan it to just charge it into the ocean ride as far and as long as possible when I get to a point where I think I am completely through I will take the plug out tie myself to the metal boat and go down with this this shit hole life we call modern age human existence. I’m hoping the boat will work as an anchor and keep my body from washing up. My dad will never have to see my body and I can finally rest.

fv1m42,4,2020-04-04,Rejection Lesson- Don't ask too many questions to grad students bc you never know who's on the admissions committee,melon_head214,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/fv1m42/rejection_lesson_dont_ask_too_many_questions_to/,"TLDR:1.You never know which grad student may be 'interviewing' you2. Did anyone have interviews that they felt went great, then they got rejected? But then it seems as if everyone else got into that school?

Sorry for the long post. I definetely don't want this to come off as complaining or anything because I have two great options for a PhD in biosciences. Although they weren't my top choices, I really can't complain. I just wanted to share my experience. Please hang in there with this read! Any advice/ thoughts would be awesome.

Just briefly my stats:

3.48 B.S., 3.65 M.S. from a 5 year B.S./M.S. program-UCSB.  
Summer internship Stanford  
1.5 years as an undergrad research+ 1 year (during 5th year) as a grad researcher  
1.5 years as a compounding pharm tech  
2 years + now working as an RA at UCSF

Schools list:  
Rejected After Interview: UCSD BMS  
Waitlist : UCSF's PSPG  
Accepted: Johns Hopkins, Scripps Research,

My top choice would have been UCSD's BMS program, (bc of location, 6-7 professors I was interested in studying the microbiome, super cool outreach program to teach elementary school kids, and a pharmacology training grant, which was my undergrad major). I got a super cool phone call prior to the interview where I chatted with a professor who I thought would be the perfect fit and would be excited to learn from. The feeling was reassured at the interview and our research interests were very alligned. I conversed about my research with all the interviewers, with out any tough questions. After what I thought was my best overall interview (vibe wise, relevant projects and aligned interests wise, etc) I got rejected. I was bummed since again I felt super aligned with the program. **Speculation was the worst part!**  I reached out to the admissions committee and they bluntly said they adhere to confidentiality about their admissions process. Anyone else have this experience?

I found out from an inside source, (my friend's friend.. who knew someone on the Grad student admissions committee) that during the grad student poster session- I guess I was asking a grad student lots of questions, and not letting them fully answer- before I asked more questions. This must have rubbed them the wrong way. I think it's actually crazy that this **particular** story circulated back to me. Ultimately, it was that this one grad student didn't think I was a 'fit' , even though I got along with (and still keep in touch with ) several grad students who I met there, including my 'student host' who mentioned he was also on the admissions committee. Also, because there were so many students with my research interest, (gut microbiome) they said that group of students had it especially competitive. I guess I was a bit surprised that one interaction with a grad student was weighted more than the very aligned research interests and experiences  and positive interaction I had with professors.

During this grad poster session: I was trying to be super proactive. I talked with probably 10 + grad students, asking them lots of Qs about their labs, having them point me to talk with other students, and trying to get as much insight as possible (because I really liked the program/ profs!). By the 8th or 9th grad student, I definitely knew some of the answers to my questions, but I just couldn't contain my excitement, and wanted to hear everybody's insight/ advice! Reflecting on this, I guess this kind of personality can be intimidating. And I figure that if you were to meet and chat with 10+ random people on the street... odds are that not all of them are going to think entirely positive about you. But its all just part of my negative speculation...

My PI's and colleagues advised me that during these interviews, you are being interviewed at **all** times by **everyone, so** be sure to act that way.  But, it's not like I was cursing, or doing anything which I think would be considered a red flag. I was just excited about the program. The students were very laid back as well, and I guess I got too comfortable. It's a bummer that my admissions review probably said something like: ""He didn't let a grad student answer their questions fully"" rather than something like...' He was proactively trying to talk with several students and professors trying to get lots of insight and was excited about our program'. All the applicants who I did keep in touch with, (\~10  of them, mostly undergrads) after interview got in, and none of them seemed very excited about the program, and I can safely say they weren't as proactive as I was.

As you could maybe tell, having just finished interviews I found it especially hard to not compare yourself to others, meritocracy/admissions results wise. I guess this does say something about my personality that I need to work on. Everyone who got into the program was very deserving! Everyone I met was honestly awesome, obviously hardworking, dedicated and I think all of them (and everyone in r/gradadmission ) are very deserving of the schools they got into and want to go to. E.g. one of my best friends for many years (quick stats: 3.0 B.S., &amp; 2 years RA at UCSF) got into UCSF, Stanford, JH, Caltech, &amp; UCSD, for programs in biophysics and p chem. He is most likely going to Stanford!

I do realize the 'fit' is important for grad school. You have to ensure that you can work with these profs and students in this location for 5+ years, so in that aspect- yes meritocracy and research alignments should be taken away to a certain degree. But this felt more like 'give us any small reason, and you get the boot.' In my opinion, this promotes students to just' blend in with the herd'.

I'm not letting it bum me out anymore. Again, speculating was the worst part about this process, and comparing yourself to others is obviously a waste of time, even though it's a hard thing NOT to do! All that matters is that we're dedicated scientists pushing in a direction we're passionate for. Also, knowing why I didn't get in- ultimately made me feel a ton better. Hopefully this didn't come off as complaining.

Again, sorry if this read like a journal of  thoughts/ feelings/ and I'm not trying to complain. Also, UCSD has a great program with great students, but I couldn't for the life of me tell you how admissions process works. For a while I was thinking about reapplying for UCSD BMS next year because it was such a good 'fit' with the professors, research and (most) grad students. But  giving up JH and Scripps, and now with COVID, the tanking job market &amp; economy,  and the risk of not getting in again.... fuck that.

I'd love to hear more about how the admission process went for everyone else. Keep posting your stories reddit &lt;3"

Recently I've had several interviews for internship positions, and while I did great on most of them I've realized that I really skimmed topics that I've learned throughout school and personal projects. I would say that my specialty is embedded systems and firmware but after these interviews it blows me away how much this profession can vary.  


I've had different interview questions relating to networking, Linux kernel development, data structures, algorithms, FPGA design, microprocessor architecture, power engineering, digital signal processing, cyber security, and many more. It's intimidating how much esoteric knowledge these employers expect their interns to have in my experience and I'm hoping it gets better once I start working a while and can really specialize.  


On top of that, I keep forgetting a lot of the basics and have to constantly touch-up on my knowledge. Many of my peers seem to memorize everything thoroughly that's thrown at them. Although, I feel that I have a good foundation of knowledge to work from if I were to learn something again. Does anyone else struggle with this? And any advice is appreciated.  



Thanks!"

So to clear my head, it would greatly help if I find professionals who know their way around, as I can talk to them about my interests and needs and they can recommend ways to get there. I often listen to my friends that are starting out and tell them what to do, but right now I don't have anyone to help me with similar kinds of questions.

Somehow this just doesn’t click with me. I have an internship this summer at an IT consulting firm and regardless that’s where I’ll be working, I’m not asking whether or not I should do it, I am merely wondering how it will look on a resume for next year. As far as the role goes, I was told I will be doing a lot of development in JavaScript with react as the fw. To me, this sounds like a valid experience if I’m looking to get into something like webdev or some other software engineering position in the future. Is it true that bc it’s labeled as IT it will be viewed differently than a “software engineering” internship? Thanks"

Hi all,

I'm currently in my 4th year (of 5 years) of studying chemical and bioengineering in Canada. At my last internship term (last summer and chem eng related) I realized that I enjoy software development/engineering a lot more than I do chem eng. So since the beginning of this school term (fall 2019), I've been picking up some languages and tools (Java, Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS, React, SQL) and building projects with those skills. I have been to a couple hackathons and have some side projects.

As it is my second last year, I can take the next year off for internships (so from May 2020-September 2021). So, for this summer, the internship search has been pretty unsuccessful, as I have gotten a 3-4 technical interviews, but I'd say my problem solving skills aren't exactly there yet. However today, I got an offer for one of the positions I applied for in the States (javascript web dev), however due to the lockdown and current situation, this position will be unpaid and virtual, having a 20hrs/week commitment. As of right now, a fall internship (anything software related) is the main goal, so I'm torn between taking the unpaid position, or just spending my summer brushing up on data structures/algorithms, building projects, and doing HackerRank problems. Would love some insight or advice on this!

Thanks in advance! :)"

I've been entertaining the idea of moving to the states after I've got a few years under my belt to pursue those big numbers, a different country, I guess a wildly bigger city. The salaries any big tech gives is magnitudes larger than anything I could achieve in the UK, even in London. I guess it appeals to parts of my ambition, I just feel that I might get capped by the UK not really valuing devs like other countries do, even at the big Ns we have.

Just wondering what the quality of living is like, your pay vs value/size of house and compared to other places, how far are you from your work, company culture, would someone young and single be able to buy property, do you feel that you have plenty of progression left, does the high salary actually reflect in real value, or does it just get sucked away by living expenditure, and I suppose ultimately, would you want to move to where you are/work, if you weren't there? That sort of thing. I'm looking mainly at SF and the bay area, which seems to be where the jobs are. I suppose also Seattle and LA too?

Any and all thoughts appreciated, cheers."

I had three more semesters to go and this is really discouraging me.

I worked very hard to get this perfect GPA and it seems useless after all this rejection. I feel my perfectionist killing me and I don't understand how to overcome this situation.

One of the hiring managers provided me feedback and he said, ""It was a bit hard to really experience your personality and determine how you would work next to your peers. It was a hard lesson for me to learn. I focused so much on my technical ability, I started to lose my ability to interact with others. If you can make that happen in an interview along with your technical skill you will be just fine!""

I will use the same template as   [u/send\_me\_a\_dad\_joke](https://www.reddit.com/user/send_me_a_dad_joke/). 

My interests are in the control of network systems and I was looking for PhD programs with broad emphasis on network systems and strong programs in control and dynamical systems theory.   


 **STATS/INFO** 

* GPA: 3.9, Top 20 Public state school, double BS in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics
* GRE: 159V/169Q/5.0AW
* Research: \~1.5 years in a freshman research lab doing multi-robot distributed target detection and estimation. Then from junior year - present, working with a professor in the mechanical engineering department on multi-robot networked coverage control
* Publications: At the time, 1 journal paper (1st author), submitted one conference paper (1st author, accepted since)
* Posters: One poster at my school's undergraduate research day
* Rec letters: 1 from the PI of the freshman research lab, 1 from the mechanical engineering professor I am currently working with, and 1 from a lecturer whom I have taken 2 classes from and have TAed under (Got A's in his classes and talked to him regularly). I believe all were good letters, but they are all younger faculty and lesser known in the controls community.
* Internships (not super relevant): I worked two internships, 1 at my local NASA headquarters where I did mechanical design on a telescope and 1 at a FFRDC/National Lab where I was again doing space system mechanical design
* Demographics: white, male, US citizen

 

**WHERE I APPLIED**

I applied to eight schools, mostly for mechanical engineering, but some in electrical, and one in applied mathematics.

SCHOOLS (all direct PhD):

* Stanford (Mechanical Engineering) - emailed 1 prof, 1 response
* Harvard (Electrical Engineering) - emailed 0 profs
* Caltech (Control and Dynamical Systems) - emailed 0 profs
* UPenn (Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics) - emailed 1 prof, 0 responses
* MIT (Mechanical Engineering) - emailed 1 prof, 1 response
* UC Santa Barbara (Mechanical Engineering) - emailed 1 prof, 1 response
* Georgia Tech (Electrical Engineering) - emailed 0 profs
* University of Maryland (Mechanical Engineering) - emailed 1 prof, 1 response

FELLOWSHIPS:

* NSF GRFP

**RESULTS**

* Stanford - rejected (3/16)
* Harvard - rejected (2/24)
* Caltech - rejected (2/20)
* MIT - rejected (3/9)
* UPenn - accepted, full funding (2/12)
* UCSB - accepted (1/23), full funding (1/29), more funding (2/27)
* Georga Tech - accepted, full funding (12/18)
* UMD - accepted, full funding (1/24)
* NSF GRFP - honorable mention (3/30)

**THOUGHTS/DECISION MAKING**

I am pleased with the results I got! Getting accepted to half the schools I applied to is really awesome! Ultimately, I was deciding between UCSB and UPenn. I considered Georgia Tech, but was ultimately not thrilled with Atlanta and was not super happy with the sizes of the labs of the professors I was interested in. It seemed like each lab had too many people in them. As for UMD, I didn't consider them too much because the professor I was interested was still working on establishing them and was only an assistant professor. Deciding between the two remaining schools was very difficult as both had different things going for them. UPenn has the GRASP lab which is really amazing and am amazing sense of community, while UCSB is really an amazingly beautiful campus with some really amazing professors working on control. Ultimately, I elected to commit to UCSB because of better funding, nicer campus, and I was overall more excited by the research being done by my POI and the other faculty there rather than UPenn's. I'm super excited to begin there this fall!

If you are interested in controls/robotics/anything broadly mathematical engineering, feel free to reach out to me with questions about graduate school or my research of interest and I'd be more than happy to talk to you!

**TL;DR:**: 3.9 GPA, 159V/169Q/5.0AW, 4 reject, 4 accept, 1 honorable mention - attending UCSB"

I really struggle with ECE classes and all the programming stuffs. I got C+ on ECE 120. I am doing pretty well in ECE110 but it is just too easy. I dropped ECE 220, and the lc3 is just hell to me. I came to the school with no experience in programming and very few AP credits. I am in the program mainly for the possible six figure salary. I am definitely smart, but the teaching method in the school just isn't for me, and I basically study everything by myself. I dont understand the materials in lecture and I couldn't get the homework done by myself.

Life is hard VERY VERY hard for me now, but I REALLY REALLY want to graduate with a CompE degree. Please let me know if this major is really rewarding in the future? Also, how hard is it to graduate and graduate in four years? For reference, CE major has 58% four year graduation rate. CE and CS are the only two majors in UIUC that can make more than 100k starting salary.

I was recently accepted to both Rutgers' campuses in New Brunswick and Newark, though I am unsure where to enroll as of yet. I would rather live around Newark (near where my girlfriend lives). I am an older student and like the idea of a commuter school. Also, I imagine renting an apartment would be cheaper in Newark. 
The dilemma I am facing is that the Newark campus only offers a BA in Computer Science.

I guess what I am asking is how much would the programs differ between the two campus' - between opportunities for internships &amp; so on as well as the classes taught? And is there a large difference between a BS vs a BA in the eyes of an employer?

My girlfriend, and three other friends of mine are all looking for a college apartment for next year. 4/5 of us have summer internships and the fifth is having their housing paid for. We’re all in on this and will support each other to get this started up. 

We’re looking at the end of the school year because we want to beat the college rush and secure a good place before it’s gone. 

We found a place in mind, are working with the management company, allocating funds, etc. it’s gonna work out. 

My problem is that I tried to bring the idea of renting an apartment out to my dad earlier and he said it’s a terrible idea and that the dorms are safer and less expensive. I’ve run the math several times in several spreadsheets and have invariably proven that living in the dorms in x2 the amount of money as getting a place in town. I’ve shown him the spreadsheets and he denies it saying I don’t know what I’m doing despite my being a junior, soon to be senior, engineering student. 

I’m not looking for his blessing, I just want him to consider a viable and good option for me. Everything is going to happen, I just don’t want to ruin relations with my father. Is there anything I can say or do to try and at least get him to stop degrading the idea as if I’m an idiot.

fvm5l5,2,2020-04-05,A question about the future of my career.,Missapizza,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/fvm5l5/a_question_about_the_future_of_my_career/,"Hi everyone. I graduated as both a mechanical and aerospace engineer in December 2019 from a state university with a decent 3.0&gt;GPA. I have behind my belt at least 2.5 years of experience, with 1 of those being engineering related and the rest just college employment. 

As many here, I’ve applied to hundreds of positions that fit my qualifications, skills and level. I’ve also attended career fairs I had to drive 200+ miles to get to. Nothing has come out of this pursuit. 

The closest I got was an interview with a welding/mechatronic proprietary company in Ohio back in November, and feedback was great...but here’s the icing on my career cake; im NOT a US citizen/person. I studied in the US as a foreign national under visa. The company, naturally, rejected me after hearing about this. 

Now here’s another important piece of info, before some of you call me an evil job stealing immigrant, or bad hombre; as an international student you get the “chance” of working in the US for up to 3 years with a special work visa, with the company interested in you having to do absolutely nothing different about you in the hiring process. I’ve let each and every place I’ve applied to know this, yet every company seems incredibly afraid of taking in a foreign national. 

As it stands now, I’m 60 days of unemployment away for my visa (which you pay$400 USD to the DHS to file) to expire, and with NCOV-19 around I think I can kiss this opportunity goodbye. 

My career question here, with all that context now established is; should I go for a masters or head back home? 

Here’s the data I’ve got to work on the answer for that question: 

Masters: applied for the fall semester at the same university I did my Bsc on. If accepted (lmao) certainty on funding was 90% a few months ago. As of today, I don’t know. I’d get the chance of improving my GPA, getting an MS and looking for internships, then later coming back to where I am with an employment visa begging for a company to have mercy. 

Back home: Shall I return home, I’d work for 2-3 years to save up for a masters in Canada or Europe. The thing about refusing to coming back home mounts up into 2 reasons: 

Salaries: Mexican engineers get paid dirt. I can do exactly the same thing a quality engineer does in Kansas for the same company in Mexico, and I will be getting 1/10th of his salary. 

The nature of work: Mexican engineers don’t design, research or develop...those are my passions. Our engineers work in the production lines for foreign companies most of the time, and our suggestions for improvements/changes in designs are frowned upon and rejected as if we were some sort of “inferior” being. The work culture in the company reflects this. 

Verdict: If I go for a masters in the USA, I’m rendered useless in the Mexican work market as I’ll be “overqualified” and no company will want me, but I get to try again in the American job market...with more experience and higher up in the qualifications percentile. 

If I go back home, I’m wasting the investment I made on the work visa, will work for pennies on the dime, won’t work in anything I’m qualified to work in (design/testing/research) but I get the chance to get more experience and apply to masters opportunities in Canada or Europe, where permanence through academic merit has a higher chance of working for foreigners. 

I know this is long and tedious as hell, thank you if you got this far in the read. I’m open to your suggestions, or perspective as from mine I remain STUCK on the verdict for both options.

Edit: I know working in aerospace is impossible unless I was some sort of modern day, Von Braun. Please interpret my desire to work in the US or abroad as a desire to participate in Mechanical engineering and its subdivisions."

I hope all of you guys are safe and healthy. My first year of college is finally coming to a close, and I've been trying to find something to do for the summer. I've tried applying to a bunch of internships, but I've, unfortunately, have heard back from none. Many people have told me that even if I don't find an internship to do, it's ""fine"" because Freshman internships don't matter that much. While I am aware of that, I am still eager to sharpen my programming skills in some way or the other.

As a brief background, I currently reside and attend college in NYC, and I have a pretty strong background in Java and a bit of Python too. I am really interested in learning more about AI and Machine Learning, but because I haven't taken the necessary courses, I feel like I don't have the academic background to even start learning those topics. However, if you guys know of any helpful introductory online courses, I'll definitely look into those as well.

Honestly, I am just in need of some direction and I'm hoping you guys can take the time to spare some advice for a confused and stressed out first-year.

My parents also made a deal that they will buy me a car if I go to Purdue. I heard that West Lafayette is really boring that there is nothing to do around the campus. Oppositely, Madison is a nice city and Wisconsin is a big big party school. I am thinking of minoring in DS at Wisconsin and minoring in CS at Purdue.

Which one would be a better choice? Just program-wise, which one will be a better degree in the future? For job opportunities which school and major would be better? I personally want to work in the US after I graduate, so which school will be easier for internationals to get an internship?

I am interest in Finance. Here's my options:

Queens Commerce - (Will graduate with over 100k debt: 20k tuition + living)

Laurier BBA - (Debt depends if I get co-op or not: 11k tuition + living)

McMaster Commerce- (Year long internship option which will help pay a lot of debt off- 11k tuition + living)

Also considering low ranked programs with co-op such as Ryerson accounting and finance, Guelph commerce, Carleton and Brock BBA

Does where you get the degree really matter? I'm willing to go into debt if it will seriously help my future employment opportunities, but if I can get to the same place from those other schools, I'll gladly save the money lol. I also don't know how much debt it manageable or worth taking on.

6 interviews of 345 job applications. 329 of which were in the Silicon Valley Area. I specialized my major in Corporate Finance and I was so discouraged when applying for jobs. I had 0 companies express interest in me in the Silicon Valley. I go to Colorado State and unfortunately it’s not a very well-known school. Sadly lots of those firms won’t look at you unless you are apart of a well known program or know somebody. I kept applying day after day and it ended up talking about 2-3 hours out of my day since August. I kept visiting this sub to take small pieces of advice and improve throughout my application process. 

Of my six interviews, only 3 offers were extended to me. I did my best to go over their 10K before my interview and make predictions or assumptions based off their numbers and I think that impressed them. One of the companies told me they liked the way my resume looked as it stood out aesthetically from other black and white ones.* I’m going to accept a Finance internship with Arrow Electronics because they want to teach me new enterprise software and other data analytics. I’m really excited to learn more about the industry. 

So, thank you to this sub for the collective help y’all have provided. Lots of great advice. Here’s to hoping COVID-19 doesn’t cancel my opportunity found.

   * Going to a quant fund full time.
   * Interned at 2 of the FAANGs
   * Interned at recently public unicorn (like Dropbox/Lyft/Slack/Uber)
   * Interned at a bank
   * Other random tech internships/coops
* Extracurriculars:
   * VC Scout (manage 2 other people)
   * University Senate
   * University SGA

   * Hackathon Organizer
* Undergrad school/major: Top 50 State School, Computer Science

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA: To transition from hard tech into entrepreneurship, particularly interested in a emerging market (BRIC nations for example)
* Target schools: H/S/W Deferred Programs

**Concerns**

* GPA is below average for deferred programs. It would be a 3.85 except I took a class over summer while working and had communication issues with my group. I'll try to explain this in my application.
* Not sure if my goal is too broad/overused
* Going to a quant fund full time which doesn't really match my post-MBA goals. Idea behind this was to gain solid technical skills, build financial stability (so I can take 2 years off for school and also do well during the current economic downturn)
* Not really any strong leadership which is hard since you don't really get to lead as an intern. Relying on my extracurriculars here but those aren't particularly strong either."

**Thoughts and Advice:** 

I personally HATED writing essays for colleges because it was so hard to find things to write about. I'm not complaining about it being some flaw in the selection of students, I just was not very good at it, and I view myself as a pretty good writer in general. Therefore, I would probably view that as the weakest aspect of my application. The thing I regret the most is not applying to more colleges. I have a very flexible financial situation so it probably would have been best to apply to many more colleges and see where that would lead me. If you are wondering where I am going, I still have not decided yet; feel free to let me know your opinion on the best choice for me. DM me any questions you have about my experience and I will try to answer. Good luck!"

I've come here again hat in hand to beg for help please, as figuring this out will save a lot of time for myself and my department.

I need to sort several long columns, these columns are full of peoples names. Each of these people fall into a different category, such as ""Consultant"", ""Registrar"", ""HMO"" or ""Intern"" and I have them in a 'Name Manager' group under those titles.

I want to be able to sort columns N O P Q R S and T by those named groups, so that everyone who is in the Consultant group is on top, then everyone who is in the registrar group, then HMO and then Intern. I would put this in my template as a repeatable action.

Is this something that is possible? Any help would be very much appreciated.

Edit: Just to be greedy, would it also be possible to automatically put a blank cell beneath every single name as they're sorted?"

This seems really dramatic but this has been an issue I've been dealing with internally for a while now. Keep in mind that I'm 25 and have only been an engineer for a year and this is my first engineering position ever, no internships or anything. 

I just received an email from my boss about how frustrated he is with how several of my previous projects were going, and he felt like I wasn't listening to him and dragging my feet with stuff and trying to cut corners. Truth is, I'm just not a super detail oriented person. I know this, and know that if i just fly by the seat of my pants, stuff gets missed, I forget things, and I'm not as thorough as I should be. Fair. It's something that I've known for a while and have been working on a LOT. I have 2 redundant checklists I keep updated with things to do, and a 3rd generated by our ERP software. I put a lot of effort into trying to make sure I'm on top of things, but i still have a long way to go. Learning to be Type A as an extremely disorganized person has been super hard. 

The truth is, though, a lot of this is because I feel a ton of pressure from sales and the C Suite to speed through projects if they are behind, and they're always behind. I'm in controls, so I'm the last person to see it before it goes out the door and all the slowdowns up to that point get compounded onto my shoulders. I don't get the time to do stuff right before the ship date, stuff gets missed, you know the drill. 

How do I talk to my boss about this? I feel like I can't win. If i take my time and do it right, I piss off the customer and the bean counters because it goes out late. If i speed through it, the customer and my boss get pissed because now its a buggy mess we have to spent weeks supporting. Either way, I get thrown under the bus. but I recognize that I do have issues I'm working on addressing. Has anyone else dealt with similar situations? What can I do to get better at catching small stuff? how can i bring this up with my boss without sounding like I'm making excuses?"

fvtiga,6,2020-04-06,I applied for a Vice President position... and now my anxiety is making me cry.,lupitaladelbarrio,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/fvtiga/i_applied_for_a_vice_president_position_and_now/,"Hello! First time posting, but I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest to people that can probably understand me better.

I joined an organization at my university for the first time this semester. I was excited to finally be putting myself out there and socializing with more people, but unfortunately the experience was cut short because of COVID-19. This organization also had an agency run by students, and I joined it as a simple intern (before COVID-19. That was also, unfortunately, cut short).

Two weeks ago or so they announced that they were opening eboard applications! This agency is around a year old, so I was like ""hey, maybe I joined for like half a semester, but what if I ran for Vice President?"" I was thinking that maybe since the agency is just starting, I could maybe take advantage of this and gain more leadership experience, plus I actually liked the agency and want to put myself out there more!

So, starting Friday I began working on a new resume and cover letter. That's all I did from the moment I woke up, to the moment I went to sleep.

Today was the deadline. I had everything ready; however, obviously, last moment I got scared and just stared at the application for like 15 minutes. I began thinking ""Am I dumb? I didn't even spend a full semester at their organization and I think I can become Vice President???? I have no experience at all (can't even get a proper job because interviews give me anxiety) and I think I can become Vice President???""

I began to feel embarrassed. It eventually became 12:04 a.m. 4 minutes past the deadline. With a sudden act of courage I finally pressed submit.

Now. I have no idea if my application even counted because I turned it in 4 minutes late. I'm starting to think I even clicked the wrong position at the application, but I don't know if that's just my anxiety giving me false information to get me more anxious.

One second I go from: ""It's okay! If your application counted then that's great! Just give it a shot, you might get the position! If you don't get it at least you tried :)""

To my anxiety telling me: ""Are you kidding? If your application passed then that means you're doomed! You'll have to do an interview and they'll stare at you like you're a moron! Come up with ways to cancel that interview ASAP""

I don't know if I did good pressing that submit button. Now not only do I have to worry about having to prepare for an interview, but I also have to worry about whether or not my application passed even though it was after the deadline! (It was a Google Form and I had it opened before the deadline, so when I pressed submit it didn't give me an error. That's why I'm not sure if it was accept through or not.) Plus, what if they see I turned it in late? It'll be ironic how in my cover letter I'm saying 'I have no problem turning stuff in on time!' and then my application is late...

I really don't know what to do. Sorry for ranting. I'm feeling much more relaxed now. My anxiety was just giving me a headache with all these thoughts! :/ I hope I'm okay with whatever happens. If my application passed, I hope I get to do the interview confidently. If my application didn't pass, I hope I get more opportunities in the future and maybe take a deep breath.

Have you guys ever experienced something like this? How do you guys get through interviews? Or joining organizations, or putting yourself out there?"

fvuctf,0,2020-04-06,CS -&gt; Wall Street,bagd13,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fvuctf/cs_wall_street/,"Hi all,

I am currently a sophomore computer science major.  Over the past months, I have been browsing through various tech companies and their internship opportunities.  This process has led me to realize the vast diversity of niches and specialties within the field.  Some companies are looking for backend workers who have expertise with specific programming languages, others are looking for fronted workers with expertise in their own languages, etc.  Given this observation, I figure that I should try to find my own niche within the industry so that I can tailor my resume so as to have a high probability of getting jobs within that niche.  I've decided that I would like to work in highly math intensive subsets of the industry.  I suspect that the most lucrative math intensive cs jobs are on wall street.

Does anyone have advice as to how I can maximize my chances of getting onto wall street with a cs background and without going to grad school?  Any other thoughts on my sequence of reasoning above would be appreciated as well, as I'm still very new to the process of seeking out job opportunities in the tech industry.

Thanks"

fvv735,1,2020-04-06,Advice post- security internship,HoeChiMinh,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/fvv735/advice_post_security_internship/,"Hi all, apologies if the post is against rule.

I've joined a company in the US providing a Cyber Security internship. What was advertised was was over 18 months, there would be a rotation between the Network team, SoC, and IDAMS (identity and access management) after which there would be interviews for job opportunities in each team. This has been scrapped and they have placed me on what they call a 'path' to becoming an IDAMS engineer after the internship has run its course. So the rotation is still in place but that will be the only job available afterwards. I believe this is counter-intuitive as theyve hired multiple interns, the most logical path to me would allow the rotation and application to each field afterwards and hire those who've done best in the internship postion held in that field.

I am against this as I believe the SoC would be the ideal place to be in terms of career opportunities afterwards. Also the training they are offering on the SoC path seems to outclass the IDAMS training (CCNA, Linux+, MCSC, SANS course's compared to MCS and MCSA/Cloud accreditation). 

I wanted to ask if i am right in believing the SoC to be the place to be, or am I overreacting and following the IDAMS training can get me  just as far in terms of future career. I am new to the field and need some advice.

I am looking to specialize as  a software engineer perhaps specialising in the fields of Machine Learning and AI.

Pros and Cons of CN Yang Program that I can think up of:

Pros: Provides for alot of opportunities, networking chances and prestigious (Not sure about this wrt companies). Research experience might prove to be useful in the fields of AI and Machine learning.

Cons: Learn stuff such as triple science etc during the first sem, might fall behind other cs students and career wise (Because these modules are very heavy in content wise = spending less time on cs mods and less free time for personal projects). Also curriculum wise suggest that uni breaks will be spent on things like making &amp; tinkering etc = Less time for self-sourced internships, and less elective slots."
fvvh2q,4407,2020-04-06,My Grandmother Worked for NASA for forty years. There are terrors beyond our world.,googlyeyes93,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fvvh2q/my_grandmother_worked_for_nasa_for_forty_years/,"Man has been on this Earth millions of years, exploring the planet, building civilizations, killing and creating in an endless cycle. Man first went into space starting almost eighty years ago. Think about it, we spend all this time getting around our own planet, arguing over the smallest bits of land, but when we finally set our mind to space travel it only took us a few decades to get where we wanted to go.

I'm proud to say my grandmother was one of those that helped us to get there. She started out back in 1959, fresh out of college, as an intern for NASA. The space race was already going strong, the US vs. the Soviets, and she managed to get in right in the middle. Gram stayed there for forty more years, only retiring right before Y2K.

She's up there in years now, and I wanted to try to do something to preserve the memories she had of that time, so I began to collect her stories. We started out with the basics, talking about how she joined, what she did, the history surrounding everything when she was there... all the things you learn in a high school history class. 

When we started discussing the missions she worked on though, that's when I realized that there was a lot of history missing. Locked up, never to be heard or read by anyone, nor should it. There's a reason space exploration has slowed down. There are missions that were made off the books and off record, launched from secret blacksites around the world. Gram both saw and heard terrors beyond our comprehension from the dark void of space. 

She shared these stories with me, these secrets kept from us by those in power. The human price of our curiosity is much higher than we're led to believe, and these people deserve to have their stories known. 

I'm enclosing one of her stories here. She can get a bit long winded, as some do in their old age, so I've tried to edit down anything that isn't relevant. I'm still going through everything with her as well. With her age she can't stay focused for very long, so we're doing these little interviews in hour sessions every day. I'll transcribe and upload what I can when I can.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*What follows is the transcript of what Gram told me on April 4, 2020. Any interjections of my own will be formatted with brackets around them.*

My name is Evalyn Lara Smart. I was a mission control contact with NASA from 1959 to 1999. I was the one that any astronauts or crew would speak to, the voice on the ground. I relayed this information back to whoever needed it in flight control, navigation, engineering and such.

I didn't set out to work there, it sort of just fell into my lap. I had worked as a switchboard operator, mostly taking emergency calls for the local departments. NASA was doing some recruiting and one of my supervisors recommended me. Then before I knew it, there I was, sitting in the big mission control room, watching the big screen with the video feed, and talking to our very own spacemen.

[Here she goes into a tangent about how lovely Armstrong and Aldrin are, with many mentions about Christmas cards from the latter.]

So, one of the first missions I was there for was the first picture of Earth from orbit. Obviously being in communication I wasn't really necessary, but we all crowded into the control room to see the picture as soon as it was transmitted. Granted, it was the late fifties so we were waiting for quite a while.

We expected cheers when it came through finally. It started that way, at least, then everything quickly died down. There was the Earth, the huge curve with a beautiful crown of light from the sun shining around it. We captured something else too, though. Something that I fear I'll see again one day.

Behind the Earth, off in the distance, was something... giant. It wasn't completely clear, but what you could make out was a clearly defined torso, arms outstretched with wicked spines jutting from the outside. Large red eyes blazed against the dark void behind the figure, with a gaping maw underneath opened in a terrifying roar.

The scale of this thing was huge. No way it couldn't be seen from a normal telescope here on Earth. We aimed our most powerful scope at the coordinates we estimated it to be at and swept the sky, but couldn't see it anywhere. Took another picture from the satellite and it was gone. As if it had never been there. 

To this day we don't know what the hell it was. We check for it in every photo we take, every sweep of the sky, and it's only shown up two more times since then. Once in 1979, and once in 1999. I don't know many people in the agency now, so god knows if it's been there again. Every time it showed up though, it appeared larger.

[Here she goes on about a few other notable advances in tech. Most irrelevant to what we are discussing now.]

What a lot of people don't realize is that there were manned space flights before the ones on the history books. Sure, there's always been the theories about ""lost cosmonauts"" and such from the Soviets, and there are definitely true cases of that, but we had our share as well.

There was an initial manned space flight in 1960, the *Daedalus*. 

[She noticed the look of shock on my face, apparently, and laughed}

Never read about that one, eh? It was kept tightly under wraps. We didn't want anyone to know about it until we had them back on the ground successfully, otherwise it may kill morale around the office. No, we kept a small crew, launched the rocket off from an isolated area of Alaska. We did a lot of launches from there, kept the Reds on their toes back in the day. 

Anyway, this was a three man crew. There was Bill Zask, James Hanlon, and Terry Duncan. Those three were a tight crew. They were supposed to go up, orbit for twelve hours, then come back down. We would pass it off as a comet if anyone saw, but never got that chance. 

Things went south fast. They took off, all was fine until they hit the upper atmosphere. They tried to ease back on the jets, make sure they made it into orbit and didn’t overshoot. Everything went to hell. Jets wouldn’t cut off. We don’t know what caused the malfunction. I heard them, shouting... trying to fix the issue. It didn’t happen. They flew straight through, getting just enough adjustment from the orbital pull to be shot off course and toward the direction of the sun. 

[She lets out a sigh here, shaking her head.]

Jets continued firing, taking them even further out. We maintained radio contact with them for twenty hours after takeoff. I spoke with them as fuel ran out, they began drifting into the void, no hope of turning. Never to feel solid ground again. 

To this day I don’t know if it was something they really saw or the insanity getting to them as they died and faced their mortality. James was the first to begin raving. Telling us about the bodies floating by the cockpit windows. I tried to clarify what he meant, assuming celestial bodies. I’ll never forget the response from Bill. 

“No, Evalyn.” He said to me, “Human bodies. Dozens of them.” 

They described the field of bodies. Male and female, old and young. All naked as the day they were born. Bill swore that one smiled at him as he went by. We didn’t have live feed cameras at the time, unfortunately, so we weren’t able to confirm. The way they described it though... I have no doubt they were seeing all of this. 

A lot of the transmissions got lost in static.  Limits of the tech at the time. The last broadcast we received was Bill. He was raving, still talking about the bodies. Said they were talking to him now. Telling him he could live forever with them. He said he was going to open the emergency hatch. Maybe it was my emotions getting the better of me. Right before he opened it and the static took over, I swear there was another voice. 

[She drifts off and stares out of the window next to her. The sun went down an hour ago. Stars were plainly visible, shining in the inky darkness. I asked what the voice said.]

It’s ingrained in my head. I can hear it clear as that moment sixty years ago. 

“Come. Be with us. Become as stars and drift immortal.”

[[Gram is tired, says she’s going to bed.]

I'm looking for any suggestions on companies (LDN) that would take a Jr like me, whether that be from what you've heard / you've gone through it yourself? My ultimate goal would be FinTech/HealthTech. I have already been swiftly rejected for Monzo and BenevolentAI lol.

Should I be applying for internships and then hoping to pivot to a job / send applications out after starting the internship?

Any suggestions on how to improve my project list is also appreciated, I realise I have few software-related projs on there - would like to not appear as a complete pleb. I've ensured my code isn't spaghetti despite being self-taught

Thanks!"

I'm an international student who has been accepted for Computer Engineering 2024. The 61k COA is a significant cost to me. I'm also aware that UIUC doesn't typically give much aid for international students.

If there are international students who have been attending UIUC through  a mix of savings, department scholarships, Co-Ops, internships, loans, could you let me know what your experience has been like? 

I'm inclined to take on a similar path but am wary of the undue stress it will cause. Hoping to learn from the experiences of those before me.

Thanks"

I've been creating mainly desktop applications at my job, so I started learning about web development and took a class on Angular which I plan on building my personal website with. But I'm not a fan of coding all day and then coming home to code some more just to have a showcase of personal projects for potential employers UNLESS it definitely helps getting offers."

I was later asked to continue exploring on it and update them. 

Whenever I try to talk to my immediate manager, he never responds back to my messages, mails or calls. I have to physically go and meet him to get update my work. Ever since the lockdown began, I m not able to get him to respond to me. It's been 2 weeks since I ve heard from him. He seenzones my messages. When I try to call him, he tells he ll get back to me but never does.

I did try to contact other senior members in department but all they suggested was to keep calling him.

I m really concerned on what's happening as people are loosing jobs and we are headed towards recession.

I recently got admission to both the courses below at Maynooth university and I was wondering if any of you could help me compare the two courses and suggest which one would be better for me. 

1) About the course content itself, it seems the 2 year course is more theory and math oriented compared to the 1 year course. Plus there are lots more modules to choose from, so it seem like a more open course. The subjects in 2nd year is very similar to the 1 year course it seems. Can someone pitch in on how the degrees compare generally speaking with regards to the course subjects taught?

2) Would learning a 2 year course over a 1 year course give me any advantage when job seeking? (I plan to seek a job after studies). The 2 year course has compulsory internship in 3rd semester, I suppose that'd be helpful but I also will be paying a fee to the uni as I'm a non-eu applicant. So I'm not sure if it'd be beneficial considering I'll be saving an years worth of fee if I pick the one year course.

fw1yep,1,2020-04-06,"[Feedback] Hired part-time end of January, pulled off only project I've worked on last week in light of Covid-19, should (or how aggressively should) I be looking for a new job?",UnemployedAWSGuy,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/fw1yep/feedback_hired_parttime_end_of_january_pulled_off/,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ep6ipa/feedback\_looking\_for\_fulltime\_work\_for\_4\_months/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ep6ipa/feedback_looking_for_fulltime_work_for_4_months/)   
is a post I made in mid-January about the struggles with my job search.  Fortunately, two weeks later a LinkedIn connection (someone I had not worked with in the past but who reached out to me about a job opening that I had politely declined as I was already employed) posted about another job opening.  I reached out and after a short phone call, they made me an offer for position; it was part-time/somewhat of an internship but it pays monthly.   
**TAKEAWAY**: Connections don't matter, solid ones do.  Just because I have accepted so many requests from recruiters, my job-offer-to-accept percentage with them is approximately 0, while this one connection was able to make me a job offer with little effort.  


Being a small shop, I enjoy the lack of restrictions a larger company might have but don't like that feedback is short to come by and administrative processes are ad-hoc, seat of the pants (no HR or payroll department, etc).  However, the position is part-time and the work is flexible hours so as long as I attend one or two weekly meetings and get my work done, I can devote other time in the week for school.  My performance has been average at most but I believe this is partially because I'm new to the company and the client and I'm doing things in a manner I haven't before.    


Over the past two months I haven't gotten much feedback from my manager but last week they told me to stop working on the current project as the client requested my company stop work due to uncertainty surrounding Covid-19; Thursday was an effective cut-off date where I didn't have access to the customer's systems any more.  I spoke with my manager today and they said there is a lot to do internally (I think they mean creating promotional content or improving the company's web presence) but they can't pay me for it; I offered to do some 'sharpening the tool' work and potentially write a blog post about it.  They said that would be good and that they want to keep me and another coworker who joined around the same time I did on.  


* No one explicitly told me to log or delete my account out of the client's systems and as I'm still logged in I see work is still being done; should I log out of those systems?  Should I take the sign that work is still being done and my account hasn't been logged out/deleted that this could just be temporary?  
* Is me doing the 'sharpening the tool'/blog post giving away my labor for free?  Or productive in terms of convincing them I am an asset to the company?
* Should I be looking for a new job?  Searching for freelancing gigs?  I have my LinkedIn set to open to new opportunities but I want to make sure in my job search I don't inadvertently stumble upon a current coworker and ruin what I currently have.
* How upfront should I be about my job search with my current company?  I really like the situation I have with my current company especially if I could maintain a full-time 9-5 job AND be 'on-call' or work nights/weekends with my current company as side-hustle.  Does it seem like I even have a job at this point and the news is a 'slow drip'?  
* What is your perspective on the impact Covid-19 is having on the IT industry and how long do you think it will affect the IT industry?  


I plan on staying in touch and being pro-active with my manager but wanted to get insight/feedback/strategy from others in the industry before proceeding; thanks in advance for any feedback and I can answer questions over PM as well as the comments."
fw25pj,13,2020-04-06,Is Australia a good destination for international students to get a bachelors degree in CS?,RichAssistant,unsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/unsw/comments/fw25pj/is_australia_a_good_destination_for_international/,"I am thinking of getting a degree in Computer Science but I guess getting just a 'degree' in CS is not everything,  it has to be very practical like working on projects, participating in competitions like hackathons and stuff that will help understand the theory and most imp getting an internship which will be very beneficial in getting hands on experience of the course and this is where I have a problem, most of the good interns and jobs in companies in AU are reserved for permanent residents.

So how is AU (more like Mel and Sydney) compared to other countries like US and Canada in terms of opportunities for comp science undergrads and shall I bothered by this intern thing?

Edit: Not discouraging anyone but with the discussions below here's what i have gathered about AU unis in general (feel free to correct me below if i am wrong at some points).

Students mostly enroll in AU unis for their masters or phd in research as they are very good (the uni ranks are based on the research department) and the undergrads due to the low entry requirements and easy admission process and in hopes of getting better jobs and a degree from an int. uni.

Most (not all) int. students end up with just a degree from uni without any real world experience (not all) and either go back to their home country or wait about 2-3 years or goes for masters and then for PR and then finally a good paying job in AU.Moreover if you are a graduate from the non-Go8 unis there's very little chance of landing jobs overseas as they are not even recognized outside AU.

Its always better to look at all the pros and cons and choose the best option available for you."

[The BU Center for Career Development](http://www.bu.edu/careers/) has been getting a lot of questions - very understandably - from students who want to know what COVID-19 will mean for their job and internship searches. To help, we're hosting a series of [\#AMA sessions.](http://www.bu.edu/careers/about-us/calendar/?topic=8237)

Over the next five weeks, CCD Counselors and Assistant Directors will answer any questions you might have on career-related topics. It doesn't have to be related to COVID-19 or the economy, but we have counselors who have been with us since before 2008, and we're experienced in counseling students through all kinds of economic outlooks. 

This is definitely an uncertain time, and no one can say for sure exactly when we'll get back to normal. But we do know that we have methods and strategies that can help you feel more empowered, and we want to help. 

The first AMA will be this **FRIDAY, April 10, at 3pm,** with CCD Assistant Director Esther Leonard. All of the AMAs will be held on Zoom, so you'll need to log into Handshake to get the link (that's how we're keeping it exclusive to BU students). The full calendar listings for all the AMAs are [here,](http://www.bu.edu/careers/about-us/calendar/?topic=8237) or you can find event listings for them on the BU Facebook.  

In addition to the AMAs, the CCD is still holding virtual workshops and counseling appointments, and we're actually seeing record numbers of new listings of virtual internships. You can find out more info on our [website](http://www.bu.edu/careers/), our [blog](https://bu-beyond.blog/), or by logging into [Handshake.](https://bu.joinhandshake.com/login) 

We hope to see you at the #AMAs, beginning **FRIDAY, April 10, at 3pm!**

fw2gpt,4,2020-04-06,Should I change my major from Information Technology to Computer Science,DashProdigy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fw2gpt/should_i_change_my_major_from_information/," Some background about me is that I am 20 years old and I am in the second semester of my junior year of my Information Technology degree. When I declared my major, there was not Computer Science degree and my university is going to start offering it starting in the fall semester.

The IT degree at my university is very similar to a standard Computer Science degree. Like the degree still requires basic computer science classes like Programming 1, Object Oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, calculus and discrete math, Web Design, etc...

Most of my classes will transfer to the new degree, but I will still most likely have to have another year of school. I think for the Computer Science degree I will have to take Calculus 2, two more post-calculus math classes, and some higher level programming classes.

I know the name ""Computer Science"" holds a lot more weight than ""Information Technology"" when it comes to looking for jobs, but I'm not sure if it will be worth it or that much more beneficial when it is going to make me have another year of college.

Another important piece of information is that I already have a software development internship lined up for this summer. I have seen that experience matters a lot more than your degree when it comes to looking for jobs. Will having internship experience offset not having a Computer Science degree and having an IT degree instead?

Also, I wanted to include that I want to be a software developer in the future."

This has been my plan since I started my undergrad. I did everything throughout my undergrad that would get me to be a good candidate for this. I maintained a pretty good CGPA  (9.82/10 in my country) and got a 330(168Q 162V) on my GRE. I did my undergrad at an average uni where I am from.  I got a prestigious software development internship at the end of my second year and I was on the way to get another prestigious research internship this summer (All this may sound decent but I was aiming for top choices in computer science and it is fiercely competitive). All this being said, my research internship has been temporarily suspended due to the ongoing crisis. I feel like because of this my profile will take a huge hit. At the same time, I've heard talks about how a lot of students are going to defer their admit to next year so next year's intake will be pretty low. I wanted to get into the top universities for my domain but now I feel like I have very less chances. For me personally, a master's degree is a huge investment and I want to do it in one of my top choices. I looked through some less competitive degrees in computer science at my top school choices but it's nothing I'm really passionate about. Right now I'm pretty hopeless about the entire MS Application process and I would like some insights on what kind off universities I can apply to and have a possibility of getting into and how the entire admission ecosystem looks in universities right now and their prospects next year. I have thoughts giving up on grad school and looking for a job back here but my dream was a master's degree. Any guidance is appreciated."
fw2ydo,9,2020-04-06,My Pathetic brooding.,Chewester,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fw2ydo/my_pathetic_brooding/,"Most of my suicidal desires stem from my intense hatred for myself, and when you look at me there is really no denying that I deserve to have a shotgun forced into my mouth. 

During the new year, I asked my workplace if they could give me the quarter off, because I assumed that I would be too busy with the internship that one of the courses required. I work at McDonald's and they have plenty of people and constantly move people around so this wasn't an issue at all. Well turns out I am even shittier than I thought because I failed to get that internship, so I transferred out of the class, which literally saved my life, if another student didn't tell me it was possible to do so, I would be dead right now. However, I never contacted my work telling them I was free. My quarter ended two weeks ago and now with this covid shit I don't even know if I can go into the lobby to ask. What terrifies me the most is going there and seeing who has left in my absence and re-socializing with everyone else. Now that my suicidal desires have increased since the new year, I can't be the same person that left there. I am much more depressed and unhappy, which keeps me from going back to work, which makes me even more unhappy. I don't even know if its worth it because I am planning on killing myself by graduation this year.
I know this is pretty fucking pathetic, I know more than anyone else that the only thing I deserve is a bullet through the head. Which makes my life so fucking miserable, I have a supportive family that takes care of me financially and put me through college. This makes me hate myself even more because I should be succeeding and yet I can't stop cutting myself. My biggest failure is probably my 10 failed attempts at ending my life. I don't own a firearm so I have to kill myself by other means, the easiest of which is jumping off of a high place, because I live near the tallest bridge on the west coast of the US. However, every time i try I always lose my nerve, either in the middle of the drive over, or the 10 minute walk to the bridge from the nearest parking. 
All of this makes me want to cut myself but I can't do that because that will for sure make it so that I can't work because the scars would be off putting to customers, so I have been robbed of my main release for these feelings. 

I'm not even sure what I expect from writing this, but the stress was getting to me today, so I thought I would right it down. 

Tl;dr: Someone please put a bullet through my head, it's what I deserve."

If sales needs a report, I write a ticket to have it made. If sales needs a PowerPoint, I'm make a deck that I also have to present. If we get a new data set, I write the documentation and use cases for it. If we're running low on man-power I query our database myself to pull some basic insights. Problems here are alright. There's the real world constraints of budget, privacy laws, and what our tech can do; but it's more of the business side of things.

I've found that I really just have no patience for this aspect of how a company works. I really don't want to be making PowerPoints, or writing pages upon pages of something that I didn't build. For once I'd like to do the building. I feel like for right now, I just want marching orders to build something and to sharpen my technical skills.

When I get home, deep down inside there's a feeling that this is not what I want to do with my life. That I should be doing anything else. It keeps me awake, and I dread logging on every morning and answering emails. At the end of they day I ultimately help sell ads, something that at its best is an interruption in scheduled programming/content, and at worst is something that compels you to buy something you really just do not need or manipulates you to want something you didn't really want in the first place.

To address this, I've started taking non-credit Python development courses at a local university. That said, I'm unsure that I'll be able to pivot out of this industry because I feel like I've pigeonholed myself as an ""advertising"" data analyst. I really want to become a developer, but part of me just feels like it's too late to pivot. Besides, who would hire someone as old as me?

Not sure what to do. I'm getting more miserable about it by the day."

I got invated to take the test after short talk with HR. I scored 92% percent and didn't get any response from HR for a week now. How long does the recruitment process for intership in big corporations that hire hundreds of interns take ? Is it possible that i got rejected because i didn't get 100% ?

This internship offer can be used by me to stay in US after completing my Masters in may and work with them. After that when they resume hiring i will get an official Job offer.

Are there any legal repercussions i should be worried about as an international student. Are there any other pros and cons to this way. I feel this way is advantageous to me as i can wait on other companies which have put me on hold and have this company A as my safety net.

fw5ex4,2,2020-04-06,Opinions on taking leave of absence / dropping out altogether for an industry role?,ExistentialCris3s,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fw5ex4/opinions_on_taking_leave_of_absence_dropping_out/,"I'm currently a self-taught first-year CS college student, who has done a fair amount of work in the tech industry during HS, through internships in industry and academia, and personal projects and other endeavors. I took a gap semester in the fall to continue my industry internship for a prominent startup, which I've found to be incredibly exhilarating, as it has helped me accelerate my growth both technically and interpersonally. Ever since starting school and especially with the big transition to an online format at my university, I've been tossing around the question in my head whether or not I should stay in school, or leave it altogether to pursue an entry-level full-time position, or pursue an internship with the prospect of become a full-time hiree.

I don't want to say that college is at all beneath me, especially since I've been able to meet phenomenal students and faculty alike, and learn new things and fill gaps of knowledge in both CS and engineering courses that I take. However, I've also realized that the workload of being in a prestigious and difficult university has bogged me down from being able to take upon part-time/contract gigs, self-teach, contribute heavily to OSS, and work on personal projects that I feel will ultimately have the biggest impact for any career aspirations. Even more, my university has projected that remote classes might be held even into the fall semester, which means that the summer classes that I am to take to catch up from my gap will also be online, plus the potential for the fall semester to remain remote as well. While this has given me more time to get back to my self-taught workflow, it's also made me question whether or not a university education is worth it at this point.

I've seen many other self-taught engineers like me go towards this path of skipping out on college and being successful, but also many that play it safe and stay in school. I would say that I'm definitely not the most academically strong individual, and that being able to do work in tech has been the only thing that I've been truly passionate about and can excel at. There's definitely a lot of other personal factors for me to consider as well, but at the moment, I'm curious about what other students/grads, engineers, HR reps/recruiters, etc. have to say about this. My current plan moving forward is to remain in school into my second year, and ultimately make a final decision towards the end of the year.

Thanks all for the insight, and please don't hesitate to ask / PM for other info!

EDIT: I'm guessing it might be more useful if I have some specific questions to kind of guide the discussion moving forward:

1. Does being a drop-out hurt your prospects of securing a senior or managerial role in the long-term?
2. Are businesses more likely to start downsizing from employees who have a lack of a college degree?
3. Have any fellow drop-outs or people you know that have dropped out end up going back to school, and if possible, why?"

I have just been admitted to the MS Robotics program at the University of Michigan. However, I am finding it difficult to decide whether or not to attend the program in the Fall mainly because of the significant cost. 

For background, I am just finishing up my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from a smaller university in Canada. 

I plan on completing robotics masters at michigan in the 3 semester minimum which will cost about $75000 USD (25000 per semester). But not only the tuition cost, I have been also trying to consider the opportunity cost of not working for that year, which will probably be closer to $125000 (75000 tuition + 50000 working for a year maybe?) There are opportunities in the second year to get paid research positions, so I may stay longer than 3 semesters if I receive that funding for tuition. However, I have received mixed responses from past students about availability of funding so it’s seems like a 50/50 shot at getting that financial help.

I see an MS as simply a path to a better career in robotics, and do not plan on doing a PHD at this point. I really do love robotics and working on robotics projects, and have specific interests in computer vision, perception. I have spent almost  2 years now through multiple internships during my undergraduate degree working on robotics related projects and really don’t doubt my interest in the field. 

I have started looking at some jobs over the last couple months that I have been interested in and most of them would like or require a masters of some kind. However, there are also plenty of general software/elec jobs for robotics companies/projects that I think would also like. My undergraduate degree has not given me much experience in the robotics field and I think Michigan would be a really big step up and would also provide and lot of connections in the field as well as sort of start my transition to the US where there is a lot more opportunity.

I was hoping I would be able to decide if I was doing my masters after weighting the current job market but it turns out I will have to make the decision of whether or not I am doing a masters long before I will be able to start applying for jobs starting September this year. I have also considered maybe working for a bit beforehand but also don’t want to throw out my acceptance to the program when there is no guarantee I will get in next year.

fw822z,2,2020-04-06,Really want to quit my grocery job with everything going on,furon747,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fw822z/really_want_to_quit_my_grocery_job_with/,"Edit: Male in early 20s

Hey everyone, for some context, I'm a computer science student graduating after two more classes this fall, and have been working at one of the US's largest grocery chains for four years come the 23rd. I live with both of my parents and my sibling. I wanted to know what you guys think.

To be blunt, I want to quit for more than a few reasons, but this pandemic has largely become the main reason.  

Firstly, I hate my department. I liked and worked in another but talked a bit and got moved Jan. 2019. I legitimately hate my department. I'm calm but very open about it to people in store and my own department as well. After four years of retail the job as a whole kinda sucks. It's a first job so it's expected, but I've just had enough of costumers and the mind numbing tasks we do each day.

With everything going on, going to work makes me kinda nervous now. I work with the vitamins, hand sanitizer, soap, etc., so I'm interacting with people constantly telling them we're out of item X. Additionally, the prospect of getting the virus itself really scares me, coupled with the fact that both of my parents are in their early  60s and stay at home now most of the time, in the event I get it I don't want to risk infecting them. Two workers have left (temporarily) since each have a loved one that they don't want to get sick, so now I've picked up more hours despite wanting to work as little as possible during this pandemic.

Probably the most selfish reason, but since my classes have moved online, I wanted a month or so of just relaxing as my last serious semester comes to a close. I know it makes me sound lazy, but my friends all have been able to stay at home during all of this, and those lucky enough to be in an internship have been able to work at home as well. I feel a little annoyed in a sense, I'm jealous I guess. 

I know if the economy takes a dip a low paying job is still a *job*, but maybe I've just grown contemptuous towards it.  I have a vacation happening in three weeks, and I've considered putting my two weeks in and taking my remaining PTO days before I leave. 

I'm really torn though. I'm young and a job is a job, but I feel like quitting is the wrong choice since it's such a huge commitment and change of a lifestyle. With everything going on though and more news each day of people getting sick and dying it makes me feel unsafe and vulnerable going out to work. What do you guys think?"

fw9t0l,16,2020-04-06,"Left career as lawyer to get a CS degree, now scared I'll have to return to law with tail between my legs (34 yrs old)",jo__mo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fw9t0l/left_career_as_lawyer_to_get_a_cs_degree_now/,"**The Context:**

I was unhappy and uninterested with my work as a lawyer, but I was happy learning how to code in my spare time and I had always been a computer enthusiast. Working with technology was not something I thought was an option for me as I nearly failed high school math and was encouraged to pursue liberal arts.

After fumbling around as a lawyer for 7 years at several firms in several different practice areas, I saw no light at the end of the tunnel for me in terms of having an enjoyable career in law (especially due to work-life balance issues in the profession).

I saw that a local university (in Ontario Canada) had a CS second degree program that would only take about 1 to 2 years to complete. I spoke with an independent career advisor and we both agreed that going into this program would be the right career move for me long term. We agreed the money may be less than law, but the career satisfaction would be high and so would the job prospects.

Everything was set up well for me to return to school. I had a lot of savings and a supportive wife, family and friends. I quit my job and returned to school in May 2019 (note: I had to retake high school math while working as a lawyer to gain admission to this program).

**My Experience at University:**

Initially, going back to school felt like the best decision I'd ever made. I was so glad to leave law. It felt like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders.

Academically, I've been very successful as a CS student. I've managed to achieve a 4.0 GPA (96/100%). I wanted prove to myself that I had it in me to be successful at math/CS if I worked hard.

I've thoroughly enjoyed my studies, but I've also realized how difficult school can be from a mental health / stress standpoint (especially exams). I think the stress is compounded by the fact that I habitually compare myself to my peers who are successful professionals and are achieving a lot more than me personally, professionally, and financially.

**My Current Feelings:**

I'm about 4 months away from finishing the program and I'm starting to feel a different kind of anxiety. It's related to re-entering the workforce (or rather, the potential failure to do so). I'm afraid I'm going to have a failure to launch. That I'm not going to be able to find a developer job.

I am so scared of disappointing everyone who supported me in pursuing this career change, especially my wife who has been a major supporter and is hoping I can find a job quickly so we can start a family.

**My Major Concerns:**

1. **I have no CS work experience:** The program I'm in is 1-2 years of straight classes without breaks (even during summer) and thus there is no time to get internships during the program.

2. **I don't think I can program well enough:** Despite my high grades, I don't feel like I know how to program well enough to have companies interested in hiring me.

3. **I don't have an amazing portfolio:** There was no capstone project in my program and I've spent the majority of my time studying for my classes, so I don't have much to show off except many smaller programs I completed as assignments.

**My Current Plans:**

I have only 2 courses left until I finish my degree. I'll be taking them online this summer (they have been moved online).

My small course load is going to leave me a lot of time in the summer to do whatever it takes to get my first CS job. I have purchased a web dev ""bootcamp"" course on Udemy, a Spring Boot Java course, and a copy of Cracking the Coding Interview (note: Java is my most used language right now and I noticed a lot of companies near me are looking for Java and Spring/Spring Boot experience).

I am planning on mastering these materials alongside my courses this summer as well as sending out resumes.

**I am looking for ANY advice, feedback, or support. Thank you.**"

I am international student who’ll be an incoming freshman next fall and I got into UofT (CS stream) and UBC (Faculty of Science and plan on majoring in CS). I’m in the process of deciding between the two and internship (coop or PEY) opportunities is one of the criteria I’m considering while making a decision. From what I’ve read on the internet (including Reddit), here’s what I was able to compile regarding both and wanted to hear y’all’s opinions and thoughts regarding which one would give me better chances of employment after graduation. (I am posting this on both UBC and UofT subreddits to hear opinions from students at both unis)

**UTSG PEY:**

*Pros:*

* Longer working term (12-16 months), employer will get to know me better and higher chance of a return offer.

*Cons:*

* One shot at applying to internships/lower quality internships applications. Chances of landing an internship at one of the big companies AND receiving a return offer is close to zero. 
* Stuck at the same company for a long time if I end up not liking the position/what I do/the company atmosphere.

&amp;#x200B;

**UBC Co-op:**

*Pros:*

* 4x or 5x 4-month work terms, totaling 16-20 months of work experience (more than UofT’s).
* Once I have 3-4 successful internships, I’ll have a higher chance of landing an internship at one of the big companies (increasing the chances of getting a return offer).
* More experience with internship applications, bettering the quality of job applications after graduation. 
* Exposed to different companies, making me adapt to different environments quickly. 
* Might look better on resumes.

*Cons:*

* Shorter work terms, might now be involved in long-term projects/less time for an employer to see your worth, less chance of a return offer (?)
* A lot of moving around (not a huge con as I’m international - far away from home either way - and I like traveling but housing might create inconveniences) 

I am currently stuck between these two options and job opportunities after graduation is one of the biggest criteria I’m considering. Which one would give me more opportunities job wise do you guys think? I’ll appreciate any input. 

Have a great day and stay safe y’all!"

I'm currently a senior at a decent university, and I just wanted to get some thoughts out and maybe ask for some advice. I'm someone who is considering graduate school, but theory classes and test taking have never been my strong suit.. my GPA is pretty good (3.78) only because the core programming classes have inflated grades, since the programming portions outweigh the exams by a ton. I've gotten grades within the A to A- range for these classes because I was able to do well on the programming assignments. I don't take too many classes at the same time, so I'm not like an extremely stellar student or anything. I usually just took 1 to 2 cs classes per semester.

But exams, on the other hand. Oh boy. I'm so bad at test taking. It's so hard for me to study, and my study strategies are really bad. I never knew how to study for these mathy, theory classes. All I did was just go through my notes and lecture slides and then hope for the best. This got me through for the most part but there were times when even though I had studied the slides, the questions would just be like... what the fuck. and I would get scores in the C - B+ range, sometimes even D range. I've gotten a B- in my theory of computation class, and a B- in Linear algebra. Even so, I still managed to get my overall GPA to around 3.78 and major gpa to around 3.5

I'm considering grad school but I've looked at the graduation requirements and I'm see that minimum grade requirements for graduating a masters is that you have to get a B minimum in every class you take. This worries me because I've gotten B-'s before in a couple classes so this sounds really daunting. I don't really feel the need to go to a top 10 CS school or anything (although that would be nice), just a decent one. The only thing I feel like I have going for me is that I have internships (FANG) and startup experience.

What I'm trying to ask is - does this mean grad school not for me? Will it be likely I won't be able to get my degree considering that my grades/test taking fall below the general requirements for a master's degree? What can I do to improve my test taking/study skills in the future?

fwbn96,3,2020-04-06,Is Software Engineering for me?,callum_grey,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/fwbn96/is_software_engineering_for_me/,"\*\*A bit of background (feel free to skip this):\*\*

I've always loved technology, I've been working with computers since I was little. Obviously, at first it was just playing games, but then I naturally started learning about fixing various problems, hardware, software, etc...I became quite good with computers mainly as far as ""fixing anything"" is concerned (you know, like when your mum asks you how to open a PDF file...)So I went to study CompSci at uni and it seems I really do have *a little* advantage - I understand the concepts a bit more easily because I've dealt with them, I am already quite familiar with programming and many other things. I also work as an ""IT specialist"" for company where I deal with basic IT stuff, like installing software and basically fixing anything that breaks (just anything IT related).Obviously, in my course, there are people *much* better than me, these hardcore programmers that have been doing this since they were born or idk... But still, I think I'm better then average.I'm not being overconfident.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The problem:\*\*

Therefore, the next step for me is to find an internship. Obvious role was a Software Engineer/Developer.Okay, from the requirements, I found out I still don't know a lot of stuff - that's normal, I expected and I am ready to learn more and more. But the more I read about it, the more it felt like I know nothing. No chance I would get the job.

Okay, so maybe pure software isn't for me - after all, my experience is more general since I am interested in networks, graphics, security, hardware, ... as well. So I looked for other IT positions, but the result was the same - it was unbelievably overwhelming how much I don't know. After all these years, it feels like I'm basically at the same level as my peers. Like, what was the point then? If I know so little after so many years, how long would it take to be able to get *any* job?

Now, don't get me wrong, I obviously know there's always infinite number of things to learn. But given my experience, I would expect that I'd be able to get a basic job within the IT field.

Does anyone have the same experience? Am I really still not good enough or do I just look for wrong position?"
fwbtk4,1,2020-04-06,How bad is reneging?,serawrr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fwbtk4/how_bad_is_reneging/,"So I recently accepted an offer from Atlassian for their software developer internship program during summer (based in Sydney).
I was largely able to land an interview there through my connections with the recruiters, who I was introduced to by my manager at a previous internship. I also have connections to many people who are either currently interning at Atlassian or are current full-time software engineers there.
Note: I've completed all the necessary background checks and signed the contract already.
The internship goes from November to February.

After accepting the offer, I decided to continue interviewing at various tech companies to gain more technical interview experience and connect with more recruiters. Now that I'm at the final stage for one particular **F**AANG for their summer internship in London, I'm starting to feel a bit conflicted.
The internship goes from January to March.

Here are my pros and cons for each:

**Atlassian**:

Pros:

* Fairly well known name in tech
* Located in my city
* Potential for full-time conversion/internship extension

Cons:

* Not as big a name as FAANG
* Feels like I'm giving up a huge opportunity :(

**FAANG**:

Pros:

* Very well known big tech company
* Located in London (opportunity to travel)
* Potential for full-time conversion

Cons:

* Will potentially burn bridges due to needing to renege (I'm the most worried about this, since I feel very fortunate and lucky to be able to have made these connections)
* Overlaps slightly with my uni term

If I were to receive an offer from the FAANG, should I renege the Atlassian offer and risk potentially burning bridges with valuable connections in the future to intern at the FAANG? Or should I decline the FAANG offer and maybe apply again next year (will be for grad)?

Any advice/thoughts appreciated."

fwgpvs,2,2020-04-07,Dealing with non-software people / managers thinking software is easy,DagDreamer93,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fwgpvs/dealing_with_nonsoftware_people_managers_thinking/,"I've been working for a bit less than a year now at a small instrumentation company (started as an intern). The main software leader with years of experience just left a few weeks before I arrived, so me and the rest of the devs (4 others, 2 of them new arrivals) had to deal directly with the boss and the head of R&amp;D.

The problem is that both of them are from mechanical/instrumentation background. Even though they know how difficult their own fields can be, they seem to underestimate the complexity of software engineering. They think that software is some kind of magic that gets written and forgotten, and that is easy to do. When I think about it, I like to bring up a meme that I saw before, a news headline talking about some drones being able to detect each other and not collide mid-air, and some guy commenting how easy it would have been, something like:

if (goingToCollide) { dont() ; }

that's how I like to portray their view of software, it's a bit extreme, but funny enough.

What made matters worse, is that, as a software team, with the fresh heads we had, we decided to do things differently from what was done before: there was a lot of spaghetti code, no documentation, no tests, etc. you name it, if it is a bad software practice, it surely was there. We decided to flip things, make sure our code was tested, well designed, documented, we're also trying to TDD, improving deployments, etc. And with well maintained code, comes delays and more time needed for programs to be finished, and, you guessed it, the bosses being unhappy of delays thinking that the job was a piece of cake and should have been done earlier.

In a way, I want to give them some credit, because at some point, we needed to convince them about doing that switch, about how messed their code base was, and how much it would hurt the company in the future. They were open enough to acknowledge it, and decided together with them to halt development for some time, establish best practices and try to repair the old code. But now they're at it again, thinking that this restructuring should have been finished earlier.

In a sense I understand their need for speed, to sell, make money, and pay bills and salaries. I understand the ambitions of the boss to expand, increase sales, and get a firm grip on his market. But this is really nerve wrecking: Having somebody hammering you every now and then about something they don't fully comprehend ; Your mind being torn apart between trying to do decent software, or saying ""Damn it, just give him his spaghetti and move on"" ; thinking how they perceive you as non productive, while you're trying your best, etc. And as a fresh grad in my first real professional experience, this is making me doubt my choices, and giving me bad insight on how the industry looks like.

Has any of you had an experience like this? How did you handle it?

How would you suggest turning things around?

How does your company deal with ""speed""?"
fwgx5q,5,2020-04-07,"My first steps in my journey to stop being controlling, jealous and needy",blasekillers1,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/fwgx5q/my_first_steps_in_my_journey_to_stop_being/,"TLDR: I met a girl who is an intern nurse and because of a combination of her not having the energy because of her very busy internship (Its commonly known that these internship put a lot of strain on your social life) and also the appearance of corona we had to break contact for a while because i was also needy from my side. This made me realise that my needyness and my anxiety from this had actually no real basis as this girls still tried to make time for me. This realisation caused me to go fix my issues and hopefully continue where the girl and i left after our internships are over. I try to keep a as low as possible expactation to not be dissapointed and i realised that if she met someone else, she still helped me on my path to happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

My journey to self improvement began about a couple of months ago, i met a nice girl on a concert and got her number and we started talking and eventually went out on a date. One of the issues we had is that she is an internship nurse in her last year and quite busy. After her workdays she would be basically done for and go to bed or she had to finish stuff like treatment plans for the week. She would have time on saturday and sunday but she wasnt the most active person on whats app too.

She realised herself that she wasnt able to start a relationship and felt pretty guilty about it but didnt want to waste my time. We tried to make it work, but I needed more contact than she could give me. She would still try to make time and we would talk every weekend and keep very casual contact over whatsapp, wait until her internship would be over in 4 months and the start again. But then Corona showed up and she became even more busy. We both couldn't keep it up, me being needy and she just not having the energy she wanted to put in it and having to work more because of Corona. We agreed that we would break contact and try again after her and my internship as well but also made very clear to each other that we couldnt guarantee what would happen.

This became a wake up call, because i would soon realise that my thoughts were that she didnt care about me or that she wouldn't put in the effort allthough these were wrong. When i went through our texts and the things we did, i realised that i had unrealistic thoughts about how much contact people have in a relationship. She did put effort in it that she could even when the rest of her social life was also negatively affected by her internship (it is a common saying at those studies that the internships kill your social life) and even when she realised she couldnt give me what i wanted she still tried.

I realised i was doing things i did in a previous relationship too, i Was checking when she came online to check if she wasnt lying to me, i was needy in contact. i would never blame her but i would keep most of my struggles in my self because i knew what i was doing was wrong but it was a way for me to survive with uncertainty. i had 1 breakdown when we were still talking where she was really helping in putting things in perspective.

After my realisations i decided it had to stop, i couldnt grow as a person or have a relationship with her or any other girl unless i fixed my Controlling issues. I quickly recognised a few events in and before my past relationship that really triggered me going to controllong, and jealousy as a person. Currently im researching on coping with anxiety and analysing what went wrong. My goal is to have analysed my issues, learned to cope with my anxiety and have way to deal with it when it comes back and learn lessons from my own faults and insecurities that disprove my feelings before the end of June when i and the girl decided to have contact again allthough i know i wont fix all my feeling that have been my way of life for years. I try to lower my expectations of the outcome to not get dissapointed if thing dont work out by a very important thing for myself: Even if she would meet someone else, dont be sad, she is happy now and she helped you get on a path where you can be happy too, the time wasnt right and you have decided to do something about it.

Thank you for making it this far and taking the effort of reading my post, i know its a long one, but i guess i needed to get my thoughts on black and white as part of arranging my thoughts."

Like many of you, I went through several rounds of interviews earlier in the year and was fortunate enough to get an internship offer from my dream company.  The only problem is, now it looks like the internship will be canceled. Not 100% confirmed yet but likely.  FWIW, my internship was/is with a CPG company.

I know I'm not the only one in this situation. To those of you who have already had internships cancelled, how have you proceeded forward?  Are you touching base with other companies that made you internship offers? Are you starting from scratch and sending out applications again? Or, have you accepted the fact that you may not even have an internship this summer?

This is new territory for most of us, I would imagine.  I would love to know how others are dealing with the situation. 

TBH, I find myself really jealous of my colleagues who haven't had internships cancelled yet :(  It feels really unfair to strategically sign with a company that would allow for the greatest career advancement, only to have the rug pulled out from under my feet.  Such is life..."
fwksob,8,2020-04-07,100% rejection rate from the big 4,beniic,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/fwksob/100_rejection_rate_from_the_big_4/,"Hi guys, I’m hoping someone can give me some insight as to why I can’t land an interview at the big 4.

Context: 

Australian grad from 2019 Adelaide Uni, and I have a distinction GPA (for reference that’s around a 3.2 out of 4). I hold a Bachelor in Economics and a Bachelor in Finance. I’m currently 3 months into my full time job as an IB analyst in a 1bn+ FO/EB in Singapore. I’m Asian but am very much Australian. I can’t even speak Chinese. I had to tear my mind apart to figure out ways to articulate how I could add value to Singaporean firms. I do not have any prior relationships/referrals to the firms I worked in within Singapore.

Over the last 2 years I’ve made over 400 applications to internship, graduate programs, and everything in between. My applications are mostly in Australia at firms like the big 4 and commercial banks. I have an offer rate of 1%. My success rate in Singapore is a lot higher at around 10% (and I’m not even a citizen or permanent resident!).

My issue:

I have never made it to the AC or f2f  interview for any of the big 4 or mid-tier. I applied to intern/vacationer roles in my penultimate year of uni (2018) and grad roles in 2019 and 2020. That’s 4 applications every year for 3 years and 0 interviews to date. I apply for deals/TAS business lines.

In the darkness of my most recent rejections, I decided to reach out to the reddit community for insight. 

Here are the bullet points about myself which I leverage. 
 
- I have been to final round interviews at BB IB and boutique - with a yield of 1 offer which I rejected to work in Singapore.

- I have internship and graduate experience in Singapore at multi-bn$ EBs’ and FOs’. I’ve done an internship every summer of my 4 year double degree.

- My bosses in Singapore are almost exclusively ex bludge bracket (BB) MDs at Goldman/UBS/JPM or Schroders/Blackrock and the younger guys (still my bosses) have won awards in their BB’s for their performance before moving to their current shops

- I have failed 1 first year subject but managed to get my GPA back to distinction average in the same year.

- During Uni I volunteered by founding a student society based around employ-ability ironic right). With my team - we managed to win some student society awards. I am also a faculty ambassador and stuff like that.

- I used to play state level badminton and was nominated for a uni award

- I competed in case comps like the UBS investment banking challenge - where my team took Australian national second place

- In all my psychometric assessments I return scores usually within the top 1 or 2% in all sections.

My peers:

I know people in my Australian cohort who somehow get into big 4 programs like it’s nothing. But their GPA/internship exposure is average. I’m not trying to down play others, but even after talking to them about their experiences - I see a huge gap between them and my friends that are deciding whether to accept grad offers from the likes of CS/JPM. The funny thing is they’re in the same boat as me. One of my close friends scored a winter internship in IB at JPM. But even he can’t get through the video interview for big 4.

More on my actual applications:

I really take each application I make personally, and where I have to - I write genuine and articulate cover letters which I feel bridge the gap between my core values and the company’s.

My resume/CV and cover letters have all been thoroughly checked and revised by my contacts at IBs and HFs in New York and Singapore. It’s come to the point where I’ve been told to redo it multiple times until they thought it reached EB standard. Each word is there for a reason.

Where I can, I submit letters of professional reference which I worked on with my referees to best highlight my ability and acumen. To my knowledge, only in Singapore do hiring managers read reference letters. 

As for my video interviews, I have scripted answers which I’ve refined with the help of people I know in HR at an Australian bank. I have a pool of around 100 behavioural questions that my peers and I all put into a master sheet so we know exactly which question gets asked from what company. My answers are usually balanced between my work experience, volunteering/community exposure, sports, and case competitions. I try to articulate my actions and how they reflect the values of the company.

In the applications I’m successful in, I usually do well in psychometric, get issued a case study (Singapore firms), get a phone interview filled with behavioural, progress to f2f technical, then to f2f behavioural.

—TLDR—

My previous internships and my current job:

I am happy where I am. But I am also frustrated because of these big 4 rejections. My friends have gone through big 4 vacationer programs and told me work that they do is useless in the context of the team they’re in. (Their words not mine). Meanwhile in my Singaporean internships, I’m getting feedback about my financial model for live transactions and equity research. Or even worse - I take on the responsibility of being the point of contact for due diligence for key investments and what not. Being and intern at the time, I couldn’t help but adapt to the pressure and pace.

In my current role my responsibilities cover 2 areas.

1) Sell side deals. 

2) Capital raising.

So far in my 3 months at my firm, I have helped close one sell side transaction and am trying to originate AUD for our firms new products.

So my questions are... 

1) In the big 4, how on earth do hiring managers shortlist for assessment centre/face to face interviews? 

2) What qualities in a candidate get them through?

3) What do I lack that gets me that juicy automated rejection letter?

If anyone has some idea or is experiencing the same issue as me I’d love to explore this further!"

Leading up to graduation I applied for a bunch of jobs. Interviewed for a few but most were looking for immediate hires however I was still in school. Started panicking and felt like I needed to plan for worst case scenario of never getting hired and I applied to grad school aswell. Fast forward a month and I got a job offer from a decent company. Was excited but realized the pay was less than what I made as an intern over the summer. In honesty my career field is a little niche so not a plethora of jobs and I would have loved to go back and work where I interned but they didnt have the space. Side not starting pay for where I interned would have also been significantly higher for what I do.

Anyway I accepted the job offer as it was all I had and the only place to even get back to me. As I started working I realized I really dont like it. To keep it short its different then what I expected from the description and I really dont do much. Fast forward a few more months completely forgot about grad school but not only did I get accepted they offered me a full ride.

I was going to spend this time on a new side project if it does fall through, but I’m curious what others are actually making for side projects? I currently have a Python ML project, a Node.js CRUD app, and a PHP CRUD app which was my Web Programming class final project. 



It seems like all I know how to do is make simple CRUD apps and I don’t have any ideas for a more intensive / impressive application to show off. What have you guys done in the past or are currently working on?

I am currently a second-year Computer Science and Engineering Major at a decent university. Throughout my time in university, I have struggled with a lot of courses but have been able to somehow get by, but due to only remaining afloat my GPA is at a borderline 2.9. For the past two quarters, I have tried to just focus on school and getting to a 3.0 overall but feel that I am doing myself a disservice by not applying for internships or research.  I want to try and take advantage of this online studying and properly allocate time to bettering myself (through researching career paths, bettering my portfolio, expanding resume, etc.) My issue is that I have so many things to work on and better that I don't know where to start as well as not knowing where to look. My school has really emphasized Computer Science throughout my past two years and while I do enjoy (yet struggle) with these courses I also have an interest in engineering. Because of this broad degree, I have been confused as to where I should apply and what I should be doing. Basically, I am posting is to ask where do I look into internship opportunities for computer engineering / electrical engineering/ CS, and how I can better prepare, as well as asking am I starting too late? Any and all help is gratefully welcomed."

Can't they fucking leave those cheap ones alone?!!!,TooSlowH,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/fwrd06/why_would_we_people_steal_cheap_bicycles_just_why/,"A year ago I bought a brand new bicycle (for a semi-cheap price.) It was nothing special, on the contrary it was a little low quality. I mainly used it to reach my work destinations (I was doing doing a uni internship that was like 50 minutes away by walking). 3/4 months after buying it, unfortunately it was stolen (I used to place it under my residence, had no place inside and it was against the rules to get bicycles in.)  

I am so frustrated and angry until this day. I simply cannot afford to buy another bicycle. It is fucked up how people just decide to steal something that is not theirs. How pathetic can they be? Unfortunately, my bicycle was not the first to be stolen. And no matter how good the locks were, they would always manage to break them and steal the bicycles. 

This does not only apply to bicycles, but also to food. I live in a shared residence and I always always have missing food (vegetables, fruits, meat..etc), drinks,..etc from the fridge. And no I cannot buy a mini-fridge because my room is very small and I literally have 7 free steps to do. No more space for objects. I keep those 7 steps to do some workout space for me. I cannot afford to move out and I cannot afford to live in better conditions. I am still a student..

The bicycle thing is something that has been bothering me so much.. I wish that in the future we would have some way to trace down the thieves and get them punched for their ruthless and merciless actions and decisions....

I know people who would just go into Chinese stores and steal from them. Why? I ask. They'd proudy say ""They are rich af, won't matter if I steal a piece or two""....  This is exactly the same concept as stealing food, bicycles..etc.. they are all in the same category. Thieves. 

A thief can be a politician who steals the money of the state and of the people. A thief can be defined as someone taking something that is not his or her's to start with. 

I am sick and infuriated by the general public, humans are slowly and gradually becoming savages once again. 

I am sorry for this long rant, I'm so pissed off and I couldn't find anyone to share this with. Thank you if you have read it. 

Be safe and have a great evening/night."

I graduated 2 years ago and have been working as a software engineer. My ultimate goal has always been to work in computer vision R&amp;D in industry. So I need to pursue an MS or preferably a PhD in CS. During my undergrad I did not participate in research, with the exception of a research paper for an algorithm design class. I had a part time internship for the last two years of school and was focused on trying to keep my GPA above a 3.0. I finished with a 3.1, didn’t get the score I wanted on the GRE quant sections so I went into industry while I study to increase the score. 

1. Is it possible to get into a thesis MS or PhD program without undergrad research experience? Or are you just kind of blocked forever? 

2. Is it possible to overcome a less competitive undergrad GPA? With for example a perfect GRE quant score. For a top 15 school?"

It was a space that I had a strong interest in, and while they didn't traditionally take undergrads, there was the suggestion that if I performed extremely well it might be a possibility.

My internship has now been cancelled and while I'll try, the chances of me being able to convert to full time are essentially zero without any in-person work experience.

Recent announcements from GS and JPM have me thinking about what the FT recruiting landscape might look like this summer - especially for IB. Part of me is half-hopeful that reduced time with the current intern class will open up more FT spaces, but I think it's equally if not more likely that recruiters will act in 'good faith' and fill the analyst class exclusively with interns. 

Does anyone else have any opinions/insights on how things might shape up?

I go to a semi-target, have a strong GPA, and have decent freshman/sophomore internships. I have a backup remote internship for this summer either way.

Obviously everything is still up in the air right now, but curious to hear what people might think about my specific situation as well and if they have any advice on what I could potentially do going forward."

I am currently a fourth year CS major from NEU and I am planning on pursuing a career in web development. I did not receive very good co-op opportunities nor good GPA in NEU. Therefore I think I am in a very bad situation compared to my classmate, so I wish I can be educated on how can I improve myself so at least land an offer when I apply job upon graduation.

Here is some detail about myself:

My GPA is about 3. I have two co-op opportunity before, one of them is a UI/UX position where I am responsible for helping the Business to design their software (not coding it). In my second co op I was working in a financial company writing some react component for their web app. I have some personal web apps, a store app in react + firebase, a MEAN stack allowing user to post/read recipe, and a Django+react project that is like a movie web app with recommendation.

I will be graduating in June 2021 and I currently been offered a six-month internship but just in QA using Java TestNG (which I believe is a pretty old, outdated legacy framework), and this internship is unlikely to be turned into a full-time offer for me to use as a intermediate until I got a full time offer. I can only access developer code as read-on for the company, and I don't know how much I can gain in that experience. I am planning on using that six month to build up my resume as much as possible

Can someone give me some detailed advice or feedback on my situation base on the above concern or steps on where should I work on from where I am now?

Here is the aixth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).

All the best,

\--Nick

fwx7zz,1,2020-04-07,Should I leave to my new apartment or try to salvage my family relationship?,momothemonkey,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fwx7zz/should_i_leave_to_my_new_apartment_or_try_to/,"Hello, 

TLDR: I gotten an apartment to get my peace of mind but parents don't want me to leave and are getting slowly more aggressive. Course of action (given I already have an apartment I can afford)?

Growing up I think there was something wrong with me. I never really felt the love form my parents, I lacked any friends, got depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. I think my unhappiness came from two main sources. The first being a religion I was disgusted with but had to practice for fear of repercussion. I live in Canada so I wouldn't be getting a public execution thankfully but I was seriously worried about going homeless thanks to my dad's threats.

The second source would be my parents. They gave me just enough to get by. I got food, a place to sleep, live, eat, my education. But I pretty much felt worthless and hated myself because of it. My parents felt like super strict religious conservatives. They would pressure me to not go hang with possible friends. I feel like I live under a rock because I don't share the same experiences other families do I think. Even now  I'm pretty much out of touch with others. I don't know how to explain it. But my main thoughts towards them were that I have to be a good faithful child that doesn't talk back and that if I do then its the streets for me. I know now that I took their words quite literally but I didn't want to risk it. Besides what parents threaten their own children like that? Its my normal life so idk..

To avoid going homeless, I lost friends and potential friends I would've liked and focused on university for 2 years until I got my internship that lasts a whole year long. This internship pays pretty well and I've saved all the way up to now to get my own apartment and can possibly afford my expenses for 2 years so I feel confident I'm set.

I broke the news to them that I'm not religious last month  and that went ... okay. They want me to continue prayer and think im going through a phase even though I told them I haven't believed in years... I expected to get kicked out tbh but damn I was surprised. 

I told them I wanted to move twice also but they did not like that. It was mainly just a bunch of yelling and then the next day would be like nothing happened. So I told them recently I got an apartment. My dad implied that I could move but it'd be a 'one way street' meaning no coming back ofc. He hasn't said a word to me since.

My mom came in yesterday telling me to break my lease and to stay home for another 2 years... I really don't want to waste another 2 years of my life. She said I could do whatever but I don't buy it.  Besides you can't break the lease so simply here in Quebec but that fact didn't seem to enter her mind. Also it seems like she cares more about her image because she would bring up what other people thought of our family which I don't give a shit about. I firmly and calmly said no but she said she expected me to cancel the lease for the next day. 

Tonight she was more aggressive and kept on yelling. I hate to raise my voice but also I think I'm a pushover because I really wanted to yell back but just let her carry on. Then she started with more threats praying for my failure if I left and that I have to fork over 50 thousand to make up for what I owed her for raising me. I told her why'd she give birth to me but to no use ofc. 

Dear, reddit... Do I just walk away from this? I hate getting walked over like im an easy target or something. I've listened to them for as long as I could. I would even give up seeing friends because they firmly said no. I feel like I would rather harm myself then live in this 'home' I don't even like. I'm terrible at social relationships including my parents, but it seems like there's no equal grounds to talk on. I'm always hit with ultimatums like 'If you want to move out you have to get married' or 'If you want to be like that you can just leave' (lol because that's what im doing). 

I've done what I could do to maintain my relationship with my parents but seems like If i do move out then I would lose that. Its not like I care what they think honestly. More like I'll be losing another connection in my life that would be useful in the future. Having parents to rely on would be better than none right? But I can't seem to rely on them. I don't even go to them for emotional support. 

What the hell do I do? Am I making the right choices in life? Will I end up dying a terrible death from her prayers coming true? Will I ever become a normal functioning person and fit in with society?

&amp;#x200B;

Debating running away asap before they get more aggressive...

&amp;#x200B;

Am I really a pushover? Should I have been more assertive? More aggressive? I hate confrontation or nonsensical yelling matches.

Update: Left with most of my stuff because it was too much."

Ultimately I want to start my own business and I have a fair amount of capital saved and growing for that.

I've been debating how to spend my time both during and immediately after my degree, and wanted some advice from others who have been down the same path. Conveniently, I live in the bay area and I'm more than willing to spend the money on anything that will help my future in SE. What would be the best ways to do this? Here are some ideas I've had:

During:

1) Take a coding school (coding bootcamp) in the summer while working on my degree.

2) Go to hackathons/ meetups and learn from/ network with other coders.

3) Volunteer to be a tutor/ TA for professors at my school.

4) ?

After:

a) Get a CS Master's degree. I can do it in 1 year at my current school or 2 years at another school.

b) Do internships and work at tech companies to learn their practices to later apply them to my own business.

c) Go directly on my own and start a business.

d) ?

I had a psychologist strongly suggest I pursue testing for a math learning disorder as I had severe symptoms for literally my entire life. 

I struggle so badly with math and math heavy subjects. I could not tell time on an analogue clock until I was like 10. I never learned my multiplication tables. I cannot do ANY math in my head. I couldn’t even READ numbers for a long time. Like a normal person would see 1,628 and say “one thousand, six hundred and twenty eight”. I would say something like “one....sixty two....eight”. I can’t remember dates, because there’s a number involved. I constantly transpose and come up with numbers and make stupid mistakes on tests and assignments. 

I wanted to go to medical school so fucking badly. I always wanted to be a surgeon as I’m very good with my hands and excelled in anatomy classes. I’m so bad at math and just so stupid I would never get in, and if I did get in I would never get a residency, and if I got a residency I would probably go on to accidentally kill someone because I’m so fucking stupid. 

I wanted to join the military and follow in the footsteps of many of my family members. Make everyone proud. Had to go to physical therapy for knee problems. Long history of psychiatric disorders and medication. Brief institutionalization. Horrible migraines and bad vision. They wouldn’t take me. Ever. My ex military boyfriend made an off handed comment that I’d probably crack in basic. Que crying in the bathroom because I knew he was right. 

I changed my major to psychology, hoping I could go to graduate school to become a therapist and help people. Realized I only have a casual interest in psychology. And I’m shit in my classes. Everyone in my classes is going for clinical psych too. And the majority of them are smarter, more involved, have internships, and generally just better than me. Shit. I may be dumb, but I can recognize when I have little to no chance of getting something. 

When I was in high school I was on the cross country and track teams. I ran distance. I worked so hard to the point that I developed an exercise addiction, which was fueled by my body dysmorphia. Started having extremely severe knee pain to the point where I walked like I was 80. X rays were done and the backs of my patellas were jagged from repeated damage. My cartilage was degenerating. My outer quads were dragging my kneecaps towards the outside of my leg, causing improper tracking. I went to physical therapy and it helped a little. 

I pushed so hard and it wasn’t good enough. I had coaches tell me to lose weight and work harder even though I was running 5-9 miles per day every day and doing weight training. I never missed a practice, I did running clinics and training camps. I ran into my old middle school track coach and I excitedly told him my personal best time for the mile. He said, “well what are the other girls running?” I told him and he just kind of smirked at me. Still wasn’t fast enough. 

I loved to run, but now the physical and emotional pain is so great I can’t run without crying. It is now looking like I am developing osteoarthritis and I’m only 22. I recently lost my health insurance and now I can’t get any sort of medical help for any problem. 

There’s been so much let down in my life. I grew up in a manipulative and emotionally neglectful/abusive family. I was raped by someone I loved and trusted. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety ever since I can remember. I’m in debt. I have no assets or money to my name except for what I make at my shitty part time job. 

I thought if I kept trying, if I kept getting back up after I had been pushed down, if I kept going, eventually things would get better. They haven’t and I’m only going downhill. 

I’m tired. I’m tired of being “strong”. I’m tired of getting back up after strings of failures. I just want to stop. I want to lay down and die like the pathetic weakling I am. I want to ease the burden on the very few people I’m close to. I have no future, why not leave now? I’m so fucking tired. Life is nothing but pain and struggle with no relief. I want to rest forever. I’m not made for this harsh world. If I start screaming I don’t think I could stop. 

Who knows, this might be the last thing I ever write. My boyfriend is asleep and I have a full script of sleeping pills and a bottle of vodka. I’ve tried getting help in every way imaginable. There’s no release from this hell except death, then the sweet, black kindness of nonexistence. 

If you read this far, which I’m sure no one will do, thank you. If I end up leaving this mortal coil tonight, goodbye."

So i'm in a weird situation right now. I am 20 yo and work as an intern at a small programming company. I have always worked at the office and there has been no real problem with my productivity until now the last couple of weeks. As everyone knows, with the corona virus outbreak a lot of people have started to work from home, and i am one of those people. I have never liked studying nor working from home, so i always sticked with the library in my university and working from the office. Now i really have to work from my home, and i didn't think it was going to be a big deal at first, but this has proven to be so much more difficult then i thought.

I literally take a week to finish stuff i usually did in a day at the office, just because i'm home. I really don't know what it is, i just cant think the way i think at the office. I turn off my phone and use a direct connection to a computer that has only work stuff in it, so i don't think its because i'm distracted.

It was my first professional job. I completed my internship there, graduated college and was hired on three months after. Next to being a supervisor I am as high as I can go. I always wanted the supervisors position once she retired but she is very indecisive about when she is retiring. There is a huge possibility I would get her job when that happens but there is also the smallest chance I won't. 

I have had many job opportunities to be a supervisor in other neighborhooding counties doing exactly what I do now but I always turned them down to stay with coworker friends, my family situation at the time, holding out for the supervisor position where I currently am and out of fear. Other than being offered those jobs I have never looked for another job. I am a state worker and have a lot of time invested and would hate to leave the state in fear of losing benefits, time saved and so forth.

I have an opportunity to move into a new position (not a supervisor one) in a neighboring county doing something completely different than what I have been doing. Under new management with new coworkers, same pay and a little more travel. I am very unhappy where I am but I am afraid I might not like the new job and be just as unhappy. 

My supervisor loves drama and feeds off of it, she favors coworkers (mainly men and whoever benefits her at the time) she has a delivery method that keeps you stressed. We are never fully staff because are always calling in and where I work if that happens you have to cover there stuff it's not a wait til they get back kind if place and it's always been like that.

I have been working from home for almost a month because of the quarantine and even being away from the office and coworkers at a distance hasn't helped. My body has physical reactions to when my boss calls me or I find out I'm stuck doing someone else crap because they've called in ""from working at home."" 

I also don't care for the work anymore. I still make sure my job duties are fulfilled because I do care about the clients but I have way less passion than I use to and I really just go through the motions because it's very repetitive at this point. I am nervous and fearful that i wont be able to perform at the new job or that I am making a wrong decision or not will be worse than I have it now. Also worried that if I leave my current office that things might get better and my boss will be different and my coworkers will get along better without me and I'm not sure how that makes me feel. It has been a constant thought in my head for months now. I have already passed on two jobs in thr last couple of months. 

I have 17 years before I can retire (lol) I know I dont want to do this for that long and i no longer have a desire to be a supervisor and all of that should answer my own question but how in the world do I know if I am doing the right thing, because once the decision has been made theres no changing it until something new opens up within the Cabinet and you never really know when that is.

I am very blessed and thankful to have a job and to of had this job this long. Please don't get me wrong I am diffinetly counting my blessings but the struggle of not knowing what to do puts me under mental stress every single day."
fx8pqt,48,2020-04-08,My company is trying to move me from Java Developer to their Phone Tech Support. I feel like they may be just trying to get me to resign. How do I navigate this issue with HR?,G_Man95,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fx8pqt/my_company_is_trying_to_move_me_from_java/,"**TLDR** at the bottom.

I am an Associate Java Developer with a consulting company. I graduated with a B.A. in Computer Science in 2017. This month marks 1 year since I was hired by this particular company (before that, I was an Android Developer Intern with another company).

I was hired around this time last year, flown to the company HQ at the Western side of the United States to take part in a 2 month Full Stack training program. I was then matched with a client in New York but when I got there, the person who was listed as my manager on the company portal said he had no idea until the day before I arrived.

Took him like 2-3 months to get me a company laptop (the client's company), at which point I was given a briefing about the project. Took like another month before I was given access to the repository. Was allowed to look and analyze but I was not given any tasks to do because anytime I asked like every other day, it was always ""we'll get to you"" and ""experiment with Java for the meanwhile"".

So I decided to use the time to put together some Java Projects until about November 2019 when my manager said that since they had no work for me to do, they would have to send me home and let the consulting company find another project for me because the current client doesn't like people having card access to the building and not doing any work. I then asked one more time if there was anything I work on for the team (since I liked the New York location of the job) but he said that everything that could be done was already being done by someone else and that it wasn't his fault, it was the client who didn't want me having card access. Only got like 4 phone calls from other potential clients so since being sent home.

Fast forward to this week and I start getting emails from the HelpDesk part of the company out of the blue, welcoming me and some others to a HelpDesk training program. The next day, I keep getting emails saying that I should be online and taking calls and that I and the others CC'd in the email aren't online. At the end of that day, I get a phone call from an unknown number, then a voicemail and email from HR asking me to get back to them ""regarding your new project"" (this one, the phone support).

The following day, I reply (Reply All) the email saying that maybe there might have been a ""mix-up regarding projects"" and that I am actually a Java Full Stack Developer with the company, and not a part of the Helpdesk. Stepped away from the phone for a second and get back to notice that I had a voicemail from someone in HR, identifying himself (known to be a bit of a ""my way or the highway"" kind of person) and saying ""hey"" that they ""wanted to talk"" to me and an email from another person from HR (both CC'd in the original email) saying that I should please call and ""Let's discuss this"" followed by a phone number.

And that's basically where I am right now. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but part of me feels like they just trying to get me to resign. Don't want to take a Helpdesk job because first of all, I did an Assistant HelpDesk job in college and then did an Android Internship after I graduated, then got this job. So basically, taking the Helpdesk job might make people question my coding abilities later but at the same time, I don't want to call HR, tell them that I want something else and have them tell me that I either take this or I am fired.

**TLDR**

Consulting company hires me 1 year ago from this month, gives me 2 month Java Full Stack training and deploys me to New York, where I was given nothing to do onsite from then to November since apparently my manager was not notified beforehand of my arrival.

Was eventually sent home in November and told to wait for the consulting company to choose another project for me. Got contacted 4 times but none materialized. Company suddenly starts sending me HelpDesk emails this week saying ""HelpDesk Training"" and ""you should be online and taking calls"". I point out that I am not a part of the HelpDesk but a Java Developer and now two people from HR want to ""speak to you"" and ""discuss this"", one of which is known to be a ""my way or the highway"" type of person. How do I navigate this with HR? Don't want to get fired for not taking a task that doesn't work with my current career trajectory.

**EDIT**

Finally mustered some courage and called HR later today. Apparently, they were ""close to terminating your services"" because I ""began communication and then stopped"" (voicemail from the ""pushy HR guy""). To be fair, they threaten termination whenever you leave them hanging for like 5 seconds, phone or email. This is the 4th ""get back to us ASAP or we'll terminate you"" threat I've received since November (you'll notice that I also said in my original post that I got contact 4 times with potential client matches. This is technically the 5th time, so like only one time when they didn't threaten termination).

Anyway, they said the HelpDesk role is temporary, just about 4 weeks maximum, since I'm not doing much. They said that they have other developers on the task, not just me. No official change in my role or salary. Just a temporary thing since I'm currently not assigned to any developer projects and one of their clients is experiencing increased call volume due to COVID-19. They said they didn't want to ""just keep paying you"" that's why I was put on this project.

**\*\*CORRECTION\*\***

Also wanted to make a quick correction. I wrote earlier that it took 2-3 months to get a company laptop and 1 month after that to get access to the repository. My mistake. It was the other way around. Roughly 3 weeks to 1 month for the company laptop and about 2-3 months for repository access. Wanted to make the correction here instead of editing that part of the post."
fx9259,73,2020-04-08,Don’t focus all your energy on engineering,PotatoGopnik,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/fx9259/dont_focus_all_your_energy_on_engineering/,"I thought about writing this post as a little incentive to some of you to focus on more than just engineering.
I read a lot in the comments about students focusing solely on their GPA.

But during my search for Internships and jobs the relevance of my GPA has been extremely low. What recruiters really focused on was linguistic abilities, personal ventures (in clubs or voluntary work), the fact that I always worked alongside my studies and so forth. 

It’s quite important to stand out, there are less trilingual or entrepreneur students than high GPA students.
And the ressources or opportunities to acquire these skills are quite numerous.

Also I would recommend investing a lot of time on creating a robust cover letter and CV one that really highlights your skills and what makes you different.

So this is just a reminder that in some fields having a high GPA will be essential. But there are also many opportunities out there for different profiles! Try to get in contact with recruiters in your field at job fairs or through LinkedIn, and find out how you can make yourself more desirable to companies.

Good luck to the ones amongst you who are dealing with consequences of the coronavirus!"
fxa949,6,2020-04-08,Word of advice for interviewers,alexlvk,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fxa949/word_of_advice_for_interviewers/,"So, lately I had 3 'failed' interviews, but not failed because of me.

I've been unemployed for a while, and I had a few face-to-face interviews which went nice, even got some offers, but lately because of Covid-19 most interviews I had where online via Teams or Skype. I get it, most people work from home right now, but let's not forget that even if you are in the comfort of your home, you are still during work hours.

Let me start with the list:

1. First interview was with software outsourcing company, for a Dev post. Things went nice during the phone interview with the HR agent. After that I had a video interview with the future Discipline Lead Engineer and a Senior Engineer. Everything was fine until webcams turned on. Messy bedrooms, wrinkled t-shirts, greasy hair and I think the Senior Engineer was in his Pjs. I get it, you work from home, but I took the time to take a shower, put on a plain white shirt, a black blazer, jeans and cleaned my room and even positioned the webcam so that I am centered without having furniture, posters and such in view. Also, I can hear you typing on your keyboard and I can see you laughing at something on screen. If you are having an interview, please don't do other things during those 30-45 mins. It proves you have no respect for the interviewed person and the company.
2. Had another video interview for an Oil&amp;Gas company. The interview was more about them knowing about my background, it was supposed to be just me, the HR agent and the Lead Engineer. Apparently it was fine having 2 more people in the call, not related to the position I applied to. Unlike #1, the Lead Engineer was wearing a blue shirt, had a white background and was focused on our interview. The other two started asking me obvious questions that they could just read from the resume (probably didn't save a copy), asked me to explain some gaps (apparently internships during uni for 2-3 months are unusual from their perspective), but failed to make a point. Instead, they decided to make it a technical interview and bombarded me with questions from they technical field (in which I had no experience, but it was an entry-level job with no experience required based on their linkedin job list). Please, reduce the number of people in a meeting/interview, because most people do remote work, they are laggy and I had to ask quite often for them to repeat themselves because it was cutting out (they got annoyed and asked me to reconnect).
3. Finally a face-to-face interview. Once again, HR agent and Primary Field Lead Discipline Engineer (quite a title). He kept bragging about his PhD, cracked jokes when I answered vague questions (PFLDE: How much X you know? Me: I can't really say a %, I got thru it during a class in college. PFLDE: Oh, so not much? Me:Kinda. PFLDE later in the interview: Let's wrap it up, I see you don't know much X, haha, not much.). Also, once again, if I, the interviewed person take my time to make myself look decent, please do the same. Don't show up looking like someone picked you from the street, purple t-shirts, jeans and sneakers don't send a message about how professional you are in a business environment. Even the office security agent was rocking a white shirt and a blue blazer.

To wrap it up, I don't mean this as a way of whining, but it pains me when I go to an interview and see the person, who is supposed to be older (I'm 24 btw, recent graduate) and be my superior at the office in colored t-shirts and jeans. Also, just because a  recession is on it's way, it doesn't mean it's okay to bully your future employees, act careless, unprofessional, etc. We are also choosing where we want to work. Two companies from the list sent me offers which I declined. One of them even phoned me to ask why and I calmly explained the issue. They told me they'll take action to make sure something like that doesn't happen and extended the offer duration to two weeks instead of one, if I change my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: If you conduct an interview, take a shower, shave, wear a shirt, clean your room. Act professional even if you are in the comfort of your home. If I take my time and do that, don't be surprised if I decline your job offer.

fxaa9s,5,2020-04-08,How to deal with failure to launch as new grad after a gap year?,omarkhwj,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fxaa9s/how_to_deal_with_failure_to_launch_as_new_grad/,"**Background:** Graduated in March of 2019 with a degree in CE from UCSD. I took a gap to try pursuing e-sports, while I learned a lot, I didn't continue and have been looking for job since February of this year. I have 1 internship and 1 relevant job I had during college. I also have plenty of relevant projects (I think). I have a 3.13 major GPA so that's what I use when it's required on apps.

**Current Situation:** I spend 6-8 hours a day grinding leetcode and carefully applying to positions that I see are entry level and relevant to my skills. After over 100 job applications, I haven't received a single  interview or phone screen. I've even applied with referrals to a lot of the big N companies like Google and FB. I'm starting to feel really depressed and I'm burning out grinding leetcode and applying to jobs daily. I feel pretty good about my ability to do technical interviews because I've been preparing, but I can't seem to get an interview. I just want a chance to slay an interview. It's hard to keep going after waking up to ""Thank you for your interest"" emails every morning. 

I've gone through 3 resume revisions and have posted my latest resume on 2 consecutive resume threads with no comments.

I know COVID-19 is not helping at all, but I'm only applying to companies that are still actively hiring anyway. I don't think I'm asking too much here. It doesn't have to be big N. I've seen plenty of posts on here with people getting more than what I'm asking with less. I just want to be able to prove myself in an interview. I'm starting to feel like what's the point of practicing leetcode for interviews when I can't even get one.  


**Resume:** Would appreciate feedback if there are any glaring flaws. Personally don't think I could do much better than this.

I had less motivation than usual but in general I was still functioning and capable of doing my schoolwork and basic things like eating and showering. But today I kind of hit the end of my rope. 

As some of you may have seen, Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race. Please don’t criticize me for my political views because that’s not what I’m here for. I’m just saying that his dropping out was my tipping point. I think anyone would be upset when you put so much faith in someone and you feel like the system failed you. I just feel like there’s no escape from all the craziness that’s happening. There’s no where I could go where I wouldn’t in some ways still have to deal with all of this. My dad used to always say stop the world I want to get off and I don’t think that’s ever been more relevant to me than right now.

I have all this homework I need to do and my professors are overcompensating for not having in person classes so they’re assigning even more work and expecting even more out of us. To be honest, school is the very last thing I’m even remotely worried about right now. Today I was planning on getting all of my work done but now I literally can’t do anything but stare at the wall. 

I was supposed to go to LA this summer for my school’s internship program that I worked my ass off to get accepted into. They pushed back the program dates and they haven’t said anything but I have a feeling the chances of it actually happening are slim. I haven’t even applied to any internships yet because it just feels like what’s the point? I need one to graduate and next fall semester is my last semester at college. If I push it off until the fall I can either commute two and a half hours by train to the closest city near me or take a smaller internship around here. I’m a PR major so I was hoping to get some experience with a larger company or firm first but there isn’t any close to me. I can’t even tell you how much I was looking forward to moving to LA for three months on my own across the country. 

I know eventually things will get better but to be honest that really doesn’t provide me with much relief because even if things will get better, I’m still struggling NOW. I feel so stupid that a political candidate ending their race is what did me in. I feel so stupid crying over it. But with everything else going on I just needed that one thing to keep me going. All of this fucking sucks. I really don’t know how I’m goin to keep going. Thankfully my boyfriend is here and he’s really supportive. I just wish I could hit pause for a second and take a minute to have all this weight off my shoulders. Having responsibilities like school work is honestly making me just feel ten times worse. Hopefully tomorrow is a better day :/"

Over the course of last summer and Fall 2019 and this Spring 2020 semester, I've been working on the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate online and I should be getting it by the end of May this year. The certificate went over the following courses/topics:

* What is Data Science?
* Open Source tools for Data Science
* Data Science Methodology
* Python for Data Science and AI
* Databases and SQL for Data Science
* Data Analysis with Python
* Data Visualization with Python
* Machine Learning with Python
* Applied Data Science Capstone

With my minor the courses I have are:

* Advanced Excel Programming
* Data Visualization
* Statistical Programming
* Data mining ( taking this Fall 2020)
* Supply Chain Analytics

I have had German language instruction from Highschool( 4 years) and some in college(1 semester) , but I have no knowledge of my fluency as I have not taken a formal exam for that.For this summer I have a 6-week virtual internship that will either be in Business Consulting or Supply chain/Logistics or maybe in Healthcare Operations or Data management, and I won't know for a few weeks which one it will be, unfortunately. For the time that I have available though for the summer and some time that I have free the following semester, I was wondering if I should do another online certificate related to Data Science/ Machine learning with Business applications or do something for my German Language proficiency in terms of getting a formal exam and materials to study for that. At this point in my college career I'm at a fork in the road with so many things that I could potentially do, but the problem of once I go down the path I would need to do some specialization with that certain path I take. Though hopefully, I could intertwine my different industry interests in what I end up doing for a career. I just need some help on what would be a good decision on what to do for certifications or courses maybe other the time I have as I want to do something with data science, supply chain, and health care in some capacity."

I am a student of Software Engineering in Malaysia. I am in my last semester currently and will be graduating in July. I am faced with the dilemma of what to do after my graduation. I am an international student here in Malaysia and I recently completed my internship at a company here. My internship went well, and the company is willing to hire me after I graduate. They are offering me a work visa as well. However, I have this opportunity to pursue Masters in Canada in the field of software engineering, computer science. A few universities I shortlisted are Dalhousie, Concordia, McGill, Alberta and so on. My question for the seniors who are reading this post is , if there is any advice they can give me on what to do. I dont intend on living in Malaysia forever, going to Canada gives me the opportunity to get a permanent residence and settle there for good. I am faced with two pathways right now, either I could take the job here , do part time masters and after 3 years try for an express entry in Canada or I can go to Canada in winter and study full time for another 16 months. My knowledge is good and my skills are intermediate but I am a hard worker. I am worried about the difficulty of education in Canada and I dont want to be stuck in my masters there."

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA: Passionate about the intersection of technology and education, would like to strengthen and build business-related skills to advance this field. Considering moving into a non-technical position as well later in my career and I think this would be a good fit. I'd also like to pursue a joint degree with a MS in CS but I think apps for those happen AFTER getting accepted to a business program.
* Target schools: HBS, Wharton, MIT

**Concerns**

* I've been thinking about applying to these deferred programs for a while but only recently started to seriously consider it. Do I have enough time to strengthen my application?
* In terms of recommendations, is it okay to ask my internship managers for recs even if both internships were at the same company but were different projects?"

My overall CGPA from all 5 years is around a 3.00/4.00, it's really low because I faced a lot of issues in first year and got a lot of horrible D's. Although my last two years GPA of upper CS courses (graphics, advanced linear algebra, machine-learning) is about a 3.5 overall.

I've worked as a Teaching Assistant before, and also as an undergraduate research assistant, although I mostly did iOS development and it was in an area I wasn't too interested in (eco-energy).

On the contrary, I've worked multiple (5) internships, my most notable ones being at Amazon, Tesla, and Capital One. I've also been heavily involved with student leadership, taking on tons of leadership roles and hosting tons of events :).

A lot of people would think ""why yould you even want to do a MSc if you had so much experience"" and honestly I wasn't too happy doing straight software engineering, I'd rather try and research something meaningful. My current interests are with brain-computer interfaces, computer graphics, and of course like every one and their mom *machine learning*.

I guess, my question is do I have a good shot? I don't have to study the hottest field (machine-learning), but even coming to do a thesis in something around brain-computer/graphics/bioniformatics stuff would be awesome (if you work in that space please dm me!).

TLDR resume really stacked on the work experience side, not stacked on the academia side."

Like many, my SWE internship for this summer got canceled by the small company I received an offer from. This past week I’ve been scrambling to find something else, but I’m not sure how feasible an offer would be for me at this point. I want advice on how to make the most of this summer, as I didn’t make good use of my last one.
 
As of now, I know Java, HTML, and a little bit of C++ and I'm not familiar with Git yet. For this summer, I’m planning to learn Python using one of the free courses on Coursera and complete my first ever personal projects. I’m also potentially taking a university course over the summer to avoid graduating late.
 
Programing has never been something that came easily to me, but as of late I’ve begun enjoying it. I’m currently taking my Data Structures class, so I haven’t been able to easily solve a lot of the problems on leetcode until I read ahead in my textbook, and I’m still not the best at these problems. I had my eyes set on one of Big 6 or my dream company, Spotify, for an internship next year, but I’m worried that it isn’t likely for an individual with 0 previous internship experience.
 
Sorry this post is all over the place, I just am a little confused/worried on where to go from here as I’m not sure what I should put my time towards. Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

Without any further ado, I can classify my ECs under three distinct categories: creative, political, and business/entrepreneurship:

&amp;#x200B;

**Creative:**

&amp;#x200B;

* I'm a novelist with a published fantasy novel that has sold 10k copies so far
* Also have published a few short stories in reputable magazines 

&amp;#x200B;

**Political:**

* A lot of internships with political figures including a pretty high-up position in Joe Biden's campaign
* An Asian activist group I founded/head that basically raises awareness for and works on issues concerning Asian-Americans in the US
* Speech &amp; Debate nats and TOC qualifier 

&amp;#x200B;

**Business:**

* A media company I started that covers a lot of business/investing/startup news. Also ties into politics a bit, as I cover some political stuff
* A 50k investing portfolio (built it up from 1k)

To give you a short background, I’m a recent grad of electrical engineering in 2019 spring. I’ve been working as an electric drives and control systems engineer for just about 8 months now at a steel mill. 

I’m having some problems with this intern who is in process engineering department. He is in mechanical engineering and still has a year left of school. In short he has ideas past down to him from older process engineers on how to reduce cycle time and it’s his job to investigate the gains from these changes and pass them to control engineers (me) to implement and trial them. 

So basically these ideas are directly passed to me and I have to write some code or carefully change drive parameters to achieve these desired goals. 

We just recently had a trial where we ran a test for a few coils to see reduced cycle time. I then told the intern we could do some analysis to see cycle time improvement and benefits from this change. Two days later I log in to see an email from the intern to a bunch of managers and myself, briefly saying thanks for the help (Me). He then goes on and on about how HE did the analysis and found the proved benefits to be x,y and z. He also exaggerated numbers and to make it look more impressive. 

Shouldn’t he have reached out to me before hand to compare our analysis? I think so. He just out of the blue had to send an email to make himself look good and look like a hero. This is a behaviour I’m noticing of him, he only comes to me or people when he needs something and just constantly uses people to make himself seem more grand to managers.  

He’s now trying to schedule Skype meetings to “check up on my progress with my projects”. It’s like he’s trying to manage me despite being an intern! Like what the hell... I literally don’t need his help for anything and he’s becoming very difficult to work with. Any help or advice is much appreciated."

fxgiw7,1,2020-04-08,Should I get Comptia A+ cert while working on BSIT/ Interview Question,jcole154,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/fxgiw7/should_i_get_comptia_a_cert_while_working_on_bsit/,"Some Background info:

I started college to get a degree in IT so I went to community college to get one. However I had to go for computer science for my associates because they didn't have an IT program. Currently I'm trying to get my bachelors in IT after transferring and obtaining my associates in computer science. I have one year left after this semester before getting my bachelors and I have been applying to internships primarily focusing on help desk positions. I have interests in cloud, network engineering, and automation so I figure help desk would be a good job to get some exposure to those and figure out what I would like to have a career in. I've only had one company that had a tech support position reach out to me after applying like crazy and got an onsite interview but, I didn't get it. I have no IT experience at all. I have over a year of customer service experience. I left out that I had 3 years of warehouse experience with the same company in three different positions on my resume because i thought it was irrelevant but now that I think about it it's not. Now i'm adding that to my work experience section of my resume. I'm trying to get a help desk position and work for a year then transition into something specific like network engineering, cloud, or devops.

Question 1: Should I get the A+ cert to give myself more of an edge and start applying or should I just add the work experience I left out, not get the cert, and start applying?

My thoughts:

Some students have a tech cert before they even start college and some during. A friend of mine has the same college background as me and prob the same amount of customer service but, has an MTA cert when he was in high school and was able to have internships with a company for a year plus one with another company for half a year.  I feel like i'm a good candidate but because I have mostly a programming background from my CS degree I feel like I lose to those who have certs or a combo of both certs and formal education (I know those with experience will definitely get the job over me). Covid-19 is cancelling internships left and right currently so why not learn the skills and gain a certificate this summer and reapply when this pandemic clears up?

Question 2: How would you answer this interview question for a tech support position?

""What are some weaknesses that you have?""

An answer I would give after thinking:

I believe my weakness is that I don't know everything and to combat that weakness I take initiative in learning new things and challenge myself.

Thanks for replies :)"
fxgl6o,3,2020-04-08,Quarantine Project Ideas?,Elongated_Muskrat628,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/fxgl6o/quarantine_project_ideas/," Hey all so I’m currently a first year undergrad aerospace engineering student and like everyone rn I’m stuck in lovely lovely quarantine and by the looks of it (since my internship got canceled) I’m probably not gonna go anywhere for the next few months. Keeping that in mind, are there any cool hardware/software projects I could learn/do in this time? I know MATLab, CAD, and a bit of ANSYS currently and I’m working on getting better in python and learning microcontroller programming and electronics rn. Some random ideas I was thinking about was building an Arduino drone and having it controlled by hand gestures or like building a VTOL RC plane, tho that may be a bit harder considering I don’t have access to a laser printer. Do any of you have suggestions as to what kind of projects I could work on? Obviously aerospace related would be best but honestly any engineering project that can help me learn more and show my skills would be great. Also preferably if I could be able to integrate both hardware and software skills that would be great. Thanks and happy quarantine!"

I am a junior studying accounting I recently went through the recruiting processes I applied to 6 internships and only landed one.  The internship I have is a public accounting firm and is very niche and only operates in one type of industry. I'm not sure this the best place to start my career. The pros of the internship are that the pay is very high and for a full-time position, the pay is 60k in lcol area.  I will be graduating with 9k in debt and will move back to my hometown where the job is, I most definitely be able to pay back loans in one year.  The other option I'm considering is moving across the us to pursue a master's degree and recruit again. I'm sure if I want to put the stress of recruiting on myself again. If I were to pursue a masters I would be 37k in debt living in hcol area but I will have more job opportunities available to me in the future.

I am hesitating about option one because it is my hometown I didn't have many friends growing up and I think I would be very lonely living with my parents. I can probably become very rich with option one I would work at the firm for probably about 6-7, years  I will be saving a lot of money and plan on investing my money in real estate with the help of my Dad.

Option 2 will provide me to get into a bigger firm but I might just completely shit the bed again and not land a job and be in a huge amount of debt.  I will be moving across the United States and will be pretty starting over socially. "

fxhmge,1,2020-04-08,Reverse chance a conflicted junior (schools preferably in the East),Stubbae,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/fxhmge/reverse_chance_a_conflicted_junior_schools/,"Demographics: White male from New England, attending a very small yet competitive private school, not first gen, middle class

Intended major: Mechanical or civil engineering

SAT: currently a 1540 (770 R, 770M). I plan on retaking this during the summer just to bring the math score up considering I am looking at the STEM field. 20/24 on the essay for whatever that is worth.  I don’t plan on retaking the essay.

Subject tests: None taken yet, I am currently studying for Math II and expect a relatively high score.  I hear of competitive engineering programs wanting to see physics as well, however my current physics course (my school requires you to take an honors physics course before AP physics) will only cover about half of the material on the test.  Is this something I am going to need to self study like crazy for over the summer, or will colleges be understanding?

Course load: Believe it or not, my school removed AP classes at the start of my junior year.  None were available to take prior to my junior year, so I will have taken 0 AP tests.  My school is trying to be all forward-looking by allowing the teachers to design a curriculum based off of what they believe is most valuable in their field rather than structuring the courses around a single test.  They claim that they have discussed such with colleges, and that they seem to be on board, but I am still very worried at the fact that I will have no AP scores to report.  Instead they have implemented “AT” (advanced topics) courses that are the new equivalent. Regardless, I have consistently taken the highest level math, science, English, and language courses available to me.  These include honors biology, honors chemistry, honors physics, AT physics, AT statistics, two years of the highest level Latin available, two years of the highest level English available, and finishing math at AT Calculus (calc BC).

Grades: I have never received anything below an A.  Interestingly enough, they don’t give us GPAs, but I am fairly certain on any scale that this is a 4.0/4.0.

Rank: They don’t report our class rank.  All I know is that I am likely in the top 5%.  

ECs:
My main extracurricular activity is classical piano.  I have been playing for 12 years and reached what I believe to be a fairly high level.  On my Royal Conservatory of Music Grade 10 Exam (the most advanced pre-college diploma category) I received First Class Honors, which sounds like a bunch of subjective nonsense, but is essentially the second highest score band you can be in.   I perform at my school multiple times every year, and in the summer before my junior year put on a benefit concert for a local church with a community lunch program. The concert raised enough funds to pay for this program for a month.  Finally, I have attended an intensive piano summer camp for the past 9 years.  It has become one of my favorite and most intellectually stimulating summer activities for as long as I can remember.  I plan on submitting an arts supplement to whatever schools I apply to that I hope will be able to showcase my skill level more than some of these subjective activities would be able to.
I will have done Nordic skiing for all four years of high school, going on to qualify for my state’s Meet of Champions my sophomore, junior, and likely senior year.
I will have done rowing for my sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school.  I have been in the men’s first varsity boat for every season (both fall and spring) of my sophomore, junior, and likely senior year.  I came in first place in my states championship in the junior singles category.
I will have worked at the local supermarket for my sophomore, junior, and senior years (roughly 10 hours per week, more than this during the summer). 
I am currently looking into engineering internships for this summer, as I am well aware that my current extracurriculars don’t exactly demonstrate interest in STEM.  The problem is that my current activities take up nearly all of my time (not that I am upset about this, I am doing them because I genuinely enjoy them) and this doesn’t leave much room for STEM experiences.

Recommendations: 
I will be requesting one from my English teacher of two years, who knows me and my sense of humor and way of thinking better than anyone else.  I have done very well in her class and she tends to write very long and detailed reviews/comments.  She described one of my essays as “one of the best pieces of writing she has received from a high school student” so I am hopeful that her letter will be strong.  The other is coming from my current calculus teacher (I had him for precalc last year).  I am definitely one of the strongest students in his class and we have a pretty close relationship.  

Essays: haven’t written those yet.


So that’s all folks.  I apologize if I come off as a bit condescending in some sections of this post, but I am just trying to reflect where I am at right now as accurately as possible.  Any input as to the band of colleges I should be looking at would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!"
fxhvrz,1,2020-04-08,Where should I even start?,throwaway3009632,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fxhvrz/where_should_i_even_start/,"I’m very, very new to the world of computer science. My bf was a computer science major, which inspired me to start looking into it because the prospects of those jobs look more stable than in my field (I got a BS in Psychology). Plus, it seems cool to be able to say that you know how to code and work on your own computer.

The problem is that I have no experience whatsoever, and just studying didn’t seem to be enough to have everything stick in my head (though, granted, I’m a little impatient with myself). It also doesn’t help that I’ve kind of bounced around to different areas of the field (like IT work to Software Engineering).

I’m currently in an unpaid internship (Web and Mobile App Development) to give me more direction and hopefully more of a hands-on experience to remember this stuff. The thing is that the internship is still essentially the interns learning on their own with no real direction yet. The person who can help us the most is normally too busy to, so it still feels like I’m learning nothing, even though I like the people I “work” with. It also just feels shitty to not be able to really contribute anything.

I just don’t know where to start and what to stick to. I’m trying to study any programming language and software I can to be a good candidate for a good-paying job, but it ends up making me feel overwhelmed because there’s SO MUCH to learn. I’m not really sure what to do, and would appreciate some guidance. I’m totally lost in this field."

I’m graduating this spring with a bachelor’s degree in health sciences. I have 4 years sales experience at Nordstrom as a top seller, along healthcare experience as a primary care intern. I recently had an interview with a genetic testing company (prenatal testing), for an associate sales rep position. I truly felt like the interview went really well. I was very enthusiastic about the position, and I felt like I connected well with the person I was interviewing with. Our convo was upbeat, I asked a lot of questions, and there was no awkward silence during the 45 minutes we spoke.
Today I got a call and was told they are no longer going to consider me a candidate for this position, primarily due to my lack of experience as a recent college grad. The recruiter then told me that the only feedback they could give me is to have “a little bit more energy”, which completely caught me off guard.

I got into UT CS as well as UTD Software Engineering. As someone trying to work in the Cybersecurity field after undergrad, I am unsure on whether attending UT is worth the debt (no parental help) especially since I can spend my extra time at UTD (UTD curriculum is said to be easier hence should have extra time) to complete external cybersecurity certifications. Additionally got basically full ride from UTD.

So my main question is: Is it worth to attend UT in this situation. Secondly, I would like to know how easy is it to pay off/manage debt as a UT CS student (are on-campus/part-time jobs manageable with course load, how probable is it to get internships). Thirdly, how likely is it to get a Cybersecurity internship as either a UTD or UT student."

Please either confirm so I can move on or help bail me out with your knowledge!,charlie_work__,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/fxjnll/raid_5_storage_issues_fairly_sure_im_screwed/,"Small MSP, even smaller business that we support and owns the hardware in question. Running a 5 disk RAID 5 array for media storage (against my better judgement, but in a small town working with small businesses it's so hard to get anyone to see the overall big picture of immediate costs vs. costs when someone shits the bed... Even more important in this instance since we have all the media files on various drives but no full backup because ""how often is there more than one disk failure at the same time?"". The actual load on the machine is fairly light so we were running it through Storage Spaces on a physical machine Windows 10 Pro. The 5 HDD's are about a year into production, the rest of the hardware was at the 5 year mark so we planned to move the storage to a new machine and tasked an intern with the job. 

When he moved the disks, he apparently did not reconnect them in the same order and when Disk Manager showed 3 foreign disks he adopted them. This obviously led to a failure of the RAID array. I tried moving them back to the original machine and running Stellar Recovery Professional to restore the disks to the RAID configuration. It showed only 2 disks. It was unable to process the reconfiguration. 

Is there anything else I can do to recover the data or am I going to burn some days migrating data from dozens of disks back to a newly built storage array?"

My interests are in fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and CFD modelling. Unfortunately the company I have been interning at for the past year did not give me any projects in the above but assigned me to a very boring management/transformation style team within the services sector. I was hoping to balance this negative experience by completing a CFD project with a team in the company that could have led to a paper publication which would have been invaluable for a PhD application.



Additionally, the worse part is I had a summer internship lined up with a small consultancy that do super niche fluid modelling within an area that is very exciting to me. This might be cancelled now due to the virus. To summarise, two opportunities which separately on their own would have been great springboards for me towards my preferred career area have and could be void, and I won't get a chance next summer to do it as I will be a final year student come September.

I am writing this to get some advice for Pentester career. 

I recently graduated university with Bachelor of CompSci. I have no job experience, no internship, just nothing. But I have OSCP certification and keep working on like HTB, CTF and Bug Bounty.

I am trying to land my first job in Pentester Field, but due to COVID there is not much Junior PenTester Position at the moment. or maybe recruiter just don't like me and my resume because I have zero experience. Therefore I am considering taking another certification OSWE or OSEE. 

But my friend said I don't need that such higher certification because I am just entry-level graduated student and what I need to do is just focusing on coding and preparing my Github to show them my code and my work. Because I have nothing on my Github except around 30-40 writeup. 

Which one is better for me like entry-level? Getting certificate or just focusing on coding and some project that I can do myself? 

And if doing project is better, which project do I have to do? Could you guys recommend some projects for me?

Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you and stay safe :)"

How to start living, for once?",Servietsky,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/fxt3ug/im_30_ive_failed_everything_in_my_life_therapy/,"First and foremost, let me tell you that I've tried to write this message about a 5-6 times already but never mustered the courage to press the send button. If it is in anyway not welcomed, please delete and advise me as to where would be more appropriate. Oh and I'm from Switzerland, if that explains my grammar errors and treatment path (maybe). I must also say that **I'm on Concerta 54mg but I feel nothing from it**. I don't take it everyday (not today) because I stay in bed the whole day (more on this below).

After I voluntarily went to a psychiatrist on November of 2018 and asked to be tested, **I discovered that I was actually suffering from ADHD**. So this is still pretty new to me, but this is the way I've been trying to work my troubles from. As a kid, I was told I was a gifted child but that I've never learnt to work properly. ""Just work harder, make some efforts"" were common phrases I've heard over and over. It was not a requirement since primary and most of middle school were easy for me. **I barely passed high-school** after that and when **I tried to go to university I've failed completely**. About 5 times as to now. **I have always been depressed** and actually had plans to kill myself since I was about 10-12 years old, tried maybe twice in high-school but was never directed toward therapy nor drugs nor anything. I hid it well enough, I guess.

Now I'm getting to where I originally wanted: since forever, but most importantly **since I'm an adult I actually failed everything** I've started and I've been so depressed since the last couple weeks that suicide has been present again in my thoughts. I will not do it, I know there is a way out. But I don't know how, **I'm totally lost**. That is why **I'm asking you for help.**

I will not detail everything I've failed in my adulthood, you might have ADHD too and I know this text is long enough, but let me emphasize that as of today, 30 years old, I hold no diploma, I've only had a handful of unqualified jobs (that I can hold!) but I've spent most of my life on social welfare. **I'm prone to drink alcohol, smoke illegal substances and play video-games for 8 hours a day** when I have no job. I have a child which lives across the Atlantic, I've never been in a relationship with someone I've loved even though I fall in love easily, been in a romantic relationship only twice for a total of about 3 years. **I barely have one or two friends**. **I feel fucking lonely all the time, except when I'm drunk, high or into a good game of video-game.**

This COVID-19 situation is a hell for me: I was actually in an internship as a bookseller that was going amazingly (talks of a contract right before the shut-down) and had plans to visit my child during the summer... Now, there's nothing. **I stay in bed until 3 to 7pm without eating, drinking, just on my phone browsing Reddit, Instagram or any social network.** When I'm not in bed I'm playing video-games, order fast-food too often, drink too often too.

There's so many thing I've started and never continued. **I have so many projects I can't find the energy / *drive* (as I call it even in my French mother tongue) to pursue.** I want to play more guitar and learn new things, I want to write, I want to workout, I want to learn more Russian (or any language really), I want to cook (I actually love cooking), I want to garden, **I want to... But I don't.**

The ongoing depressive episode was triggered by a girl I was talking to for about a month that I've met on OkCupid. We've developed a great virtual relationship that led me to have feelings for her and finally met on Tuesday. We spent the evening, the night and the next morning together but only as friend. I slept only about 4 hours and wept a lot without her knowing. **I feel lonely again, lonelier every time and this loneliness is killing me...**

In order to tackle this loneliness out of my life **I know I have to improve.** The thing is, as I tried to explain, I simply cannot find the energy to do it. Now, I know it is not impossible but I don't know what to do. **My therapist and I are trying to work through CBT** on the triggers that let me do things, which is doing things to avoid being judged (I clean every time someone's coming over to my place or shower every time I have to go out, for example), **but I feel a barrier inside me** that makes me quasi-instantly forget what we've discussed, what I would be working on.

I thing that this is it. You know a lot about me, and **I'm willing to try anything now that could help**, to find the path and go along it. Any book, strategy, anything starting from the first step to lead my life away from Hell.

tl;dr: Am 30 yo., it's 3 and a half in the afternoon and I'm still in bed writing this message, haven't eaten, feeling lonely and like crap ; it's been the same my whole life and I've never achieved anything - I have no diploma, no job, no friend, *lost* my kid. I need help to start living, for once. Please. I'm lost."

I graduated December 2019 with a B.S. in IT. During my last semester I did a 4 month internship where I hovered network desktop technicians. From there I moved to Raleigh, NC in February and got a job in less then a week. I had been working a help desk specialist contract to hire position for two month, but my contract was cut due to COVID-19. Good relations with the company and they said theyd reach out if things got much better, but knowing the company that could 6+ months.   


&amp;#x200B;

So When I moved out here I had like 5 interviews scheduled and counting. When my contract was cut recruiters started to call me about tier 1 and short term imaging positions.  The issue that keeps coming up is either I haven't used their specific ticketing system or way of imaging. Both should not be hard to pick up at all and I've tried to reassure them of that.   


I keep getting told that the company went ahead with candidates who have more experience in what they are looking for. Pretty much they dont want to train and they can afford to look me over because of stronger candidates. But these are low hanging entry level tech jobs that I can't get at the moment. It is incredibly frustrating. The pay for some of these jobs are less then $16.  


It seems that a lot of people more qualified then me have also lost their jobs and are sweeping up the entry level work. The competition just got much higher.  


I honestly dont know what to do besides hoping that my unemployment claim goes through and wait this out. Just hoping that within 6 months hiring picks up again. Just has put a massive wrench in my career at the moment.   


Any advice? I know this is sort of more of a rant honestly, but I figure others are going through similar things."

I was accepted as an incoming junior majoring in CS. My current school's program is...terrible with zero guidance -- most people have trouble finding internships, let alone jobs -- so actually feeling prepared career-wise is 100% my priority, and the fact that Michigan is ranked highly for CS matters a lot to me.

My question isn't so much what the cons of Michigan CS are, because I've definitely heard that it's overcrowded like in terms of registering for classes (a concern since I couldn't take AP exams and will only have 70 credits by the end of this semester). That being said, do the pros of Michigan CS outweigh the cons? Ie: do you think that, despite everything, it still prepares students well and leaves them in a good position for internships and jobs? My other decisions will be out in a month+ so I'm trying not to overthink yet, but I'm still stressing since I don't know if I should be really crossing my fingers to get into a comparable private like USC, or just relax and know I have a solid option already. I feel like a lot of the general ""how is CS here"" posts can devolve into being fixated on negative details, so I'm trying to look at the big picture.

fxwf6e,3,2020-04-09,Feeling depressed about new position I was converted into and the messy internal hiring process that lead to it,blueee423,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fxwf6e/feeling_depressed_about_new_position_i_was/,"Hi all, first time writing in. Not sure what I’m looking for besides to rant and make sure I’m not crazy or ungrateful especially in this time. The internal hiring process I felt was very bizarre but I’ve been told that’s how it is everywhere, so I wanted to see if that holds true.

So I worked for the federal government and I started as a pathways intern. That basically meant I would have a job as an intern until I finished my masters degree and if I was good and their were positions available they would bring me in full-time. I was doing a lot of communications work as an intern (not a communications major) but it was in relation to what I studied in college, so I was content. I was working a lot with people who were in my field and I had even won employee of the month for my work.

The hiring process was a mess. I updated my resume and my supervisor sent it to *some* people. I wasn’t allowed to reach out to anyone, I was told all the managers would take care of sending my materials where they needed to go.
It felt very out of my hands but I dealt with it.

My first interview was for two positions. One was in my dream department even if it wasn’t the best job and the other was being an inspector in the field I studied, but I was apprehensive as I’m not a super confrontational person and no one is ever super happy to have a random inspection conducted. Never heard anything at all from one job and the inspector job was taken on and off the table not once, not twice, but THREE times. I was told it was nothing to do with me but the manager was confused about whether they had the funding/room to hire me. If there’s no job...why was I interviewed!? I was specifically told that it wasn’t me and no one was going to get the position cause it didn’t exist... a few weeks later they bring someone on in that position.

I then interviewed for two positions also were inspectors but neither in my area of study. They went fine, I didn’t really want either position but I wanted a job. Finally, my dream department calls me up and asks me to interview for two positions! The interview went great. I was walked around the office to meet people and after the interview they word for word said, “we think this would be a perfect fit for you and that our department can be your home.” Next week I’m told that they realized the positions I interviewed for couldn’t be entry level...I asked around and a friend in the department told me the positions they were looking to hire were level 13 (the federal government has levels 1-15) and as an intern I was a level 4....so again why was I interviewed and then why tell me it went so well!?! It was so unreasonably out of my league, I had been there 6 months and just graduated the month before. 

I end up taking on of the inspector positions outside my field, never in the process did I receive a position description stating my duties or any official paper work. They told me to wait for an offer from HR that never came. And I was freaking out because as part of the pathways process was told that if HR’s paperwork and my background check were not completed within 120 of graduating college, I would not get the position because I would time out, even if I had done everything right on my end. I was also offered a pay level two levels below what this https://www.federalpay.org/gs/2017/GS-9  federal website said I should get as I graduated with a masters. Other online sources confirmed this as well. I tried to bring this up and they were not willing to even look at my evidence or hear me out when trying to negotiate.

Other weird stuff happened. My old and new supervisors met to talk about what I should be working on but I wasn’t looped in? My new supervisor announced my start date at a routine meeting I attend, and I had no idea until that moment. There was a lot of shady stuff that didn’t add up, and I know they’ve been trying to fill the position I took for a very long time.

Now I’m in this new role and I hate it. I’m struggling to feel motivated when the field and type of position is something I would have never applied for while job hunting. The sad thing was I was happy in my old position, I was good at it and I was excelling. They are also hiring two interns to take my place in my old department and their combined salaries are def more than what mine would have been if they kept me in my old department. 

I feel completely under qualified in general seeing as I have no background in this field and I legit think I’m gonna cry if a stranger yells at me during an inspection, and I hear horror stories about other inspectors being threatened physically or being made uncomfortable as a tactic to get them to leave. Not to mention they hired another inspector along with me who has a PHD in this field and did their dissertation on exactly what we are working on. I even though I’ve been working at the agency longer, I feel so behind next to them. I go to meetings and she’s cracking jokes with them and to me everything is so foreign I literally feel like they’re speaking a different language. 

This is definitely made worse by Covid-19 but there was little to no attempt to onboard me and make sure I am added to all the email chains, websites and other things I’m supposed be on, I always find out after the fact, but they add the other new hire to everything....I keep finding out things after I mess up. I feel like I’ve been thrown in the deep end. I’m also dreading the end of quarantine because then I have to start actually doing inspections. 

The internal hiring process had me feel like I had no control over anything and the managers came off as if they didn’t even know what was available. I cry like every other day cause I just know this isn’t for me. I was in the middle of applying and had actually had an interview before the world closed down, and now everything I did apply for is either cancelled or delayed. 

Any tips to stay motivated in a role you hate? I’m having such a hard time since they literally moved me from stuff I was actually good at an invested in. Having those other positions dangled in front of me was really tough. Esp because my division keeps bragging that they were posting a bunch of external jobs (that I would be good at) in March"

I myself have sent out a little over a hundred with nothing to show for it other than interviews. I know many in a similar situation.

Quite frankly I don't see other majors having to deal with this. As an example I am friends with two people who were able to get professional internships, one in the state department and one as a paralegal, as far as I can tell both only applied to the one internship. Neither have any sort of special connection and the main things they had going for them were relevant degrees and fluency in Spanish and English, obviously I don't know every detail about their applications/resumes. When I talk to other majors the idea of applying to 10+ internships is alien. Is this because everyone in engineering is just spamming out applications and now no one can find anything unless they do the same. 

I used to be upset with myself for not getting anything, now I am just angry. I don't care if I sound ""entitled"" I put in years of hard work into my degree, I got good grades and did everything I was supposed to do, I DESERVE SOMETHING GODDAMMIT. The whole point of me going through this was to get a stable career.

Also please please please don't give me any more advice on how to get something. I have heard so much advice on resumes, interviews and the application process that half of it contradicts the other half and just becomes noise.

I am 24 years old student, just about to obtain master's degree in electronics (I already hold bachelor's degree in automation technologies) in Europe (I'm European, if it matters).

When i started studying I was quite narrow minded person, knowing nothing about anything, except what I've been taught in school. I was always good with numbers and natural sciences, therefore I decided to study engineering.

Through the student years I changed a lot. I spent a lot of time abroad (doing exchanges, internships, summerschools, I travelled a lot), in total more than two years abroad in last three years. I am still interested in engineering, maths, science, but I don't find it so satisfying anymore. I am much more passionate about other people, new places, cultures, situation in the world, even tons of social sciences interest me now. 

In general I would enjoy having dynamic job, meeting people, travelling, but with my education I am most likely to get boring 9 - 5 desk job. I am thinking about applying for PhD abroad, just for the sake of changing environment and bringing at least some excitment in my life, even though just temporarily. I think I will at least try with career in my field, but I'm not very optimistic. 

I am not really sure, anyone has any idea of what kind of non-engineering career I can pursue with my education? 

I will be thankful for all ideas or experiences.

Regards!"

I'm a freshman at a state school and my first semester a finished with a 4.0. This semester I'll probably be somewhere in the 3.5 range because my gen eds have been a disaster to care about and the COVID situation has not helped. My goal is to finish the year with a 4.0 because it was just a goal of mine

Now my school has offered a Pass Fail option for all classes. I'm undoubtedly using it on my gen eds, which could potentially help me salvage the 4.0 goal but it still might be a reach. Will using it on Multivariate Calc or my Data Structures course hurt me? I'm really trying to land a solid internship next  summer and I want my 4.0 but I don't want 3-4 P/Fs on my transcript to hurt me.

Writing, drawing, paiting, reading,playing piano,writing music,.... Name it and I enjoyed it. I studied ancient Greek and science, and while my studies were not easy, I still found plenty of time to do what I enjoyed.
I was diagnosed with clinical depression, but my suffering only served as an additional source of inspiration to me.

However, once I entered university (pharmacy), everything was put to the background. My depression and my interest for my hobbies all had to make room for studying. I assumed my passions would re-emerge after university, but boy.....Was I wrong.

In 2019 I entered my last year of pharmacy university. I got the opportunity to pursue an internship in Paris, which has always been my dream city. However, the internship itself was dreadfully boring and after hours, I felt very, very lonely. I obliged myself to go to the Louvre every wednesday, as I used to love art so much. However, it was more out of a challenge (to see the entire louvre) than out of interest.

After the internship, I was not ready for the job market at all. I decided to study Toxicology (in Paris); extending my period in Paris with 2 more years. I thought living as a real student would give me more free time/opportunities to meet fellow students/take up hobbies, but none of that came true.

After class, all I do is randomly surf the internet until it is time to sleep. I can't focus enough to watch Netflix. I can't put effort into reading a book. I occasionally motivate myself to sport, but rather to lose weight than to be active, I haven't drawn anything in years, nor touched the piano.
Besides schoolwork, my mind is now a blank screen, while it used to be a beautiful painting. I miss the old me. I feel empty.

TL;DR : used to be a pretty creative kid. Then I made some unlucky career choices and now I can't find the energy/focus to write/paint/read/watch series/do sports any more. It's all just work and no play. I don't even like work."
fxyi9g,1,2020-04-09,I am high risk for COVID-19 complications and the doctor + my coworkers at my clinic internship are making me really uncomfortable in the midst of this pandemic,Virgo_Sky,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fxyi9g/i_am_high_risk_for_covid19_complications_and_the/,"I am a nontraditional premed and currently am an intern at a primary care clinic. The internship is unpaid and consists of shadowing the doctor, doing medical assistant work with patients, admin billing/insurance stuff, maintaining the office. It’s great clinical experience and I’m super grateful for the opportunity. Unfortunately, I also have mild to moderate asthma. I was on a steroid for it awhile back, but I’m not currently and just use my emergency inhaler sometimes for chest tightness. 

Now I have worked at this clinic for about 4 months so far and signed on to work for a year minimum. At the time I didn’t have a full time job, so I was working at the clinic a lot and as often as I could so I could help out and get patient experience. Ever since the COVID outbreak started, I’ve been really anxious about being at the clinic because of my asthma and because like most other medical facilities we don’t have adequate PPE either, so we are coming into contact unprotected with patients who could potentially have the illness. We are doing some Telehealth appointments, but we still have some patients coming in person and there are still most days at least 3 or 4 interns at the clinic in close quarters. 

I have texted the clinic manager to ask if I could only be present on patient days when all appointments are strictly Telehealth due to my higher risk being asthmatic and she said that was fine, however, my partner whom I live with has now expressed concern about me going into the clinic at all, even on days when there are no patients there and just interns there. 

The backstory with my partner’s concern is that the sole doctor/ owner of the clinic is a major narcissist and doesn’t appreciate people questioning him at all, as everything is a personal attack to him. He is very paranoid as well and only allows women to become interns at his clinic. 

One day during the outbreak (sometime in March) when social distancing was definitely a thing people were practicing I was working at the clinic alone with just me and the doctor, now this always makes me anxious because he low-key gives me creep vibes and everything is about catering to his ego. He will talk AT you for hours (it’s a one-way “conversation”) and just generally makes me (and other interns I've spoken with about it) feel uncomfortable, so anyway, I was working alone with him and, granted, the clinic office is tiny, but I was making my best efforts to keep 6 feet of distance from him in order to protect myself since from what I’ve read we are not supposed to be in close contact with really anyone who is not living in our household. 

so anyway he is finishing up a Telehealth appointment and once its over I need to make a follow-up appointment with the patient so I have to switch places with the doctor at the computer. He gets up from the computer and leaves and I make the appointment in the book on the table and I sign off with the patient. Now, there are two big office chairs on both sides of the tables in the small room and I was stuck in the middle of them against the table because that’s where the appointment book is, and so then the doctor comes up and goes to look at the appointment book which essentially traps me in between him and the table and the chairs, and I start to panic internally because he is trapping me there between him and the table and no way for me to leave or move around him! He is so close to me I could feel his breath on me…I just kept thinking this was definitely not 6 feet of distance :/ and he didn’t seem to care at all despite the pandemic. 

Also, he is aware I have asthma, when I tried telling him one time about my concern with my asthma, he just brought up that he has asthma too and started talking about his history with it instead of addressing my concern. 

Anyway, the whole experience with him trapping me between him and the table made me feel super icky. And I felt I couldn’t say anything to him about him doing that and being so damn close to me because he will take it as a personal affront and make me an enemy. I feel I really need this internship to get into med school. :\\ Anyway, then later that same night when I was locking up the clinic, the doctor again stood a hair’s breath from me as I was locking one of the doors; there was absolutely no reason for him to do that….especially then. 

I went home and basically had a mini mental breakdown. I cried so hard that night. The whole experience felt very violating to me and gross, even if social distancing wasn’t a thing I would have still felt uncomfortable but especially now more than ever, that he did that. 

 I am 26 years old and the oldest intern at the clinic, most of the other interns are younger than me (like early twenties) and I feel like they also haven’t been taking social distancing seriously either. One of the clinic managers (who is about 23) was telling me about still going out on dates with random guys in the midst of this pandemic. 

I questioned her about whether she should really be doing that and she brushed me off. The last time I worked with the other interns, it didn’t seem like they were trying to maintain 6 feet of distance from one another either. They’re all a little immature or oblivious, or both maybe. 

So in essence, it feels like most of the interns aren’t being very careful in this pandemic and neither is the doctor himself, so it makes me extremely uncomfortable to intern here right now which is why my boyfriend is also concerned. I told him all of the days I signed up for I would be working alone in the clinic (no doctor, no other interns) just doing admin stuff, but he’s still worried about me being exposed to the virus through lingering aerosols from the other interns having been there before me. 

My boyfriend struggles with OCD by the way and other serious health issues, so this pandemic has been really hard on him. I’m not sure what is reasonable to do in this situation…not go into my internship at all or what? I feel that my boyfriend is making good points about potential exposure to the virus because we just don’t know yet about whether we should be concerned about aerosol transmission rather than just respiratory droplet transmission, but I don’t want to lose this internship. 

I don’t know if I will have many other options that will help me get into med school without this opportunity. I am so stressed by the whole thing though. I want to be reasonable though and I definitely don’t want to put myself in danger or my partner. I could use some other people’s perspectives on this situation. 

Thank you in advance! &lt;3"

My university has established a policy saying that we can designate any course we want as a Pass/Fail, even a major or non-major required course. It will still fulfill any requirement for ONLY this unique semester.

I study chemical engineering and am a first-year. I have a 4.0 and would like to keep it that way but I am considering keeping my major required courses with letter grades but designating one of my non-major required core classes as a Pass/Fail to ease the stress considering my experience with the virus.

I plan to apply for REUs, T20s, and internships and I have heard mixed comments from faculty and administration about this decision. The administration said they are marking all Spring 2020 Semester grades with a special note on how COVID-19 affected students. Would this move affect my chances negatively or are grad schools going to even care about a non-major required core class.

fy08ya,8,2020-04-09,Struggling with workload,squirmzzz,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/fy08ya/struggling_with_workload/,"Hey everyone, I would like to get some professional advice from people with a little more experience than myself. I recently graduated and have been working at this firm for 2 years (as an intern and now analyst). Essentially we work as data providers, and with the recent COVID-19 happenings, we have been rushing to update many of our models to reflect the big changes in the markets. We were already behind on our other main projects, and then two new large projects were pushed onto my plate on top of my other responsibilities. I am working from home by myself (no roommates, no family) and honestly I am struggling due to the isolation and the workload. I am not able to get the help/guidance from other coworkers that I normally receive when working on projects. The lack of human interaction is also difficult for my mental health. 

It is especially stressful in this time as I am being expected to do large important projects with very little guidance. I am pretty much being chided for not doing more on these projects while simultaneously not knowing what is expected of me because it is not being communicated to me by leadership. Until now I have handled this by completing what I know, and presenting the work with placeholders (as in semi-complete with what I think is correct) and then asking what is needed further. This has not been received well, but I am worried that if I attempted to do things fully how I believe they should be done, I would just be forced to do the work over due to my boss being extremely picky about things. 

I do not want to come off as irresponsible or not hardworking enough to handle these projects, but honestly I am not sure if I can. I am worried that if I bring up these worries it will impact me negatively with my bosses. I am getting very discouraged, and before this I was receiving very good feedback at work but now I feel the complete opposite like I can’t stop fucking up. 

My questions boil down to:

1. Do you reach out to bosses when you think your workload might be too much, or just power through it?
2. How do you handle situations where your objectives are not clearly explained to you? Do it to the best of your abilities or repeatedly ask for guidance?"

Hey! So I am an international student fortunate enough to have these options. As for the major, I am equally interested in both CS and Maths, with no plans to go directly to job after undergraduate - I intend to go to graduate school. Cost wise, Umich is somehow more expensive for me than UCLA, Johns Hopkins is the most expensive, and Georgia Tech is the cheapest option. However, the cost difference is not significant since I am an international student. Furthermore, I am not really worried about the fact that a school might be cut throat.

I needed help deciding which uni to choose, and I would really appreciate any help I could get. I do have great choices in UK as well, but wanted to narrow it down between one UK school and one US School:

1. Regarding graduate school prospects for Mathematics, which of these schools has the best prospects? I know there are many other factors involved, but which one would, statistically speaking, be the most likely to send its students to a good graduate school.
2. Being an international student, I am worried about research and internship opportunities. I did try to research, but I was not really successful. What I think is that since Georgia Tech is the smallest, research opportunities will be more readily available compared to UCLA and UMich. And Johns Hopkins is obviously research intensive, so they would obviously be the best of these options.
3. Internship wise, I believe Georgia Tech is the best due to the simple fact that they have really big career fairs. I am not really sure, and would love some answers.
4. I care about, more importantly, a math or cs program that offers a rigorous curriculum, alongside a wide range of opportunities for its math undergrads.
5. Which of these has a more thriving(?, is this the correct word lol) international community?
6. My only reservation with UMich and UCLA are that they are really big, which seems intimidating.
7. I got this Mathematics Merit Scholarship worth USD 2500 per year for 4 years at UMich, which is great, but it hardly makes a difference in the cost.

I would really appreciate your opinions, since I am really confused. Again, my parents are not that concerned about the cost since I am an international student and my parents will have to pay fat racks anywhere.

Thank you!

1. Apply for More Internships ([Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-doubling-size-of-2020-summer-intern-class/) doubled the size of their internship class and is still hiring!)

I didn't receive that many interviews compared to how many applications I put out, but in the fall I got an IT internship and it was my best offer (despite only being $20/hour with $2000 stipend). After I accepted that job, I continued to apply and interview and I did get some interviews, but no offers, however this may be due to me applying only to places that were equally as good or better than the IT internship I already got.

Fast forward to today and I find out that I no longer have a summer internship, and the company didn't give me a stipend or guarantee a full time offer. I feel like crap because even while the job market was great, this job was the best that I could do. So now given the current circumstances, I feel like I'm fucked for the summer and fucked for post graduation in spring 2021.

Right now I'm applying to as many jobs as I can and going to a virtual career fair soon, but I still don't know if anything will fall through. I feel like one of the best things I could do for my resume was school clubs since I talked a lot about my club involvement in interviews. Thus, I was planning on joining a new one right before my college got shut down because of the virus.

What are your suggestions as to what I should do given my current circumstances?"

I also asked this over on r/berkeley but would like to hear some answers hear too. I've been admitted to UIUC'S CS+Chemistry program and Berkeley's ChemE major in their College of Chemistry. Before I can even declare CS at UCB, I have to take a semester in ChemE before I can transfer, and then take 3 CS prereqs and hope to meet their 3.3 cutoff, which is not guaranteed at all. However, I feel like even if I can do it, I would be declaring for the major in my sophomore year.

If I pick UIUC, I just want to make sure that the Chemistry part tagged onto the major will not affect my chances at an SWE job. Initially, I was interested in both fields but increasingly see myself liking a pure software role. Is it also possible to switch to another CS+X major like Econ or Math?

I know UIUC has an amazing CS program, but I am still conflicted. However, with the arduous process of switching schools at UCB, picking UIUC should be a no-brainer right? I read that Silicon Valley internships are slightly easier to get there, but the recruiting and overall program at Illinois are top-notch as well. Cost is not an issue here as I am OOS for both, but my parents really want me to go to Berkeley for its prestige.

Then I did, I changed majors to a CS-related field, and thought if I got great internships I’d be set, then I did, and thought that if I got into a top grad school I’d be set, etc. 

I’m currently 21 turning 22, and on paper, I feel like I’ve accomplished a lot of what I’ve only dreamed of before. I’m interning at NASA JPL this summer, I’m going to Carnegie Mellon for a masters, I’m in a 2 year long relationship, and I’m living relatively stably with comfort and with the prospects of lucrative and interesting work. I enjoy my work and I enjoy CS more than anything I’ve studied before. 

However, I’m also frequently feeling melancholy, stressed and like I “should” be doing something all the time, all while coming to terms with the fact that my work is pretty much meaningless. I don’t know where to go from here. I’m no longer sure what my “end game” is. I think a lot of what I’ve done has only put me in a position to feel more responsibility, more pressure to keep up, and more like I can’t keep up. I guess prior to all of this, there was a clear goal and the dream of accomplishment - but I’m now a bit disillusioned knowing that life chugs on no matter what I’m doing. 

I’m not really sure what answers I’m looking for. I guess I should be improving my mental health more than anything tangible in my life, but I’m not really sure what this entails either. I think I’m both tired and dissatisfied, but know that I can’t I take a break from everything (and don’t think this would help). 

What’s the end game of self improvement? Everything I’ve done sounds like an improvement, but it doesn’t feel like it at all. I can’t say I’m happier today than I was 5 years ago."

Hope I'm in the right place for that question, otherwise I would appreciate if you can reroute me.

So because of the lockdown, I had to bring my company Windows 10 PC at home since I do all my computation on it. It doesn't have any wireless adapter so I plugged it directly into my livebox with an Ethernet cable.  
The problem is that I do have an internet connection when I boot it, but it disconnects after some time. I had to reboot it to get it back but the circle is endless. I got this globe-shape icon saying ""no internet connection"" and when I try to troubleshoot it, it says ""please plug in an ethernet cable.""  
I tried the cable on another computer, it works fine so it can be the cable's fault.  
I also took care of disabling any proxy settings (by disabled all option in the Network settings/proxy) that was set up by the company.

So what would be the problem here ? My skills are not longer useful.  
We have a new intern who needs to remotely connect to my machine so it's a bit annoying ...

Thanks for your help :)"

fylllu,1,2020-04-10,Possible Student Questions,Ejohnson9912,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/fylllu/possible_student_questions/," 

Hi! I’m a potential incoming freshman and wanted to pitch a few questions to see if anyone had any answers or thoughts whether you’re a current or former student. I’m all ears.  

(I just posted something like this in the Miami subreddit and found it to be very helpful, so I thought I'd ask around here too.) 

Here’s a TL:DR for anyone who’s scared off by this amount of text 

* Do large classes put me at a disadvantage? How in-touch would I be with professors? 
* I want to do computer eng. but also want to explore biz/comms. 
* Anyone else have allergies and can speak for the accommodations on or off campus? 
* Internships/co-ops/on-campus employment? Are there enough good opportunities for everyone? Is there too much competition? 

Essentially, I'm stuck between choosing Miami University or Purdue. I think I'd like to do computer engineering, but obviously the engineering dicipline isn't something I'd need to figure out right away because of FYE. I'm also interested in exploring a bit of business, management, and/or communications just so I'm able to have that skillset when I graduate and I'm not ""just an engineer"" but rather an engineer who is flexible and can manage/communicate well. Would this be possible in 4 years? Are the business/maanagement classes at Purdue any good? I've seen a lot of different numbers on how many kids get weeded out, or how every class is almost a weed-out class. I think I do have a pretty decent work ethic, but I'm still concerned about being overloaded.  

When I visited campus last year, there was a lot of talk about how you will likely be watching lectures for class before stepping into the classroom. How common is that? In addition, I also am a bit put off by the fact the classes are so large and you'll sometimes have classes taught by TAs and not necessairly in touch so much with the professor. How is that experience? Is that true? 

Secondly, I totally want to partake in some internships, jobs, and maybe co-ops. This might be a question that doesn’t necessarily have a right answer, more just looking for opinions: is it extremely easier to get an internship in something like engineering by going to a higher ranking school in engineering ex. purdue v miami? I’ve heard things like it’s doesn’t necessarily matter exactly where you went to school as long as you have the general skillset and communication skills. I already have a few contacts at places like Apple, Facebook, and a few other tech and media companies so I think I might be fine in terms of connections, as in I wouldn’t need to rely on the school I go to in order to get connected. How common are internships for students at Purdue? I feel like with a large engineering student body, there would be too much competition for things like internships and co-ops.  Specifically for engineering, but I’d love to hear how some other concentrations are in regards to internships.  

I have a severe allergy to nuts and was wondering how the dining and food situation is both on campus and off. Does dining at the school seem to take allergies quite seriously? Same question with area restaurants.  

Plus, any other tips or need-to-know things I might benefit from knowing would be great to hear. Sorry this was so long!"

\- Linear Algebra

\- Probability with a calc 3 pre-req

\- Statistical inference with a probability pre-req

\- a two-course sequence going from statistical methods in R  + Excel, to time-series analytics and risk modeling.

I was homeless the majority of my freshman year hopping from relatives houses to other relatives to even living with my friend and her family for a bit. When we actually have a home of our own, it isn’t uncommon for common house utilities (gas, AC, water, etc) to be shut off for weeks because we can’t afford the bills.

Because of growing up low income, I pretty much have had no opportunity to really engage in any extracurriculars. I’m just going to list a few of these reasons rather than put it in para form:

1. We often didn’t even have a car and when we did, my mom didn’t have any time to drive me to any extracurriculars because she’d work really long shifts.

2. Working these long shifts meant that I had/have to be home 24/7 in order to care for all my siblings because I am the oldest. I couldn’t just up and go to some club—who would take care of my brothers? We couldn’t afford a babysitter.

3. We constantly have to move because our finances are never solid. Ive been to 4 different highschools so far and I’m currently approaching the end of my Junior year. I was never able to be in any clubs long enough to establish leadership positions or even really consider them ECs.

4. Maybe I’m just not looking in the right areas but, every program that I’ve tried to do research on to see if I can join so that I have some sort of EC is always at a high cost, which I can’t afford. 

The list goes on but moral of the story is: I don’t see how in the hell I’ll be able to get into any colleges when I really don’t have any good ECs. I always see posts on here of people listing all their ECS: being apart of a club for 4 years, student body president, internships with freaking NASA, winning state championships, etc, and it’s like.. I don’t compare in any way, shape or form.

What sucks even more right now is that I was going to try to do volunteer work and find other EC’s to do over the summer so that maybe I’d have somewhat of a chance, but Ms. Rona came around and isn’t giving me too many high hopes for that. 

My current GPA is an unweighted 3.8, 4.1 weighted. I have relatively good grades and take some AP classes, senior year I’m taking all AP classes. But to be honest it’s like.. for what? To be rejected from every college because I wasn’t able to join clubs or have internships? It just really sucks."

I signed the lease in February for an apartment complex that is partnered with the company I will be working for (that essentially said that this is my problem.) 

COVID-19 happens and now my internship is completely virtual so I am staying on the West Coast. As soon as I found out in early April, I asked the manager if I could cancel the lease, to which he responded: ""The lease cannot be cancelled. You still have a housing stipend, correct?"" and is expecting the full payment for an apartment that I will never see. 

The issue is that I live in a dorm and will have no housing out here as of May. I need this stipend to pay for my West Coast summer housing. I have not put down any payment yet, and the IL lease is for approximately 3 months over the summer. 

Am I legally obligated to pay this full amount if I'll never even be in that state? What will happen if I can't pay it? All advice is appreciated, thank you very much. I can provide more details if needed."

I'm in the process of closing down my small business, partly due to how slow it is due to COVID-19 and partly because I've been itching to get into software.  Thankfully my partner and I are walking away with retained earnings, so I'm not in a huge hurry here.  Eventually I'd like to start my own software or cyber security company, but that is a long-term goal and I realize I need experience at a company as a developer/engineer.

I'm currently a MS CS student at Georgia Tech.  I'm about to attempt my second class in OMSCS (Knowledge-Based AI).  I attempted AI4R in my first semester but was overwhelmed with python stuff.  The math I understood, I just wasn't fully comfortable with the language.  Since withdrawing from AI4R, I have been working through Python Crash Course and have just completed the 2-D video game project.  I'm feeling a lot more comfortable with python and think I'll do fine in KBAI.

I have a math undergrad and two python projects to my name.  What else can I be doing in order to be competitive for a software engineer position?  If possible, I'd like to forgo the internship phase but if it's necessary I would take it on.

I'm in the DC area.  What should salary goals/expectations be?  I'm 26 right now so I'm hoping age won't be a huge factor in looking for a new software position.  Thanks for your help."

Thank you for reading this and helping me!

Context:

\-possibly majoring in Statistics/Applied Math (maybe along with Econ?)

\-potential sports analytics OR actuary career path? but that could definitely change--just an idea but at least I know the general field I want to probably enter

\-not a low enough annual income for a lot of finaid but can't pay full boat; am in the process of doing the math to see how much debt I would graduate with, but I *feel* like I am lucky to like a somewhat lucrative field so maybe I can take on slightly more loans than the average bear?

\*\*listed in no particular order\*\*

**Northeastern**

PROS:

\-got combined major (Math and Business Admin)

\-great location for internships

\-Co-op

\-from what I know about it, it seems to be in a bubble in the city so not BU-level urban (this is kind of neutral for me)

\-know my way around Boston and can take the T in for Celtics/sports games

CONS:

\-$59k/yr (though I haven't appealed yet, I doubt they will give us any more money)

\-haven't been able to visit campus so I can't judge for sure how I feel about location

\-doesn't seem nature-y, I'm a somewhat outdoorsy person

\-doesn't seem to have a lot of school spirit

&amp;#x200B;

**Boston College**

PROS:

\-am practicing Catholic so that would be kind of cool to have that tradition ingrained in my school

\-Beautiful campus, I like the location better than I think I would like Northeastern's as far as non-academic stuff is concerned

\-more prestigious to me and in the eyes of employers than my other two options (is this true)? Though I will admit I do care slightly about prestige for myself, it's not a huge factor. more important to me is how my employers will see a BC degree vs others.

\-same as NEU, know my way around Boston and can take the T in for Celtics/sports games, though it's a bit of a longer ride than NEU

\-not as urban as NEU but close enough to Boston

\-seems fairly community oriented which I like

CONS:

\-unsure about the strength of their math/stats dept

\-$65k/yr (though I will try to appeal to get them to match NEU at least and maybe try to get them to beat NEU)

\-not a ton of nature stuff being pretty urban

\-am really worried about how I would fit into what I perceive to be a preppy culture (maybe someone can address if this is true-don't want to to jump to conclusions but I kind of felt that when I was on campus) . FWIW I am a rural kid and I consider myself to be down-to-earth.

\-Aside from the preppy stuff, I just don't know how I would fit in here. Not to say I wouldn't, but idk

&amp;#x200B;

**UMass Amherst**

PROS:

\-roughly $30k/yr, instate tuition so cheapest option

\-got into Isenberg business school so I have the option of majoring in something business along with whatever else I choose if I want

\-western MA is beautiful, a lot of nature opportunities

\-I have heard about the great food (but in my anecdotal experience I wasn't a fan)

CONS:

\-not sure how strong their math/stats department is

\-didn't get into the Honors College (I will admit I am pretty pissed about that, does anyone know if I can formally appeal?)

\-even though I know it's a big school, a LOT of people from my HS are likely gonna go there and I have not enjoyed my HS experience as far as classmates go

\-Amherst might be a little *too* rural when it comes to landing job opps/internships

\-though the areas surrounding it are beautiful, I think the campus buildings make it look like a Soviet prison camp

Also I have a disclaimer that I am also on the Cornell waitlist. On the 2 percent chance I get off I will almost certainly drop everything and go there, but let me know what you think about this too. Thanks for making it this far!"

fyti01,4,2020-04-10,Social anxiety at work is really fucking with me,llewmorb,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/fyti01/social_anxiety_at_work_is_really_fucking_with_me/,"I honestly just feel like literal dog shit right now because of my social anxiety, especially at work right now and just need to vent and get this off my chest but would also love to hear any advice anyone may have. Well here goes this roller coaster:

I work as a manager at a warehouse and I manage about 20 people. I am only a few years out of college so I’m only in my mid twenties. So this is already kinda a disadvantage because 90% of my team is a lot older than me so I’m already not taken as seriously. I started initially working here as an intern and enjoyed it so much that I applied for and management position and got it. I’ve always struggled with anxiety my whole life so I knew it could of been some obstacles in my way but I was determined to make it.

Fast forward two years with the company and I am currently on a PIP (performance improvement plan), due to poor performance for the year, and the best part is my team know all about it, which I still have no idea how. I pretty much got told a month ago that I have 45 days to improve or I’m shit outta luck. So this in general has brought so much stress on me trying to do the best I could possibly do. Also with covid going on, we are an essential business and we have been non stop mandatory overtime for a month now and it’s not stopping anytime soon so I’ve been working at least 60 hour weeks but closer to 70. So pretty much I’m fucking drained.

My stress and anxiety has been so crippling I’ve started to have panic attacks in the middle of work. I work in a huge warehouse so I can’t just go running into the bathroom or anything because it’s in the middle of the building with tons of people, so I will go to the back where no one sees. Well much to my dismay, someone has seen me and it was someone on my team.

Someone on my team has saw me and now I am the running joke between my entire team that they make me cry, make me so stressed out and make me so nervous. When I heard about this I literally thought I was going to throw up. This obviously meant they showed absolutely no respect for me as their manager. I had another panic attack because of this and left for the day. Now I am currently on a two week leave of absence due to my anxiety because I do not wanna be anywhere near those ugly people who get some joy out of me crying and worrying about me losing my job. 

So yeah I am currently looking for new jobs because the thought of going back just to have these people think this way of me makes me wanna vomit. The only thing is because of this covid going on there’s hardly any jobs available so I most likely will not have any choice but to go back. I have an appointment with my doctor so I can see if I can change my medication to at least something that won’t show the physical symptoms of my anxiety since they are obvious to my team. I just feel so alone, hurt, humiliated and ashamed, especially because I genuinely liked most of my team..."
fyuah8,6,2020-04-10,Reprogramming The Wind Waker,JakeJLLee,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/fyuah8/reprogramming_the_wind_waker/,"# Background

As a series that I've played and enjoyed ever since I was young, *The Legend of Zelda* will always have a special place in my heart. Two of my favorite games in the series are *The Wind Waker* and *Ocarina of Time*. As a college freshman that has moved back home due to quarantine and will most likely not take part in a summer internship, I've decided to pursue one of my long-term goals of recreating *Ocarina of Time* in the style of *The Wind Waker*. More specifically, I want to do so by creating a GameCube .iso file that I can play on the Dolphin Emulator.

# Feasibility

I guess this sort of begs the question: is this even possible? Based on my initial research, I've learned that it would be extremely difficult to reverse engineer *The Wind Waker*, or any Nintendo game for that matter. Furthermore, the amount of game design knowledge required would be immense (which I, unfortunately, have little to none of). I am willing to go to great lengths to accomplish this dream of mine, but I still have to be realistic.

# Resources

Regardless of whether this is feasible, I still want to learn more! If you could send resources my way that helped you when starting out with video game design and programming, that would be much appreciated :) I couldn't find that many resources relating to my specific goal, so info related to GameCube/Dolphin/*The Legend of Zelda* is nice, but not required. Finally, if possible, I'd love to be able to reach out to you for any clarifying questions I have. Thank you so much!

# Personal Programming Knowledge

Just so you guys know where I'm at (and how much more I need to learn!):

* Experience with data representation, machine-level code, computer arithmetic, elements of code compilation, optimization of memory and runtime performance, and memory organization and management
* Proficient: C, C++
* Familiar with: Java, Python

fyvs5n,0,2020-04-10,Berkeley Undergraduate ME Major—a freshman's questions about the school,heleena11,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fyvs5n/berkeley_undergraduate_me_majora_freshmans/,"Hello everyone\~

I've just been accepted to Berkeley ME, and I'm trying to have a better understanding of the school bc I'm interested in Berkeley, but at the same time, there are some things I want to clarify before entirely committing myself here.

I realise it's actually quite a lot of questions, but if you could answer at least a few, that would really help me a lot! Thanks so much &amp; Go Bears\~\~!! 

&amp;#x200B;

1. For me, teacher-to-student interactions have always been really helpful. Although it doesn't seem to be the case for everyone at Berkeley, I heard that profs aren't really available during their office hrs (due to a large # of students) or some ppl even said they were only taught by TA's! Is that true? If so, how can you get close to the professors?
2. I did quite a bit of research during high school, and I'd like to research again at Berkeley, and the earlier the better. But I'm an international, and I'm not sure how easy it'll be for me to get an internship or a research spot. Do you know what the situations would be like for people like me? Could I get any sort of internship as a freshman—or how early can I get started in such research? Also, I did hear ME ppl have fewer intern/research opportunities than EE/CS ppl; is that true?
3. Berkeley seems to have some really cool engineering clubs, but I also heard that many clubs can be quite competitive &amp; hard to get into (with lots of interviews and whatnot). How true is that?
4. I  did not know about the MET program when applying (\*sigh\*), but if I had known, I definitely would have applied. But since it seems like they won't let me ""transfer"" into the program somehow, I'm thinking of double-majoring in ME-business or ME-economics (hopefully at both Haas and Berkeley Engineering). Is that actually possible? If so, how many ppl do this—is it manageable?
5. What if I wanted to switch my major to Chemical Engineering or EE(CS)? How easy is that, and what steps do you need to take to do so? I think I'd like ME (from my experiences from HS), but tbh I'm not too sure, so I think there's a possibility I may change my major. Also, what if I want to switch entirely into an economics/business major? Is the process of changing my major then a little different?"
fyvtgl,1,2020-04-10,Do or do not a PhD? That's the question,Historical-Carpenter,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/fyvtgl/do_or_do_not_a_phd_thats_the_question/,"Hi everyone! I'm a master's student in AI from abroad (w.r.t. Europe and US). Before starting my master degree last august, I applyed to 5 universities in the US and Canada for PhD in Electrical engineering &amp; CS. Clearly, I got rejected from all of them. At that time I had just finished my undergrad and was not really clear about research directions, I had zero to none research experience, and although I had really good grades, I found out that's not the only important thing for gradschool applications.

Anyway, I got in my MSc in AI in my country, where there are really good researchers (most of them studied abroad), deeply interested in making good research and publish it. I should mention that at the time of applying to those PhDs, I didn't have enough idea of what PhD and research are all about. I also felt kind of burnout, I always worked hard in my undergrad to get those ""life-solving"" good grades. Now, I'm getting to know more about research by actually conducting it, and I think I'm enjoying it, I'm kinda curious about open questions in my field, I enjoy reading papers, etc.

First Isssue: right now I have open doors to work in a thesis project which could eventually give me a pair of publications. I believe I could make it to the level of having a decent application profile for universities abroad. But now I don't know if the PhD is exactly what I really wanted in the first place. I really like teaching, I think I'd like to be a professor, however I really want to have industry experience. Another issue is that, at least in my country, there are not many interesting jobs, say, R&amp;D in AI, computer vision, etc, most technical jobs are for engineers to work inside factories, supervising and stuff...so for many interesting job posts abroad, I see they require a PhD or MSc with equivalente experience. I'm affraid of not getting a PhD and miss out the opportunity of getting one of those jobs and/or internships. I was thinking of doing it in Europe where they are shorter, although US and Canada are my main targets.

Second issue: strongly related with the first one. I guess I could finish a PhD, with all the struggle it comes with, but I don't know if it's going to be good for me in the long road.  Sometimes I feel I'd also like to do something different, beyond ""schooling"", that's the only thing I've done in my entire life. I like to do applied stuff, but when I read about what tech companies do, it seems to me that it's a world apart in difficulty and complexity. I feel I have not that many technical skills. I have no experience. I'm also affraid of loosing friends or missing the chance of making new ones because of the PhD, or of being alone because of focusing a lot on research. I tend to be really focus and sometimes, the only thing I do is working and doing homeworks, that's my everyday life, even weekends. I don't want to get tired about life to soon in my life. What if I make it to the end if the PhD with no jobs options in hand. 

Have any of you guys been in a similar situations? How did you deal with the uncertainty? I'm sorry for such a big text wall. I'd really appreciate your advice. Thanks in advance!

[EDIT] It might sound ""obvious"" that I ""don't"" want to do a PhD. I must mention, I'm really career focused, I think it's one of the most important things in my life, so I think I'm set to do whatever is necessary to advance my career (being it legal of course)."

Any tips?,ForsakenDiscount,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/fyw24n/i_am_leet_coding_away_without_any_job_perspective/,"I recently graduated in computer science and despite having a lot of experience during the course projects and research assistantships and being a good student(perfecting my course projects, good grades, etc), I don't have any industrial experience. I know I should have done internships but didn't due to life circumstances -- Hindsight is always 20/20, you know...

Nowadays, I apply for a lot of positions and all I hear is ""We are sorry"" emails, which are better than being ignored all together tbh. I know a lot of programming languages and the state-of-the-art technologies that the companies ask for. However, I don't have that much evidence to tell them I know their material. It seems like telling them that you have done course projects is not enough for most companies (at least based on my experience). I apply for entry-level positions but even those need like 2 years experience with python. I have experience with python let's say for over 4 years but it seems they mean 2 years of intense industrial python experience, not being exposed to the language in an intermittent way (like one course this semester, another course next semester).

I am good at Leetcode and enjoy solving problems but it feels a bit absurd since I cannot even get an interview to show my skills. I know it is stupid but I feel like giving up altogether go study something different like medicine for with better job security (just a random thought don't take it literally please).

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any tips for improving my situation?

So I’m looking to hear from other people about  their stories of doubt on applying to grad school.  (Sorry for the long post as well) 

So a little about myself, I am a third year student in a combined BS/MAS Chemical Engineering program, and I will graduate May 2021. I plan to apply to PhD programs next cycle, but I have doubts on being admitted. I have a 3.5 undergraduate gpa and a 3.0 graduate gpa. My gpa is my real source of concern right now. This last fall I suffered a concussion (I play a varsity sport at my university) which greatly affected my academic performance. 

I have worked as a research intern for a year (this has inspired me to continue my education), and I am a part of a research group and I should (hopefully) have two publications during time of application. 

My points of concern come from: 
- low gpa for both undergraduate and graduate courses. 
- my university has moved to pass fail grading for this semester so there won’t be an accurate representation of how I preform in my upper level classes. 

I’m hoping to hear other people’s stories that are similar to mine as to have a little more encouragement because I am feeling a little lost recently. Also any advice on how to address my gpa issues in my application would be greatly appreciated! 

Best wishes all and stay healthy!!"

I'm trying to build a portfolio, but I don't know of any noteworthy projects that I can build with Java aside from Android and desktop apps. 

When I researched what languages the internships around my area (Bay Area) require, many of them require web dev languages, mainly html and js, with a background in SQL. There are a handful of internships that have to do with Android development. While there many internships that are  looking for experience in Java, they are also looking for experiences in js or Python.

My problem with developing an Android or desktop app is that I would be narrowing down the number of internships I would qualify for.

Basically, I'm split between developing an Android app to solidify what I already know, or learn other languages to be more marketable."

My options as of now are:

WPI: very good reputation, great academics, ranks highly on post graduates being able to find jobs. 

Drexel: Great school, love philly, and a really appealing factor is Drexel’s coop program which often times is a paid internship that pays upwards of 18k and many are offered full time positions post graduation.

Pitt: great fit, love Pittsburgh, great program and a really good path to interdisciplinary studies which I’m very keen about. Also after merit and need based I’d be paying next to nothing to attend.

Purdue: This one is a doozy, admitted to my top choice major (cybersecurity) Purdue’s cybersecurity program is ranked second?(correct me if I’m wrong) in the nation. Cybersecurity is ultimately the field I want to go into. However, I know nothing about Purdue, never been, don’t think I’d like the area, or fit well...

fz5r04,0,2020-04-11,Please help me choose: UC Davis VS Middlebury,anon001100,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fz5r04/please_help_me_choose_uc_davis_vs_middlebury/,"Hi guys, yes I know that Davis and Midd are completely different but I’m actually quite stuck between the two since it would cost roughly about the same to go to either and I think there’s benefits to both. 

**UC DAVIS**

PROS

-Location: in state, closer to home, NorCal which I’ve always wanted to try living in

-lots of student activities (800+ student organizations) which I love bc I was always more of the type to enjoy/grow from extracurricular activities in HS than pursuing purely academics 

-quarter system: would keep me on my feet, wouldn’t have to take a class I hated for longer than 10 weeks, get to try new classes often

-manageable workload compared to Midd? = time to explore and start personal projects/create things :))

-food options!!! are much much better than in Vermont

-college town but not incredibly far from bigger cities (Sacramento, Bay Area)

-people here seem friendly and generally have similar interests as me (hobbies, pop culture) 

-diversity + lots of people (idk how well I’d do in such a huge school but it seems kinda cool)

-sunny and bright with lots of green around, biking culture 

-transportation costs to go home would be cheaper than Midd since the distance is shorter, I can see my fam more often

CONS

-seems more STEM/premed or agriculture focused (i have little interest in that)

-hard to stand out and get letters of rec from professors 

-study abroad is expensive (whereas at Midd its not that much more than a regular year)

-been told that sometimes it’s hard to get classes and some ppl have to do an extra year of school which means more money spent:( 

-I’m not exactly sure what I want to do rn... so an LAC would be better for that 

-would challenge me but not //that// much

**MIDDLEBURY**

PROS

-great for what I’m currently interested in (foreign language, things international related, possibly econ) but I could explore other things if I find myself not liking those things anymore 

-once in a lifetime chance to live in another state? Experience snow, live on the other side of the country 

-better opportunities to get internships and funding for them, better connections 

-close relationship to my professors and classmates

-challenge my intellectual learning, meet passionate people from around the world

-said to have a great study abroad program that’s affordable which is nice since I always wanted to study abroad in college 

CONS

-older facilities and dorms compared to Davis (actually kind of important to me bc I see myself being happier and more productive in newer/more modern facilities)

-very little diversity. I’m a lower middle class Asian from SoCal and Midd is known to be quite homogenous 

-class size too small? I’m an introvert and tend to prefer to sit there and soak up what my teachers say instead of having to forcefully participate... tbh idk bout this one bc I come from a public school in a pretty big school district so I’ve never really had a “small” class in HS lol maybe small class sizes might be good for me

-FAR, I’m not too good w plane rides plus they’re really expensive considering how big the distance is and w the covid situation being that far from home makes me really nervous 

-very little to do/explore as opposed to Davis which has games, fun recreational activities, hobbies and interesting clubs 

-student culture very based around academics, crazy workload which would probably drive me insane!!!!!!!!!!!! (I’m the type to needs time for myself and to pursue other things to keep myself motivated instead of being on a constant grind)

-kinda worried about my mom. One time I left for 3 days for a fly in program (which I had to beg her to let me go on) and after I left my sister said she saw my mom lying in bed by herself just like thinking and staring blankly at the ceiling which kinda broke my heart ... not my main concern tho bc she’s for the most part supportive of whatever I choose to do but being far from her would also make me a little sad 
—

If you haven’t caught on yet, I’m pretty big on being able to explore and try student activities. What worries me is that I know Midd could probably provide me much better connections and academic support with its small size plus I think I’d become a more introspective human being there. Davis sounds fun and would be an easier transition but still a big enough one for me considering my parents have always been overprotective and so Davis would probably be give me a good opportunity to be an adult while not having to make that huge of a transition. Going out of state at this point in my life seems a little far-fetched especially with the covid situation. However I’d feel guilty for choosing Davis bc even though it serves my non-academic needs better than Midd, I know that the education I’d getting there wouldn’t compare to Midd probably in the slightest and the internships/opportunities I get at Midd could set me on path for a good career... like it could settle what I do for a lifetime 

College is supposed to be a time where you have fun, discover yourself AND get an education. My problem is deciding on what I value more or what school would give me the best balance of those because both schools are very different. I’m not sure how much college should have an impact on my career so do I go to Midd which is far from the opportunities in Cali where I think I’ll return to for work but has better academics and access to internships or go to Davis where I’ll have less academic opportunities but I’ll be more active in student life and have the time to start projects/discover myself as an adult. 

Sorry if some of this sounds wordy and absurd, it’s like 6am and I need to sleep but I can’t bc I’m stressed about this. My parents are immigrants who came to the US for my education and for me to have more opportunities so this whole process has been left pretty much entirely to me. I’m super grateful to even have this choice and therefore don’t want to make the wrong choice and waste my parents’ hard-earned money.

I am set to graduate December 2021 with CS Major. I have 4 internships (Fortune 500). I was wondering when is the best time to start applying/interviewing for new grad roles if I graduate on December.   
Like for Spring Graduate, you are expected to start around the summer-fall semester of your senior year. Anyone sharing their experience while graduating on December will be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Another question, if I apply assuming that I graduate on Spring, can I defer my start date to the next January?"

Would I be an asshole to use the offer as leverage to speed up other interview processes i'm in/help me get other interviews? Especially since people are having internships cancelled due to COVID? I'm asking both on the perspective of recruiters looking at me as a candidate, and just from an overall moral perspective."
fzgm6i,11,2020-04-11,I'm not going to get into college because of corona,helloworld666666,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fzgm6i/im_not_going_to_get_into_college_because_of_corona/,"I'm a high school junior and in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, I feel completely helpless and incompetent. This post might be selfish and might be very r/firstworldproblems but I just want to get this off my chest because I've been keeping my feelings bottled up for the past couple of weeks.

Throughout high school, my grades are pretty decent and my extra curricular activities are few and very average. Going into junior year, I thought, ""This is the year I'm going to pop off and prove that I'm capable."" I had so many plans and aspirations that all fell apart as soon as March hit.

1. Testing: I took the SAT in August and I got an okay score, but I personally feel that it is not competitive enough compared to the rest of the applicant pool for the colleges I want to attend. I planned on retaking it in March except the March SAT was cancelled for my school and now the earliest date I can take it is in June, which brings me to another issue: subject tests. It's pretty conventional for people to take subject tests in June, since it's right after the AP Exams and most classes have covered all of the material by that point. I originally was planning on taking the Physics Subject Test in June, but with the SAT rescheduled, that is no longer an option. I know I can always take it in August and October, but it's cutting it too close for my comfort. What if my June SAT is not satisfactory and I need to take it again? Then my subject test date would get pushed back even more. In addition, (because I'm an overachieving idiot) I wanted to take the ACT before my senior year as well. Now, I don't think I can handle all this testing in such a short time frame before college applications. Moving on to AP Exams... which is pretty self explanatory. The structural change and the ease at which students can cheat on them is a hinderance to anybody.
2. Volunteering: I started volunteering pretty late compared to most high schoolers (late summer before junior year) because I'm unusually young for my grade and with a 15-year-old age requirement for many volunteering organizations, I couldn't apply until much later. I volunteer both at a hospital and through an online tutoring program, both of which have been cancelled due to the virus. I was hoping to get the President's Volunteer Service Award and of course, that is no longer possible due to an insufficient number of hours.
3. The first two points are definitely obstacles, but these next few topics are really what hurt me the most. First, let me clarify that I want to major in a STEM field. Last year, my friend and I won a chemistry competition in our local section and were invited to regionals this year. It would take place in early June in NYC, and with the current situation, I'm assuming the competition will be cancelled. Second, I was also planning on taking the examinations for USNCO, but because our teacher chose the latest date possible to hold the local exam, our school already shifted to virtual learning by then. To prepare for the exam, I spent countless hours and an embarrassing amount of money in a prep course to ensure that I would place well. Not only do I feel like all my effort was for naught, I feel terrible for wasting my parents' money like that.
4. My summer plans: Since I want to major in STEM, I know how important laboratory experience or an internship is. I applied to/was planning to apply to many different research internships for the summer but I no longer have hope that I will be able to secure one for this summer. For a bunch of my friends who are interested in either writing or computer science, these programs have simply transitioned online. I feel like I will be the only one left without a competitive or intense summer program.
5. Because of how coronavirus has impacted students, colleges are changing the way they evaluate applicants. So things like GPA and test scores will be weighted less, while extracurriculars will be weighted more. Well frick because due to coronavirus, my extracurriculars will drag my entire application down. Other than my SAT score, my stats are one of the higher points about my application.

I have so many additional things that I could continue ranting about from my athletics being impacted to the music portfolio I was planning on creating but I think my point is made. Coronavirus completely screwed up my plans and maybe even my chances for getting into a ""good"" college. I feel like there's nothing I can do about it and the situation is completely out of my control.

After taking a moment to reflect on what I just wrote, I want to make a few points. I realize this virus has caused so much more pain to other people around the world than I have experienced. I probably sound like an ungrateful teenager but simply put, I'm angry, frustrated, and devastated. Second, I am also to blame for a lot of my current problems. I could have taken the SAT in December. I could have had the foresight to do an internship or get research experience starting from last year. There are so many things that I could've done, but I only realize now, when it's too late. That being said, sure coronavirus might have been the thing to pull the trigger, but I myself loaded the gun. So maybe this post isn't a rant about how coronavirus obliterated my plans, but how I fucked up instead."
fzgolz,4,2020-04-11,housing advice needed (anyone need summer sublease)?,throwaway646142700,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fzgolz/housing_advice_needed_anyone_need_summer_sublease/,"So back before the shelter-in-place, I had a verbal agreement to join 3 others on a 3 bedroom place on Northside, 8 minute walk to Soda, bus stop 100 feet away and 10 minute bus ride to BART, a really nice single room (14'x12' master bedroom) for around $1400/mo, but it was starting 6/1.  My original plan was to move in for the summer and either commute to my internship in the Peninsula or take a TA position.  Well, the internship went bye bye and classes for summer are online.  Plus my family is losing a shitload of money while shelter is in place.  

I'm wondering if it makes sense to try and sublease the place for the summer?  Since school is online, it sounds like it's not going to work. It also looks like a ton of people are trying to do the same thing.  My other options are to just forego the place and find something else closer to August (would want something very comparable, single on Northside close to Soda), or to just fork over the $2800 or so and call it a day.  What do you think?"
fzhnnt,3,2020-04-11,"PhD (statistics) student, was going to apply for academic jobs next academic year, but my adviser says there's going to be a hiring freeze due to world events. Now what?",NTGuardian,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/fzhnnt/phd_statistics_student_was_going_to_apply_for/,"I posted yesterday about a big conference in my field getting cancelled and I talked to my adviser and a coauthor about it. They were not concerned; what's worse is that they're saying the job market will be terrible. My adviser even said that universities are freezing hiring. Also no one wants to retire due to the stock market, so even if there were hiring there'd be less positions to fill.

Next year was when I was going to start applying for jobs. It was supposed to be my last year of funding. But it sounds like no one will hire not just me but anyone. I will not take an adjunct position unless I literally can find no other job, including industry, since I've heard enough horror stories from the Internet to know that it's terrible; heck, even postdocs scare me! While I have not had industry internships (and at this time they're probably not possible), I've even had people from industry reach out to me when I wasn't looking for a job (in the good times) in part due to a blog I maintained (but I haven't posted for about a year), and my adviser has great connections; I think I'd have a good shot. So I could go into industry... but honestly, the job market in general could be very bad, not just in academia.

I'm not miserable as a graduate student; I've figured out how to make my life pleasant. But I don't think that staying another year is really an option.

What do I do now?"

My issue is that I'm *really* struggling with the time it takes for me to complete tasks. It often takes me twice as long to complete a project as other interns, and my mentor often seems a bit disappointed that I'm still working on a project he thought I would have finished a week or two ago. I get it done, and I do it fairly well, but it seems to just take me a lot longer to think through problems and how to solve them than other people. I've had to resort to spending some evenings coding after work just so I can seem like I'm making more progress during my work hours, which obviously isn't sustainable or healthy (although right now with the lockdown I don't have much else going on, and I find my classes very easy). On the plus side, everyone seems to like me and I get along really well with the team, so I think that's helping even if I'm not the best employee. I'm just concerned about being this slow once I graduate...

I know practice makes perfect, but I don't understand how people just blaze through code, especially when we're regularly using languages/technologies/problem spaces that are completely brand new to them. It's not like I'm comparing myself to senior software engineers either - just the other interns seem to be able to pick up much more complex work much more quickly. I know what we learn in university is fairly orthogonal to the career, but I've had straight A's in every CS course so I like to think I'm not a complete dumb-dumb. But even with my courses, my approach to coursework is to start early and spend time mulling things over. I'm not good at doing assignments last minute."

Basically it’d give me a bit of a high/energy and then a crash after about two hours. I don’t really think I became more focused either. 

Eventually I just quit filling the prescription and gave up on medication without trying an alternative. Now I’m working on an internship that requires 90 pages (minimum) of reading and a 1,500 report every three days. The struggle is very real.

If I have interest in something then I experience tunnel vision but if I’m uninterested then I can’t sit for more than 5 minutes or avoid distractions. I’m engaging in every distraction possible and now I’m desperate for some help. Just curious about people’s relationships with their meds. How effective has it been for people. Have some meds been terrible and another did the trick? Etc.

I’m skeptical how effective meds are for adhd in general. Taking stimulants never made much sense to me, as I just felt like my hyperfocus/unfocus was just amplified. 

Anyways I’m curious what everyone has to say. Thanks!"

I will have my first internship this summer. I have constantly taken the highest level courses available to me and I get good grades, but I have terrible self confidence.

What scares me:

1. I feel I don't have enough experience. I have not taken many classes where I had to design something. I am scared that I will get to a job and be so out of my depth that I'll crumble.
2. I have never been able to do homework in a sane amount of time without chegging questions. I have always memorized the 'algorithm' needed to solve a problem in any class. I think I am good at test taking but not good at engineering. To add to that, my long term memory isn't great. I constantly need to open my old textbooks up and refresh myself even for things last semester.
3. I lean on my colleagues a lot for help in class.
4. I am not good at analytically finding solutions to abstract problems (i.e. I took dynamics II which had Lagranian and Hamiltonian mechanics and rotodynamics (&amp; rotoshaft stability) I got by with the skin of my teeth)
5. I feel like I'm not creative enough. The best way I learn is by seeing someone else do something a couple times. I am not good at creating new concepts. I prefer to do tried-and-true methods.

What gives me hope:

1. I get good marks on my projects.
2. I am resourceful and take good notes, read all the assigned reading, ask colleagues for help, and when all else fails I know how to make good queries on Google.
3. I really enjoy learning and I like reading papers (even though a lot of the math is nonsense to me).
4. I am a fast learner.
5. Even though I feel like I have forgotten a lot, if I refresh myself it generally comes back to me.
6. I will graduate with both a masters and bachelors at the same time (my university allows undergrads to take grad courses on day one, not recommended, but possible).

I scared that I will fail on the job because I learned to be good at exams and chegg homework. My terrible memory really scares me. For example,right now I understand the general concepts of heat transfer but I would not be able to find/estimate the convection coefficient for a part made in CAD.

Has anyone experienced the same? How did you overcome this anxiety?"
fzq0qd,0,2020-04-12,UW vs University of Utah,garbageboy007,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fzq0qd/uw_vs_university_of_utah/,"Need help deciding! I got accepted into UW Seattle (in-state; direct admit to college of engineering) and University of Utah (direct admit; full ride scholarship). I plan on pursuing a major in bioengineering, though I'd also like to keep my options somewhat open. I also am considering grad school later down the road so there's that to keep in mind as well. Basically, UW is the obvious choice when it comes to having a more prestigious program, but I think I would be happier with the overall environment at University of Utah. What do you guys think? UW is my best option and I don't want to pass up such a great opportunity, but I also don't want to end up stuck in an environment where I might feel too overwhelmed and isolated. All I seem to hear about is how competitive and cutthroat it can be since everyone is vying for the top spots. Not to mention if I went there I would be surrounded by many of the same peers as high school (a big con in my mind lol). Don't get me wrong, I don't mind working hard and I'm used to competition so it's not a major problem. I still am very interested in going there. I just feel reluctant that it will feel too much like high school, where I was TOO consumed in this culture of competition. Of course there's really no real way of knowing how I'd do in each environment without actually attending there, so it is hard to accurately access each environment. I could absolutely thrive at UW, who knows. I certainly would enjoy having access to such amazing research and internship opportunities, as well as being around so many major tech companies! I guess part of what I am asking as well is if I go to a school like University of Utah, do I risk losing access to some of the opportunities needed to get into a prestigious grad school and thrive in my career? Is it worth going to a more competitive school, battling to set myself apart, or should I go for the safer option and hope I can still differentiate myself enough? Or perhaps my impressions of these schools are misguided? I'd like to hear any advice or thoughts. I really can see myself going to either of these schools so anything is appreciated.

Demographics: I'm a white male living in California, my family are immigrants from Russia idk if that matters lol.

Intended Major(s): I would definitely like to major in something computer science related, probably machine learning. 

ACT/SAT/SAT II: Haven't taken any because of the virus yet but my PSAT last year was 1410 and I didn't really study. Have taken quite a few online practice tests and am in general a pretty good test taker, so I think most likely 1550(or like a 34 ACT) or above. I also plan on taking both subject tests and hopefully getting max on those. 

GPA and Rank: So I've pretty much been taking the most APs possible, I think by the end of this semester I should have like a 4.4 or 4.5 GPA, but I have gotten a few Bs so unweighted is probably like 3.9 something. 

Coursework: So far only taken one AP test sophomore year, got a 5, I have 5 AP classes this year and 6 APs senior year. Gotten a few Bs but everything else is an A.

Awards: Not really, I play piano so I've won quite a few pretty big national competitions, but idk piano is a pretty common EC.

Extracurriculars: So this is where I think Im either the strongest or the weakest. I play waterpolo and tennis, all 4 years of HS. I play piano pretty professionally. No clubs or anything which is what I'm scared of. Had a summer internship with a pretty big tech startup, probably will do it again this summer. Idk if this is an EC but I have a Fiverr gig making neural networks for people, have gotten a few jobs done so idk if that would look good. Also no community service yet but plan on doing some this summer hopefully.

Essays/LORS/Other: I would say Im a pretty good essay writer and can convey my uniqueness and worth(hopefully), and I think both my AP calc and AP comp sci teachers like me and will write good LORS.

Schools: So in order of preference; MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Cal Tech. Those are my top 4 choices. 

So not a lot of info, but I just hope someone can tell me a rough estimate of my chances, and Id love any advice on how to increase my chances. I've wanted to write a research paper on machine learning as it's a big passion of mine and I think it could look really good if I get it published somewhere."

It was nothing like regular internship (No formal orientation, no mentor, no specific project). I was barely doing any work for the first week. 

Then, I was assigned to work on a project for someone in my team. The project was just initiated. It was just making a web app prototype for POC. It got interesting. Looking over tutorials video, I learnt web dev and built the prototype. They were quite impressed. There was constant feedback loop that kept improving the prototype. 

Then, they assigned me next project, this time, it was tougher with vague requirement. I researched and learnt and again presented them another prototype. They told me that I was top performer. I was happy. 

But now, they want me to build those web app at production level so that people can use it. There are only 2 in the team, one working at backend(from different team) and I am working at front end and database. Its even tougher because I have never done it and there are too many unknowns. They are stressing that it should be completed before specified deadline. The problem is I am using tech stack that nobody is expert in, so I have to lot of research myself. I am working 50-60 hours but only paid for 40. I am halfway in phase 1 but I am not confident that thing I developed will be bug free and efficient in terms of performance.

Is this a viable pathway? I've looked at coding bootcamps but I'm not sure if they will give me a strong foundation in computer science and programming."
fzynjc,66,2020-04-12,Tips Needed: Applying to PhD while in PhD,aenneas_academe,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/fzynjc/tips_needed_applying_to_phd_while_in_phd/,"Hi,

Background: So I am currently done with my first year of PhD. Mind this is in Europe so I already had a master's before this. My wife has sacrificed her career to move in with me from abroad, thinking she can learn the language and practice her profession. However, this doesn't seem possible any more and her mental well-being has been deteriorating rapidly due to this. Now she has been presented with opportunities by her friends in another country in the EU, so I would like to do all I can to go to another lab for her sake. I don't mind losing a year or so for her.

The first tip I need is how to address the elephant in the room: why am I leaving my current PhD? They will see in my CV that I am doing a PhD right now. Should I explain the reason in my cover letter?

Second tip I need is about my competitiveness:

I would like to make sure my application looks competitive enough for other labs. I am only applying for funded positions (i.e. vacancies. Quite common in the EU where PhD students are a lot of the time considered employees with contract). I will list my strong suits below and hopefully some of you who are experienced in hiring (or getting hired) may chime in to point out if they are positive or not and how to inject them to application (i.e. put this in CV; mention this in cover letter etc)

1. I have a master's particularly in my field (AI) from a well-respected institution. (goes into CV obviously)
2. During my master's, I was selected from the beginning as the special class of my year and offered a part-time research assistantship in one of the research groups. I have held this position for 2 years (throughout my master's). (Should go to CV as work experience + awards?)
3. For two summers I have worked as full-time research summer intern at this research group. (Work experience I reckon)
4. I was offered a ""thesis worker"" position and was funded full-time for 6 months of my thesis. (again work experience)
5. In my final master's year I have co-organised a special course with the postdoc I work with (Have a teaching experience section?)
6. My 6 months thesis work and the first 4 months of my PhD resulted in a published paper (I'm the 2nd author) in one of our top venues. Basically, nowhere higher than that in AI research. (Publications part)
7. I have published two top-tier workshop papers (1st author).  (publications)
8. Attended a summer school by CIFAR in my area. (add the certificate)
9. I was awarded a personal research grant from a foundation, and also awarded funding for 2yrs by the department. (Should this go to grants and funding?)

I think the last point is extra important. I want to emphasise that, even though I was hired by my professor's budget, I applied and got my own funding for at least 3 years of my PhD. This I think should bring external validation, showing the department and a foundation have confidence in me. I think this should also help them see I am not leaving due to lack of funding etc.

I am open to any tips + suggestions. Thanks a lot!"

The company said they take everyone is an interns first. The only issue I see is financially if it’s unpaid (I’m unsure if it is, I’m talking to them tomorrow for more details) it’s not wise for me to accept that role. I’ll be moving to an area with a high cost of living and id rather not use my savings for 2 - 4 weeks.

ever since I was a kid I was pretty good at school. I did all the typical brown kid things like go to Kumon and be put in a bunch of ECS from the jump. Nothing really stuck with me when I got to high school. So fast forward, its my freshman year and I am super hype. I did many clubs and did well in a lot of my honors classes ( honors english, bio , algebra 2, geometry). Towards the end of the year, I started losing motivation because I was moving schools and was just hanging out with the wrong people. I thought I would do better there. When I moved schools, it was super competitive. It was named the "" rich kid"" school in our town. I started sitting alone at lunch because no one wanted to talk to me. A girl ended up bullying me because of the clothes I wore. It sucked from going to a place where everyone knew you to a place where no one wanted anything to do with you. The only honors/ AP classes I was taking that year was honors chem and AP econ ( which I ended with B averages). It was a rough year for me as well because my mom had got an illness ( which required a lot of hospital visits and just pushed me out mentally ) and we were moving into a new home. I tried joining clubs but I felt like I never fit in and I was just mentally out of it. The only extracurricular I did were band ( nothing special just the regular one) and a couple clubs. One I had a leadership position in.  I knew junior year was my last shot, so I took AP physics, AP stats, AP Psych, along with some honors classes. I also doubled up on math and English that year ( but just CP). 

so a summary of my junior year 

91.5 uw 96.5 w 95 cum

ap physics, ap stats, ap psych, comp sci, calculus, and the humanities 

have a leadership position in one club and joined others.

took the SAT but my score was really low. I was planning on taking it August of my senior year but with corona who knows 

had an internship lined up but nothing came out of that because of corona 

30 volunteer hours

I made a lot of wrong decisions throughout my high school career class and EC wise that I regret, but what do you think I could do to make my application stand out?

Im looking for colleges that could accept me for CS which is really competitive but after all I have been through I know I have the drive to do better."

Over the past couple months I've decided I want to pursue the sys admin path, and I have been studying when I can. I haven't been putting too much pressure on myself, as I'm not in a rush because I'm still learning more and more of our system every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I have a good relationship with the network admin team and they know of my desire to learn more and advance. We're currently working on setting up our new VMWare desktop environment and they asked me to be part of the team to which I gladly accepted. Just yesterday, I was asked to take ownership of setting up the VM desktop and configuring/deploying a KMS server to activate 365 on the desktops, sweet! Except now, I kind of feel a bit over my head since I've only been studying this stuff a couple of hours every week for the past 2 months or so. I like to think of myself as capable, I'm very resourceful and obviously the network team is more than happy to help, but I want to try to prove I can do this without them having to hold my hand. I've learned how to set up Office 365 on a non-persistent desktop, and I've been able to figure out how to set up a general KMS server, except my question is now, how do I get them to talk to each other? How do I get the KMS server to authenticate 365 every time a new VM is spun up? I'm trying to replicate this in a virtualbox environment on my home system, but having trouble figuring it out. Thanks."

g02f4k,0,2020-04-12,Turning Down a Full-Time Offer to Freelance,hahacompilergoerror,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g02f4k/turning_down_a_fulltime_offer_to_freelance/,"To preface my question with some info: 

I am a CS undergrad student about to graduate this spring. I was never super into technology until I switched into CS my 2nd year of undergrad. That's when I started to do side projects, hackathons, just fully diving into the CS world.

I couldn't secure a summer internship my junior year. tbh, I was not trying hard enough to get one anyways, and I ended up without one. Not to say I was an expert programmer or engineer at the time and could have easily secured an internship, but I didn't put in the effort to get one. I felt some reluctance working for a company, I liked the idea of working on my own hours and for myself. 

So that summer, I tried freelancing for a company, to beef up my resume. It was definitely a lot of work, like constant communication, planning out the app, learning a full stack, configurations, actually programming, testing, and finally delivering. On top of that, learning soft skills like time management and hardcore focusing. 

It was one of my favorite experiences of my college career. I enjoyed the communication aspect, and working anywhere I wanted, and any time I wanted. The pay!...was not so great. I figure because it was my first time freelancing, but that's just my current assumption. 

Final year of CS undergrad, I send my resume to as many companies as possible and secure a few interviews. Each time I interview, I get a little better, but ultimately, rejected. One interview really kicked my ass with leetcode questions. That's when I knew I had to step it up to secure a full time role.

After lots of hours of deliberate practice of leetcode, I took on one more company, and went through their interview process, and got an offer! A decent offer too, at a well known company.

Really, I should be grateful for this opportunity. Lots of students who deserve these positions more than I do still struggle to find a job. But for some reason...I do not want this job at all. I don't want to spend 5 days a week, stuck at one location, working 9-5. I WANT to work, don't get me wrong, but not like this. I want to work for myself again, and to be able to do it wherever.

So the question is: as a soon-to-be CS graduate, is it viable to make a living freelancing right off the bat, or is the smart move to accept this job offer?"

I switched to this major from IST (have an associate's degree in that field) and currently have 2 years left of CS-related courses only. I've never had an internship yet and from what I've researched passing a lot of the interviews requires knowledge I would gain from Data Structures and Algorithms.

I am not able to take my Data Structures course until the Spring and not able to take my Algorithms course until the Fall of my final year. 

Currently now and during the summer I'm brushing up on my javascript and plan to learn some frameworks and also am delving into the ""Programming Interview Exposed"" and ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" books.

What I need advice on is when would be the best time to go toward an internship and what should I do prioritize doing over the summer to help prepare me?

Intended Majors: Double concentration in Neuroscience and possibly English (on a pre-med track)

ACT: 36 (35/36/35/36/10)

SAT: haven't taken it unless you count the time I took it in middle school, SAT II Bio: 770 (plan to take Chem and Lit over the summer if I can)

GPA: 3.94/4.00 (unweighted)

Courseload: I've taken the most challenging courses offered at my school.

Rank: (school doesn't rank, but I'd assume top of my very small graduating class)

AP: School doesn't offer AP courses, but I have taken 3 exams thus far (USH - 4, USGov - 5, and Psych - 5) and hope to take Chem, Calc AB, and Lit this year

Awards: No major ones

Extracurriculars:

1. Student Council president - I've been super involved in my school's community, and have been lucky enough to be elected as the president for the past two school years. My term will unfortunately end right when I start applying to colleges, but it's been a good time :')
2. Mixed Martial Arts - I've been learning for around 4 years now, and have recently began to teach kid's white belt classes. My belt rank is kinda hard to explain because my family moved and I had to restart at my new dojo, but I technically have a bunch of knowledge already, so I'm in a strange spot.
3. Hospital Volunteer - Have been volunteering for two years now and was primarily involved in Maternity Care and the ER. I'd estimate 100+ hours. Unfortunately this has been cancelled due to COVID-19, which is a bummer.
4. Summer Program - Did a summer camp as a rising sophomore where I took two courses for college credit. It wasn't at a super-well known university, but the courses were challenging and it was a lot of material packed into only a couple of weeks.
5. Internship - Worked as a high school research intern over the summer as a rising junior at a well-known medical school and published two papers in journals with an average impact factor of 2 (one directly related to the research being done and another collaboration with my PI). I learned a lot from the experience and it's made me want to pursue neuroscience.
6. Paid Internship - Currently work as a remote paid intern for a private research company where I'm working on neuroscience projects. Currently writing a paper set to be published by the end of this year and hope to conduct original research this summer (luckily this won't be cancelled because it's already a remote position).
7. I'm a Writing TA at school and I've been doing it for 2 or so years now. We have a Writing Center where we edit peer submissions and offer feedback.
8. President of Book Club and Biology Club at school.
9. Not sure if this is even an EC, but in early 2018 I raised over 17k dollars for a disabled orphan child in India with a GoFundMe and coordinated efforts to send the money to her. It was a very rewarding experience and I do still keep in touch with her :)

Essays: I'm a pretty good writer and plan to work on my essays for a while over the summer (with some of teachers helping me edit), so hopefully they should be okay.

LOR:

\- Biology teacher: As I mentioned previously, I'm super lucky to be able to go to a tight-knit school, so my teachers know me very well and I've asked several teachers to write me letters before, which they've been happy to do. I think this letter will be an 8/10.

\- English teacher: I've had this teacher for 2 years now and have really built a connection with her, so I'm hoping 9/10.

\- Counselor: My counselor really likes me and our meetings always last far beyond our set time and have known her for 3 years now, so I'm guessing a 9/10.

\- Might submit another letter from my research supervisor, but unsure on this one.

If anyone has any other suggestions please also feel free to reverse chance, I'm definitely building a list of schools to apply to in the case I get deferred or rejected Brown.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can improve myself over the summer before sending off my application in November?

Feel free to PM me with any other questions or suggestions too!

Thank you all so much for reading and commenting, and I hope you have a lovely day :)"

I'm pretty strong in HTML, CSS, Python, Django and PostgreSQL. I've been loving Django and my final project was building a fully functional site which I took a lot of pride in.

My program was supposed to find me an internship to get some experience under my belt, but given the Corona situation (and my country especially being strict with the guidelines) I don't think that's an option. 

I want to continue learning and growing with Python. I have a SQL course I bought on Udemy a while back so I plan on doing that to get more SQL skills, but what can I do in the meantime to grow more with Python? Should I look up tutorials on YouTube? Should I think of more projects to build and just do that and practice that way? 

I've heard that it's good to specialize (especially in the beginning of your coding journey) and not bite off more than you can chew by trying to learn so many different languages at once. What would you guys recommend?

\*COULD BE TRIGGERING\*

I know teachers work hard and care for their students, but I feel that many children slip through the cracks. Unfortunately, I think children often only have their teachers to advocate for them because they may not come in contact with other adults (or even if they do, they may only see their doctor once a year rather than 200+ days a year like a teacher would). 

I was one of the children who slipped through the cracks. I was neglected &amp; abused as a child. I'd wear the same clothes, have unbrushed hair and would act out. Instead of teachers taking a second to care and talk to me, I was told that I was very bad. I understand that teachers can be stressed, but no one seemed to care to ask me some questions. When I went to a public school in the second grade (before I was ""homeschooled"") I could not read or write. This did not show up as a red flag to anyone. I would run away from class (just randomly lunge out of my seat and dart away). I remember writing about Thanksgiving, the teacher kept coming up behind me ""you need to write something"". I remember so desperately wanting to write, I wanted someone to be proud of me. I wanted to do what the teacher told me to, but I couldn't. I remember slowly forming the word ""thanksgiving"" on my paper that she had written on the board. ""Faster"" she told me. It seemed like the clock ticked louder and louder. 

If I didn't do the assignment, then I'd be put in time out she told me. I remember whispering to another kid to help me with my ABC's that I did not know ""what comes after..."". Since I always ran out of class, the let me stay with the counselor. I do not remember what we talked about, but it was a joy to not have the pressure of being in class. 

They decided to hold me back. I was too behind even for first grade though. I'd miss school because I'd run before the bus came. Eventually my parents had enough of it. I was jerked by my neck and thrown down on the seat and told ""you're not leaving this seat until you learn how to read"". Neither teacher called to check up on me, I imagine both were happy to get rid of me. The counselor called me and told me how she thought it would be so great for me - that now I can get one on one attention. I remember that even as a seven y/o this did not make sense to me. She knew that I was homeschooled before. I couldn't read when my mom was at home, but now that she has a job and won't be home somehow that will be better for me? Also a seven y/o home alone without any supervision? No one had an issue with this? No, they did not. They got to get rid of me.

By some type of miracle I taught myself to read. I did not go to a public school until the sixth grade again. At first I did not receive good grades (mainly because I never had history, science or any other class). Sometimes I'd be made fun of ""you don't know the colors of the rainbow?""

I ended up having a reading level in the 99th percentile for the US. I ended up being number one in my middle school and become the salutatorian of my high school. All throughout my life I heard ""you're so quiet"". One teacher would yell and I would jump out of my seat in fear and he would laugh. ""You're so sensitive - kids nowadays haven't had anything"". Well, no one else jumped. I jumped because yelling for me meant I was going to get beat. I always was hardworking and did things without being asked. Teachers commented on how my parents must be proud and I'd look down. Every time they talked about my parents a lump would form in my throat and I'd look elsewhere. They'd pause and look like something was up, but no one ever asked. ""Your parents must be so proud"" ""Yeah"" ""Don't they say it?"" ""No, we don't really talk"". Never a follow-up.

&amp;#x200B;

They would hear that I made lunches for myself. ""You cooked that all by yourself?"" I'd tell them yes and they'd ask if I liked to cook. I would say no. They'd look perplexed. Every once in awhile we'd discuss something in class and I'd share little pieces about my childhood, such as ""neither of my parents cook"".  There would be a pause, ""how can they not cook?"" There would be a pause again and I'd look down and I'd joke ""I made myself ramen a lot"". 

I went to a school to internship (not for a teaching position) and I noticed things no one else seemed to notice. I told the counselor about one boy who had dirty fingernails. Not always a warning sign, but I decided to lightly talk to him. He seemed incredibly depressed. That is not normal for a young child. I asked him about different things and he told me some scary things. I notified the counselor. She ended up doing a hotline call because it was very concerning. How did his teachers and counselors not notice anything? I'm not sure and I don't want to come off as prideful. I saw him the second I walked in the room because he reminded me of myself.

Listen, I love you teachers and I appreciate you! I would not blame anyone in my childhood, but sometimes I wonder, what if I hadn't been forgotten? What if someone had asked me ""why are you running away?"" ""why aren't you writing?"". What if someone had believed in me? 

I won't pretend to know what it's like to be a teacher, but I was a Sunday school teacher at my church. I'd always come early and stay late. Why? To talk to the kids and form relationships. Trouble child? I made it my mission to get to know them. I tried to give them a smile and encourage them if we passed by in the hall. There was one time I reported a suspected child abuse case and everyone was questioning why the girl would tell me ""a stranger"" rather than her teacher or the kid pastors. That's because I spent time with her. That's because I listened. That's because I cared. I wasn't rushed. 

Notice the signs. Not all abused kids are ""problem children"". I was as a young child, but I was also well-disciplined when I got older. Look out for the child that never speaks or is quiet. It doesn't mean that they were abused, but get to know them. Look out for the children in the same clothes or unbrushed hair/unclean fingernails. Listen to children and ask them questions. That does not mean you say ""are you abused?"" but you can find out many things without it seeming like you're asking about abuse. 

Now that children are home with their parents, it may be important more than ever to notice signs in your children. See how they're doing, let them know you care and build trust between them! Ask them questions that show you're interested. YOU make a difference! :)"

For example: how to organize project files, make abstractions correctly, write scalable logic, etc.

I ask this since I'm a new grad who started working full-time this year and although I've been coding for \~5 years, a lot of my work is of prototype scale and quality whether it's through college projects, side projects, hackathons, or internships and I'd like to take my coding skills to the next level.

I know that the best practices can differ by language and platform, so I'll also mention that I'm interested in getting better at Java (backend web dev and big data), Python (backend web dev and infra), JavaScript, and Node.js. I haven't worked with Scala (big data), Go (infra) yet, but I'm interested in picking them up in the future."

I’m two years older. She’s currently in her second year of undergrad at UC Berkeley and I’m finishing up my first year of my master’s program at USC. I’m currently taking my classes remotely because I got exempt from going onto campus since I’m also working a full time job that ranges around 40-60 hours a week + do UI Design/art commissions as a freelance hustle (approx +5 hours a week)

Amidst all the COVID-19 issues, my sister ended up coming home early since Cal suspended all on-campus classes. My parents have always babied her since she is the younger one in the family and since I’m older, they expect me to take care of her **(and by “take care”, they also mean financially because I have a job - which I don't understand because I just finished paying off my undergrad loans on my own and am currently paying for grad school by myself...which doesn't leave me with many ""FUN""ds left... they (including my sister) call me a shitty older sister for using my money on vacations instead of giving my sister a fucking allowance).** They deliver food to her, help her with laundry, clean her apartment, got her a brand new laptop for college, all that kind of stuff. Whereas me because I went to a lower tier UC...nothing. Because Cal is known to be difficult, she needs all the resources/help she can get - is what they claim, aside from the fact I went to school 400+ miles away lol.

The other day I was irritated over her not washing a few dishes and saw how my dad automatically cleaned up after her. I asked him out of curiosity, *“Why do you and mom quietly do everything for her, but when I leave a bowl to wash later, I get nagged at?”* 

*He responds, “because your sister is in school and she needs all the time she can to study.”* 

*Me: “I’m in school too?”*

*Him: “Yeah, but she goes to Berkeley.”* 

*Me: “I also work full time.”*

*Him: “Berkeley is difficult.”*

Anyways, I guess this was the final trigger for me. This is the thing I don’t understand, my parents glorify my sister for being “smart” since she went to Cal, and have even told me that I’m jealous of her because I CHOSE to go to a lower-tier UC (I honestly don’t...care?) My mom was upset with me for getting offended at her for telling me I was jealous of my sister, and told me to quit lying when I denied her claim. My parents think I’m jealous of my sister because they claim she’s younger &amp;amp; more academically inclined than I am. I feel this constant need to prove them wrong and I still do. Part of the reason why I even went to grad school (aside from research/teaching) was to prove to my parents that I’m not as dumb as they think I am since they always shat on my undergrad institution. I also finished undergrad in three years, went straight into a full-time job, and went to do a small research program at Cornell for 3 months before I started my master’s at USC. It honestly kinda hurts to just say this because none of my accomplishments feel like accomplishments because it’s nothing from Berkeley. 

When I admitted into USC for my Master’s degree I was asked “Why didn’t you get into Stanford?” They also had to check the authenticity of my USC ID card after it was mailed home - I even saw my mom text my uncle photos of my ID card and admission letter to make sure it wasn’t a scam and that I actually got into grad school. Seeing this freaking HURT because it really made be believe that my parents thought I was too stupid to get into a grad program. 

My parents constantly compare me to her asking why I go out to drink all the time/hang out with friends and constantly complain about how they never see me sit put to study, I just go straight to bed all the time after work/gym (lmao I go to sleep at like 10PM), whereas my sister stays up all night til 2AM studying for her classes. I can’t “fake” studying in front of them because that’s just a waste of my time. I love going out/traveling and I manage to fit it all into my school/work schedule but to my parents they see me as some kid who just wants to go out and have fun all the time / doesn’t care much about academics. They constantly say I’m setting up a bad example to my younger sister because I go out too much (She’s 20... and I’m 22 LOL). My parents expect me to give her an allowance because I have a job now and I should support her because she’s younger, and the little ones need to be taken care of... but when I was her age I already finished my third internship, started my freelance work, and was almost financially sustainable on my own. They constantly ask me to help my sister look for an internship/refer her to my company because she's a busy student and kept telling me I was selfish for not having the time to help her - they claimed that I just didn't want her to be better than me because she already had leverage with her educational institution. I'd get a mouthful if I went to bed right after a 10 hour-work instead of reviewing her papers/homework for her and it got to the point where she would get upset at me too and accuse me of making empty promises for not making time to review her papers. And because I got to bed after work/don't follow through with some of the things I agreed to do for her, I'm a ""shitty sister"". I understand her frustration and how it feels to not have a promise fulfilled but I don't think they all understand that I just don't have the mental bandwidth to read papers after working an 8+ hour work day and adding another 5+ hours at the end of the day for my OWN school work. I just want to go to the gym/out for drinks/to bed because I'm so mentally exhausted at the end of EVERY DAY. But instead I'm told I'm a selfish and shitty older sister.

I have to excuse all her shortcomings/mistakes/or anything about her not being responsible for herself or independent because she's ""younger"" and it's frustrating because I'm genuinely concerned about what will happen once she is on her own. 2 years is a big gap at our age (20 and 22), but I feel like when I was 20 I was already self sufficient and had no one making excuses for me.

My friends have always cheered me on and have told me many times that they are proud of me, but despite all of their positive remarks I feel no satisfaction from my family and I guess that’s where it hurts the most. No matter what I did to try to prove myself to be successful it just feels like nothing has worked. I also used to be called the “chubby &amp;amp; short” sister which took a big blow to my self image and self esteem. I ended up losing 36+ lbs towards the end of undergrad, but even now when I snack too much my mom calls me out, but when my sister snacks its okay because she’s a student? If my sister takes a nap at 8PM and I'm up facetiming friends I get yelled at to be quiet because she needs to ""wake up later to study"", whereas she can get up around midnight and be as loud as she wants, despite the fact that I have to get up at 5/6AM for work the next day. But it's because she's ""studying with friends"" whereas I was ""playing games"". 

I don’t understand their logic behind all of this and it makes me question all my accomplishments and my self importance. I don’t mean to boast about anything I've done but I just wrote it all out as a way to depict my current situation right now. I’ve done to try to PROVE myself to my family. I didn’t get the best grades in high school (whereas my sister was almost a straight A student), but I hauled ass in college/with my jobs and internships and I’m unable to feel proud of myself for any of my academic/professional accomplishments. I honestly don’t know why my parents constantly question my academic abilities, but it freaking sucks lol. I'm stressing myself out right now over what PhD program I get into because if it's not Cal or Stanford, I don't know if there's any other way I'd just get a ""good job"" or a ""you're smart"". The other day I asked my mom why they listen to my sister more than me and she said ""No one trusts alcoholics."" - which I DON'T understand because I probably only drink once or twice a week if I go out.

Don’t get me wrong, I love my family and I know that they still love me a lot, but I feel like Asian families just have this mentality that “brand names” mean more/are very protective of self images/very conservative when it comes to self image. I think I just need to accept this and learn how to ignore it. I just don’t know how because I feel like I just will never seem successful to them because of how I am and what my interests are. I've also been questioning myself as an older sibling lately and if I'm really that bad of a sibling because I can't meet all of my sister's demands. She keeps mentioning to me what other older sisters do and how they're more selfless and giving than I am and that she's jealous of those relationships because I'm not enough. Apparently I'm stupid because I don't check things twice. She asked me to borrow a black dress from my closet and if I could deliver it up to Berekley for her banquet since a friend and I were driving up to Berkeley for the weekend. I was in a rush since I was already late for dinner with my friends up there - and since she didn't specify which black dress, I grabbed one out of my closet and started driving. While driving she kept texting me asking me to send photos of the dress, which I had to eventually pull over - in the rain - and snap photos for her. To which I got a response ""why can't you do anything right, this is the wrong dress, i don't want it anymore it's ugly"", then she called me useless and said I should've taken pictures of ALL my black dresses for her before I left the house/I'm bad at fulfilling promises and am useless. I talked to my mom about this and even my mom agreed that I should have been more ""responsible"". Hearing all this just makes me constantly question. ***What am I doing wrong? Am I that intellectually behind??? Do I lack common sense?*** I've also explained to her how these arguments trigger my anxiety and how much my pulse skyrockets when she talks to me like this - I've been having issues with my pulse since second year of college and every time my anxiety is triggered through OUR problems, my pulse shoots up above 135...which I don't think is healthy at all. But she keeps telling me that I'm pulling a pity card because ""i dont know what to say"".

I tried to communicate to her that I'm tired and this has been detrimental to my mental health but she proceeds to telling me that I'm pulling a pity card and I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm so tired of being seen as not enough by my whole family. I know they love me, and my parents tend to speak before thinking (where I also picked up this habit lol), they don't always mean everything they say and I was told by my cousin to take it with a grain of salt. I just don't know how to block it out anymore especially after my sister added onto it. I just feel like I have to live as another care provider for her, but my mom said it was my duty since I was born first. My sister also constantly compares our undergrad institutions. If she talks to me about something, she'll be like ""well I went to Berkeley, it's more difficult here, your school was easy"" and it just sucks because my parents ALWAYS agree. 

TL;DR Questioning my accomplishments and self worth because my younger sister goes to  Berkeley so my parents cater to her needs and demand that I do the same/support her financially. They also claim that she's academically more inclined than I am and I'm just jealous because my undergrad/grad institutions = not the #1 public school in the US?????

The Situation is complicated for me and I don't know what to do. I feel trapped and stagnant. Any and all advice is welcome.",the_olive_boy,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/g07f8n/im_20_in_college_and_dont_like_where_im_going_i/,"I'm just looking for any form of advice right now. With the events of COVID, I've been forced to move off-campus from my uni and back home with my parents until June, when my lease for an apartment starts. I've been forced to spend a lot of time alone and now that there's silence in my rural environment I can no longer drown out the static in my head. I'm having to come to terms with a lot of personal issues and I'm really just shutting down mentally and physically. I really hope I don't sound like a whiny entitled child in the next few paragraphs. I realize I am extremely fortunate to be going to college at all and to not worry about most living expenses. 

The biggest of my issues is that I do not like what I am majoring in. Building Science with a concentration in Sustainable Building Systems. I've changed majors/concentrations a bunch, Environmental Science, Computer Science, Building Science with Architecture Conc., Building Science with Construction Management conc., Commercial Photography, and now back to Building Science with a concentration in Sustainable Building Systems. I kind of floated around these majors and managed to use them for electives wherever I transferred into. I'm on track to graduate within my four-year plan but really hate what I'm doing. I register for classes tomorrow and am dreading the schedule I have. 

I really wanted to be a Commercial Photography major but my parents wanted nothing to do with it.   
They're fronting the bill for my tuition so they threatened to drop all financial support if I didn't change back to Building Science. Additionally, my dad has cancer and does not know that I know. My mom told me about it after he yelled at me for ten minutes straight about how stupid I was for changing majors. She said the cancer wasn't spreading and is very small but still put a lot of stress on him and he just wants me to graduate with a ""practical"" degree so I can feasibly support myself if his health disappears.  Not wanting to come out of college $10K + in debt and feeling guilty about being selfish with my collegiate career I switched back to my old major. But I did it under the condition that I would change concentrations because I know that I will never be a good manager for a construction site. I am very introverted. I tried to breath new enthusiasm into my major and fell so flat. The class requirements are damn near the same and I think I can do even less with a Sustainable Building Systems concentration, so I might just switch concentrations again back to management. I felt so free and capable in the photo department that coming back to Building Science destroyed me. 

Additionally, I have to have an internship to graduate with this major. I have interned in construction for five years and documented two years of it, but the department will not accept this because I did not follow their strict guidelines surrounding internships or pay for the accompanying portfolio class. I have not been able to secure one for this summer because until December I was still a photo major and didn't have an internship requirement. I applied to a lot of places after I changed back to Building Science. I didn't get anywhere because companies already had interns or are now looking to maintain their full-time and part-time people over interns because of the pandemic. The Building Science Department wants signed contracts with employers by the fifteenth and at this point that just ain't happening. The department has teased doing an online alternative for intern requirements but as of now has not made that an option and with registration being tomorrow I think I'm SOL. Fortunately, I can take my internship in the Spring semester and still graduate on time but my parents are still pushing me to find an internship in the town my lease is in for a summer job and nobody is taking interns. I'm just going to have to do something that doesn't pay $16+ hour and my parents can't stand the thought of that. I've had this argument with my mom for three years. I would be working at an internship that paid super well but hated the work environment and the work itself. My mom always told me to get over it, that other people have it so much worse, that she used to have to work three jobs. I know and understand those claims, but shouldn't I be able to find some happiness in the jobs I work? I was commuting an hour in the morning and sometimes two hours in the afternoon because of traffic. Literally 3 hours of my day was spent driving. Then 9 hours at the job (8 working, 1-hour lunch). And I had to get up an hour before I left my house so I could get ready. Thirteen hours of my day were dedicated to that internship and I was only getting paid for eight. I worked in a cubicle on a computer with minimal human interactions and had no windows to the outside world. Of course, I was miserable, but whenever I said it sucked, my parents just got mad at me. Told me it was such a fantastic opportunity. 

On top of all that I've had to transition to online courses alongside the rest of the nation and some of my teachers are being so frustrating to deal with. One of my professors has literally changed due dates and assignment requirements EVERY class period since we left campus. (3 meetings a week times 5 weeks = 15 times), another one was very hostile to begin with and now that we're distance learning he is unresponsive to any questions I have and then is super critical of my sub-par work when he will not help me, and another keeps incrementally increasing the workload I have for his class. I already disliked the contents of these courses but was trudging along alright with the mindset of ""If I'm moving I'm okay. Just go with it."" Now I just want to stop. I can't focus on assignments or lectures and I keep losing track of what is due when because my teachers' lack of consistency is destroying my understanding of what's happening. The days all blur together.

There's a lot more going on in terms of my mental health and familial relationships and I really should talk to a counselor but until I move out for good/off my parents' insurance I won't be able to see one.

I know I'm moving but my mind feels stagnant. I don't feel like I'm productive. I don't like where I'm going. I don't know how to help myself. I feel like my parents financially coerce me into making major life decisions and it makes me feel trapped. I keep falling into dopamine binges of scrolling through Instagram/Twitter/YouTube because they're the only things that feel good anymore. Any advice at all would be nice. I feel so burnt out in all aspects of life and I'm going numb."

g08jf2,0,2020-04-12,Currently a rising 2nd year undergrad. Need help for my current undergrad plan!,L0rdTachanka,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/g08jf2/currently_a_rising_2nd_year_undergrad_need_help/,"I am a rising second year currently studying at University of Virginia, majoring in BS computer science and maybe double majoring with Econ (because humanities electives perfectly). I am 100% certain that I will go into Grad School (Master) for CS right after and I am aiming for the top grad schools so plz take this into account.

Right now I am having a huge difficulty deciding between graduating early in 3 years or doing 4 years. If I graduate with 4 years on average I only need to take 11.5 credits per semester which I can get good grades with easily, but the issue with that is 1. I don't think doing 11 is allowed since the minimum is 12 and I don't think we can graduate a semester early 2. I feel like I am wasting my time doing so little amount of credits  in 4 years where I can do it in 3 years. And I think a lot of recognition/honors require a minimum of 15 credits/semester

And here is my 3 year graduation plan: Take 15 credits for 3 semesters and do 18 credit for one semester, or I do a 3 credit class sometime in Summer/winter and do 15\*4 semester credits. Right now it seems like 3 year graduation is the better one right? Since I pay less tuition, get a head start on everything.

But the thing is my current GPA (around 3.55) is not a very optimal one for grad school, it is around the average for engineering at UVA . I am worried that if I graduate early in 3 years, my GPA would not be so great and also that since I only get 2 more years I won't get much time to do research or internships. And I believe grad school cares a lot about GPA, GRE test and undergrad research. So I feel like if I do 4\*15 credits/3\*15+18, it would result in my GPA in not a very competitive position and also give me less time to do enough research to be competitive for grad school.

**Quick Note for GPA: I can't find a place for average GPA for different grad school programs. I just can't find them. I have no clue what is considered a competitive GPA for the program. I only know the cut offs... And I also don't know how much GPA matters, it seems unfair to me to compare GPA directly since if I am from a undergrad program with more rigors academics then my GPA is bound to lower...So if my assumptions are wrong, sorry but feel free to correct me!**

**This is really a hard choice, and I have been thinking abound this all day. Can someone give me some inputs! THANK YOU SO MUCH!**"

This is mainly because I like web dev and mobile dev, but also because I see internships for FAMAG (Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google because Netflix doesn’t hire interns and doesn’t really hire many people in the U.K.) asking for Java, C++, or Python. 

I was thinking, if I also add Go, would that help me with Google internships because it shows I’m willing to integrate entirely into Google so much so I’ll be using Go and Kotlin, same with C# for Microsoft and Swift for Apple? And then I use these in interviews (if I get them I go to a top 30 uni so not as good as Cambridge or Manchester), would that show that I’m passionate about these companies?

Please help vote (read description),JenJen71902,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g09ao5/usc_v_northwestern_please_help_vote_read/,"Deciding between USC and Northwestern after narrowing it down! **Please** vote/comment! 🥰 
Edit: **This is the CLOSEST race ever. My stress went uppity**

**Facts about me/interests:**

* Chinese-American female who values a good Asian-American community
* Studying Communications at USC (#1 ranked for communications) or Journalism at NU (#1 for journalism) with interests in the media/entertainment industry, acting/performing arts, business, and computer science
* I'm a YouTuber w/ a descent following, so I'd love opportunities to find an agent/network
* Seeks a good social life w/ access to city and likes parties
* Needs a whole bunch of internship opportunities/good job placement w/o a huge student to faculty ratio
* I absolutely do not want a college with a HUGE competitive environment/stress culture. I can handle a healthy amount.
* Both schools are easy to double major in and explore diff interests, so I'm not really basing a decision on that

**USC pros:**

* Highly regarded for communications (#1)/journalism, cinematic arts, business, and acting schools, and connections to entertainment industry. Has been an ultimate dream reach for a while and would hurt to give up
* For YouTube, acting, and Asian connections, I'd pretty much be set. It's LA here, with emphasis on arts and interdisciplinary
* Weather is amazing and USC is known for a great social scene/school spririt/non competitiveness (Got that #1 Student Life) Could possibly be happier here. 
* Trojan family is a GREAT network and has an an awesome alumni network
* Has a really unique research program, and unique clubs like a social media creator club
* Easier to get internships on the West Coast to some top companies, and has companies like Wong Fu, Jubilee, and other orgs

**USC Cons:**

* Would cost $49K, which is 6k more than NU and I wouldn't be able to appeal until AFTER the deadline date (didn't get that merit scholarship, rip). Is USC worth 6k more?
* Doesn't have as much prestige or as high of a ranking as Northwestern. For context, USC is #22
* USC communications would have a lot more students than NU's journalism, so it'd be harder to form those good connections + lil more competitive
* Might not have as many connections to NYC or the East Coast
* USC's journalism would force me to specialize in a certain field, which may be a good thing, but also not
* May have fake/pretentious spoiled rich kids? but not too important

**Northwestern Pros**:

* Medill Journalism School. Regarded as the best J school in the country and produces a lot of top grads and job connections and internship opps and I love it as well.
* Medill would allow me to study abroad more frequently and in more diverse locations than USC
* Northwestern is Top 10 according to US News! probably means better academics, smaller classes, better rep for employers + my parents prefer NU
* Quarter System would allow me to explore a lot more classes
* \#1 for performing arts and Chicago may have the entertainment scene as well to enjoy
* Big sports life and a social scene is present, but not as party dominated
* Close to Chicago! One of my favorite cities ever
* Would cost $43k, which is 6k less than USC

**Northwestern Cons:**

* Weather. It would be so COLD for freaking half the year, whereas USC always has that nice weather year-round
* Apparently some people have dropped out of J school because the introductory courses were boring and tedious
* I wouldn't be able to double major in Journalism and theatre, whereas USC would let me do so. Plus, NU doesn't have a business school but does bonus have a certificate!
* Would be more stressful and more competitive 
* Not right in Chicago. I like how USC is right in the heart of LA, and even though Chicago is close, it isn't as accessible. Chicago also doesnt have the media/acting scene USC does

I am graduating this fall but I am really worrying about failing one of my CS courses at this point. I have accepted my offer for a top grad school, but if I fail this class, I am risking of not graduating and lose my spot in grad school. This is a very bad semester for me (worried about family, lost internship, sickness), and apparently the professor isn’t going to take Covid19 situation into account."

I'm going into my freshman year this fall at NYU Stern and I am interested in pursuing a career in finance, more specifically investment banking and possibly private equity as well. I was wondering if anyone can help me with these questions:

1. What concentrations should I take at Stern? I was thinking either a finance + data science, or a finance + statistics with a minor in comp sci
2. How can I prepare myself for first year? What can I do right now to hopefully land an internship after freshman year, and what can I do next year to make myself an ideal candidate?
3. Is NYU Stern really a target school on Wall Street? How much would it help me to go to this school?

Thanks everyone! Hope you guys stay safe!"

so one day i get a call to install a new computer that just arrived at one of the departments, just plugging it in, nothing out of the ordinary.

i get there and the head of the department points me to the computer in its box, the user and the desk it should go in. i say no problem, it'll just be a minute. he walks to his office and comes back becaus he forgot to tell me to put the new monitor in his office and give his old one to the user.  sure, i say. no problem.

i go about what actually is my business: setting up the pc. cable here, extension there, old monitor here, new monitor there, same old same old.  

the boss man is just chatting away with the user, neither of them really acknowledging my existence any further, which is fine with me.

as soon as i come out of his office with the old monitor the boss man rushes over, worried look on his face. ""did you save the icons on my old monitor to the new one? i need those for work.""

cue me frozen for a second as i try to simulate explaining to him that there's no reason to do that and no, i'm not being lazy, that's just not how computers work and... yep, no scenario in which i win. best case scenario i'm going to lose half an hour of my life trying to explain computer basics to an old guy who is probably months away from retiring and doesn't really give a freak. nope, not gonna happen.

instead i just say ""yep, it's the first thing i did. don't worry, all your icons are gonna be exactly how you left them""

i finish up, leave and everyone's happy. the user has a computer finally, she's asked for it ages ago and really needs it for her work. the boss has a brand new monitor that's exactly the same size, brand, color, etc as the old one, and all the others in the building, but is somehow so much better. and i have a funny story to tell my friends.

it doesn't end there. if you think i'll get screwed for misinforming the guy, you would be absolutely wrong.

as soon as i get back to the IT corner (some 10 minute walk i swear, the building was huge) my boss comes to shake my hand. ""great job, op, boss man called to compliment you, he said you were very efficient and proactive, i knew you would be a great addition to the team."" (happened relatively early in my internship) he turns to the other interns ""you all should be more like op, instead of lazying about on facebook."" 

boss man was so happy with me that everytime his department needed any support after that he would call and ask me by name, which my boss must have told him because he never asked me.

all in all, that one little white lie made me my boss's best employee for as long as i stayed there. he was very upset when i said i wouldn't be staying past the 6 months on my contract. (the maximum limit for an intership is two years in my country, and the norm where i worked was to renew the contract every six months)

learned a very important lesson that day"
g0bi5c,4,2020-04-13,About to have final interview for a great job. How do I let them know I can’t wait until October to start?,wilsoncommaadam,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g0bi5c/about_to_have_final_interview_for_a_great_job_how/,"Live in AR, job is in WI.

I graduate in May with a bs in Emergency Management. 

In theory, there’s no better time for a student with my major to find a job, but I’m not having a ton of luck. I have some other minors and skills that suit me well for more creative firms, but those are being hit particularly hard by this recession. I thought I had something lined up for after graduation, but discretionary hiring is frozen indefinitely. I understand, but it sucks.

However, I’ve been recruited by a BIG company for a project management position! It would be a great gig, and probably pay much better than most new grads could expect. 

The only downside is that the start date would be in October. If my internship hadn’t been cancelled this wouldn’t be an issue, but I’ve still gotta pay rent.

Is there any way I can “encourage” an earlier start date without writing myself off? This position would normally start out with three to four months of training. My best strategy would be to suggest that I’m available to start training as soon as needed, so that I can dive fully into the position in October. I’d even be down for a month or two gap in between, if necessary.

The interview is likely to be more in the casual side, but it IS the final interview before a decision is made.

Any advice?"

Obviously, the pandemic sent everything to total shit, but I was still struggling even before then to gain any experience of significance. I worked at a part time job, but just as a meat clerk (and still am elsewhere). The closest to experience I have is being an IT Technician for 6 months before getting laid off (not relevant to the pandemic). Got close several times with internships after an interview, but I never got anything. I spent 6 years in school with almost no extra-circulars to show. My capstone project was a literal shitty box. I already graduated with a BSME in December. I stupidly do not know how to do CAD. I did Autodesk Inventor in high school but never got around to anything solid like Creo or Solidworks when bouncing around from college to college. I have to get an internship or something because I have no skills to offer in a full-time job.

I guess the good things I have going for me is compliments on my programming experience, knowing Java and C++ beyond simply the basics. I'm working to pass the patent bar exam sometime this year, likely end of the summer. I also am planning on finally getting an CompTIA A+ certification by the beginning of May.

I have yet to completely update up my LinkedIn, but I'm a bit scared of doing so because I don't want my life to be so open on the Internet. I only have a professor to reach out to. I don't have anybody to network with. Furthermore, LinkedIn had done nothing for me when I had it set up earlier during junior year.

I want to do something with computers, like Automation Engineering, with patent law as my end goal.

I hate this job search so much because I'm applying to positions I'm completely under-qualified for since there's nothing better. I have nothing. I can't get my foot in the door. I know I'll be fine once I get it in there, but it feels people shut the door on me and won't answer the door when I knock. I'm 25. I'm way too old for internships on top of having my BSME already. I have nothing."

At the same time, Cali houses a lot more opportunities for all of the other things that I'm interested(Hollywood, Disney studios for animation, start-ups nearby). UCSD had a ton of research and internship opportunities as well. UW-Madison has a good computer science program(13th in the nation) and a good pre-med program but I won't get as many opportunities.

What are the pros/cons of being a math major?

I'm current a CC student setting up my application for transfer to my local state university. I'm choosing between Computer Science and Mathematics. The former because it's what I've always been interested in (and job prospects ofc) and the latter to gain a deeper/raw knowledge of the mathematics that I might be working with in the future as a computer scientist.

I want to work within the field of computer science and have been eyeing cybersecurity (reverse engineering, exploit dev). I'm not sure if I have the ability to go to graduate school (work ethic issues) but the path I've been eyeing is *heavily involved* in research so I might as well try. I don't intend to work as a web/app developer or data scientist. A friend told me math majors tend to do a bit better in academia/research settings (given that they have basic programming knowledge) because of their maturity with mathematics as opposed to CS undergrads. As I've been looking more into CS research (and especially RE research), there is a huge emphasis on mathematics and it got me pretty spooked as a lot of the maths are not covered in a CS undergrad curriculum. Even though I've thoroughly enjoyed my math courses at CC, I'm not too sure if that will transfer over to the rigor of a 4 year university. My ego might be inflated from the easier math classes i've taken at CC but it's something I'm currently interested in.

I'm considering if prioritizing mathematics would be more beneficial to me with the programming background I currently have. I have an alright resume built from HS till now that got me some webdev internships interviews this year, but it isn't what I want in the long run."

Sam was a creature of very few words. Fittingly, his job was one that had a rather severe lack of contact with other sentients: hyperway shipping. This was generally acceptable to Sam, as he was happiest with a cup of warm brey, a collection of the works of Meign, and the holochamber set to his favorite setting: a tent in a light drizzle.

 It was here that Sam was relaxing when he heard the warp drive shift. Sam frowned. There was no reason for there to be any change in the configurations during the entire haul, and it had never before, so Sam was obviously not the happiest holographic camper. He quickly closed the hologram, turning the soft forest into a white room again, and ran to the bridge. As he jumped into the worn chair, he noticed that the ship’s proximity warning light was flashing. How strange, Sam thought. Sam was very right to be confused, as those lights only warned of nearby structures when a pilot was guiding a ship for a landing, and nothing would ever be close enough for the sensors to be triggered whilst a ship was in hyperspace in deep space. At least, that’s what the ship’s manual had said when Sam was assigned to it. 

To be fair, the writers of the ship manual, titled “Freight Cruisers and You: The 112”, could not be blamed for not predicting what was about to happen to Sam. Hyperway shipping, being 90 years old, was still in its infancy, and the only recorded prediction of what Sam was about to go through was in a science fiction book published about 3 years ago. 

As Sam settled into his chair and surveyed an array of normal readouts, the second proximity light began flashing, then the third. Suddenly, all 6 warning sensors flashed, and Sam grew quite annoyed.

“What are you comp--HURRGGGG,” Sam felt the familiar kick of his gut shifting as he was pulled out of hyperspace, but this time it was a hundred times worse. Sam could feel the warp drive straining as the bubble of spacetime that the freighter was constrained in began to collapse. The last thing that Sam managed to think of as the spacetime that made up him was twisted and snapped was how ironic it was that the last thing he said wasn’t even really a word. People always told him he was a creature of very few words.

The Galactic Transit Authority, after noticing that half of an asteroid belt was missing, quickly cordoned off the accident site, blacklisting it on all navigational computers. This took them a shocking five weeks. Most license approvals averaged a year and a half on processing, so people were generally quite impressed with how seriously the GTA was taking this incident. Most political pundits believed that the sudden and catastrophic failure of a perfectly good warp drive on a tried and true shipping freighter was due to sabotage, and that there was something more valuable on board than some toaster ovens and a couple antique holodisks of The Battles of the Banfer. The more radical of the news outlets claimed that the speed of the response was because it was the precursor to another strongarm by the Queztalia, and as usual amassed their following of stay-at-home parents with too much time and not enough intelligence. Either way, the opinion of the masses was that there was a cover up. As a random Megiean off the street put it, “the damn government is hiding shit from us, as usual...I pay my taxes and I say I have a right to know of everything that happens in this godforsaken sector”

The truth was significantly less exciting. In reality, the GTA had no idea what was going on, and despite the initial rapid response, was too far up their ass in bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo to figure it out. After the initial investigation files were produced, they were passed around from paw to tentacle for about a month before finally ending up on Greetis the intern’s desk. Greetis, being the typical intern with a hodgepodge of having too much time on his hands and never being told anything productive to use it on, immediately devoted his full energy to the file. He hoped that if he could produce something worthwhile, someone would notice and he might be awarded with a paid internship the following cycle, or even a full time position.

After spending about another month of work time on the file (except for when he had to pick up the office’s brey order), Greetis finally had something to show for it. On a certain Sunday morning, Greetis slowly slithered into the mass fabricator room. After checking that no one was there (as interns were only technically authorized to do basic maintenance on the machine, Greetis inserted his holostick into the import port and quickly started the program. 17 hours later, it was done. A full scale recreation of the object that had managed to completely scramble the warp drive of Freighter 1999-203, Model 112. Greetis had passed out around hour 16, as most sentients found even staying up 10 hours difficult. He was found in the morning by a very irritated tech, who wrote him up, recording what Greetis had done in great detail in HR report #10002394.

Despite not seeming very fortuitous to Greetis, that HR report was possibly the best thing to happen to the newly recreated object. Much like anywhere else, incentives were not very prominent on the list of importance at the GTA, but discipline was. The report quickly shot up to the head of the Galactic Transit Authority, who demanded that the new object be studied to excruciating detail. When asked about what should be done to Greetis, the bureaucrat simply asked, “who?”

Intense study of the object revealed that it was actually a space probe. After decoding all the stored data and transmissions on the craft, it was determined that this probe, Voyager 1, originated from a yet undiscovered species called “humans”. The reason that Voyager 1 was so catastrophic to Freighter 1999-203 was because it happened to be transmitting exactly the right frequency and pattern to destabilize the freighter’s warp drive. The GTA took great pride in claiming that they had discovered a new sentient species, as it was incredibly rare that anyone would find a species before they achieved FTL travel, and this accomplishment was touted across the Confederation. Greetis received another stern talking to and was put on probation for unauthorized use of equipment. 

-----

Meanwhile, NASA had been quite confused for half a year or so on why they had suddenly stopped receiving transmissions from Voyager 1. It was immediately explained when a Confederation recon ship made contact with Earth by descending onto Las Vegas blasting “Hello, humans. We have found your probe. We hope you are having a good day.” as well as a collection of the whale sounds that was on the disk contained in Voyager 1. This would have already been quite a confusing moment for most of humanity, and the whale sounds only seemed to make it worse. This all coupled with the fact that the corvette appeared just under a hundred miles away from Area 51 meant that whatever was happening in Vegas was most definitely not going to stay in Vegas. 

After some explanations and the passing out of many translators, the situation became clear. The various governments of Earth decided to unite under a more cohesive United Nations (though they obviously couldn’t help but continue spying on each other), and the sharing of knowledge began in earnest. Thankfully, the United Nations was very efficient in adopting the new spacefaring technology to which they had been exposed, as all of the species in the Confederation found it quite difficult to even walk on Earth, what with its high gravity, crushing air pressure, and low oxygen levels. The few ambassadors that had originally landed in Las Vegas had also felt the heat to be quite disturbing, to say the least.

Xihide Yervak was one of those ambassadors. However, after just 10 weeks dealing with the humans, their unusual hell of a planet was the least of his concerns. He was more impressed with how readily they were adapting into their situation. Even for sentients that achieved FTL travel autonomously and found the Confederation first, it usually took months, years even, for them to truly begin to accept the sudden broadening of their horizons. Yet the United Nations, within the short span of a few months, was already taking initiative without much prompting. In fact, one of their recently designed “spaceships” was about to dock with the Confederation diplomatic vessel. Xihide absentmindedly rubbed one of his ears, mentally steeling himself for the negotiations that were about to proceed. Negotiations between sentients always took years, and sometimes creating a resolution was the life work of a politician. Nevertheless, Xihide knew that he would come on top. After all, the difference in knowledge and experience was simply unbeatable -- as species were generally cooperative with themselves, sapients always lacked the negotiating skills that were needed for interspecies/intergalactic bartering. The Queztalia ambassador was taken out by his stupor by the flare of rudimentary hyperion thrusters cresting the curve of the blue planet. The humans were here. 

As Xihide stood, watching the United Nations vessel draw closer, he began to feel uneasy. It’s rather large, isn’t it ? he thought to himself. And what are those on the top of it? The vessel grew closer and closer, revealing itself to be at least the size of a cruiser. Xihide’s anxiety grew further and further, culminating when he realized what the massive shapes on the top of the ship were. Guns. Specifically, they looked like mass drivers. Xihide ran to the bridge, frantically scrambling up the ornate steps of the diplomatic vessel.

“We’re under attack!!” he screamed as he burst onto the command deck. “Why are we not running?!”

“Nothing we can do. They would catch us immediately, and we obviously have no weapons ourselves--being a diplomatic vessel and all,” replied Captain Amarite. She was in the process of bucking on her ceremonial scimitar. Obviously, she had realized that they were about to be captured before Xihide did. “We saw the guns as soon as they crested the horizon. I had hoped that their size was a malfunction on the scanners, but as you can see, I was wrong. My apologies. We blocked communications as soon as we realized we were in combat, so they won’t be able to trace the location of the main fleet, but this ship...this ship is lost.”

Xihide was in shock.”There is no reason they would declare war now...Are they insane?” 

“It’s a new species, and one that formed on a Category 14 at that,” Captain Amarite stated matter-of-factly. “You can never predict what they might do. The Craitens thought that the Confederation was an asteroid the first time we met.” Suddenly, the ship shook.

“Looks like they’ve managed to board us. Mind if you come with me to deliver our surrender? You are the ambassador, after all. I’m sure they would want to talk to you.” Not waiting for a response, Captain Amarite strode off, and Xihide scrambled after her. The duo quickly made their way down to airlock 4, closely tailed by Amarite’s personal guard. The captain faced the airlock door with perfect military posture, and the ambassador attempted to do the same. 

Bang…Bang...pssshhhhhh

The airlock door slowly swung open, depressurizing. A team of humans wearing military gear strode in, looking ready to kill. Xihide gulped. Sapient on sapient violence rarely occured, as the thought of violence was generally enough to make a sapient puke, but for some reason he believed that these soldiers were capable of it. Then they started laughing; at least, that’s what his translator told him their breathless grunts were.

“You’re clear to enter now, sir,” one of them called into the airlock.

“Wonderful,” came the reply, accompanied by footsteps. “I suppose that our worst case scenario was just a precaution after all?”

A rather familiar human female strode into the atrium. She did not wear any military armor, nor was she taller than any of the human soldiers, but she radiated authority that Xihide had rarely seen before. Seeing Xihide, she smiled.

“Ah, Ambassador Yervak! It’s good to finally meet you face to face, not behind one of your holoscreens. I trust we’ll have much to discuss.” It finally clicked why she was familiar to Xihide. It was Samantha Crawford, the representative of the United Nations he had been working with through a low res holoscreen. 

“Am-” Xihide cleared his suddenly hoarse throat. “Ambassador Crawford?” 

“Don’t tell me you don’t recognize me, Ambassador Yervak! First we can’t establish communications with your ship, and now you’re looking at me as if you’ve seen death. If I didn’t know any better, I would think that you were trying to avoid me.” Samantha’s voice carried a hint of joviality that was not consistent with the fear that Xihide was feeling.

“We...You...Were you not seizing control of the ship?”

“The ship? You mean your ship? Of course not! Why would you think that? We arrived exactly when scheduled from the vector that we had planned and docked at the airlock we had agreed upon. Did we do anything improper? We did have trouble establishing communications so we couldn’t verify the docking, so the armed entry was just in case something had happened to you.”

Xihide felt his fear give way to anger. “YOU ARRIVED IN A WARSHIP! WITH GUNS LARGE ENOUGH TO DISINTEGRATE US!” Xihide attempted to calm himself. “Bringing weapons is enough to declare your intentions for most civilized sapient species. Perhaps you weren’t aware of this, but that cruiser is basically a declaration of war.”

“Ah. I apologize. Us humans are loath to go anywhere unfamiliar without protection,” stated Ambassador Crawford. “Why don’t we brush this aside as the cultural difference it is, and proceed with our discussion?”

Xihide felt his nerves settle. “That would be quite desirable. Let me show you to our conference area.” As the entourage walked back into the spaceship, Xihide was glad to categorize the recent event as a result of human stupidity. However, in his subconscious, he was still afraid. Afraid of how the humans had managed to create such a large warship in a few months, yes but more so afraid of what he had seen in the human soldiers. Their eyes were covered, but he could see it. The predatory glare. That bloodlust that they switched off when they realized there was nothing to kill. That spark of determination and intelligence in a perfect mix of lethality. Xihide reasoned it as a trick of the light, but deep down, he knew better. And if he didn’t, he was about to find out."

Now before I get to the specifics for me I will say that cost is not a factor as after aid both of them will cost the same. Ok so here we go 

College A

Pros: Beautiful campus, I like the students here better, higher ranked school overall, one of the best colleges for studying abroad (I would use this to study at DC for political science) better speech and debate club, varsity sports exist but it’s clear the schools and students value academic more, better students life, love the city it’s in, really good professors, better residence halls, I was able to visit it so it feels safer, love the vibe

Cons: academic calendar not my personal favorite, possibly a little too political, separate from the city so access to it is ok but not ideal doesn’t allow freshmen to bring cars freshmen year, requires freshmen to live on campus freshmen and sophomore year unless they live in the city (I don’t so I’ll have to live in campus for two years) 

College B 

Pros: still a pretty campus, higher ranked for my major, great internships abilities in the government, downtown, better track team, higher earning alumni, family live close, easy access to anything in the city


Cons: hate the city it’s in, coin operated laundry, don’t really like the students attending, almost everyone here goes for government meaning that although it’s small my major will be harder to get one on one time compared to the other school, but I’ve been given an opportunity to be in a special program within politics they only offer to few people but getting one on one time will still be harder even I I get special treatment."

Where should I apply?,rghost1234,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/g0diw6/where_should_my_safety_school_be_ranked_where/,"Hi everyone! I'm in the process of planning for grad school applications next year for computer science. I would really like to get a PhD in theoretical computer science. I graduate in December 2020 and will be applying for fall 2021 admission.

I don't know anything about all of this so I have been having a hard time figure out where to apply and what's reasonable for me. I'm also really nervous because increased applicants and decreased funding from covid.

My research advisor thinks I can get into a top program, but I feel like he might have a positivity bias because I'm his student, but I'm willing to trust him because I think it would be awesome to end up at MIT, CMU, or Stanford (which are my 'reach schools'  along with University of Illinois Urbana Champaign).

For reasonable schools, I was thinking of a lot of large midwest high ranked schools like UWMadison, Michigan, University of Minnesota.

For kinda safety schools, I considered Rutgers because I'd be very happy working at DIMACS.

I feel very presumptuous putting safety schools ranked in the high 30s, but I really don't think I'd want to end up at lower ranked program. Where should I be putting safety schools? Is there even such thing as a safety school in grad school admissions? Are there some lower ranked school that are great in theoretical CS that I might have a better chance at?

My application:
I'm a senior at a large public university, well known for engineering and ranked in the 60s for computer science. 
I have a 4.0 but looking at my transcript, I feel like I had low-ish credit loads... 12-16 credits but I've been working since sophomore year (20-35 hours a week).
I started as a genetics/computational biology student and fell in love with my first programming class, so I switched to CS.

I did a year in a genetics lab doing ""bioinformatics"" research building a pipeline for the lab, but I don't have much contact with the professor since it was freshman year.

I did a REU in bioinformatics after my freshman year.

I did a software engineering internship after softmore year at a great tech company without name recognition
I did a embedded ststems co-op at a large name aerospace company second half of junior year to junior summer.

When I came back senior year, I started research under a CS professor (still a bioinformatics topic but kinda algorithms research and now I am working on a SAT approach to our problem, so it's kinda become more theoretical). I will be working for him next semester too.

We just got a extended abstract published in conference proceedings and I am second author. I'll be presenting my research at 2 poster sessions at my university and my professor thinks I can get a application note published as a first author and we are trying to get a full journal article published (where I will probably be second author again).

This summer, I will be doing research at one of the #1 ranked CS schools in formal methods.

I have been a TA for three semester in upper level CS courses (algorithms and advanced programming) and plan to do one more semester (algorithms or the intro CS programming classes) 

The bad: I took the GRE and didn't do so hot. 164 quant (84th percent), 158 verbal and 4.5 writing. I plan to retake and hoping i can get quant up since i didnt study.

Also, I am a US Citizen and a female. 

So, where should I be looking? What's safe? What crazy? What's reasonable?"

I realise that I  don't mesh with the department of my school that well but they're the closest and most reputable college in my area because I didn't want to spend more money getting a dorm elsewhere. 

I medically withdrew for this semester.  

The online computer science program at Troy university  takes 36 hours of course hours,  plus I won't have to be as mentally screwed as I've been so far sense attending this university. 

However, I'll miss this university due to its connections through internships, everyone is familiar of the university and I feel like I'd regret not being able to physically talk to my professors or classmates. On the other hand, I've never had a close relationship with either groups of people. I've been  humiliated a lot in school, made fun of by TA's etc. 

So I really just want a peace of mind. 

Should I stay or go?"

Tl:dr in bottom

I recently got an internship doing front end web development at a start up, which is what I wanted to pursue as a career. I was at the company from mid January to mid March and felt like I was learning a lot and was glad to move onto a real project and not have to work on side projects, textbooks, documentation and tutorials all the time. However, due to the covid pandemic, the company said they are struggling with their funding and laid a bunch of people off, at least according to what they said. 

After months of studying and finally getting something to work with, it feels like i got swallowed and spat right back out again and I’m having a hard time keeping the learning process going as my motivation is dying down. 

Curious, how do you guys handle being laid off and getting back up? 


All responses are appreciated!

I graduated from a communications degree in 2018 with a major in media communications.

I then decided to travel for a couple of years and have now found myself two years out of my degree with no relevant work experience or accomplishments.

I already knew it was going to be an uphill battle starting a career with a stale degree, but with a lot of recent grads losing their jobs from the Coronavirus I expect it will be almost impossible to find something amongst the competition once it all picks back up.

I’m looking at returning to study to rejuvenate my qualifications and hopefully find an in through an internship, but I can’t decide where to begin.

I’ve had a look at various masters courses, graduate certificates and diplomas as well as media skills courses and I’m struggling to decide which avenue offers the most opportunity potential.

Are there specific areas of study which complement a communications degree? Which skills courses or certificates would be particularly worth looking into to help give me more of an edge (digital marketing/social media/video editing skills)? Is there anything else I could be doing to make myself more appealing to employers?

I’m hoping to avoid taking on the debt of a masters degree but at this point, given the amount of time that has passed, would it be worth looking into?

I would love some insight from someone on the inside or someone who followed a similar pathway! Cheers!"

To make it short, I am a college student (Human Resources) graduating this year, December 2020. I am currently working an internship (call it Job A) that is set to go until my graduation (December) with a possibility of full time employment after that. The problem is, I am absolutely HATING this job. The work isn’t the best and I overall just have a bad feeling being there, not sure if it’s the people or what but I just don’t feel like I can last a year being there without going insane. About a month ago, a friend referred me to her company and they have now offered me an internship opportunity (call it Job B) for the summer ONLY, but also with a possibility of full time employment after the summer or after graduation. Job B sounds a lot better on paper, they are a bigger company, and my friend can only say good things about them. Both internships are in HR by the way. 

Job A (current) - $17/hour
Job B (new) - $25/hr

Job A is in the manufacturing industry and Job B is in the financial services/banking industry if that makes a difference. My current internship does not seem to have plans of terminating the internship, and the new internship opportunity seems to still be excited to bring me in (talked to them about 2 days ago and everything is still good to go).

Am I being stupid for considering taking the new offer considering the times we are in? Thanks for any advice!"

g0lzz3,1,2020-04-13,Temporarily moving out,Not-getting-thebread,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g0lzz3/temporarily_moving_out/,"Sorry, this is long, summary at the bottom.
So I (21F) have been going out with my BF (22M) for two and a half years. I’m in my third year of college and only really come home for summer and Christmas holidays. I have pretty strict parents; they don’t approve of drinking, sex before marriage is frowned upon, shouldn’t still be up at 1am (even though I’m 21 and my mam was also still up) etc, etc, I could go on forever, and they’ve always been stricter with me than my two brothers because I’m a girl.

But since I’ve gone away to college I’ve experienced more freedom, my BF spends full weeks at my place that my parents don’t know about. This semester he’s been doing an internship in a different county when we had previously been going to college in the same city so it’s been harder to see him. Now I’m dreading the idea of going home for the summer because I’ve no idea how I’d get the time to see him. I work a summer job as a waitress every year in my home town that averages 50+ hours a week and, when the weather’s good, 60+ hours a week. I usually get 2 days off a week but they aren’t set and aren’t given together so it could be any two random days of the week, and never weekends. Every other summer I’ve only been allowed spend one of these days a week with my BF or once every 2 weeks. But with his internship he only gets Saturday and Sunday off. So my BF and I spoke about me moving to live with him for the summer until college starts back and I’d get a job somewhere in that town instead. 

Now my regular summer job pays incredibly well and I need it to support myself during the year for college (for food and some of the tuition, I’m still heavily reliant on my parents to pay for accommodation) but I hate the place and would give anything not to go back there, and I have been saving so I could afford to move out and pay rent for the summer without added financial strain next year.

The problem comes with my parents. I have no idea how to bring the topic up with them, or how to tell them this is my plan. They really like my BF but they still treat me like a teenager and I’m expected to act like one when I’m home, “do what I’m told, when I’m told”. I’ve always been the “problem child” in my family as my brothers are just obedient without question. And the thing is I won’t be able to afford my final year of college without my parents financial support next year and if they pay for my accommodation it’s still technically their house, their rules, and I just know they’re going to tell me if I want to move out for the summer I’ll have to make my own way next year. They’ll take this as me just using them and being disrespectful. They think I’m far too young to move in with a BF AND DO NOT TALK ABOUT SEX CAUSE THAT SHOULD JUST NOT HAPPEN!

For a bit of added context; my brother is 24 (25 this summer) and has been going out with his girlfriend for 5 years. When she stays at our house she sleeps in his room but he has to sleep on a blow up bed in the living room. This may explain how big a deal me moving in with my BF would be.


#Want to move in with BF for the summer but don’t know how to bring it up to parents without causing a huge argument and losing financial support for college."

At the interview, they told me I would be interviewing for the data science intern position. Having little to no knowledge about data science or statistics even, I somehow managed to get the offer (still blows my mind today). I'm so fortunate for this opportunity and grateful that I still have my internship after all that is going on in the world. 

After landing the position, I took a Udemy course and a couple LinkedIn courses about Data Science and I enrolled in a machine learning course at my university, which I am currently taking. I'm really enjoying the machine learning course and we've had a semester-long project to work on. I chose credit card fraud detector, which is a pretty simple and popular machine learning topic. I read a lot of [medium.com](https://medium.com) articles about machine learning and data science too which I have found very helpful.

I'm still really nervous for my internship as it's in a field where I have very minimal knowledge. I would  love to turn this into a full time opportunity at this company and do everything I can to gain a solid understanding of data science. Any advice on preparation for the internship and for during the internship itself to calm my nerves???"

I'm 26, currently living in Japan, in my second year of masters in Computer Graphics at a top Japanese university. I have about 3.5 years of overall experience (2.5 full-time backend/cloud architect, not related to graphics, 1 year of internships including 2 GSoC's and a AAA studio, both had graphics related work)   


I have a potential opportunity to pursue PhD in CS post 2021 at a Canadian university with graphics as the focus. With about a year left before I graduate, I have come to a sort of crossroads regarding what path I should take:

1. Stay in Japan, get an engineering job in NVIDIA or Google which should have graphics work available (e.g., Google is hiring for stadia devs, and NVIDIA mostly does graphics anyway).
2. Similar to above, but move to EU instead of Japan.
3. Move to Canada, do PhD for \~4 years, then find a job as a engineer/researcher at FAANG in NA/EU

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really feel like leaving Japan because I have a large social net of friends with whom I can enjoy my time here with, and my QoL standards have gone up since living here for 4 years... Canada sounds nice but I'm worried about the weather at Ontario (where I might go) - I heard the winters are crazy.

EU could be a nice fresh start for me. Some of my old friends and former colleagues are currently scattered across EU, including Germany, Netherlands and Switzerland. I would love to find a graphics dev job there somewhere.

If you were in my shoes, which path would you take?

Any input you guys provide would be really appreciated.

I am looking at the classes I can take and it looks like I am getting some IAH (uni mandate) and then I can either take  Thermodynamics ,  Deformable solids, or dynamics (have to apply for an override for this one). Obviously any of these classes will be online since they are gonna be in the summer so I am trying to decide which one will be the easiest to bear as a summer online class. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for the overall input"

I can’t entirely blame online school - my focus has been only getting worse for the past year and a half.",cv521607,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/g0pz7c/when_high_functioning_becomes_notso_high/,"Transitioning to online school has been the absolute worst. I can barely focus in in-person classes, much less. My anxiety is through the absolute roof, procrastination at its worst, and I lost that impulse/last minute adrenaline that most of us need to get our work done. But I can’t entirely blame online - my focus for the past year and a half has been absolute tragic, and it’s getting only getting worse. 

In high school, like many of you, I got away with studying night before for major tests and doing things last minute in order to get good grades. I graduated in the top 1% of my class. When I got to college, I quickly realized I couldn’t do that anymore especially at a difficult school. Unfortunately, because of my general unawareness of mental health issues and unsupportiveness of my family (only within the past two years have they been supportive), it’s been a really rough few years. 

I never understood why is it that I can focus so well on the things I enjoy/well good at and frankly can’t focus to save my life on the things I couldn’t stand/found them to be meaningless. In classes, I would make A’s in very difficult but interesting courses and barely pass in the easiest of courses. Because of that my gpa is a dismal 2.6. I have always excelled at work and extracurriculars. I have had five internships, and while I did well in all of them, I definitely struggled with the mundane tasks, barely woke up on time to make myself food and get ready to arrive to work without rushing, and getting distracted easily if there was no pressure/accountability. Reflecting, I shouldn’t have interned as much and used the time to seek help with school, but my insecurity and not being honest with the fact I needed help got in the way. I frankly denied that I had focus and anxiety issues. Well, here we are.

I have been formally diagnosed with GAD and seasonal depression (take 50 mg Pristiq for them). 

I also have endometriosis, which has caused all sorts of issues. While I never been formally diagnosed with ADHD bc of how expensive the testing is, I currently take Strattera 80 mg for it. ADHD runs in my family. Just was prescribed 10 mg of adderall, which I pray helps. I finally got accommodations at the end of my sophomore year for school work, but since I never got formally diagnosed with ADHD because of how expensive the testing is, I only get accommodations for the anxiety. 

I have dreams of going to law school,and I’m just so afraid that I am not going to have what it’s take to do it. How can I do grad school when I can barely pass what I’m doing now? Law school is a lot of reading, and I can barely get through my current cases for my classes now, and to add insult to the injury, my GPA is dismal. I’ve taken the LSATs and studying for them was frankly one of the most difficult things, and I know I can do so much better if I could just fucking learn to study the way that is best for me. I keep comparing myself to all my neurotypical friends and peers, and I constantly feel like a failure. I know it’s not healthy, but I have been a high achiever, and I can’t help but feel like I always fall short. 

I have always been considered “the smart one” in my family, but I just feel so trapped and unable to do even the smallest things like focus through a movie I’m actually interested in. When I’m stressed, I tend to hyper focus on one of my imperfections - like in this case, my skin is breaking out and I’ll spend HOURS on the skincare Reddit. What I should be doing is my school work. My professors are luckily so understanding and kind this semester, but I can’t bring myself to start with my assignments. I have no one to blame but myself. I’ve tried all sorts of things, like moving around different study areas, but it’s not working. I can’t build a routine to save my life. 

I would love any advice/support. It’s been rough, and a pandemic doesn’t help. If you read this whole thing, god bless you."

I got into Columbia SEAS and Georgia Tech for Computer Science. I was really happy at first, but I have no clue which one I should choose between the two. I want to start my own business, so research isn't as important to me as internship and business growth opportunities. I also got waitlisted at the four schools in the title, and I have no clue if I would choose Columbia over any of them (if I got off the waitlist).

I know that the CS ranking for GTech, Carnegie, and Caltech is higher, but I don't know how much of a difference there is between the programs.

Another aspect to consider is how easy it'll be to get into good grad schools from said school. 

Any opinions, recommendations? I just want to see if different perspectives could help me out with making the best decision.

I'm currently a Computer Science &amp; Engineering major in university (they've combined Computer Science and Computer Engineering into one major essentially), and I am slated to graduate in December 2020. I've completed internships/co-ops in general IT/Help Desk and with Infrastructure Stability/Server Management, and I have an upcoming internship in Software Development this summer.

I don't necessarily know what I want to do with my degree anymore. As I've gotten farther along my degree track and now with being so close to graduation, I don't really know if software development is what I want to do anymore after graduation. I do realize I am saying this only based off the programming classes I've had during university, but I just don't find as much enjoyment in it as I once did. I will be able to for sure know after this summer's internship since software development is what I'll be primarily doing from May to August.

I wanted to write to this subreddit to see if there are others out there that ended up with a Computer Science and/or Computer Engineering degree that is in a career that doesn't necessarily involve software development/engineering with it. I really am just wanting to see what other options I could look into that are interesting/fun with this degree.

I'm trying to do a basic reconciliation between two bank reports. I'd like to match the individual transactions between the reports. Issue is the transaction value isn't unique enough.  I was originally using xlookup for the transaction amount until I realized I wasn't catching duplicate values. I could have a 45$ transaction for example multiple times within a month. One report may have 3 transactions for 45$ while the other report may have 2. They'll still find a match because like I said the value isn't unique. Is there a way where I can include the date as an additional comparison? Using 2 columns to create a single value essentially. I'm probably not utilizing Xlookup to its fullest so advice would be great.

Here's what i'm kinda looking for. Only the 1/23/2020 transaction should match because the values AND the date are the same.

I am getting ready to graduate from my college this May with a BA in marketing and a minor in web design. I'll go ahead and break down my college experience into bullet points to sum everything up as best as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

* First in family to ever make it this far in college, little to no guidance on absolutely anything. Average grades and GPA. Was unable to snag any sort of Summer internships, only one interview offer, nervousness probably killed my chance. Worked at my college's IT department over the Summer and throughout a few semesters.
* Took marketing partially because it seemed versatile and also seemed somewhat interesting. I was surprisingly good at consumer behavior, so I was hoping to get a more behind-the-scenes marketing job like market research analysis or even graphic design.
* Intense fear of judgment due to childhood bullying and trauma, huge reason why I am terrified of anything ranging from intimacy to performing to public speaking.
* Currently medicated which helps a little, but does not dig into the root of the problem. Counseling was not that helpful. CBT told me to basically ""fake it till' I make it"" but I still manage to become paralyzed and even black out whenever asked a question I have no answer to in a serious setting.
* I personally feel like I've botched almost every class presentation I ever had to do. I rush like crazy and run out of breath and sound like I'm rabid when I speak. Practice never seemed to help, and doing more presentations throughout my years didn't get any easier.
* I have absolutely no clue how I've made I this far. 
* Finally worked up courage to go to annual campus career fair and networking events only for COVID-19 to suddenly and instantly kill the possibility.
* Friends of mine in the accounting major are able to find interviews amid the crisis, but marketing offerings are seemingly dwindling in my small city (or I am simply not qualified for the few that are available).

So given everything, I feel incredibly lost on what my next steps should be. I obviously would like to find a job, but the idea of being employed before I even graduate seems unrealistic given I couldn't find internship experience. On top of that, interviews to me are equivalent to root canals and my anxiety does everything to convince me to not send out applications. On top of THAT, I'm pretty concerned about COVID-19 and am bewildered how my friends were able to get interviews during such a wild crisis.

I've accepted that a clear cut solution to my problem is probably nonexistent, but has anyone by chance been in similar shoes, if so, what did you do/say to yourself to finally nip this problem in the bud?"
g0rwl8,1,2020-04-13,Student Inquiry,FadedRift,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/g0rwl8/student_inquiry/,"This semester I am completing my BSc in CS at a state university and will be starting my MSc in bioinformatics this fall at the same institution (I am aware that this is considered an aceademic phopa, hopefully it doesnt negatively effect me too much). I have had software engineering experience through internships, but have not had any research experience. I became very interested in bioinformatics about 8 months ago, and decided that it is something I want to pursue, as a biology lover. I am planning on trying to find some way to help/volunteer with computational biology research at my university this fall, to scope out research. My goal in my head is to try finding an analyst position post MSc and maybe after a few years working to enter a PHD program if I so desire. Does this seem like a plausible plan? 

The strong emphasis on research in this field makes me pretty anxious, due to my lack of exposure to it. Any tips for what kind of settings are good for starting to explore research? Assisting a professor? Volunteering in a lab? Focusing on a thesis?

Also any general advice on things I can do to help ""catch up"" on making myself more hireable would be much appreciated. I feel like I joined the party late and am hitting myself for not exploring these questions earlier."

We buy the hardware and software our customers use and have that all documented in our system. This doesn't always apply though when we get a new customer and their current hardware was bought by themselves or their previous tech-supporters.

This is one of those cases. Less than a year had passed since we had gotten this new customer. The company consists of about 20 women and I think 1 man (intern). They are a bunch of nice women and since then they and I get along well, sometimes too well, as they love to drop certain innuendos from time to time. 

To give you one example: They had an Outlook-issue while being in their conference room and put me on speakers during  the call. After fixing that small issue within a few minutes, their head of HR says

&gt; ""Thanks /u/chilled_it . You just satisfied 4 women within 3 minutes.""

 I didn't know what to say, but felt like I had to say something so it wouldn't be so awkward and went like 

&gt;""Thanks, I always love to hear that."" 

and to this day I still don't know why the heck I said that.

Anyhow....so their boss calls me that morning and reports that the webcam on her laptop isn't working anymore. She just used it during a conference-call but since then it doesn't work anymore. I sign in with our remote-software and get to work.

Open the camera-app: Just a picture of crossed-out camera. Hm...weird, haven't seen that one before.  
Open hardware and devices: Camera is listed. Go back to previous drivers. Still no good. Update drivers. Still no good. Delete drivers and let Windows install them again. Still no good. How about a reboot? Still no good.  


I ask her to turn the laptop upside-down and give me the serial-number of the device. I do some research on the www and download the drivers. Repeated the previous steps, but this time with the drivers I downloaded. Nothing...Here I started to get a little frustrated. I check the camera-settings, download an automatic driver-update software of the manufacturer and update everything. Still no luck.  


I couldn't figure it out. The laptop recognizes the webcam, the correct drivers are installed, the camera-settings are correct allowing the apps to use it. If it was broken, the laptop wouldn't recognize it and if the camera was covered by a sticker or so, then I wouldn't see that weird icon but a black screen instead.  


So shamefully I gave up and told her to bring it to the store that they bought the device from and have them check it out. The store lent her a device to use during the time it would need to repair it. Since I had questions about that device she was given, I called that store on her behalf and spoke to one of their technicians. Skipping the pleasantries and such:

&gt;Me: So I was wondering whether I should wipe the HDD before returning it or whether that is part of your procedures when you get a device back?!  
&gt;  
&gt;Tech: Don't worry about that. The laptop is fixed already. Did you see that device in person?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: No...why?  
&gt;  
&gt;Tech: That's what I thought. I had run all the troubleshooting-steps that you probably have done too and it wouldn't work. We were actually about to ship it to the manufacturers when a colleague of mine found something on the laptop. There is something like a button/controller in the frame above the webcam. It was on red. Once we pushed it a bit, it changed to green and the camera started working again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: \*facedesk\*

After some laughs and some random chit-chatting we hung up and I informed our customer. She could somewhat laugh about it, although she just wasted about 200€ for the time/work of the technicians involved.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.:  
I had never seen a laptop with such a system for the camera. And I have seen/worked on a ton of laptops. It didn't occur to me to look for pictures of the device on the www to maybe find a clue, and none of my google-results came with such a hint, although I found plenty of other topics with the same problem. I might have felt more inclined to check out the device online, if the brand of the device was unknown or I wasn't too familiar with. But this one was of the same brand as our company uses and that I would recommend to anyone. But I guess I had never seen that model of that brand before.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Webcam didn't work because of a physical button/controller-function was on 'off'"

So I’m 22F and ever since I was a kid, I’d rather have boy friends because I can’t tolerate much drama and being friends with boys is just easier. But I was in an all-girls school -idk what they’re called exactly- until I went to university(18F). Before that, in high school, I had some boy friends but they weren’t that close. First semester of university I met with a penpal(18M) I had, and I liked him a lot -as a friend tho- and we hung out a few times but then he told me he liked a girl and when I asked him who it was, he said it was me and I got furious and we didn’t talk much after that. I got close with another boy (18M) in my university who was gay -I was very glad about that- and he kinda turned into my best friend and we had lots of fun, we would go out a lot and go on trips and everything, we had a lot in common. But he hadn’t come out to everybody so many people probably thought we were in a relationship. Meanwhile I (20F) got close with another boy in our class (23M) who was older than the rest of us and I always thought of him as sb mature, I liked talking to him and we had fun. He was so knowledgeable you’d never be bored with him. Anyway we were friends and I got him a birthday present, and we would go out with other friends, once even with my best friend. But then, once I was really stressed about sth and he suggested that we go out for lunch or sth so that I’d feel better and I said why not. It was mid-lunch that sth he said made me realize that I was on a date and I was shocked because well I didn’t think if him that way, but when I told my girl friends, they already kinda guessed he liked me. I didn’t know how to react to that and I simply didn’t. That summer we didn’t talk much and kinda grew apart, and he didn’t get me anything for my birthday or even congratulate me, I got mad at him and then he went on a long internship where he skipped almost a whole year of university. Then he immigrated to Scotland and I never saw him again. I was pretty upset. A year passed and I got in a huge fight with my best friend -the gay one- and no matter how much I tried to fix it, it went downhill and got to a point where we didn’t talk anymore. But I missed him terribly. So a mutual friend of us (22M) came to me and talked to me and tried to make me understand his side of the story and comfort me. During these talks, we got close and he turned into one of my best friends. I also made things ok with my other best friend, eventually. 
ok I’ve already talked too much and no one will probably read this. The thing is, I’m used to having boy friends and honestly, I’ve always had a close boy friend. But this one, has a girlfriend and she has problems with how close we are. Can somebody tell me what are the exact red lines of girl-boy friendships are and what to do and not to do in these friendships? ‘Cause I don’t think we’re doing anything wrong and I know he doesn’t like me in any other way than a friend, in fact he often tells me that I’m like a little brother to him. And I definitely don’t like him as anything except a really good friend. I don’t wanna lose this one too, but I don’t know maybe I’m messing up in some way. Sometimes he gets in fights with his girlfriend that he won’t tell me about (he never tells me about his relationship stuff because he thinks it should just be between the two people involved and he’s right) but I sometimes worry if they fight about me and if his girlfriend can’t understand and accept our friendship. 
You see I’m also kinda paranoid about my two former best friends who said that they liked me and that lead to our friendship being ruined; So I’m constantly worrying if any of my boy friends like me. This one less so, because I know just how in love he is with her, and wouldn’t ever look at anybody else. But still, I’m paranoid and her girlfriend makes me even more so.
So please, help me? Give me some tips about girl-boy friendship and what lines there are that I shouldn’t cross and so on? I’d really appreciate it ‘cause as you can see I’m so naive it even bothers myself and don’t know what to do."

g0ua3p,1,2020-04-13,A lost CS student,peacaPeas,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g0ua3p/a_lost_cs_student/,"Hi everyone,

I’m finishing up my sophomore year as a community college student and looking to transfer to a 4 year university to finish my degree in CS. To say the least, I really don’t know what I’m going to do for the summer and fall yet, and it’s almost summer. My original and ideal goal was to get a CS internship this summer and transfer to Michigan State in the fall, but as of right now, neither of those things are happening. At this point, I really wouldn’t mind taking a break from my degree to do a gap-year working in the CS industry in the fall instead of MSU, and I’m also still (hopefully) looking for an internship (paid or unpaid) this summer so that I can get valuable irl (or maybe remote because of corona) working experience in the industry. At any rate, I’m slightly worried because I haven’t gotten an internship yet**, and by now, most companies are pretty much done hiring (+the semester is over in a few short weeks). I say slightly, because my backup plan is to work at McDonald’s or something similar, but my Dad insists I should get a CS internship instead. Thoughts on routes I could take based on your own personal experiences and my current situation?

**My only experience with computer science in general was a year long Java class in high school, and a semester long C++ class at my community college. So I’m not really surprised I haven’t gotten any internships with my lack of background.

P.S. sorry if this is in the wrong sub-reddit, I’m new to reddit.

Much thanks in advance!"

I'm not totally sure what I'm looking for here, but any and all advice would be welcomed.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a Fall 2017 admit, I came to Berkeley under somewhat unorthodox conditions, I was much younger than most of my peers and was excited for my future at Cal. My Freshman year went smoothly enough, but I joined too many clubs and got off to a bad start with respect to my grades. Due to the aforementioned unorthodox conditions I wasn't as academically prepared for my Major as I should have been, I didn't handle this in the most healthy way. I leaned hard into my clubs and into my friends, spending even less time on my coursework because I was successful in my clubs but was not so in my classes. I had a great network of friends and finally felt as though I was happy, it was really the first group of people I felt like I could really connect with. However, things started to slowly slip further and further from normal, I got into a relationship that was not healthy for me but I got enough dopamine from being a good boyfriend to stick around ^((what a fuckin simp amirite)). At the same time, financial difficulty, struggling academically, and just the nature of Berkeley, had let imposter syndrome set in and **hard**. All of my friends who I cared about more than I did myself were incredibly successful, had plenty of accolades, and could run circles around me academically. I figured if I just put my head down I could work my way though it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friends convinced me to break off my relationship, and I began to surround myself with the friends who meant the most to me. Classes were still absolutely brutal (two math courses over summer to make up for a D the semester before was hell) but I had good people who got me through it and I found someone who seemed absolutely perfect for me. I knew it wasn't a good idea to be back in a relationship so soon, but it just felt right. My grades kept dropping though, I was drowning in classes. I was spending as much time as I could on classes but I was dismissed from my college. I had landed an internship, but it wasn't related to the career path I wanted. I was failing out of Cal? Everything I've been building toward my entire life had started to unravel. It started taking it's toll on me. I couldn't stand that I had done nothing impressive compared to my friends, I was terrified for my future, some of my friends started making fun of me for my grades, I tried to roll with it, I've always had thick skin, but slowly I started trying to pretend I was someone I wasn't, I started lying through my teeth for fear of making people disappointed in me, I was already failing out, I didn't want to let people down even more, I hated myself for it but that just made things worse. I couldn't be good enough in my relationship, a great friend of mine had feelings for me and I didn't know how to reject them without letting them down. I felt as though I'd lost everything at Cal, my friends were all I had so I couldn't lose them, but they were slipping away before my eyes. I was constantly stressed and couldn't sleep, I felt like my friends had started to hate me too, and things started to completely spiral, I was trying to make everyone happy and had done everyone wrong for it. I started to question who I was and I had lost all credibility for myself. I inadvertently crossed a line and despite my intentions being worlds apart from the interpretation of what I'd said I couldn't defend myself because nobody would believe me, nobody would have. My close friends didn't want to be around me anymore. My biggest fear was my reality.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved out of my apartment and moved into a single on short notice since my roommates wanted nothing to do with me, putting even more financial stress on me and my family. I stopped talking to anyone, even those not directly involved, I wasn't sure how I got to this point, I felt like none of this was the person I thought I was. But something was clearly wrong, I didn't who I'd become. I had lost all motivation, I felt like I couldn't fix anything. I couldn't believe I'd hurt the people I wanted nothing more than to bring joy to. I couldn't stand myself. It's been almost a year since then, I've been trying to get classes back together, I'd found all the study spaces on campus where nobody can see you. I haven't been to my old study spots for fear of seeing my old friends. And then the Coronavirus hits. I finally have some time away from Berkeley (sort of), I've been on a runaway train for the last several years and I might finally have a chance to change things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking here because I don't have anyone else I can ask. What do I do? How do I make things right? Be harsh if you must (trust me I'm used to that, I can take it), I just want to be the person I was, the person I know I am.

&amp;#x200B;

go bears."

Here is the seventh installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).

All the best,

\--Nick

Now that he works from home, he has somehow gotten it into his head that my mom and I are his servants. I need to fetch him some water or coffee, make him food, and everything I do is now his to criticize. 

Of course, whenever I stand my ground and refuse to do any of those, I'm selfish and ungrateful for the ""work"" he does for his family. Like, yes, dad you work. I do too. Mom does too... and we manage to take care of ourselves and the house while you laze around watching TV. You're nothing special. You don't deserve special treatment for being a normal member of this family.

Our culture is absolutely archaic when it comes to gender roles, and because of that, my mother and I have been victims of his absolutely ridiculous standards and mentality. My mother acts like a doormat to him. When I was younger, he threatened to ""ship me off and marry me to a guy"" in my home country when he figured out I was sexually active with my boyfriend. I swear, if it wasn't for my boyfriend (who's white, by the way) keeping me sane at the time, I probably would've lost it and never spoken to them again.

Ironically, he's the most selfish and ungrateful person I have ever met. He never gives any thanks to my mom whenever she makes dinner or cleans the house. He never shows any affection towards her whatsoever. Everything in the house needs to be centered around *his* comfort, and he doesn't do compromises. Let me tell you, I was ***shocked*** when I would go to my white friends' houses and their parents actually gave a shit about each other?? When my FIL thanked my MIL for making supper the other day, it suddenly clicked: my father has *never* done that for my mother.

So, no, dad. I'm not selfish for refusing to be your coffee intern. I'm not ungrateful for thinking you're just a normal adult. Stop projecting your flaws onto me."

Don't get me wrong, I understand the importance of hard work, but I find it almost soul-crushing how it is here. Even more so I find that life (specifically in Ontario, Canada) is rather quite boring and I see a general lack of passion in people.

I spent my last year of university studying and working in Italy and travelling around Europe. I really like what I found (especially in terms of the culture, friendliness of the people, good food and weather), but the people's mentality was too traditional for my liking. Work life is very rigid there and I found little tolerance for ambiguity or acceptance of innovation. Despite speaking the language I also quite often felt a sense of hostility due to me being a foreigner.

I'm not sure why (maybe it's the impression that I got from my Latino friends) but it seems to me that Latin America is in some ways a mix of the New World (more progressive, open minded, less structured and rigid than Europe) yet obviously still has the Latin culture which I really find myself at home in.

Is this true? Am I just dreaming? Is there a place where I can find good weather, great people (who know how to party), vibrant culture, but still be good on the financial front (good job, decent salary to live comfortably)?

I appreciate any input I can get (especially from people living in Latin America).

I speak English and Italian fluently, and am learning Spanish now. I'd give myself a 3/10 at the moment, but I plan on having a good degree of working proficiency by the time I go.

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in finance and economics. I also have some work experience from internships I've done (in finance and in sales). I'd consider doing a master's degree in my destination country, but I'd prefer to work for a while first. For someone with my background, how would I fare in the job market? Anywhere you can recommend that I start looking?

I know Chile is the most economically stable country in the region, so off the cusp, that's the place I have in mind. I also know São Paulo is big for business and could probably find work there (although my knowledge of Portuguese at the moment is virtually non-existent).

Any recommendations for locations are also much welcomed.

Many thanks in advance."

I graduated from college in December and been looking for a job, but with the whole virus thing, it’s been difficult. Now, I wasn’t the best student and didn’t have the best grades, on top of having no internships. Despite that, I’m still optimistic that I’ll find something, eventually. I looked around and found entry level software developers or engineer positions but they’re all from “scam-ish” companies like Revature and Smoothstack. And while I’ve been getting phone interviews, I’d like to broaden my search because I really just want to get started into my CS career.

So my question is, what kind of jobs should we be looking for? Whether they’re long term jobs or jobs to just get started into the field, like entry level software developers/engineers. But what other positions are available? I heard data scientist or analyst, business analyst, etc. Definitely not IT support, I imagine. 

And where would the jobs be? Obviously jobs in NYC or California would be the place, but what other states offer good places to work? I’m in New York right now, just two hours from the city. I’d like to move to California, Bay Area specifically, but I’m willing to work my way there if I can.

g102dt,2,2020-04-14,Advice Wanted: How do I repair my mental health?,tacolover9719,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/g102dt/advice_wanted_how_do_i_repair_my_mental_health/,"Hi, I’m a college student who has posted on this subreddit before. Since COVID-19 forced all our classes online, I’ve been wanting to post on here again to reach out for some assistance, since things have got somewhat worse since my last post and most of the responses were about the financial side of that.

These last couple of years have been bad, but last year was probably the worst. Wednesday (4/15) will be the one year anniversary of my mother’s death. After she passed away, I found out that my mentor was being forced out and all of my friends/co-workers were graduating. In the fall, I returned to find that I lost my job, so I had to find a new job.

Perhaps the biggest thing to happen was I lost interest in my major. I’m studying journalism, and before everything happened I was super passionate about it, even though I could tell something was wrong. During the summer, things got worse. When I returned, I was burned out on journalism.

My fall semester went much better than I anticipated. It was the best semester of my college experience, academically. I worked hard to raise my GPA. At the end of the semester, I settled on wanting to pursue a career in web design.

This semester, on the other hand, has been a train wreck - even before COVID-19 hit.

I’m not sure what I want to do. I know I don’t want to do journalism, and I’m not so sure I could be successful in web design since I only know HTML/CSS and have tried to teach myself PHP and other, more sophisticated languages but failed. (This semester I haven’t even had the time or energy to practice.) For one of my career readiness classes I’ve taken some quizzes but I still have a question mark for what I want to do.

The other problem plaguing me this semester is exhaustion. I’m constantly exhausted... and it doesn’t matter how much sleep I get. I feel my memory, attention and cognitive skills have declined, as well. I don’t feel as “sharp” as I used to be, and I’m very forgetful. Even things I used to enjoy doing or would do for fun (such as working on websites, etc.) have fallen by the wayside because I don’t feel like I have the energy to do them.

Another issue is my self-esteem. I have very little self-esteem. I feel like I’m not good at *anything.* I’m constantly worried that I’ll end up working at a McDonalds flipping burgers for the rest of my life, living with my family. (I can’t work fast food or retail... it’s just not for me.) I’m worried that I’ll never grow or become truly independent, and that worries me.

Right now I’m in the middle of trying to find an internship for my degree, but I’m not even sure if I could handle an internship with my current mental state. I don’t even know what I want to do (except I know what I *don’t* want to do), and I constantly feel exhausted which has caused my memory and cognitive skills to suffer. I have no self-esteem and I’m constantly worried I’ll be working as a burger flipper or cashier for the rest of my life and I’ll never be truly independent or happy.

Really, I feel like I’ll never crawl out of this hole and be happy again.

COVID-19 has really exacerbated things. I was furloughed/lost both of my jobs and have to do all of my classes online. I’m now even more stressed about finding an internship or job that will work.

What are some things I can do to get back on track? What are some things I can do to gain energy and improve my self-esteem?

Because of my current financial situation and having no health insurance my current options are limited. I can’t get any medication (before loosing my insurance I was on a SSRI.) I’m currently talking with a free counselor provided through my university (grad student) but I’m looking for something more permanent, since she leaves in May and I feel her advice isn’t too helpful. I’m currently trying to get on a sliding pay scale with a local clinic. Getting health insurance isn’t an option since the cheapest private option costs almost as much as I make each month, and I’ve looked into government healthcare (Medicaid/Medicare) but I don’t even have a chance as my state (MO) has very strict requirements for Medicaid recipients. I’ve also been trying to get some exercise and taking some time for myself to do stuff I enjoy, but these really haven’t been too helpful for my mental health.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I apologize for the long post."

Some other less important stuff- sports, smaller clubs

#Essays: 

Did personal statement about a decently unique hobby I really enjoy (music production), tried my best to make it personal and interesting, did some weird gimmicky formatting stuff because I thought it might be cool- I personally don’t think I’m a very good writer so it was probably a so-so essay. Supplements were rather rushed, did them all over winter break, did most “why” supplements in a similar format where I talked about classes/professors I wanted to take/learn from, clubs on campus I’d be interested in. Talked a fair bit about connecting the various interests I had together.

#Recs:

I don't really have any idea how these turned out. 

One from a cs teacher I had for 3 years, I tended to slack off a lot in their classes but also did their extra credit opportunities, think they liked me. 

One from my chem teacher I had junior year, they’ve said I give off a super carefree, relaxed vibe so I have no idea how that translated into my rec/if it was good or bad. Probably positive to some degree.

One from my AP Lit teacher I had this year, I went to them a lot for help with college essays, think it was pretty positive? Probably one of the better ones, although I have no idea.

#Interviews:

All my interviews were pretty run of the mill, decent, lasted 45 minutes-1 hour. I wouldn’t say any of my in-person interviews seriously affected my application.

Harvard: probably my worst, I was nervous af and fidgeted a lot, didn’t hurt me, didn’t help me.

Rice: again, standard, recommender liked me, maybe helped a little.

Princeton: one of the better ones, interviewer said they’d write best recommendation possible (though they likely said that to all of their interviewees).

UPenn: potentially my best, interviewer seemed to like me a lot.

Brown: submitted a video portfolio (will elaborate later on).

#Results:


Rejected: Stanford REA, Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, Northwestern, Yale, UCB

Waitlisted: UChicago, UCLA, Rice, UPenn

Accepted: UCSC, UCSB, UCD, UCI, UCSD (all with some sort of regents scholarship), Brown (!!!!!)

#Advice:

I’m pretty sure that the main factor that got me accepted to Brown was my video portfolio; my admissions officer messaged me after my acceptance and talked about how they enjoyed reading my application, especially my video portfolio and how they thought it was great that I put music I had produced as backing music for my video portfolio. Basically took a bunch of fun clips off my camera roll- anywhere from different club events to concerts I’ve attended (shoutouts to tyler, the creator) to make a pretty lighthearted video where I talked about all the clubs I was in and the fun I had from participating in them. I 100% do not claim to know any sort of special secret that will get you accepted. I just decided to be myself throughout the entire application process, wrote about something I wanted to write about even if it didn’t necessarily lend itself to be the ‘best’ essay topic; I don’t even know if my personal statement had anything that could even paint me in a positive light with regards to potential academic performance. I just tried to let as much of my personality show through in my video portfolio and personal statement and let my extracurriculars/honors speak for themselves. 

#Final Thoughts:
If any of y’all saw my last post on this account, don’t worry I’m doing fine now. I’m extremely happy to be attending Brown this fall. Hopefully this could help some of you: if I wanted to impart anything it’d be that you should try to have fun with your application. I feel like if AOs truly can detect authenticity, they’ll enjoy people who stay true to themselves. Of course, take everything I’ve said with a grain of salt- I have no idea how this college process works. Good luck to all y’all prospective applicants, and stay safe/healthy/happy.

edit- thought i'd explain how the video portfolio works. At brown, you can opt into an alumni interview; if you can't get an interview (no interviewers in your area, no availability, etc. etc.), you can submit a 2 minute video portfolio about whatever you'd like. As UChicago doesn't provide interviews, anyone can submit a 2 minute video portfolio."

I am sucker for these kind of stories. What kind of stories you have?

Some personal examples from my very toxic last job:

* Was in a project. We missed an important deadline costing $45 million contract due to management over promising and accepting unreasonable timelines. Both client and company brought out a team of lawyers. Lots of public tongue lashing. Seeing a project crash and burn so hard was sight to see.
* Project manager cussed out over conference call by her boss. She had ticket item excel sheet opened. Excel sheet filled with tickets still opened. Only handful are closed. ""What is this fucking shit"", ""you are fucking this up"", ""you had a whole fucking year"", etc. A lot of fucks thrown around. In a department wide conference call with 50+ attendees. Project manager demoted to project team member.
* My coworker (wished I had more balls than him) going off on our strict boss after several 100 hour weeks due to understaffing and non-stop AM on-calls. Convinced my very strict boss to keep track of hours left us go off work early if we had to be on-call super late or super early. Type of strict boss who would get on to you about every little thing. Thought boss would absolutely blow a gasket, but rather found respect and did what he suggested.
* They let go of my pregnant co-worker not long before due date. They denied her to keep her insurance for a few months via COBRA. She got denied despite qualifying for it. Back and forth spat until she got a new job with benefits that she was able to use to pay for her care. If that wouldn't happened, she would have took them to court.
* Yelling match between tester and developer. Tester said she ran through the checklist. Nasty bug got released. Bug was consistent and obvious enough that she would have caught it. Developer claimed tester just submitted the list as done when it's not to avoid work (she was caught in the past doing this).  Both yelling at each other across conference room.
* Brown nosing co-worker who would always cause drama. Only a few years fresh and only higher  than interns on the corporate totem poll. He talked down to people if they wanted to leave at 5. ""Oh Jacob is just a 9 to 5 person"". Shit like that. Told one of my co-workers in an asshole way, ""this is not a 9 to 5 job. We leave when the work is done"". He got an informal cube leader title that went straight to his head. Reported a guy playing a browser game on their computer during lunch hour even though he takes lunch at a different time due to EST clients. He kept record of who and when people work at home."

I feel professionally lost, I feel I'm wasting my time even when I'm actively looking for opportunities or trying to get some online education that will help me get more jobs (supposedly). I feel overwhelmed by the amout of content YouTube provides of people ""teaching"" how to make money, how to get the job, how to work from home. I've come to a point that I've watched so many videos that everything sounds like bs, and nothing but online course sponsorship. 

Ok, a bit of my story and why I wanna jump out my window:

I graduated in 2017 in communication, I've always loved video editing and that's what I'm trying to pursue as a career. I've worked 3 companies in Europe as a marketing intern and I wound up learning a bunch about social media, marketing, graphic design and entrepreneurship. Right now I kind of HAVE TO work as a freelancer, I left my last company in 2018 and since then I've sent lots of resumes and haven't had many responses. Maybe a chat, maybe an unsuccessful interview, but no jobs. I signed up for many freelancer platforms in june 2019, tried really hard for about a month and kind of gave up, I ran out of credit, had no cash to buy more, and didn't know if Iwould actually find anything anyways. Surprisingly, somebody found me on upwork and I started working for this person in March 2020. I got really excited for having a client and decided to pay upwork to get more connects and reach out to more people. But I haven't had any return since. I don't really know what I'm doing wrong. Every day feels like a failure, I came to a point that even looking for jobs and spending hours and hours working on my portfolio, resumes, job search websites depresses me!! It's like: what the hell am I doing? I'm unemployed for 2 years, nothing came, why would it be different now?

Anyways, I feel really unmotivated, I try to keep positive, I reach out to people, I ask for help, but at the end of the day it's like I'm stuck in this shitty loop and I have no idea how to change it."

Going into this, I was a two-job working, full time college student. Then, I lost my job in my lab at school because the university closed down all labs. Okay, expected, but I still had my other job.

Then, I get an email that the industry summer internship I had been offered was being cancelled due to COVID-19. Okay, also expected that one, since most companies I had sent applications to were sending emails about their programs being cancelled.

Fast forward to today, a few weeks since losing the lab job and the internship being cancelled. I get a call from my boss saying that there’s no work for me to do, people aren’t buying auto insurance right now and full time employees will be taking over my assignments because they don’t have enough to do.

So now I’ve officially lost 2 (and a half?) jobs because of this pandemic. On top of that, I will be turning 21 in a few weeks when things will most likely still be closed, and I can’t see my parents during this because my dad is immunocompromised."
g18goq,24,2020-04-14,Harvard vs mit (cs),mcoolinham,Harvard,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/g18goq/harvard_vs_mit_cs/,"I saw another post on here about someone asking the same thing; so I’ll just highlight the things to which I wasn’t able to get an answer from that post. 

I’m certainly going into CS, and ik that MIT is probably better but I don’t know if I’ll vibe with the overly nerdy culture of MIT. Harvard’s social scene seems to be more of my taste.

Harvard PROs: 

- social atmosphere

- grade inflation/ higher avg gpa(i might want to go onto business school later on + Harvard likely has more connections)

- it’s harvard (world wide prestige — kind of a dream school for me)

Harvard cons: 

- their cs department isn’t on the same level as MIT

- maybe less opportunities for cs internships, since Harvard seems to be leaning more liberal arts

MIT PROS: 

-strong cs dept

- collaborative culture

MIT CONS: 

- too geeky/nerdy 

- difficult (lower avg gpa)

- maybe more competitive for CS internships since like 1/2 the people major in CS

I’ve heard cross registering is a thing, but it is logistically difficult and takes a decent amount of time to commute back and forth. Also, I’m assuming you can only really cross register for a few classes — if I were to do Harvard to MIT

I think the housing system in both places is fine for me. 

Do CS companies prefer MIT grads over Harvard’s? Do they compensate more for one over the other?"

g18uj0,11,2020-04-14,I work as a salesman. This lady showed up and I don't know why. [Part 1],ChadOfTheChill,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g18uj0/i_work_as_a_salesman_this_lady_showed_up_and_i/,"Someone, please help me. I don’t know what to do. I’m writing these posts in the hopes that my family may see this. To my wife Caily, and to my lovely daughter Caroline, I love you both so so much. I don’t have much time left. I think I only have til' sunrise before she shows up. 

So with that being said, let’s get started.

I worked at a car dealership for a company here in Fresno, California. It’s a relatively quiet place compared to those of LA or SF. The pay here is good enough to keep our heads afloat and the people are alright. I’ve been working at the Depot for about 4 years now, and nothing, in particular, has struck me odd or out of the blue.

To say my life here is ‘dull’ is a huge understatement. Nothing really ever goes around so we just chill by the reception and maybe play some Uno, watch some tv and then some. Occasionally we’d get some customers but to be honest no one really cares either way. Time just passes by when you’re bored as hell.

The real ‘fun’ starts by the end of the season. Every quarter we throw this big discount sale on the weekend on all the automobiles as far as the eye can see. Banners are thrown across the stretch with tiny *banderitas* hanging below it, following a continuous black &amp; yellow pattern.

The newly shined cars manifest their unique hues, blossoming like a beautiful sunflower, glistening against the sky. As we hand out flyers a week prior to the event, and with the aid of social media—sure enough, all this commotion can cause quite the ruckus at the Depot.

Ken and I were tasked with wiping the windshields of the cars, supposedly making them look brand-new. Unlike yours truly, Ken was a very astute salesman. With a witty tongue and razor-sharp intuition, he’s capable of convincing his clients to buy just about anything within half an hour, I tell ya.

Ken was also a very robust person. Contrary to his rugged physique, Matt would consistently tend to the cars as if they were his own children. Having treated people relentlessly with copious amounts of respect, Ken’s uplifting behavior would often be returned in his favor. Oh, how I wish I was like that guy.

“Hey buddy, need a hand?” a man with a deep voice queried.

I was startled and relieved to see a tall well-marbled man with jet black hair standing before me. Wearing the same old black polo from our internship. Both of us go way back.

“You know, it would be a lot better if you don’t creep up on people,” I warned Ken politely. He replied with an affirmative grin on his face right before I handed him the stack of tires before heading outside, holding another set in hand. “Now come on. these tires aren’t going to fix themselves.”

“Whatever you say, Poll.” he murmured.

Time flies by when you’re kept busy, and before you know it, we were one day shy of the main event. Everyone was briefed of the schedule to follow for the following days, no hiccups or anything this time. So far everything is going well.

I was more than happy to call it a day, but unfortunately, the manager ordered me to do a couple more rounds before I went home. Just to check on the cars and make sure all the lights were turned off. Some regular stuff, you know? Well, that’s when it got creepy.

It was around 6:30 PM when it occurred, I had closed all the lights in the vicinity and made one short round trip just to make sure there weren’t any troublemakers making out. The streets were empty and no one was nearby. It was getting quite cold. I had locked the door to the information desk, turning my head around in search of my car, instead, I saw her.

It was an old lady. Standing at the corner of the street, staring at me. At first, I had thought that she was looking to inquire inside, but I had clearly shut the whole place down. *What is she doing?* I pondered.

I waved my hand to signal the old lady that we were closed, yet she remains there. Seemingly unaltered, I slowly walked up to her by the barred gate guarding the store.

With my dandy flashlight in hand, I started. “Good evening Maam. I’m really sorry but we’re closed now. You can come again in the morning though! We’re having a special sale at 8 AM tomorrow and…”

That’s where it daunted me. My head felt light and my stomach started to churn. I stumbled and fell a few steps back before puking at the monstrosity I was gazing upon. She grinned with crooked teeth and laughed hysterically. The odor she gave was unbearable and peering into her lifeless soul made it all the more unpleasant. Where her nose, ears, and eyes should’ve been were covered in blank, featureless skin. 

In short, I had no other words to describe her but this: that lady was a monster. A pure, horrifying monster.

What happened after that was all but a haze. I woke up lying on the cold asphalt floor, shocked by what just happened. Feeling dazed and confused, I slowly reached for my phone to check the time. ‘7:10 PM’ glared at me, making me squint my eyes.

Seconds later, my senses suddenly came to fruition when I remembered why I was lying there in the first place. I sprang back up on my feet and looked back at the corner of the street, to my relief, she was nowhere to be seen. 

Without a second thought, I quickly went home and called it in for a night. I didn’t care how many red lights I would have to cross just to get there, all I know is that I needed to pack for home and scram.

I came home to see my wife sitting on the couch, watching *Sex Education*. Attempting to slip by unnoticed has proven harder than I thought. Alas, with her undeniable echolocation and my super-stiff body, it was all but a futile attempt.

“Honey, where have you been?” she asked softly.

“Oh, Jeffrey told me to double-check everything before leaving. Caught some kids making out by the dumpster, you know how it is.” I responded hesitantly, well, I wasn’t completely lying.

She frowned upon hearing my manager’s name. “Your new supervisor? He’s always leaving the hard stuff to you. If I ever get to see that motherf-”

“Hey now. He’s only been at it for a couple of weeks, give him a break will ya? Sooner or later he’s gonna turn out just like me.” I let out a brief chuckle as I scratched the top of my head in satisfaction.

Annoyed, Caily turned my way assumingly refuting my statement but was lost for words once seeing my tarnished polo and my soiled trousers. Despite having gone through possibly the most traumatizing day of my life, I couldn’t help but crack a smile at that beautiful face of hers.

“Honey, are you okay?” she asked distressfully.

I gave her a reassuring look. “Yeah Caily, just… something I ran into today. Sorry, I’m late.”

I gave her a soft kiss on the forehead before heading upstairs. Before she could ask any more questions, I motioned to her that I would tell her about it tomorrow. I slowly opened Caroline’s bedroom, she lied there, sleeping as sound as ever. I brushed my hands against her hair and murmured to her quietly that I love her and kissed her goodnight.

Slowly closing the door, I shiftlessly walked to our room, dropping dead like there was no tomorrow. The picture of her blank face still lingered through my thoughts. The foul stench she emitted before I collapsed. She had no eyes but deep inside, I inexplicably felt her gaze into my soul. I tried as hard as I could to get that lady—that thing out of my head but to no avail. I only had a few hours of sleep before I woke up and made haste for the following days ahead.

With little to no rest under my belt, I skipped breakfast and kissed my two beautiful girls goodbye. Unsurprisingly, I was running late so I had no time to talk to Caily about what happened. There were much larger events that I had to be concerned about.

Trying not to break the speed limit, my 1995 Toyota Corona roared through the freeway racing against time, heading towards my inevitable doom. This is it. Oh, what a day. What a lovely day."

As the title says, I am considering a move to Kansas to follow my SO who will be attending Kansas State, and would appreciate some advice from any devs local to the area. I recently got my bachelors in CS (December 2019) with both a summer internship and 2 years in a junior position at local companies during my time at school. 

I assume I'll be looking for junior positions, so any kind of partial WFH would be hard to come by. With that in mind,

* It seems as though Kansas City itself has the most opportunities. Would living in/commuting from Manhattan be feasible or should we be looking at Topeka/somewhere else in between the two?
* What is the job market like outside of KC?
* Are there other companies besides Sprint, Garmin, and Cerner that I should be looking at?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time."

This year, the average total cost to attend an MBA program is $196,067, up from $185,747 last year — and up from about $168,000 three years ago. (P&amp;Q)

Although, the Covid-19 situation is still very fluid, many schools are preparing to potentially remain online comes fall. One of the most important value propositions of an MBA is the professional network you will build for yourself during your time on campus. If relationship building is on the top list of the reasons why you decided to pursue a graduate business degree, the idea of losing out on this aspect this fall can be a deal breaker. If you are an international student, embassies closure worldwide may not give you any other option but to attend classes online this fall.

Truth is, online courses, even well designed will never be a substitute for an immersive campus experience. 

If you received a letter of acceptance to your top MBA choice, congrats! If the optics of going online this fall is an issue and you are reconsidering your plans, here are a few steps you can take to help you decide on the best course of action:

1.	**Negotiate the deposit deadline**

For many schools deposit deadlines are firm and non-negotiable. However, given the unusual circumstances, B-Schools may consider granting deposit extensions to prevent an enrollment melt down the road.  It doesn’t cost anything to ask, it will buy you time so you can make an informed decision.

2.	**Check-in regularly**

As we are drafting this article, the situation is still very fluid and schools are waiting to hear back from government entities regarding visas for international students and the evolution of the pandemic to decide whether they are going online or not. Decisions will likely be released in April/May. Stay in contact with your admissions office!

3.	**Inquire about deferral policies**

From one school to the other, deferral policies vary greatly. Speak with your admissions representative about the implication of deferring your admission to fall 2021. Will your spot be guaranteed in the program? Will you keep your scholarship award? This information is likely to be critical in your decision making process. 

4.	**Inquire about recruiting events and internships**

If the announcement to go online is out, make sure you inquire about the school’s plans regarding recruiting events this fall, are they going online? If so, how many events have been scheduled? Who will be attending? Are these events specifically for MBA students? By now, most schools should have secured their speakers and dates. Same goes for internships, make sure you inquire about their game plan.

5.	**Make your decision ASAP**

Once you have all the information in hand and if you make the decision to defer, make sure you let your school know as soon as possible. The sooner you request a deferral, the more likely it is to be granted. Safe to assume that if embassies are not able to grant visas, B-schools will experience a wave of deferral requests over the course of the summer. Make sure you are ahead of the curve!

My A-Level courses: Computer Science, Greek, Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Economics, Physics


**Awards:** 
- 1st place at a Insurance Tech hackathon (was competing vs adults and grad students)

- 1st place at the International EuroMath 2019 Conference (out of 60 people)

- Innovative Thinking Award at the International Land Rover 4x4 In Schools Competition for a navigation application that calculates the risk of roads based on past accidents

- 2nd place at a UK-based international math competition where I was the team leader (out of 500 teams)

- Best Coder @ LaunchX

- 3rd place at some OpenData Hackathon (not sure if I should include it?)

- 3rd place twice at NASA SpaceApps, likely wont mention it

- Won a hackathon related to covid-19, competing against 50 teams, the vast majority of whom were adults or college students

**Extracurriculars:** 

- Currently working on an app, in talks with an organization interested in funding it's launch. Tailored for the elderly to allow them to deliver groceries to their door in a contactless manner, keeping them safe &amp; secure during the pandemic while also keeping ordering and delivery as simple-as-possible.

- Founded school robotics club in my Sophomore year, teach twice a week. My school is pretty big (1300 students) and well established, however there is no support for students wanting to start their own club - student run clubs were against the rules until I fought with the administration for about a year on it and they finally let me. The club has become the largest in the school (40 members, ages 13-18) and it's entirely student run.

- MUN. I've been involved in MUNs for the past 5 years, going once as Admin Staff, once as a Reporter, and three times as a delegate. I was also selected to be part of my school's delegation at the biggest MUN conference in the world (THIMUN). This year I chaired the Security Council.

- Asteroid hunter in my Junior year. As part of my school's astronomy club, I've discovered 11 asteroids. One of them has been independently verified by a third party which means I'll get to name it in a few years.

- Part of the editorial team for the schools magazine since I was a Sophomore, I've been involved in it as a writer &amp; content leader and now I'm basically in the team that's in charge of the whole thing

- Student Council in my Junior year. I was elected as Class Representative to be in the Advisory Council, and then in the Advisory Council I was elected to be in the Student Council 

- LaunchX. Attended LaunchX, summer program with 15% acceptance rate. Started a company that went nowhere which is an oof - don't know if I can mention

- Internship. Landed a paid 2 month Software Developer internship meant for college students at a medium-sized company (50 people) in the country that I'm in. Worked 9+ hours a day, on one project that involved contributing to a large open source piece of visualization software used by companies like AirBNB and Lyft, and on another project that was quite unethical in terms of data privacy so I don't know if it's a good idea to mention it.

- In the organizing team for the Fridays for Future Climate strikes in my country, which managed to gain enough support to be on national news. Wrote letters to politicians on behalf of the strikes, organized logistics, strategy, etc.

- Will be in the army when I am applying (military service is compulsory in my country)

**Essays/LORs/Other:**  

- Essays: Honestly no idea. I need to start working on them, oof. 

- LORs: I assume will be 9/10. What worries me is that many teachers don't know how to write proper LORs since they're not accustomed to it (most students in my school to go study in the UK)

Other: Made a couple of fun projects.

1) Basically made my own Amazon Alexa from scratch using Python. She (""Olympia"") sits in my room and I just talk to her when I'm lonely or if I have a question. She can stream music, answer general knowledge questions, look stuff up, do math, get me the weather and set alarms and stuff. She's operated entirely via voice and responds through a speaker.  

2) Made a navigation app that uses past accident data to figure out which roads are dangerous and then give you a route that optimizes both safety &amp; time. Combined it with how you can partner with insurance companies to get people discounts on car insurance if they pick safer routes. Used it to win 1st place at the Insurance Tech hackathon and Innovative Thinking award at Land Rover 4x4 In Schools Competition

3) Currently building a website which will empower local governments to figure out weaknesses in their emergency response systems. Take fire stations for an example - this algorithm I wrote looks at where the current fire stations are located, and then it looks at where the fires have happened in the past 5 years, and it figures out the weak spots in your response system. It then tells you where you should place new fire stations to optimize emergency response time. The algorithm part is done, I just need to build a website around it. I'm thinking of reaching out to my local fire departments seeing if they'd be interested. This could work for any country in the world.

4) Made a payment system that works through SMS for 3rd world countries which don't have access to ATMs, smartphones or WiFi. However this payment system does need a bank account which kinda defeats the purpose. This was for a Financial Tech hackathon and while we didn't place in the top 3, we got the judges award and the prize money that came along with it

5) Made a thing that analyzes your Facebook chat history with someone and gives you a bunch of stats, like who talks more, words used, messages over time etc. Will eventually (hopefully) make a website out of it.

6) Built a device that lets you pay with face recognition (interfaces with the banks API) but it never went anywhere (it was for a hackathon and we didn't win any prizes either)

Completed MIT 6.00.1 and 6.00.2 on edX"

hooks

* first-gen immigrant family
* black woman
* LGBTQ
* upper-middle class (?)

academics:

* 3.75 W GPA (expected to go up), school doesn’t rank
* show an upward trajectory in my transcript, and skipped a level of Spanish between freshman and sophomore year
* 1440 SAT (700 ERW 740 M) - was gonna take it again in May but :( and also why take it again when i would be taking the spot of someone who hasn't taken it before ya know
* no APs freshman year bc of school policy, sophomore year took APWH (5), taking APUSH, AP EngLang, and AP SpanLang junior year; senior year i’ll be taking AP Psych, English Lit, Music Theory, Calc AB, and Bio (was capped by my school)
* took all the honors classes i could freshman, sophomore, and junior year. my courses for senior year are mostly APs and two honors classes
* i go to a super wealthy private school

summer things!

* summer after my freshman year, i did a business program that allowed me to work as an entrepreneur, and create my own business alongside a partner that would code our website. that summer, i made a faux business that would allow lower income children have access to lessons in the arts, and it would work as a ""name your price"" model
* summer after my sophomore year, i did a program at NYU that allowed me to get in contact with admissions officers, and have them read over my essays and know who i am
* summer after my junior year (fingers crossed), i had an internship lined up with a music museum

ECs!

* I've been in my school's diversity club since my freshman year, and i've become a junior head as well. we do conferences and discussions that are open to the whole student body.
* i've been in my school's MUN team since freshman year and i'm a junior head there as well
* i made my own club at the school centered in on different types of art (performance, visual, etc.) and the whole process of how it is brought to our attention; from inspiration to creation, to promotion and sale
* from sophomore year, i worked with a girl in the grade above mine (now senior) to create a dance team. last year, we started as a club and worked hard enough to put together something for the talent show. this year, we got recognized as a team by the school (therefore making us the first dance co-captains), and performed at the school's first-ever homecoming
* i performed in my school's musicals my freshman and junior year (with video footage) - the reason why i didn't perform sophomore year is because i got into NYU's Future Music Moguls program, that was Saturdays from February to May. it focused on music business as well as performing, and we had to come up with a business plan to promote the project that we made (in our case, it was a single). i was in a group with three seniors and a junior, and all three of those seniors got into NYU this year.
* since freshman year, i have been the founder and organizer of the school's talent show, which is a fundraiser for our sister school in Kenya. i make everything from the ground up, i set the dates, i get the talent from inside the school, and i do the promotion. i have performed in my own talent show.
* since my freshman year, i've been a part of my school's chorus and singing group - in the two years that i've been in the singing group, i've performed many times with them, and had a few solos in school concerts
* i've been taking singing lessons with my singing group teacher since freshman year, and i've performed in school recitals
* on my own time, i produce my own music, collaborate with other artists, and i plan on putting two more projects out by the time summer ends.

schools i'm really digging

* drexel for music industry
* fordham for music
* howard u for music
* loyola university nola for music industry
* umiami for the MADE program
* NYU for clive davis \*will ED there\*
* syracuse u for music industry
* the new school for music"

I had an internship in app development but didn't feel like the field was right for me at the time. Since then I've been working in a few IT help desk jobs and customer service. I feel like I am ready to go back to work as a dev.

I know I have to work on putting together an up to date portfolio. However I am not sure if I should attempt to get an internship first or a  an entry level job considering the time gap since  the time I graduated. A part of me is also thinking of going to university but I'm struggling with if it's really worth it."

I’m having a difficult time deciding which school should be my choice. I have been making pros and cons some of which include UCF probably being financially better. However, I worry about the size and how that will affect my education and support. Although I’m applying to the excel program so that might help. Also, I would have to stay at home. I worry mentally if that would be best for me considering some family issues and getting a bit of the college experience. I heard their engineering program is great which is why I’m heavily considering it. With FSU I liked the smaller class sizes for engineering, and more hands on labs (not sure if a lot of the engineering classes are like this at UCF), moving away, and becoming more independent. However, I worry the education and opportunities might not compete as well with UCF. If anyone knows the quality of classes, tutoring opportunities, internships, or anything else I mentioned in my post it would be super helpful thanks.

EDIT: I know it’s only been a day but I have made my deposit for UCF. I was already heavily considering UCF and just needed a little more advice in order to completely solidify my choice. Thank you for all the wonderful responses! I would still really appreciate any answers to my questions or any other general advice for a new engineering student at UCF thanks!"
g1a4pa,2,2020-04-14,Qualcomm 6 month Co-Op vs. Intuit 3 month internship,n_cs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g1a4pa/qualcomm_6_month_coop_vs_intuit_3_month_internship/,"I'm having a really hard time choosing between these 2 opportunities. The pay is almost similar with Intuit paying 43$ and hour and Qualcomm paying 38$ an hour. Both will most likely end up being remote because of covid-19. I heard from my friends that Intuit ends up giving almost their SDE interns a return offer which sounds appealing for me because I'm an international student worried about finding a job after graduation since many companies are on a hiring freeze and it's not looking good. 

However, Qualcomm is a 6 month co-op which will give me more experience in R&amp;D. I am not sure."

I signed the offer last year and I am expected to start in about a month.

  
The thing is, I am not really interested in the role anymore, and I was going to be referred to full-stack web dev jobs by some of my peers, but then this pandemic came in the way of that.   


Overall, I do want to play things safe and yes, I do acknowledge I am very privileged right now for even being able to ask a question like this. But my question is: If I get hired for a full-stack dev position right now, is it safe to switch jobs?  


tl;dr: If I get a web dev offer, should I switch to it or stick with my current developer job during this pandemic?"

I've applied to about 150 jobs over the past four months, with no luck. I've had a few interviews/on sites, but I was eventually rejected (I only have a few personal projects, no experience). I'm a transfer so recruiting has always been an uphill battle (I didn't know how to code until a year ago). I'm expected to graduate a semester late (December '21 instead of May '21), so in addition to this summer I'll have time for a second internship.  
&amp;nbsp;

How much merit do information technology/PM internships have? Do companies see this with any value? Obviously it's not SWE experience. Eventually I want to be a software developer/engineer, but I'm having a lot of trouble, and I see tons of IT/PM internships online. I applied to a few and they've already offered me interviews. I want to do SOMETHING this summer to build my resume. People tell me to work on personal projects, but I don't want to just sit in my room all summer doing that."
g1c2h7,1,2020-04-14,"[crosspost + update] My best friend/girlfriend's mother was suddenly killed. The situation surrounding the death is complicated, and she's struggling immensely. After 7 months, she is suicidal and stuck at home alone due to the pandemic. I don't know what to do.",ThrowRA-SadSadBoy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g1c2h7/crosspost_update_my_best_friendgirlfriends_mother/," 

I originally posted on r/internetparents but I think at this point, this sub is a good place to go to. [here's the link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/ditgbz/my_best_friendgirlfriends_mother_was_suddenly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) \- [here's a link to the first update](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/fq3x68/update_my_best_friendgirlfriends_mother_was/)

The situation is kind of complicated, but here are some bullet points, although the last posts explain all of the nuances better and I'd like to ask that you read them if you can.

* Her mother was killed in a hit and run, she also was schizophrenic. The combined trauma of the sudden death and the past issues hit really really hard.
* My girlfriend, who I called Elise in the post, was self-harming because of this and her mental health plummeted in almost every way. Not eating, couldn't get out of bed, constant nightmares every night, disassociating, it wasnt good.
* Her family is not very supportive. As well as dealing with their own grief, they have not really supported her in finding resources or anything like that. Her dad seems to not want to acknowledge this is happening and she doesn't feel comfortable discussing it with him. She's close with her sister, but her sister is also still struggling. The sister also works in a large hospital so they aren't seeing each other right now due to the pandemic
* School is almost impossible to complete. We go to a competitive private university and she's in one of the most competitive programs. Her classwork has become much much harder for her to do. She also hates her major and was pressured into doing it by her late mother, which makes her feel obligated to not leave it. The school has been completely unhelpful. Some teachers never even responded to emails or met with her.
* The pandemic has worsened all of this. She's stuck at home and can do nothing that helped her cope, like see people or get out.

It's been about 7 months since her mother died. She is not doing well. I'm being an armchair psychiatrist here, but the way she is acting is far closer to severe depression than anything else. It's not really about the grief anymore (to a degree it is, but this is very much related yet separate from it), she can barely get out of bed or focus on work or do *anything*. This is infuriating to her. We both feel that a huge reason for this is because everything we did to try and get help in the past 7 months didnt work. Professors and school services fell through completely, therapists didn't take insurance or were full, classes just got harder. Nothing we did worked. Any time something fell through, she was completely crushed and was even more reluctant to try something the next time. 

The pandemic has only made everything worse. She feels physically and metaphorically stuck. We can't even log into her insurance providers portal and mental healthcare services are so overwhelmed that its been so hard to get in touch with anyone. We've hoped to contact someone, anyone, about antidepressants or sleep aids but have not been able to. A large part of this is because her motivation is so low. I can't blame her, why would she want to reach out to anyone if everything we've tried to do for the past 7 months didn't work or didn't go through? She feels as though it can't get better at all. There's no path for her to go forward. 

Our conversations have gotten much, much darker. Since about a month ago, she's mentioned death or suicide more frequently. In this past week and last week, its been much much more. She has told me explicitly that she doesn't actually want to, and it scares her that she's thinking about it so much. She has said if she *actually* wanted to, she probably wouldn't tell me that she was thinking about it. She knows that she doesn't actually want to die, she just wants a break. I'm still absolutely terrified though - her internship this summer was moved online so she is going to be stuck at home until at least August. The internship was the one thing keeping her going and now she's spending it at home and virtually, which she hates. That's insane, and to her the thought of doing that is like a massive brick wall coming straight at her. I'm really really worried. She mentioned yesterday that she looked up studies on ""dosages"" of different chemicals or medications to find out when they're deadly. That really scared her.

I think there is a chance she could try to kill herself. I don't know what to do. Id want to try to contact a psychiatrist or doctor or *someone* to try to get a medication or help or anything at all. But we cant even log into her insurance and she feels so defeated that she doesn't want to try anything at all. **What the hell can I do?** We're currently in different states because we were both sent home from school due to the pandemic. Legally, I can't call anywhere on her behalf. I have no idea what to do. I'm the only one who knows shes suicidal. 

Any suggestions at all are welcome. Thank you."
g1cfi9,1,2020-04-14,Would you recommend taking a gap year as a student?,LaPiggyFish,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g1cfi9/would_you_recommend_taking_a_gap_year_as_a_student/,"I am currently a 4th year student in an engineering school in France (Biotechnology), and am thinking of taking a gap year. Due to the current crisis, my final year of study which was supposed to be abroad and that is the main reason of my school choice/motivation, is compromised.

At the moment, I don't think that I will have the strength to give up on that project (1 semester abroad + a 6 month internship in the same country),  nor to follow one more semester in a school that appears to be quite toxic for me. I am therefore considering taking a gap year in order to have the opportunity to do my year abroad in 2021.

If I took this gap year, I would probably take some time for myself to rethink what I want to do in life, as I still have some issue deciding what job I want once I will graduate. I would of course also try to find internships/ jobs in my field in order to gain some experience.

My question is, do you think that a gap year would be an advantage in my career, or in the opposite, would be a bad idea making it just harder for me to go back to school once over?"
g1cvxz,1,2020-04-14,2024 freshman engineer!!,bringspideyback,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/g1cvxz/2024_freshman_engineer/,"i want an opinion from ucf engineering majors:

i want to double major in mechE and cs, but so many ppl on reddit and quora as well as engineers i’ve contacted through instagram say different things (w a majority saying it’s hard obviously). yet, i do find people who have done exactly that and r doing fine rn. i wanna work for nasa in my future. 

exactly how hard would this be? i haven’t really gotten a clear picture from the exploring i’ve done on the internet LOL. would doing this prevent me from doing internships and research?? 

the whole reason i’m considering this dm is that i personally feel like it would be beneficial in my career w nasa if i gain experience in both engineering nd coding. tell me if i’m wrong about anything i’m only a hs senior w barely any experience w college 

ty for replying if u do!

idk how much this helps but i have an AA degree from hs because we had this community college + hs program so i have some transferable credits that may help? but idk how much it will help or not because it’s just an AA :/"

In order to get it, I need to do an internship during my third year and I was recently offered one. I already took part in two interviews and in the next weeks, I must decide which kind of project to take part in.

The three areas I was offered are Mobile Development (iOS/Android, which I have already rejected), backend (Java) and frontend (Angular). Currently, in my studies, I already learned C, MatLab, and Python and I am learning MIPS, SQL, HTML, CSS, and PHP; I will tackle Java next year.

I am not sure which field I should choose, here are my considerations:

\- I would like to learn about a field that I am not familiar with (for my Master's I am considering either Data Science or Cybersecurity, but I am still not sure) and to learn skills that could be useful in my career.

\- I am not considering an internship in Data Science or cybersecurity because I do not have the skills necessary for those fields since I will do that only during my Master's, whereas I have already developed some skills that could be useful for the internship I was offered. Besides, my internships must be about something that I already cover in some form in my university.

\- My main doubt is that I am not sure what would be more convenient:  
\-  either do a backend with java while I am learning that language at college (maybe if I manage, I   
could even try and learn some java during summer) and directly apply what I learn in class;  
\-  or frontend with Angular, which would mean that I learn a skill that I normally wouldn't during my   
studies.

I would like to hear your recommendation and what you would do if you were in my shoes. Thank you in advance!"

I'm a sophomore in college, finishing up my second year studying biology. I never thought I'd be forced to come back here, but with the pandemic, everything's shut down, so here I am.

In a way, I'm grateful to a degree. I don't think that everything is perfect or happens for a reason (or at least, that it's that neat). But I do think that good things happen and bad things happen, and they all help you grow to get a little bit better.

Literally made a reddit account for this. Never would've done this before, but unthinkable times call for unthinkable measures, right? Corny, but let's get into it.

&amp;#x200B;

So my parents are an Indian couple who got together with an arranged marriage. The immigrated to America, and I popped out a year later. I've heard from them in passing/rants about how much they've had to struggle with to build a life for themselves from scratch, and it's no joke. I really, truly respect it. I understand and empathize with it. But I think the hardest thing is that I don't get respect in return.

I'd love to write this in chronological order, but things are just to intense on the front end for me to delve into my childhood and focus up on detailing those events.

**My attempts to analyze their motives**

Anyway, I guess the stress of building a life here and the Indian culture made them the way they are. Both my parents have Indian musical training, and I suppose the combination of the culture, religion, and training (closely tied to culture and religion) made them this way. I've spent my entire life hearing them yell at me, beat me, whatever. (I say whatever, and one of the healthiest things to do would be to actually dissect ""whatever"", but this post is a first step, not the first ten lmao. We'll see). I guess they were just taught to keep moving forward and focus on what society expected from them? Our ""family"" – my parents, rather – are super religious.

I experienced verbal, physical, and emotional abuse all my life. I just recently put together that the reason that I didn't try in high school and wasn't motivated wasn't because I wanted to ""get back at them"" for being so intense in high school and before. Maybe marginally. No, I've recently realized that I've literally been depressed for all four years of high school, maybe more. That was astounding. To tie all these things together and actually be able to point to a concrete cause was the most bittersweet thing. I'm so happy to realize that, but at the same time, the situation sucks, you know?

**Religion Tangent**

Anyway, my parents are super religious, and so I've recently started to question their motives, to analyze why they do what they do. It's the first step to reconciling, right? I've asked them point-blank why they birthed me, and the explicit reason I got was because ""God gave us the job to make you"", so what I'm hearing is ""society expected it of us"". I call BS. (going to share my personal stance on religion, not applicable for everyone) I've turned agnostic now, because I refuse to believe that ""God"" simply decided to put me in an abusive family. Even before, when I did believe more in this, there was this sense of ""ignore the millions of people suffering out there, karma made them deserve it"". Which if you believe in, makes sense, but even still.... really?

And now I'm stuck at home with them. Coming back from college after two years has given me the perspective I sorely needed. I have actually come home for the first extended period of time since high school, and I can point to exact behaviors and say **this** exact thing is where you went wrong and crossed the line. I didn't have that perspective before, and it's a beautiful thing. But it matters for jack when you feel like shit.

Anyway, now I'm stuck at home, and in confronting all these thing I'm being forced to face, I can't believe in a God that would willingly put me here. To learn a lesson, perhaps? But that's bs. Literally I can just gain the knowledge. And you can make roundabout arguments about how experience is a better teacher (which I 100% believe) but, seriously, if you're all-powerful, I can just learn it in the best way..

Back off the tangent!

**About me**

So a little bit about me: as a sophomore, I've done some awesome things. I don't mean that in a cocky way. I say that because I've had the privilege of being able to pursue my passion to the utmost, and at 19, that's something very few people have been able to do. I've observed medicine and surgery for months, done years of research, and even presented at a national conference. These were all with some seriously awesome, nationally-eminent institutions. I'm being deliberately vague because the more detail I give, the easier people will find it to identify me, and at least right now, anonymous is how I'd like to play it.

**History**

In elementary school, my parents were grooming me to ""academic success"" from the start. They pushed me into one of those high-intensity programs for nine year olds. It was actually super awesome, and it was how I fell in love with science. It's just obvious to me now that I was being pushed in that direction.

Anyway, at the same time, I sat down with all the other little Asian boys and girls (but mostly boys) for national math competitions in second grade. That was the time that I really remember the ass-whupping starting. Before, I was learning music from my parents, and would get beat for the smallest things (straying eyes, mistakes), but now I was just expected to make these gratuitous math jumps without any prior exposure. The shame from failing to ever bring home an award was... I don't even have words to describe how devastatingly overwhelming and all-encompassing it was.

Four grades of ass-whupping later, I found myself in middle school. My elementary school was full of smart kids, but I was the only brown kid in middle school, so obviously I was one of the smartest. I didn't realize until six years later that my academic success wasn't because I was brilliant, it was because I had enjoyed the luxury of a good education.

I honestly don't remember much in middle school, because at that time I actually managed great grades. There was regular ass-whupping, but nothing extremely notable.

High school, though. You love to see it.

I went to a snotty, nerdy, disgustingly academic high school. Ego and pride poured out the ears of almost every freshman there, myself included. Then it got beat out of us by some of the most difficult content children have ever had the misfortune to see.

My high school is well known (which is why I omit the name), and you had to apply to get in. There is an entire industry devoted to beating little Asian middle schools into shape over two years, and forcing them to get 100%'s on the admissions exams. Needless to say, I disappointed my parents further when I didn't score well in the course they were paying for, and I felt the effects at home.

Though I will say one thing that I am so grateful for. My parents bought me nice things, my mother went out of her way to always make home-cooked meals, and for that I was grateful. The abuse was hard. But what has driven me in my life has been the fact that they never pushed me towards a career. I want to do medical research now, and it's solely of my own volition. That much I'm confident in. They drilled in a hardworking ethic and always doing my best, and I struggled for a long time with the fact that their core values became my core values. But at this point, I am what I am, and I love myself.

I guess the problem is that they don't love me anymore. And maybe they do, but I haven't seen it where it counts for years now.

Like I said, we were all arrogant kids until we realized high school was **not** going to be middle school. I'm sure all the other kids at our pre-dominantly Asian institution were beat at home too, because goddamn, suicide rates were high there and no one talked about it.

Anyway, that was when the shoe really dropped. My parents pushed and pushed until I just didn't want to work. Before, I thought my lack of motivation was to get back at them. But now, I realize that it's because of depression. I was so depressed. I didn't have friends, didn't fit in. I was entirely socially isolated.

It was really because that's when the dream fell apart (in their eyes). They had pushed and pushed me towards this hallmark of a school I had heard about their entire lives. But then, I failed so abysmally that they took their fears and frustrations on me. That was probably the hardest time of my life.

And it truly disgusts me to say that. So many people out there are struggling medically, personally, and the like from, wars, famine (right now, disease), poverty, and actual domestic violence. I know that part of my problem has been finding difficulty in accepting that my childhood was actually abusive, but at the same time, I never feared for my life. (Though that was because society would ask inconvenient questions, not for any wealth of love for me on their part). I probably got threatened four times a week that I would die, or that I should die, or that I was a waste of space or the like at its pinnacle in high school. But I'm just so disgusted to say ""yeah the hardest time of my life was when I was abuse at home"", with  three meals, a bed, clothing, a home, and an education most people can't even dream of"". There are people out there that are literal prisoners of war, or suffering from the trauma of taking lives – people who watch their family starve, or are stuck in internment camps. It's what I want to help through my career. People who have it worse than me. But I guess I have to recognize the reality of what I've experienced at home.

I was depressed a lot of the time, and college applications in senior year were suffocating. That constant pressure and amount of attention from them changed it to the point that I truly began considering suicide. I was beat multiple times a night, called stupid and a waste of space (the kindest of their compliments). It was almost always my father. My mother mostly stood by and watched, but sometimes she'd beat me if she was annoyed at my mouthing off. Didn't hurt nearly as much, but still sucked.

Senior year was the first time I recognized my own depression. But after four or five months, I slowly worked out of it. I started figuring out how friends worked, and made one or two. Also though (I'm so sorry guys), Logan Paul. I was watching those vlogs and they genuinely helped. Wherever you are dude, you screwed up, but you kept me going for a little while too. I read this thing recently about how some doctors are annoyed in NYC about the COVID applause, but others have come forward and said while they cringed at it while well, when some doctors got sick w COVID/tired from overwork, that was exactly what they needed to push through. I imagine those vlogs were exactly like that. Cringe-worthy and terrible now, but what I needed to distract myself/keep pushing in the moment. I actually was past considering suicide for a month when his end of the year infamous Japanese forest video came out. I had already been questioning some things as I came out of the depression, but yeah, that was the day I dipped for good. Never thought I'd be talking about this, let alone on the internet, but yeah, there it is.

I just don't want to be sad now. The beautiful thing is, college was the first time I wasn't sad. I realized I didn't have to be when I wasn't home.  I struggled for a while, spouting off my parents' ideals about life and society, until I realized that I didn't believe any of it. I was depressed throughout high school, though I still pursued my clinical aspirations. I did two years of research at an eminent organization, and it set me up for success in the future. I pushed through, made amazing friends with peers and faculty, and have been growing on a journey of self-discovery for the last two years.

People know me at my university well for my work ethic, passion for science, and ideas and contributions. And it's not a small university. Take that how you will.

The saddest thing about this whole situation is that I was truly beginning to grow out of my parents' oppressive attitudes and my past, to become an emotionally whole person. Then this corona thing hit, and now I'm stuck with them. The **only** thing it's been good for is proving my questions in college about whether I should cut them out of my life. I will.

And the sad thing is, I expected that a 4.0 would keep them off my backs. Because in college they would call, and the reason I wanted a 4.0 wasn't for me. No, I was fine with decent grades. Obviously it sets me up great for grad school apps, but I wanted it so I didn't have to hear from them about what a waste of space I was. There's no room for criticism there.

Senior summer going into college first year was so difficult. My parents always wanted me to study, so I never worked. The assumption was that they would pay for my college, but they almost pulled out entirely. I would've been stuck with them for the rest of my life. Jesus, that's terrifying. So I used their money and took out loans freshman year, but I've promised myself since that I'll do whatever it takes to fund my own education. The only way now to do that while remaining competitive as an applicant is through scholarships, so I swear, that's what I'll do. I've already funded this year through scholarships and financial aid (which my father fills out), and I don't want another penny from them. The goal is to gain enough scholarships and earn enough money with two side jobs (while taking 19 credit hours, mind you), to fund my education and rest of my life.

What's so funny is that my father stopped working when I was 16. They hid it from me at first, but now it's a known fact. It touches at the heart of why I'm abused, and how I figured it out. He's just an unfulfilled person, stuck in his own self-delusions. He's earned enough money with a lower to mid-middle class income to sit back and watch the savings shrink for a bit, but now on the edge of four years later, we're cutting it close. And my mother came down with a big illness (that is lifelong), so that really stirred the pot.

Oh man. My favorite part of college was getting texts saying, ""hey, why don't you listen to us or call us? stop ignoring us and call every day, we worry about you"". Then I'd get on the phone and actually, two out of three calls would be civil. But every third one was a guaranteed shouting match. And my FAVORITE favorite part of college was getting texts saying ""oh by the way, your education doesn't matter. it doesn't matter how well you do. The doctors are asking your mother if she is under any stress. YOU'RE the reason she's sick now, because YOU are the cause for all our stress"".

Motherfucker, I'm hundreds of miles away.

&amp;#x200B;

ANYway....

&amp;#x200B;

I had to stay home for the summer. There's an important medical application coming around, and you need clinical experience. I literally spent every waking moment of my summer with doctors. LITERALLY. I shit you not. It's hilarious because so many people envy my depth and breadth of clinical experience. And I called maybe two hundred doctors to establish this experience, and heard maybe 198 no's. But I persevered and worked my butt off.

The biggest reason was to gain the clinical experience and learn about a profession I'm passionate about. But in the back of my mind.. ""if you don't get it, you'll be stuck at home 24/7"". And that terrified me more than anything else. So I organized a kick-ass internship that third-year medical students would die for, and woke up at 4AM every day, walked to the bus stop (bc we have one car, and I'm sure my dad would let me touch it), and took a two hour commute by public transport to reach pre-rounds by 6:15AM every day. I'd stay in the OR until 6 or 8PM, but sometimes 11PM or 1AM for an emergency case. Then I'd get up the next day at 4AM to rinse and repeat.

God dammit, that was the fucking life. I didn't have to see them, and I was getting clinical experience like no undergraduate would believe. I have an insane number of hours now, and I am so grateful for that opportunity. I actually observed some medical lectures, and grasped concepts in cadaver labs quicker than even the first-year medical students there. I was so happy about finally feeling success by my own metrics. My parents would never understand, and don't understand anymore, what I do, and so success is on my own terms now. I'm so happy about that.

But here's the thing. I can gas myself up all day long, saying ""great job for doing your best"". But so many of my friends had to work jobs over the summer or the like. Because I didn't have true obligations (though my obligation was studying and to a lesser extent, looking good for society, or risk getting my ass beat daily), I could afford the luxury of observing medicine unpaid for all of summer while my parents paid for food, housing, clothing or the like. I have these accomplishments, but I can't share them with 98% of people because they despise me for it. For doing it better than they can. But the thing is, it's not even to brag about it. It's literally just, ""oh yeah, I actually observed this awesome neurosurgery case where they were discussing the action potentials we're learning about in cell bio rn"". And then its fifty people looking at me going ""fuck you, you're the reason we fail"". LMAO bro, clean your own act up. I've made my peace with that, but it's just the hypocrisy of it, you know? Sure I've accomplished things, but it's only because I've had the privilege of having food and other standards of living provided for. I don't feel guilty about my accomplishments yet, but I am worried it might go in that direction.

&amp;#x200B;

I was so in love with my life at college. I was living my best life, and all my successes **and failures** were of my own making. I loved that. Not only was I succeeding by my own merit, but the mistakes and shortcoming I was making were of **my** own making.

&amp;#x200B;

Things are nice now bc they have nothing to say about my academics. But what really changed my mindset from questioning if the was real to showing me that it was was when I came back home to the same offensive, disgusting dialogue that I had left. On breaks, they engaged in it after a week had gone by. Now its ""studying isn't everything, go exercise, you suck"". Though maybe not that nicely. They also hit me much less, but it's really a slippery slope right now. They didn't do anything at all and yelled barely four weeks ago or in the first week of breaks, and it's all slowly increasing, just like it did on breaks

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm stuck with them at home, and I can feel myself feeling that depression I need thought I'd have to.

Once I am independent, the first thing I'll do is seek out therapy. Until then, though... this'll have to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess this is my way to share my story and ask for help. What are y'alls thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Soon-to-be 20yo college kid, quarantine at home w crazy parents. I'm a sophomore who (feels like he is) on the path to doing great things if he could live alone (not in a cocky way, but a self-encouraging way), and just is trying to cope with the idea of being stuck at home for the next four+ months, and processing the last decade+ of abuse."

g1e5cz,7,2020-04-14,The Stranger.,wulferik,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/g1e5cz/the_stranger/,"He stood alone. A dark silhouette against the street lights, an unmoving centurion of the night. Ever since my first night in this apartment, he had been waiting. 

Two weeks ago my life was a mess, a bad break up with good woman had left me disheveled in both appearance and at heart. But growing up I had had the mantra “Boys are tough, keep fighting” beaten into me by a variety of relatives. I quickly found a small apartment in the local newspaper, a charming 1 bedroom abode with oak beams running the ceiling’s length and a black iron wood stove to warm me in the deepest of winters. I counted myself lucky on many levels for finding this place, any longer sofa surfing would of lead me to a soup kitchen eventually. 

Above all else the location was perfect on the west side of Allerhurst, close to my job at the steelworks. I had finished unpacking and felt I had earned some kind of special treat, so called for a pizza takeout. As I waited for my food I busied myself with fiddling around the place, adding the final touches to my new home. I remember now in retrospect, the feeling of being watched, at the time I merely shrugged the feeling off as paranoia in a new place. I looked out the window down onto the car park, my impatience matched my hunger, and I noticed him. A man, I presumed, stood under the branches of a large evergreen, it’s lowest branches grew out long and full. I couldn’t make out his features or even the colour of his clothing, but he installed a feeling of dread in me. I thought to myself he must just be a dog walker or something, trying hard to rationalise his very existence, alas I could not. I could feel his unseen eyes, boring into my own, the dread was rising in me fast. I moved away from the window, closing the blinds in a panic.

 Sitting on the sofa my thoughts raced through scenes of horror movies, I mean this is how they all start. Slowly my logical mind broke through the turbulence of fear and paranoid thoughts, he’s probably just someone enjoying the nice night, a stargazer of sorts, I tried hard to believe my own words but my gut feeling said otherwise. A sudden banging drew me from my thoughtful abyss, “shit” I cried aloud. Standing up my knees began to knock slightly, edging my way forward to the door. “Pizza guy!” Came a voice from the other side of the wooden door, in all my fear and panic I had forgot about the pizza!
“One moment!” I shouted, fumbling around for a 20 to pay. I wrenched open the door and before me stood a young man of around 20, his black jacket and cap bore the pizzeria logo, in his hands a large red pizza box. I smiled at him, almost too happy to see him; he must of thought I was stoned. I handed the money over and was about to close the door when a question came out my mouth involuntarily, “Hey did you happen to see anybody stood outside?” I quizzed the lad. “Ummm no?” He replied with a look of uncertainty “I mean, not that I noticed anyway”. He looked at me oddly as I sighed in relief, “yeah cool, I just thought... uh never mind, have a good night!”. I decided against spouting off on a delirious rant about a man in the dark, it would most likely end in a trip to a padded cell in Allerhurst Institute for the Insane. 

I closed the door, locked it and made sure the deadbolt was in place. I now turned my attention to the 14” pepperoni pizza, I found the tv remote and turned it on. News, soap operas, a film about a bald man shooting people, all flicked past my eyes with each button press. I settled on watching the cartoons, I needed the colours and childish humour to bring me back from my dark thoughts of the night. 

11pm came around and I began to feel tired, the pizza had given me that sleepy haze often induced by large meals. Turning off the lights I grabbed a blanket and settled onto the sofa, my bed had yet to arrive and the sofa was looking more comfortable than the cold floor in my bedroom. I turned the TV down and found myself enjoying the crappy reality show on it. Under my blanket I began to get hot because the room was stuffy. I can never sleep in a warm room even as a child I always had my window wide open. I slouched off the sofa and half crawled to the window, pulled up the blinds and unlatched my window. I sat for a moment and breathed in the cold crisp air of the night, it was refreshing to feel the gentle breeze on my face. I closed my eyes to appreciate the moment, nothing beats that feeling when you are too hot to then feel a cold breeze dancing around you. 

As I opened my eyes I happened to glance down at the evergreen, my heart lurched in my chest, he was there. Still there. The man. He was stood in the exact position from hours ago! He looked as if he hadn’t moved. The pure terror from before resurfaced violently, like a shark coming from the depths to attack a swimmer. I shrunk away from the window, I could not rationally explain why I was so scared, he had done nothing in the way to threaten me, in fact he had done nothing. Maybe it was the primordial fear of the unknown, passed down the generations in the architecture of our DNA. Yes, I thought, it was the unknown aspect of the situation that gave the fear. Maybe the influence of pop culture horror too. Finding my courage I stood back up to face the unknown watcher, but he was gone. The place the silhouette had haunted now lay bare, he must of finished stargazing or whatever reason he had to be there. 

Retreating to the sofa I pulled the blankets up higher than normal, like a child haunted by the scary stories told by mischievous family members. I resolved to get some sleep, I had a busy day ahead of me. As I lay there I began a mental checklist of jobs for the next day, I was back at work in a day so it was important I sorted what needed to be sorted. As hard as I tried, the man kept perforating my subconscious mind, faceless and evil he followed me to my dreams. 

The next day a storm had blown in from the north, it’s cold grip held Allerhurst tightly. I awoke early from a disturbed sleep, feeling uneasy with the previous night’s happenings. I switched on the coffee pot, and took a shower. Coffee in hand I sat down, writing out my job list on some paper. 

First stop was a hardware store, then onto a grocery store, then the cemetery. It was coming upto the 15th of May, the anniversary of my mother’s death. Though my childhood had been swathed in abuse from some relatives, my mother had always been kind to me. She had raised me the best she could, and tried to protect me from my father’s drunken abuse. Often she herself had been the receiver of such violence that I, on more times than I care to remember, believed her dead. She had been a beautiful soul, and taken from me far too soon. 5 years had passed, the pain had of course gotten easier to carry, but at the beginning it had destroyed my world.

At around 10am I found myself looking at the wide selection of tools in the town’s DIY store. I selected a few items, including a rather big wrench. I had no real need for such a monster tool, other than to crack the skull of a hypothetical burglar. I paid and left, heading down river towards the grocers. After eating my greasy pizza the night before I felt I needed some sort of nutritious food. I settled for a pasta salad with chicken and ranch dressing, before going to the counter I grabbed a six pack of ales. I wanted to celebrate moving in, even if it was a one man party. Near the counter I found a rather beautiful bunch of flowers, they reminded me of the ones my mother grew in the garden growing up. 

The checkout girl was pretty, brown hair hung to her shoulders, deep blue eyes set like jewels on her face. A kind smile greeted me. I smiled back in a dorky, awkward manner. We exchanged pleasantries and I left the store. I looked towards the town square, watching the people of Allerhurst go about their business. I set off at a brisk pace toward the cemetery. 

Allerhurst cemetery started as a burial ground after the civil war, many soldiers were buried there in mass graves, every so often one was found by a unsuspecting landscaper or gravedigger. Usually it would then be excavated and the inhabitants relocated to a new grave with a cross to honour their efforts and existence. My mother had bought 5 plots when her mother died, after she passed she was put next to grandma. 3 plots remained and every time I came here, they reminded me of my own mortality. One day, I too would lay in the hallowed ground alongside my grandma and mother.  

I placed the flowers in the sunken vase in front of the tombstone, removing bits of litter and debris from the trees. “Hello Mom” I spoke softly, as though she was alive at my front door. I sat for a while on the bench next to her grave, and spoke to her picture from my wallet. Though from the outside I must look crazy, this was rather therapeutic for me. I could tell her all the happenings of my life, like I always had done. I had been here 2 weeks ago after my break up with Jen, I had spoken to my mother that time, and when I left I felt better in a small way.

By the time I had finished it was getting dark, as I closed the iron gates of the cemetery I looked up at the sky. The shades of pink and red made for a pretty scene, especially stretched over the landscape that surrounds Allerhurst. I made my way back home. 

The car park came into sight first, then the evergreen. I shuddered at the sight of it. But tonight there was no watcher, or as my mischievous mind put it, no axe murderer. I got to the front door and unlocked it, stepping into my hallway. Jacket hung up and it was definitely time for a coffee. I looked at the new tools I had bought, a shiny hammer with a leather handle, a set of screwdrivers and finally the big wrench. My groceries were stowed in their various homes in the kitchen and I sat down to eat the pasta salad. 

I turned the TV on and decided on the news tonight, see what’s going on in the world. The usual bait of prejudice for the racially motivated demographic, half stories reported by interns and boring sports commentary. That was a big bust, I mused. Flicking around I found some old detective show and found that more to my liking. 

Engrossed in the story, I went to take a sip of water to find it empty, cursing my stupidity I got up to refill my glass. As I walked past the window, something caught my eye, by the evergreen. The watcher. My eyes widened and I stood transfixed like a deer caught in the headlights. “What the fuck” I murmured slowly, my heart was pounding again and I could feel the anxiety building. That was it! I’m not being made to feel scared in my own home, I thought. I’d had enough of that as a kid. I walked to the window and wrenched it open, taking a deep breath I yelled “oi! You down there, stop standing in the shadows and go away! If you don’t I’ll call the cops! You fucking freak!!” That’ll show him I thought. The stranger didn’t move, nor did he yell back. Instead my ears picked up a low guttering laugh, and as it grew louder my face reddened. “I told you! Just fuck off!!” I yelled even louder, trying to make my voice some what deeper and more intimidating. The laughter stopped, silence hung in the air where it had been. The watcher made a movement, a step, backwards. And was gone from my sight, I waited in case he reappeared but he didn’t. “Ha, you got the message then! Creep” I said to myself, the petty triumph over my fear felt like a war had been won. I returned to the sofa and watched the rest of my show. 

Two weeks later and my apartment was looking like a real adult’s home. I had books on shelves, pictures on walls and even stretched to buying a throw for the sofa. The watcher had been absent from the evergreen for two weeks, but not my dreams. Every night since my ballsy shouting, he had materialised in my subconscious as a malevolent spectre haunting the fringes of reality. This didn’t truly affect me, it made sleeping less enjoyable but not so much that I couldn’t sleep. 

One Saturday morning I found myself eating breakfast in a cafe, on the old market street of Allerhurst. There were many folks about, eating plenty and drinking coffee. I had all but forgotten about the unwanted watcher for two weeks prior, and there I sat without a car in the world. I got up to go pay, the counter was a big wooden one, various cake and sandwiches on display and a coffee machine stood on the side. The wall behind was covered in a mirror. I caught a glimpse of myself, ugly bastard you, I thought. As I paid I looked back up to my reflection. Over my right should I could see out of the door into the square. Stood in the middle, near a bench, was a man dressed in a black coat and ragged jeans. He caught my attention, because I had his full attention, he stood staring at me. No I thought, he’s at least 100 yards away, I’m in a building he can’t see me. My optimism was completely false. I forced a smile at the cashier and made my exit. 

Outside I looked around but the man was gone. Literally no where to be seen, maybe he had been a figment of my imagination. I decided to walk down to the library, hoping to find a good book to lose myself in.

Back at the apartment I had settled in to a book about the occult, a study of demons and such. The dark lure of magic and demonic entities had always interested me, the stories of ancient mages and medieval witch cults. For my dinner I made a burger and fries micro meal, the extent of my culinary skills. 

I sat by the window and looked out across Allerhurst at night, the dark trees of the surrounding woodlands swayed in the chilly air, smoke rose up from various houses in the distance. I looked down at the car park, inspecting my black Volvo estate. It was a older model but ran like a dream, good mileage and fuel usage. In my peripheral vision I caught a slight movement to my right, at the evergreen. My eyes darted to focus on the source, nothing. Must of been a rodent of sorts. My eyes picked up movement again. I looked at the ground 5 feet to the right of the tree and seen the expected horror of a black silhouette against the light of the street lamp. 

The fear in me rose, but so to did the anger. How dare this creep stand there again! I raged as I opened the window,
“I told you the other week, fuck off or the police are getting involved!” 
The figure made no indication that it heard him. But then suddenly out of the silent darkness came a gnarled voice that seemed to float on its own evil wave. 
“No. But I do hope you enjoyed that drink today” it said. 
I reeled in horror, the man in black had been a real presence outside the cafe. I shrank back from the window, my hand rested on the hammer I bought earlier. “See you soon” the stranger called out to me, his sinister tone chilled my bones. I slammed the window shut, I cursed my situation as I grabbed my phone. 

The police were the only option here, a crazy dude stands outside my building all night. I dialled in 911. “911 what’s your emergency” I took a breathe and said “police please”. A connecting tone broke through the receiver.
“Police”
“Hello, I have a problem” my voice shook.
“Yes?”
“It would seem I have a fellow staring up at my window every night, just stands in the shadows. I spoke to him once and he laughed. He was even stood outside the cafe I visited the other day!” I sounded frantic even to myself. 
“We can send out a notice to officers in your area, call back if the situation escalates” came the confident response of the dispatcher. 

I thanked him and hung up, I checked the window and seen the man was still there, he was stood looking up at the apartment. I still couldn’t work out his face or any features, he was still the silhouette in the night. 

Shortly the wave of relief washed over me, blue flashing lights came from the left of me into the car park. I watched in disbelief as they stopped in the car park, got out and flashed a torch around a couple of times and got back in the cruiser. My phone rang, I looked the unknown number and prepared my complaint about the two donut chasers below me. 
“Hello?” I shaked as I spoke
“Good Evening” a growl on the other side spoke back. 
“Is this a officer from the car park?” I asked
“This is some one from the car park yes, I just need to know what number are you in, sir?” The man said, I was just about to reply when fear struck again. There was no blue light illuminating my wall or windowpanes, before the blue had bled over every reflective surface. I peered out of the window to see there was no longer a police cruiser down on the concrete. 
“What do you want?” I demanded, my voice now shaking as much as my hands, “I know who you really are!” 
A low guttural laugh rang out my phone, it’s mocking tones crushing my last shred of hope. 
“Smart one, well I won’t mess around any more. I am coming.” A mocking voice retorted “see you soon”. 
I slammed my phone down, calling 911 I began to frantically explain to the dispatcher what was going on. Half way through my pleading rant the ominous tone cut through the call, the line was dead. I tried again, the tone rang back at me almost sneering at me “dead, you’re dead, dead”. 

I slammed the phone down and picked my new hammer up. The handle felt good in my hands, the 19.99 price tag, still attached by a plastic loop, hung on the shaft. I swung it around, if I had to protect myself I would. I walked to the kitchen counter and took a swig from the bottle of scotch, Dutch courage. I sat and waited for eternity, my ears strained to pick up the smallest sound. Some where a neighbour was playing music, the bass made its way to my ears. I pushed it aside and focused deeper into the wall of sound emitted from multiple apartments. 

A shrill shriek cut through the hum of regular noises, I jumped up and readied myself. Breathing deeply I advanced to the hallway, stomping boots could be heard getting louder by the second. The wind outside had picked up, the droning noise and rustling trees. I was stood near the door when I heard it, a wheezing gravelly breathing. The floor creaked slightly under me, i mouthed a curse at the unwanted creek. 
The guttural laugh mocked me from beyond the thin wooden door.
“I hear you” said the assailant, the words spoken in a drawn out sadistic fashion. 
“You won’t get away from me son, I just need some company” it continued. 
I shuddered at the word company, sick images of being raped and murdered by some twisted silhouette. 
“The police are on the way again” I bluffed “and I have a gun!” 
“A gun?” Called out the voice
“Yeah, a big fucking gun, and if you don’t leave me be..... I’ll blast your head off” my voice faltered as I lied. 
I heard a metallic click and the voice said
“Like this?” A boom of a gun came from the otherside, I jumped away in fear. Looking back at the door I noticed a few holes around a blast centre. The hole gave me a brief view of a black jacket, it moved slightly to the left. Suddenly I found myself staring at  a pair of black eyes, surrounded by scarred skin that stretched and blistered over its skull. His mouth was just visible, it too stretched into a sinister smile. 
“Hello” he said. 


I ran, dived into the lounge, I flung myself into the big cabinet that was used for jackets and bits of crap I had long forgotten. As I shut the door a banging, cracking noise signalled my front door had given way. 

I held my breath, shaking. My right hand was  gripped on something hard, the hammer? No I had dropped that in the hallway after the gunshot. No it felt like the handle of my baseball bat, a relic of a phase I went through; determined to get into a sport to get fitter. Cake and chocolate had seen a end to that before it’d made any difference. 

I gripped it tight and brought it up to my chest, ready to swing at the man. That’s if he didn’t shoot me. The lounge door slowly opened, interrupting my train of thought, a middle aged man dressed in black, dirty clothing torn in places, walked into the room. He was holding a sawn off shotgun, it looked dirty and old. I pressed my eye to the gap, the man looked around and his cold black eyes settled on my refuge. He moved towards the door, panicking silently I needed a plan. He was by the sofa, 8 feet away, in 10 seconds I would be dead and my anus probably getting filled with psycho-man sperm. 

6feet. I had to do something, smash the door open? 

4feet. Jump out and hit him with the bat?
 
2 feet. REACT! 

I smashed hard on the door, it swung into the man and gun hard. The impact had made his trigger finger slip and the second barrel went off. 

I had no other choice, I had to kill him. I swung the aluminium plated bat down hard, each swing landed on his upper body, I could heard the thump of each swing. The bat must of made contact with his skull because the sound of skull cracking egged me on harder. A primal scream had filled my head, and the sight of the creep’s blood fed an insatiable appetite to live. 

The minutes had dragged by during the struggle, I hadn’t stopped until I knew he was dead. A sizeable pool of blood saturated the carpet around him, his mutilated face and head, swollen and bloody. The black eyes stared up at me from the eternal abyss. I dropped to the sofa crying and shaking, shock took me and I felt empty to the world around me. 

Some time later the police had cordoned my apartment off, CSI investigators combed through the scene for several hours, regular uniforms asked me to recount the twisted tale numerous times, often asking changing questions to possibly catch me out. Finally satisfied they told me they would be in touch. 

When I was allowed back into my apartment I was shocked to see the blood still soaked into my carpet, the body was long gone to the Examiners office. I decided to call the landlord in the morning, he would have to fit a new carpet. I sat by the window, staring out to space. Lights danced in my line of vision, blurred orbs in the distance. I had gone to the 24hr place a while ago and bought a 6 pack of beer and 20 cigarettes. I hadn’t smoked in 10 years, but if there was ever a good time to smoke now was it. 

I finished a smoke and opened the window more to flick out the ember, I watched it fall, tumbling in midair. The ember burnt up as it hit the ground and I noticed it landed some few meters from the cursed evergreen. I looked at the top of the tree, swaying in the gentle breeze left over from the winds of earlier. My eyes dropped their gaze down the length of the tree till I reached the bottom. 

My heart stopped. I ran cold. 

There he stood, the watcher, the centurion of nightmares. Unchanged, Undead. He stepped forwards into the light of the car park. He stood and stared up at me, transfixed in the window. That slow spreading sinister smile ran from cheek to cheek. I cried aloud and looked about me, there was nothing I could do. He stood for a minute smiling demonically, then turned on his heel and began to meander through the bushes into the darkness where he belongs. 


6 weeks passed me by, I lost my job soon after the incident of that night. I was too scared to leave my apartment most days, and when I did I was a mess. I would jump as a door opened or somebody spoke behind me. I even struggled with people smiling, in every smile I could see that same sinister, stretched smile of the stranger. I called the police about him and they gave me all the details of the man on their records, even told me where he had been cremated. But I know their John Doe and my Monster are the same, I just can’t explain how. 

Most nights he leaves me be, letting me rot and vegetate alone in my misery and paranoia. Some nights he stops by, smiling and watching my paralysis develop as I squirm under his devilish eyes. I know one day he will come back for me, and collect me. Maybe he is death, or the devil. All I know is he is attached to me by a bond stronger than stone. A bond of predator and prey. 

And there he is again. 

Smiling.

Waiting."
g1e8qo,2,2020-04-14,Chance Me - Chemistry (Mix of Schools),thatonechemstudent,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/g1e8qo/chance_me_chemistry_mix_of_schools/,"Hello, I'm planning on applying to some Chemistry programs (listed at the bottom) and was wondering if I could get some advice on my stats. (Sorry for it being so long, I have a lot to say oops)

**Demographics**:

* Female
* White (Irish, Dual-Citizen)
* Illinois, 3rd Best public high school in the state (according to US News) *(you can probably guess which one oops)*
* Upper(ish) Middle Class
* Hooks: 1st gen (American &amp; College), LGBTQ+, Female in STEM

**Intended Majors**: Depending on the university/college, it will be either Dual Major in Chemistry &amp; Physics OR Major in Chemical Physics. I *might* minor in Mathematics, depending on if I have enough time. :)

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:**

* I will be taking both the SAT and ACT, and was supposed to take the May SAT but, ya know, that didn't happen. Eventually, I will take both. I have taken multiple PSAT tests, and I typically get around 1350 (690-R&amp;W and 660-Math).
   * Note: ACTUAL SAT score is going to be higher due to the fact that will actually study for it
* I plan on taking the Chemistry and Math II SAT subject tests, and possible the US History one.

**GPA &amp; Class Rank**

* Unweighted: 3.4/4.0 GPA
* Weighted: 4.57/\~5.2 GPA
* Unfortunately, my school went away with class rank about ten years ago (big school problems)
* Note: GPA does show an upward trend over 3 years

**Coursework (AP's + Senior Year + Dual Enrollment Only Due to Length)**

*Note: I am in a Humanities based track because it allowed me to take science over math my senior year. I have taken Precalcus+ through my local community college, as seen below.* 

* Freshman Year:
   * Only 1 AP exam allowed (APHG), and I got a 5
* Sophomore Year:
   * AP's: APCSP (5) and APWH (5).
* Junior Year:
   * AP's: Chem (Dual Credit, too), US History, Lang.
* Senior Year:
   * AP's: Physics C (both), US Gov, Lit.
   * Honors: Teaching Assistant (H Chem Teacher), Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry
* Dual Enrollment
   * Precalculus, Calculus I, Calculus II, Calculus III, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Bio I &amp; II

**Extracurriculars**

* Omega Council (Freshman --&gt; Senior)
   * Basically, I work with the lead teachers of this program to plan events as well as the curriculum for the entire department. Next year I'll be basically running it.
* Student Council Executive Board (Junior &amp; Senior)
   * My school's student council was broken into 2 main groups and the Executive Board (EB), which works directly with the administration to plan events as well as oversee every class council. I was lucky enough to be EB Secretary, which then allows me to be President next year (which is 100%)
* Chess Team Manager (Junior &amp; Senior)
   * So I basically get to work with the captains, do paperwork, and work on my chess skills. I attend all tournaments and make sure that all players are in attendance.
* Science Olympiad (Junior &amp; Senior)
   * I'm in Chem Lab, Geomapping, and Experimental Design, as well as an honorary Forensics because I'm really good at chemistry oops
* Chemistry Club Founder (future, Senior)
   * I've discussed this with my AP Chem teacher and he's okay with sponsoring this club. I plan on getting it ""approved"" by the American Chemical Society (ACS) because that's kinda cool. Also, I'm going to work on combining/setting up tutoring services with this club, because I offer chemistry tutoring for my Honors Chem teacher, and I think it would be good to allow for service hours as well as a possible improvement in grades across the entire department.
* Peer Tutoring (Freshman --&gt; Senior)
   * I've done a lot of peer tutoring/essay editing for many people at my school. I'm the ""head"" of an AP chemistry group that my teacher asked me to form because some students weren't doing well on.
* Part-Time Job (end of Sophomore --&gt; Senior)
   * Laser Quest (June 2019-Feb.2020) - It was shut down by the corporation rip
   * Putting Edge (Febuary 2020-Present)

**Awards** *(In all honesty, I don't know what necessarily counts as awards, but here we go)*

* Science Olympiad awards from a local invitational *(we were unable to go to our city/state tournament due to the Coronavirus pandemic, but I would have won awards rip)*
* AP Scholar Award *(yes I have that few awards)*
* I don't know if this counts, but I created a Practice Final Exam for Chemistry that was apparently really good to my Honors Chem teacher (*also the Head of the Chem department*). I'm also currently writing a guide for AP Chem that my classmates can use (currently at 30 pages, only through with chemical kinetics).
* Omega Program Diploma
* I'll be trying for valedictorian (as it doesn't count on the highest GPA) but probably won't get it. :)
* If you have any suggestions/questions to ask that could count as awards/achievements, please do ask- I really don't know what else I can put, sorry!

**Letters of Recommendation**

* I plan on asking my sophomore honors chemistry teacher, as he's the head of the Chem department and my senior year Teacher's Assistant teacher and Biochemistry teacher. I've also started a tutoring program with him for his students, as I mentioned above.
* I'm also going to ask my freshman/senior year English teacher who is the Head of my Humanities program, which I've been on the council for since freshman year. 
* Counselor recommendation/school letter because she's known me personally since freshman year (a hard thing to do at a 4k+ person school) and will speak highly of me :D

**Other**

* I'm working on getting an internship in chemistry with a major university near me, as I really want to have experience in the lab. However, due to coronavirus, the internship program is currently on hold. 

Now onto the good stuff...

**Schools**

* Top 20's (unlikely but still why not)
   * Yale University *(considering REA but not too sure)*
   * Harvard University
   * MIT
   * Stanford
   * University of Chicago
   * Washington University in St. Louis
* Other Schools
   * The College of Wooster
   * UIUC
   * UIC *(EA for sure, if I went here I'd have enough credit to start as at least a sophomore)*
   * Loyola University at Chicago
   * UC Berkley
   * University of Colorado - Boulder
   * Boston University.

This is a pretty large list that is likely to be edited and if you have any suggested colleges, please do let me know!

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much, sorry that it was so long."
g1eq27,1,2020-04-14,Should I CR MAT137?,mat137throwawayyeet,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/g1eq27/should_i_cr_mat137/,"I am in my first year of CS. I can CR MAT137 and get a 3.9 GPA or let it stick on my resume and potentially get a 3.86 GPA.

I plan to apply for research opportunities and internships in my second year, I am worried seeing the CR might not look good on my application.

In the long run, assuming I get 4.0s in every semester, having MAT137 would reduce my overall GPA by \~0.02. It probably isn't a lot, however I am planning to apply to grad schools and I would prefer keeping my GPA as high as possible.

So should I CR MAT137?"

I was lucky enough to be accepted into Duke and Cornell for undergraduate CS, and I'm trying to decide which to attend. My friend is trying to convince me to go to Duke, saying that Cornell's superior CS ranking is partially due to a better graduate program, which I currently don't plan on pursuing, that the Ivy title of Cornell doesn't hold that much weight since Cornell is the worst Ivy, and that therefore Duke's CS opportunities in terms of internships, interviews, job hunting, etc. are about equal to Cornell's due to the tech triangle. I'm having a hard time believing him, is this true?"
g1g6r9,1,2020-04-14,Guess a senior's results and you could get a prize - Low income Asian male math major!,mansnothotdoe,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/g1g6r9/guess_a_seniors_results_and_you_could_get_a_prize/,"Here we go!!! LOL... Let's see how y'all do...

**BASIC INFO**

State: TX

Highschool: One of the best in the area, very competitive and large class size, public however

Income: $40k fam of 4 - qualified for questbridge and became a **questbridge finalist**

Major: Mathematics/Statistics, which specific one depended on the schools, but it shouldn't make a huge difference. If they had statistics available, I chose it, but if they didn't i was fine with math.

Race: Asian male (brown)

**ACADEMIC STATS**

Gpa: 3.8 UW, 4.4 W; All As and Bs in a tough rigor. APs included WHAP, AP chem, AP Spanish, AP lang, then senior year AP calc BC, AP lit, AP macro, ap gov, ap bio. Scores were 4,3,3,5 for the first 4.

Rank: 108/813. Explained that part of the reason for my low rank was because of activities such as orchestra and dental science that dropped my weighted gpa heavily. Without them I'd have been top 10%.

SAT: 1540 (750 R/790M) single sitting, 2nd try

Subject Tests: 750 M2, 700 chem (lmao)

**EXTRACURRICULARS**

1. Journalist on an internationally recognized newspaper, featured on Apple and Google News, that has collected over 1 million visitors. My most popular article received over 50,000. The topic of this newspaper is technology and data science.

2. Statistics Research with a professor at a local college. We looked at the versatility of statistics in the field of weather and biology, and I learned how to create statistical models that show trends we identified in the weather and biology on GNU Octave and PPLane.
 
3. Summer journalism research/mentorship program with 2 college professors. Learned about journalism and composition to strengthen my skills in that field.

4. Founder of school club that merges the influence of STEM with the humanities; through inviting guest speakers from stem positions to share how the humanities influence their field, to discussing news articles of stem events in seminar settings, and creating a blog for the students in my school to write about STEM in the world.

5. TSA. Official reporter of my school's chapter, state qualifier in essays on technology.

6. Internship during senior year at an international engineering classification society. Work on the digital solutions team coding and designing material for the office using Python. 

7. McDonalds crew member. Serve and prepare food, take orders in drive thru and in person, communicate in Spanish constantly in a quick, fast paced environment.

8. Taking care of mother who had mental health issues and was enrolled in a mental hospital twice over my childhood

**ESSAYS / LOR / THE SUBJECTIVE STUFF**

I thought my essays were pretty good. My main one/common app or for questbridge was about discovering my passion for statistics and my culture. I used an extended metaphor through the entire essay going from experiencing weddings in my Punjabi culture and in weddings we used to bring food to collect in a pot, and that my personality was a pot but I was missing my own ingredients, until I found math, and I described math as like a food saying ""those numbers had such an intricate and powerful taste in my pot they became something i was recognized by"" and "" a numbers ability to impact different parts of the world was something i was envious of and wanted to incorporate in my own human self"".

My LORs were also good ( i think ? ) i had one from my precal teacher and I got As in her class and talked to her about calculus a lot. I had another from my dentistry teacher who even though knew I wasn't going to pursue dentistry helped me find my interest in numbers. And then I had 2 more. 1 from my summer journalism professor (who is a great writer probs was really good) and one from my statistics research professor. 

And as i mentioned, my mother also had mental disabilities which i mentioned, and to explain my lower rank i did add my enrollment in the dentistry courses and orchestra and *my counselor also mentioned those things on her LOR.*

Was also a **QB finalist &amp; QB prep scholar** if u know what that means.

**SCHOOLS I APPLIED TO**

Northwestern, Rice, Vanderbilt, Emory, UT Austin, Grinell, Macalster, U Chicago, Duke, Columbia, Washu, Swarthmore, Colby, Davidson, Notre Dame, Bowdoin, Amherst, Vassar, Princeton, USC. 

Any more information lmk!!!"
g1gmwc,1,2020-04-14,3-letter agency or small company?,Jayydoodle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g1gmwc/3letter_agency_or_small_company/,"Hello all, I really need some advice.  I'm a Comp Sci major graduating this May and have been interning with a small company (around 30 employees) since November.  At the same time I've been in the process of being cleared to work at one of the 3-letter agencies in Washington DC.

I haven't gotten a final offer from the agency yet ( technically hired, but dependent on the outcome of the clearance investigation), but the company I work for currently offered me a job at $60k back in January.  I told them I wouldn't be ready to make a decision until closer to graduation (due to the competing offer) and have continued working as an intern.

Fast forward to today - the company sent an email saying they really like the work that I've been doing and have now upped their offer to $75k.

I'm very temped to accept this offer, as it really is an awesome company to work for.  It's in my hometown, I like the work that I'm doing, and I'm generally happy where I am.  However I still can't quite shake the allure of working for the agency and wondering what benefits having that experience on my resume may provide me with in the future (not to mention the clearance).

There's also the not really knowing the timeline of everything with the government position due to Coronavirus and what not.

What would you do in my shoes?"

Hello Guys,

I have currently finished the college admission process and have been left with the following choices.

\*Note: Cost is not a factor for me, California Resident

UW (CS-Direct Admit)

Georgia Tech(CS)

UIUC (CS- Grainger college of engineering)

Obviously, due to the Corona, all the admitted day events have been canceled, therefore I'm coming to you guys to feel the vibe of the CS department here.

Here are some of my questions:

How cutthroat are the classes? (competitive or collaborative) graded on a curve? Grade deflation/inflation?

Are internships opportunities readily available? How are the career planning resources/ career fairs?

Additionally, how wide is the research scene? Is it more undergrad/postgrad focused and how easy is it to get involved (competitive or not)?

How hard is it to get the classes u want. I know that in some UC's due to a large student body, it occasionally takes more than 4 years to graduate due to the limited number of classes, Is this the case with UIUC (especially the cs major required classes)?

How is the overall social scene on campus? Dining Halls? Things to do on campus and in the area?

Additionally, if you have had experience with or friends go to any of the other schools on my list, how would u compare the UIUC CS department to them? In terms of the stuff I mentioned in my other questions

I know I asked a lot, but any info would really be helpful in choosing my future for the next 4 years.

Thanks again"

I'm doing a part-time unpaid internship right now, I'm working on side projects and I plan on doing an internship over the summer. I was born and raised in NYC, and I really don't want to have to relocate anywhere else. I've been researching the job market for software engineers in New York and, from what I gather, it's brutally difficult to land a job. I've been reading horror stories about people with 2 or 3 internships having to settle for a 50k/year job because the competition really is astronomical. During my internship search, I've only gotten responses from startups offering unpaid internships, despite having applied to hundreds of companies and micro-optimizing my resume. It's not uncommon for a company to receive thousands of applications within the first 12 hours of an internship being posted. I've heard it gets better once you have a few years of professional experience under your belt, but not by much. Anyway, I've been stressing myself out over this. I'd really appreciate some feedback on your guys' NYC job search experiences, both as a new-grad and as a more experienced developer.

EDIT: I forgot to include that I'm not a superstar engineer, so getting a job at FAANG/Bloomberg/Goldman Sachs/&lt;insert competitive company here&gt; is mostly a stretch. I'll be applying for jobs at all kinds of companies, from big Ns to no-name startups, but I'm not too hopeful I'll be able to pass an interview at a big N."

I need all the support I can get.,throwaway_filmsui,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g1m9al/please_convince_me_not_to_kill_myself_im/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Please read my story and tell me something that will make me want to live.

I am a film business student undergrad in his mid-to-late 20s. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type-1 at age 13 and have experienced manic delusions and crippling psychotic depression. I have been under the care of psychiatrists ever since. I have responded well to mood stabilizers, effectively eliminating mania from my life, and also responded pretty well to Zoloft. My depression was manageable through high school and community college.

When I was 22, I transferred to a 4-year university, rented an apartment off-campus, and was pretty much immediately hospitalized for the first time for severe depression and substance abuse. I was going through a ""mixed episode"" -- mania and depression at the same time. Things had never been this bad. At the hospital it was determined that my high dose of Zoloft was causing mania, and I was told bipolar patients shouldn't take SSRIs or SNRIs. That was the last time I ever took an antidepressant. Upon release, I felt somewhat better, but later that year I was again experiencing strong suicidal ideations. I enrolled at a ketamine clinic and over the course of over a year received monthly IV infusions which kept the depression manageable.

Eventually, ketamine lost its efficacy for me, so I stopped paying the $400 fee to go every month. I battled bouts of severe depression, often taking medical leaves from school, while living alone about 100 miles away from my family.

I hated myself for being old and still an undergrad, with no industry experience or internships or anything that would get me in the door.

Suddenly, things started to change. I started an aggressive round of TMS with my psychiatrist (36 sessions of 7000 pulses each) that moderately helped my day-to-day depression. I took a volunteer position at my city's international film festival, got into some parties, and met some super important people. They hinted they wanted me as an intern in 2020. I also landed a volunteer position screening films for a smaller film festival in my city. I was on track to graduate in Fall 2021, secure a great internship, and was already planning my senior project, which was to involve a ""mini film festival"" at my college with special guests. For the first time in SEVERAL YEARS I was looking forward to living my life.

Enter. The. Fucking. Coronavirus.

Everything comes to a screeching halt. Classes are moved online. The film festival I'm working on is canceled. The film festival I was going to be interning with is canceled. Social distancing is enacted, which is TERRIBLE for me -- socialization, no matter how hard it is to initiate, is a big weapon against my depression. My girlfriend and I, our relationship already rocky, decide to separate emotionally as well ""until further notice."" I am utterly alone. I'm reading articles that large gatherings -- like concerts, sporting events, and film screenings -- won't return until Fall 2021. I was supposed to graduate by then, with a film internship under my belt, and run a senior project based on film screenings that I have been planning for over a year. There's no guarantee the film industry, as it is now, will even survive this pandemic: the festival I was already working on had a microbudget of something like $2000 and no one on staff was paid. The festival I was supposed to intern with was run by a non-profit organization. Independent film is not a lucrative business.

Now, I feel I have nothing to live for. My entire near-future life plan, which has been a tool against my depression, has suddenly gone up in flames. Now I am dreaming of killing myself every night. I am currently building a plan to do so and researching ways to buy firearms. I saw a report on CNN tonight -- possible social distancing until 2022? There's no fucking way I'm going to survive this. No. Fucking. Way.

Give me a reason not to kill myself. I want to live. I want to achieve my goals. But my goals have abandoned me, much like most of this country has been abandoned by their jobs and income. Writing this, I feel like I almost sound privileged -- at least I have a roof over my head, have food, and am not being domestically abused -- but this is my mental illness, it's been here for well over a decade, it's never going away, and the Coronavirus just laughed and stomped on me right as I was winning the battle.

Right now, I don't see a way out of my situation. Maybe I'll graduate on-time with online classes, but that's assuming I'm well enough to even do the work (I have taken 3 medical leaves due to my condition). But this still means I'm going to literally be alone until a vaccine is created, unable to form new friendships or romantic relationships, unable to work on anything that excites me. The thought is excruciating. My depression is laughing in my face right now, urging me to buy a gun, put it in my mouth, and pull the fucking trigger.

And that's exactly what I'll do if something doesn't change.

Thank you for reading."

Does 0.5% stock options mean anything after several rounds of funding?
Is 70k too low of a salary for the San Diego, CA area?

Should I continually apply if I am not happy with the pay? (The problem with this is, I'm dreading the interview process and also shifting to a new place getting to learn their stack etc, will take a while, over here I'm settled in)

To those with experience/ been in my situation, how hard is it generally to transition from one 'software engineering' job to another? because I feel the shitty stack my firm uses isn't that popular.

I have searched quite a long time on the internet to find out how the calculations behind this works but i haven't had any luck so far(especially in the part with combining the op amps and transistors). Also the article i got this from only describes and explaines the error ratio with no actual calculations of the sort (that are of use to me), so i hope one of you great people can explain this to me so i can hopefully get this project back on the rails. Since i ofcourse have to prove the calculations to school.

Little bit of info about the project. (My english isn't perfect so some sentences might be badly written)
The project is to make a testing setup for the Siemens Sipart PS2 line of products, the location i am doing my final internship wants a setup like this to test said product because these come in about twice or three times a month for repairs. Now the setting of the valve is based on the input for these devices, so 4mA is closed and 20mA would be fully open. I want this voltage to current converter so that i can use an arduino with DAC to control it and have an easy way for automatic prolonged testing on a relatively low budget.

Once again i hope you all can help me, thanks in advance."

I'm 3rd year CS student, I took 5 courses in Java (Intro, OOP, DS1, DS2, advanced programming), a course in Vanilla JavaScript (front end web dev) and a course in Unity and C# (game dev) but I feel like I can't actually use any of them, and barely remember anything (in 3rd year we don't take programming courses but do database so I remember SQL).

I took a Udemy course that compared Js frameworks (Angular, Vue, React) and did the course work (assignments and practice) but I wouldn't put them on my resume yet.

I used CodingBat and did a lot of Java exercises.

I tried Python last summer and I'm currently taking an intro to AI course that uses Python.

 I never did a summer internship (we intern after 3rd year here) but with the pandemic I'll probably not have one, I planned to work part time next year until I graduate but with no internship, the job hunt might be harder.

I didn't find remote/virtual internship opportunities and I don't know how they work, If anybody has tried them, give me your insight.

I’m on my last year of university and also currently on an internship in a big company, it pays quite well and has lots of benefits, but I’m extremely unhappy with it. 

In my country I gotta intern for 1 full year (jan / dec) in order to graduate. I started my internship in january and ever since the first day I felt like I made the wring decision about where to intern, since I had other options but this company was way bigger than the others.

I’m interning in an area very different from what I study, so I have a lot of difficulties while doing almost everything. They never have enough time to teach me things (mostly are 3 minutes showing me things on the computer and that’s it) so I have to keep asking them and I feel like, by doing that, I actually bother them and prevent them from doing their jobs quicker. Most things I learned so far were by myself, on the internet, but not everything I have to know is online.

I don’t enjoy what I do, mainly programming, and I’m not really that good with it as my study field don’t require a lot of it. 

My bosses are good with clients, but they lack technical knowledge so sometimes they ask for unrealistic things and deadlines. Most times they give me tasks that I have no idea how to do and deadlines that are very tight. I’m always doing extra hours even though I’m not allowed by law and I don’t get paid for it. Sometime they give me multiple things to do at the same time.
Most tasks I’ve done so far were actually tasks meant to be for the analysts in the area, but they just threw at me because my bosses tend to seal contracts before even thinking about who could do the project in time and my team is extremely busy all the time.

Now with the coronavirus, the situation is much worse because we’re working from home and it became even more complicated to do things because of poor communication and slower connections, but no one seems to care. 

Right now I’m in my third month and I’m actually suffering from anxiety crisis everyday because of my internship. I feel pressured to perform like the people in my team yet I don’t have the knowledge, the experience and I’m only an intern. I feel extremely dumb all the time. 
I hate waking up because I remember I got to work, I have nightmares about work related stuff, I’m skipping meals because of it ... Also I’m working so much I end up not having time to study for the few subjects I have left in my last year of uni.

I can’t quit it before I’ve got another internship confirmed because I need it to graduate and I also need the money, but I don’t know if I should just suck it up and hold it for a full year or if I should apply for other opportunities (I looked up and there were a few open for the second half of the year). A part of me thinks it’s way too soon to quit, as I’ve only been working for 3 months and that I have a lot more to learn, but another part thinks I’m only harming my mental health and that I could be at a better work environment. 

I just don’t know what to do"

g1raht,2,2020-04-15,Ever been stuck on a CS problem? Here's how you can overcome them.,Akter8,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/g1raht/ever_been_stuck_on_a_cs_problem_heres_how_you_can/,"Hey everyone, I hope you are safe and healthy during the virus crisis.

Have you ever been stuck on a CS-related problem and could not overcome it no matter how much time you put in? It could be anything from a bug you have not been able to fix in a pet project of yours to a homework assignment in one of your courses to a bug you have been trying to fix in one of your internships.

I am a junior in CS in one of India's top universities with a much harder CS program than average, so trust me, I have worked on several problems that most CS undergrads would consider as hard. And, over these last 3 years, I have come across multiple problems in which I have spent several days working on (including all three examples listed above). Of course, trying hard, putting your brain into it is very important, without which guaranteed you will not be able to overcome relatively harder problems. But at times, no matter how much effort you put into solving the problem, you sometimes might end up with almost zero progress. You start self-doubting yourself, doubting your code, etc. And this only worsens the problem. A good method I have found to overcome this is to completely forget about the problem for a while. Take a break man! Go hang out with your friends for a while, have a good meal or go take a good dump (yes, even this helps). But make sure you don't think too much about the problem while taking this break, that would defeat the entire purpose of this break. You have been working your brain at max frequency for a few hours now, cool your brain down and this would help in you seeing things from a different perspective and gives you more motivation to solve it. And some times all you need is a different perspective.

Try out different types of breaks, an exercise, or a lazing around one, or just taking a nap, or listening to your favourite music. Find out what kind of break helps you as a person more.

Now that the internship season is starting, I thought this might help in your internship.

So the next time you come across such a problem, maybe you can try taking a break and then thank me later. Do you guys have any other such tricks that would help? I would love to know and implement them and try them out for myself."

I was able to get data for UCL, but have struggled to find contacts/data for UofT. I really appreciate the insight.

 How hard is it to get Internships as an international student?  


Where do people generally go for their internships?  


What is the range of internship pay?  


What is the course like? Difficulty? Focus on practical? How much free time? How are the profs generally?  


CS related perks of Toronto? Closeby companies? Does UfT have a strong alumni connection in the city?  


Where do people generally work after graduating from UfT with a CS degree? (What companies/fields etc.)  


What is FLC (I have a general idea from the UofT website but idk its reputation within the uni)? Is it useful?  


How time intensive is CS? Would I have enough time to join 1 CS related club/society and 1 sports related club/society?"

Like many college graduates, I have been having severe difficulties landing any sort of job related to my field despite having internships and proven experience under my belt. Out of the countless applications I've put out, I've only been offered two interviews, one of which was cancelled at the last minute and then was told the position got filled, the other got to the final round of interviews but then was ghosted. Here's all that I've tried:

* I've sought advice on my resume and cover letter from numerous people, both inside and outside my field. One person's advice will often contradict another's. Get told hundreds of times my experience is good, I just need to word it better. Re-written resume and cover letter countless times, still don't see any improvements.
* I do have a linkedin and tried reaching out to recruiters at companies, maybe I'll get a response, but every time I've been eventually ghosted.
* Tried applying various companies and industries (live in DC area), since my education is so broad, but still don't hear back from anything.
* Reached out to my old internship company, said they were downgrading and had to let people go so they couldn't offer me anything. Said they would recommend me around, still haven't heard anything.
* Asked friends and former classmates if their companies were hiring, passed along my resume, still haven't heard anything.
* Tried a few networking events, never had much time to go to these because tied down at family business, still never heard back from any of the companies I spoke to.
* Any chance I get rejected via an actual person instead of an automated email, I always ask them why I got rejected. Obviously I word it better than that, but each time they don't tell me anything. I know legally they can't tell me anything, but it sure would be nice to know why I keep getting rejected.

I just don't know what else to do now. I feel like I've tried everything but nothing is working. I've been consistently told it's ""just a numbers game"" and to be honest I'm getting tired of hearing that. What's the point of constantly applying for jobs, getting ghosted or rejected, not knowing what you're doing wrong, and then doing it all over again. And now with this pandemic and looming recession, I feel that my chances of landing a job are even slimmer.

I don't know what to do anymore and I feel absolutely hopeless about the future."

I have been researching different colleges, programs, internships, and study abroad programs so much that I just feel burnt out. A semester ago, heel, two months ago, I was excited about college. And now I'm not. The thought of just going sends a feeling of dread coursing through me because there is so much I don't know. I want to go into school as a business major, and CSUF seems to be the best option, but it doesn't excite me. And frankly, I want to be happy. I'm tired of always looking at 'later'. All through high school, I thought of reaching my goal and being happier later. 

Once I'm in college, I'll be able to do xyz.

Once I'm in college, I'll be happier. 

Once I'm in college, I'll be super successful.

I'm just so freaking exhausted of thinking and wondering about the future. There is this one school that I am considering, but it doesn't have the internships I am specifically looking for, but it does have other opportunities. And honestly, I'm not even sure if I want to do business. I imagine myself in a tall building, wearing formal attire, working hard, and being this perfect, sophisticated version of myself. I feel that I would seriously enjoy managing and working, but the actual school part leaves me feeling hopeless. Business classes seem boring to me, and I don't want a repeat of high school where I take all classes that I don't enjoy just because I have to. I love learning, and I want to continue loving it throughout my college years except I don't even know what the hell I want to study for sure anymore. I believe that it is business which is why I am looking at all the opportunities that are involved with business, but what if all my work is futile? What if I end up doing something that has nothing to do with business and the school (UCR) just doesn't have a specialty in it or later on, I don't find a good job? 

I want to be stable later on. I want a good-paying job, and to sometimes travel in my work, and honestly, I think I just need someone to tell me its okay. My parents don't comfort or help me out with this at all and are just leaving everything up to me. And while I appreciate it, I just feel so very lost right now."

Since then I have been working on different things, but also on trying to get a job as an engineer/engineering technologist. I have applied to at least 12 jobs by now and I have gotten one job interview with rejection, one phone interview and haven't heard back from the company, and this morning I got a reply back from an internship I applied to saying that they won't move on to the next step with me.

I'm obviously messing up somewhere with my resume. I must be messing up with the actual interviews too. I have been practicing with interviews at home and even managed to find someone from the university to coach me with how to answer certain interview questions.

I would like to find someone on here to volunteer to review my resume. I have gotten two reviews from two different people so far. However, they are older gentlemen that haven't applied to current jobs in years because they have been in their professions for a long time. Sometimes competition gets tougher and job requirements change. I would like to get someone who is a bit younger to help me. Someone who gets a better idea of what recruiters look for works too.

Thanks in advance! I can send my resume through email later on.

g1xg6a,0,2020-04-15,Where to go from here?,RagerOperations,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g1xg6a/where_to_go_from_here/,"I'm not sure where exactly to go from here and I guess what I'd like to ask anyone willing to give me their 2 cents is; what kind of path should I follow?

First: I didn't go to college. I didn't try in high school and obviously learned a bit too late about life and long story short I don't have money to go to college. I'm going to be 24 this year, in a couple of months and moved out of my parents.

Second: I have a genuine interest in tech and cs, so I started learning as a hobby not for money, however I'm very interested in money.

I've been learning how to program for about a year now. I started learning Python and learned OOP but never delved into data structures and algorithms. 

Around this time I decided that maybe I could get a job in tech as it pays well, doesn't necessarily require a degree, and I have a passion for it. I started learning how to use GCP as I figured this might increase my chances of being hired somewhere, anywhere. I got far enough that I was ready to take the Associate Architect Solution cert test but got a dose of impostor syndrome and I got cold feet. Plus the 150$ fee would have been a bit of a struggle so I didn't take it. I'm not sure how good that would be on my resume...

I was also thinking about getting an AWS certification as well, but I'm just not sure how to go about getting a job with these certifications. Can anyone elaborate how this could help me or leverage it to my advantage?

After this, I decided to get into web development and built a couple generic websites using pure HTML/CSS. I started learning javascript and then an I.T. position opened at the company I was working for and they gave me a shot. (I was working in a lab before this as a junior lab tech. Which was another position I wasn't qualified for.) They gave me a 1 month probation with no promises and I was satisfactory so they kept me on. My supervisor likes me and has let me know that when I'm ready to apply to other positions be it I.T. or as a developer he'd have my back as a reference. I told him I would continue studying until I was ready which could take years so I'm not sure about that timeline. 

The current I.T. position I work at is at a small company so we wear a lot of hats. I'm mostly doing help desk but my supervisor gets assigned software projects and whenever I'm not busy he shows me data basing and work projects as well as his personal projects. This company operates on everything Microsoft so C#, Windows, etc. So suffice to say, I stopped working on web development and python so that I can eventually help my supervisor build projects.

Since I wasn't really 'qualified' for this position I'm not getting paid that much and I'm basically an intern even though I have a full I.T. title so I just want to use this as experience and move on as soon as I'm ready. The problem is, I don't know when I'll be ready and since I've done so much I'm not sure what to focus on.

Will I be I.T. forever? How hard is getting another I.T. job with no degree? How hard is it to move from this position to full dev (C# / Python / I can learn any language)? Or maybe how hard would it be to become a cloud architect from I.T.? 

For the most part I'm interested in working for Microsoft, but I can tell I'm a long way from being able to get hired there. I'm just not sure where to go from here or what skills to build. I appreciate any input.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I know Python, C#, HTML, CSS, GCP at an intermediate or basic level. I'm currently I.T. with no degree. What kind of job path is realistic for me or will I not be able to get a job somewhere after this position?"

Some details on my background: EU citizen (Germany), BoS CS degree from a C-tier university. Worked 1 year as a developer, 3 years as a senior developer and currently  2,5 years as a software architect at a medium-size company in Germany. So \~7 years total, not including internships. I have a polished Github account, made some minor contributions to some popular libraries in the Python ecosystem. I'd also say that i have pretty good self-promotion skills and can keep a conversation flowing.

I am looking to relocate to Zurich this year. My main goal is to maximize disposable income for investments, but also i would enjoy a change of scenery - i already spent a week there last year and enjoyed it.

Here are some questions i have. I hope to get your thoughts on and maybe some insights from swiss locals:

1. I am aiming for a position like lead developer, software architect, team lead or similar and seeking a minimum annual salary of 150k CHF (preferably closer to 160/165k CHF). Does that sound doable with my experience?
2. I am currently based in southern Germany (Stuttgart region), so i can easily get to Zurich in 2-3 hours. Would there be any advantage in moving to Zurich beforehand to have a higher chance of getting interviews just by the fact of me already being in town?
3. Whats the work culture at the big financial firms e.g. Credit Suisse, UBS, Zurich Insurance etc.? Is it as bad as its reputation? Also what is the salary range there for someone with my experience?
4. Google Zurich, probably considered the crown jewel by many. From what i heard the interview is brutal and i am pretty bad at algorithms and data structure puzzles. Is there any point in just being straightforward and telling them that i suck at algorithms and rather see my strength in application architecture, clean design patterns etc.?
5. Any other firms that i should check out besides the financial firms an Google?"

My major is 2 years, mostly starts of with business courses which are alright. The problem lies in the more technical classes which are garbage to be blunt. The professors mostly care about collecting a paycheck, have poor teaching skills, and most have quit since I've started. As a result, I ended up hating the web development and computer science side. This was further confirmed when I began looking for internships and noticed I didn't like that kind of a work culture.

By the time I realized how awful my major was, it was too late. Unfortunately I don't have a family I can rely on if life doesn't work out. So far I've stayed positive because my long term goal was still achievable.

**I'm graduating next month and tbh I feel my problems are building**. I don't have enough skills for the entry level tech jobs. On top of that the high overall uncertainty killed alot job opportunities I had.

**I have no idea what jobs to apply for the next 1 to 2 years. I've always wanted to spend more time learning UX but I should I even bother when I need job stability? Why is anyone trying to find work in a less stable industries with this pandemic?**

I have a year left on my parents insurance, then who knows what I'll have. **My parents are suggesting Government work to get the benefits. Problem is following their life advice before led me to spending way to many years in a major I hated  (nursing) when I could have majored in graphic design.** My God I'm always seeing job openings for graphic design, even now.

If I have the time after college, I'd love to make my own art to satisfy my creative side. Someone also mentioned 1000 fans which could help me live a comfortable life. I'm skeptical but wouldn't hurt to look into it. In the meantime temp jobs like data entry is hopefully something I can get. I've always preferred apprentice jobs because I learn more by doing

**I just worry because there's nothing that makes me more miserable than working with people I hate, the healthcare/tech industry, and this cursed pandemic. What I do love are comics, art, basically anything creative and sustainable or companies that care about giving back.**

**Goals before the pandemic:** graduate, take the least soul crushing job while learning UX, make, share, and sell art, network, find UX job, be happy

**Goals during the pandemic:** graduate, find any job some how, .....make art to keep myself sane, figure out future....

**But still I'm not sure what to do. Should I plan my future for stability or give myself a chance to follow my dream?**"

Since then I have been working on different things, but also on trying to get a job as an engineer/engineering technologist. I have applied to at least 12 jobs by now and I have gotten one job interview with rejection, one phone interview and haven't heard back from the company, and this morning I got a reply back from an internship I applied to saying that they won't move on to the next step with me.

I'm obviously messing up somewhere with my resume. I must be messing up with the actual interviews too. I have been practicing with interviews at home and even managed to find someone from the university to coach me with how to answer certain interview questions.

I would like to find someone on here to volunteer to review my resume. I have gotten two reviews from two different people so far. However, they are older gentlemen that haven't applied to current jobs in years because they have been in their professions for a long time. Sometimes competition gets tougher and job requirements change. I would like to get someone who is a bit younger to help me. Someone who gets a better idea of what recruiters look for works too.

Edit: I have added a snapshot of the resume but I don't know if the letters will show up.

I got an A in 2110 last semester and I think I can get an A- in 2800 to meet the requirement, but would there be a benefit/drawback to taking algo before 3110?

If I end up going with algo, since my application to affiliate to CS won't be processed until the end of the semester, do you think I'd be able to get into the class over the summer? Should I enroll in 3110 as well just in case and then drop it if I get into algo?"

Due to the fallout of Covid-19, I think conducting independent consulting will be my alternative over securing an internship for the summer. 

I have a strong background in automating back office functions, large scale data analysis, and web scraping. I have also been doing a lot of back end development for the past couple of weeks but I am not confident enough to charge people money for that. Since my background is in finance, I can also do analysis work, create financial models, generate pitch decks and ect. 

How should I advertise my services and what do you guys think I should charge? Is this the best way to spend my summer?

Background:

\- Sophomore finance major at large state school in Texas

\- Current SWE intern at a fintech firm 

\- Have been coding exclusively in Python and its various packages &amp; libraries"

I have some experience in Python (trying to relearn most of it right now) since I saw GitHub is a good place to start on personal projects. However, compared to basically all personal projects I've seen posted around resumes, I feel like my experience is incomparably small and basically worthless to what I've seen other people complete (full on GUI programs, people who've run servers, etc).

I completely sucked big time at being an ELT teacher in Middle school. Way harder than I'd ever like to admit. Living in Mexico doesn't helped me, either.  I was very excited of doing my internship in the same middle school from where I graduated from out of nostalgy (and also because it's near home), but with the large ammount of students I was assigned to work with ( 3 groups which roughly ammounted 60 something teenagers), my feeble self-confidence, the stress of preparing weekly lesson plans with tons of activities I didn't have a clue where to start from, and finishing my dissertation thesis, I almost got beyond my breaking point, if not I already got past it. The relationship I had with my students was akward for most of the time, if not outright tense, all because of my anxiety. I just felt like a fish out of water teaching English to these guys. All the three groups were (at least for me) very difficult to work with. Most of this guys just didn't bothered themselves with bringing their coursebooks or even their notebooks, they didn't give a damn about learning English and were just plain difficult to motivate. Most of all these guys just didn't take me seriously as a teacher because of mediocre classroom management and how boring my classes were. Shortly after, I started to become the nagging, yelling teacher who nobody liked. They could tell I  didn't want to stay with them as much they as didn't want to stay with me. Even though there was a point at which I genuinelly started to hate this teens, I realized how unfair it was for them to have such a crappy and troubled English teacher. Before I snapped at them, I decided to cancel my internship in order to do it again next semester... until this covid-19 pandemics went haywire.

If it were for me, I would've have cancelled the whole semester altogether. The only reasons why I didn't do so were because I already paid for the graduation party contract (which can't be cancelled, much less refunded), and that one teacher and the academic coordinator both talked me out of dropping out of the career.

After all of this, I just don't feel compelled enough to finish the stupid thesis and I don't want ot fucking know about teaching ever again in my life. I don't want to be a teacher anymore. Not with with kids, nor teens, nor other adults, nor someone else. Ever since I got admitted at that school I knew deep inside that I was studying ELT more for the English than for the teaching. I ended up there because my English proficiency is at least decent, and because I previously dropped out of the biochemistry career. I had to do something with my life, but now I realize that what I wanted for my life to be is not what I even wanted to begin with. I don't fucking know what I want to do with my life anymore. At this point I might just die. Ever since all of this happened I haven't stopped thinking about killing myself even though I know I wouldn't do it if I were given the opportunity to do so right now. I've already tried before. None of them worked. The only way I'd ever bring me to kill myself would be with a gun or morphine, because if there's one thing that I dread more than failure is pain. Seeing at how my life has become a failure due to my worst-than-poor frustration and stress management makes me ask myself why do I even bother to keep living any longEr in a time where stress and being under pressure is the rule.  Is it because I still hope for better? At least if you gave me a revolver with one bullet, I'd roll the barrel just to see  how lucky I'd be to be alive again. I'm just hoping for the worst: to fail the thesis, fail the career and drop out of school, and yet I dread all of that so much I still want to change things in spite of how late it has already gotten.

I completelly akcnowledge how screwed-up my head is right now and that I'm not thinking logically. I'm sure that really deep down I don't want to die yet. I just wanted to get all of this out my chest. If you've been or are currently in the same spot as myself, I'd like to listen to your advice."

I am currently a senior in  Houston &amp; am really stuck between UT Austin (McCombs as an unspecified business major &amp; Plan II) and NYU Stern (Business Economics, would like to double-major/minor in Public Policy). I would really appreciate any input! :)

For background, I am very interested in a track that involves studying public policy &amp; law school after graduation. I'm definitely intrigued by more liberal arts-style curricula and not so much by a career in IB/finance/etc. Here are some things I really like/dislike about each school, in order of importance:

UT

Pros

\- Affordable (!!!!) - especially if I eventually go to law school; NYU ends up being 2-3x more expensive every year

\- My ideal campus and vibrant campus culture

\- Plan II curriculum is so cool

\- Know a lot more people going there (also a con)

\- Probably easier to get a higher GPA for law school admissions

\- Way more AP credits accepted

Cons 

\- Probably not as much opportunity for recruitment, especially outside of Texas (pls lmk if this is true or not lol)

\- Don’t like being in massive classes (but I feel like having Plan II mixed in makes up for this)

&amp;#x200B;

NYU

Pros

\- NYC!!! obviously

\- More job/year-round internship opportunities 

\- Small class sizes  

\- Will feel more like a fresh start than staying in TX

\- More prestige (want to appease my Asian parents)

\- Tons of study abroad 

Cons

\- Generally worried about social life (I'm pretty introverted lol)

\- Very expensive - my parents are happy to pay for it but it’s so $$$

\- Feel like super pre-professional/Wall Street-focused Stern culture might not be for me

\- Feel like I'll miss out on the typical college campus experience

March 25th - They ask me for a second interview

March 27th - Phone Interview #2

April 7th - I sent a follow up email

Today, April 16th - NO REPLY!

Is this normal? It's been 20 days and still no reply. Does it take that long to choose interns or did I just not get it and they don't send rejection letters? Should I call the office? I do not know what to do, but I really want this internship and I thought the interviews went really well!"

My background: I have a Bachelor's in Mathematics with a Minor in Physics, graduated May 2019. I am currently an Information Technology Intern. The most coding experience I have comes from the courses Computer Science I &amp; II (Java Programming) that I took in college. Other than that, I've begun teaching myself Python and Javascript.

Costs not that big of a deal. I agree Rice is better, but the schools are pretty much equal in so many categories. Is attending Rice worth 200K more than attending UT?

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone! I desperately need some advice on whether to commit to Rice or UT. 

Here is some background: I am coming in to college with around 60 credit hours. Costs are not that big of an issue for me, but I am pretty frugal and do not feel that comfortable asking my parents for an extra 200K to attend Rice over UT.

Rice: No scholarship or need based aid; can probably graduate early but I was told by people not to graduate early, costs for 4 years amounts to 280K

UT: No scholarship or aid, no honors; can graduate in 2-3.5 years, costs amounts to \~80K

Both schools have excellent CS programs. Academically Rice is superior because of smaller class sizes and passionate professors. However, I also read that higher level classes at UT also have small sizes and that many of the CS professors at UT are REALLY good. Rice has a better social life and social scene, but I do have close friends at UT as well. Both provide great opportunities for internships, and my dream job is working in a big tech company as a manager (thus I want to study business as a minor).

I agree that I should enjoy the next four years, but are these advantages of Rice worth 200K more than  UT Austin? I won't be able to attend OWL Days so I'm really not sure how much I would enjoy it. Please leave any advice you have.

Thank you in advance."

This is a story of how I started the day meeting roommate on craigslist and ended up burying a random stranger's dead bird.

Recently, My roommate and I needed to find a third roommate to sublease (my third roommate had an internship in Germany) but we found this guy named Scott, he seemed pretty normal (so far). The first few days when he moved in it went pretty smoothly until we asked him if he wanted to hang out one day.

We decided to go to the park and grill/ play basketball, Scott said yes. I told him we just need basic grilling stuff like hotdogs, chips, charcoal, etc. and asked if he could pick up one of those items, my roommate and I had the rest.

Flash forward about 2 hours later, we are ready to go he comes in with 5 top sirloin steaks, asparagus, and scallops. He showed me the receipt, he spent almost $200 for everything and my roommate and I just had hotdogs and chips. We thanked him and asked him if he needed some money because it was so expensive. He said it was ""his treat""

We headed to the park and found a spot to start grilling, at first, from what he bought, I thought he grilled quite a bit, nope. The man put the steak and other fixings directly on a cold grill and doused everything in lighter fluid (even the food) before I could say anything he lit it and a huge fireball erupted burning the food and a little bit of his eyebrow.

My roommate and I stood there in complete silence over what just occurred. it was awkward for a few minutes so we decided to just play basketball. After playing for a few hours, this girl came out of her house sobbing on the phone with someone, she paced back and forth and went back inside. A few minutes later she came out sobbing an again holding a dead bird (its name was Elsa).

""Can someone help me bury my bird?"" she asked. Me, mouthing to my roommate (not Scott) ""what the fuck is happening"".

The next thing we hear is Scott responding ""ill bury it"". The girl seemed relieved that someone would help her. After Scott accepted the task, he goes ""why don't you take a shot (basketball shot) for the bird and hurled the basketball toward her. Taken back and still sobbing, the girl, stutters and says ""o oo kk ayy"".

She misses the shot, and when I think things couldn't get any worse, Scott grabs the ball and throws it at her again laughing ""you'll get it next time!!""

The ball almost hit the face this time and she exclaimed ""PLEASE, help me bury my bird"" my roommate and I apologized and for what just transposed and offered to dig a hole.

Before I could extend the gesture, Scott grabs the bird, kisses its forehead and starts digging a hole with a red solo cup.

After the bird was buried, I again apologized for what happened with the girl's bird and we got tf out of there.

Just when I thought this couldn't get any worse, my friend called me and asked if I wanted to go to an open mic and the corner bar. I said that sounded fun and Scott overheard my call and said: ""Ill tag along"".

I thought this day couldn't get weirder and said ""sure"" we met up with my friends at their apartment to have a few drinks before. Scott seemed normal and wasn't bothering anyone (which was relieving).

Once we started walking to open mic Scott kept loudly telling everyone in the group (around 15 people) that he was buying patron shots for Me and Bennett (my other roommate) and no one else in the group. He repeated over and over that he was only buying shots for my roommate and me to a point my friends were visibly annoyed.

We get to the bar and he immediately goes and buys 6 rum and cokes (not patron shots) for my roommate him and I (2 each).

After maybe 4 sips out of one drink (he split the other all over his pants) he's starting to get drunk.

The comedy show starts and Scott is talking loudly during the whole show to a point where the comedians are roasting him. One comedian said ""hey you, in the Hawaiian shirt, shut the fuck up"" (Scott was wearing a Hawaiian shirt and cargo shorts)

After about 10 minutes, Scott was kicked out of the show and had to sit at the bar. I past by him later to go to the bathroom and he was even drunker. He blurted out ""PATRON SHOTS"" and went to the bar and asked for 6 shots (2 each again)

When the bartender told him the total he reached for his wallet, he lost it. Before I thought of just buying them getting him an uber home he ran to the comedy stage and interrupted people asking for his wallet. He later was dragged out by the bouncers and started trying to fight with random people on the sidewalk because he thought someone stole his wallet.

At this point, my friends (and everyone at the bar) were super annoyed with this dude the police came.

To make this night even worse, They forced him to leave and we didn't hear from him until that next morning.

My roommate and I didn't talk to him the rest of the time he lived there.

TL;DR  I found a roommate off craigslist to sublease, it was terrible and I had to experience a bird funeral"

I am international, I come from non-CS background, and get accepted into the ALIGN program in NEU and the similar program at USC (named Scientists and Engineers)

My breakdowns:

NEU pros (equivalent to USC cons):

Excellent coop - for USC I have to find my own summer internship, which is quite difficult for a non-CS background student like me, because I only have 1 shot to try in the summer after the 1st year. Recruitment for summer internship starts around December-Feb, and by that time I only have a 1 semester of CS preparation under my belt.

Better public transport - I need to rely on public transport

Possibly less admitted students for MS (I heard so - I dont know the statistics for NEU but there are \~2500 students enrolling into USC for all MS CS specializations)

USC pros (equivalent to NEU cons):

CHEAPER tuition fee (this is ironic, but USC gives me a partial scholarship, which can save me \~10-20k compared to NEU tuition fee). Possibly cheaper living cost in LA too

Better weather - I get depressed by the gloomy and cold weather (like in Boston)

I am international (Asian), and I heard LA and Cali are friendlier towards foreigner compared to Boston?

As one of many, I've been impacted by the corona lockdown. I'm trying to navigate exactly what to do with my employment situation:

* Originally a resident from a different state, was asked to begin work remotely + move out to CA for an intern-to-hire position. My internship was originally 3-4 months based on my offer letter, hourly. Only recently -- long after I had moved into CA -- was my address in payroll changed to reflect this. For most of payroll, it notes me as a remote out-of-state worker.
* The role was initially advertised as intern-to-hire, but because of circumstances, I don't think that was going to pan out. At the end of 3 months, upper management asked how I'd feel about accepting a freelance/contract offer to cut my hours in half (from full-time to part-time) at a slightly (read: insignificant) raise instead of giving me a salary offer as an employee.

My concerns now are whether or not I can file for unemployment in CA given my circumstances. Is signing this new contract effectively terminating my chances for filing for unemployment? Do I even qualify based on what they assigned me as in payroll? 

(Bene note: For also what it's worth, I'm not sure if I actually qualify as an intern (not in-school nor a recent grad; just looking for a career pivot). I was seemingly onboarded as a regular employee and treated as one. Not sure if this is just shady practices or if it has real legal repercussions.)

I have recently talked to a psychiatrist since I was showing ADHD symptoms for a long time now and the anxiety of gradadmissions has made it 10x worse. She said that I have an mild autistic spectrum disorder since I did not exhibit clear cut ADHD symptoms as a child.

Here's the thing, my gpa is somewhere between 3.2-3.5 on the 4.0 scale and my GRE is 322 (161Q,161V). Neither of these scores are actually bad but the programs I am applying to are Computer Science and Data Science which are both extremely competitive. More so since I'm applying as an international student.

I know I have put in effort in the past, much more than my peers have, yet I couldn't perform as well as them because of my disorder. It has always messed with my confidence and I used to beat myself up a lot over this. Since I knew I could never compete against them academically, I have developed programming skills on my own and I have great internship, research, and co-curricular experiences which I believe, are given less importance than GPA and GRE for grad admissions.

Some choice quotes include:

&gt;*What about Twitter? You have people on Twitter asking, “Where’s The New York Times?” and a narrative developing that The Times’s decision not to cover it represents a political stance. And you and your team are silent through that. You don’t think to say, “Hey, we’re working on it”?*  
&gt;  
&gt;So this is a tricky question. You wish you could say to the world, “Hey, we’re working on this.” **But you don’t actually know what you’re going to end up writing. Let’s say for some reason we found out something that made us not want to write a story.** Then what do we say to readers? “We looked at this hard and we found a reason. We found out something that made us not want to write. But we’re not going to tell you about it.” So it felt to me like that wasn’t quite the right alternative either.

Because they \*totally\* weren't going to report if they found damning evidence Reade lacked any credibility or was working for Russia you guys...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And we try to give the reader the information they need to make their own judgments. **Unless we can make the judgment.**

...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do you think that, in your heart, you’re reluctant to promote a story that would hurt Joe Biden and get Donald Trump re-elected?  
&gt;  
&gt;I can’t make that calculation. I won’t. I won’t let my head or my heart go there. I think once you start making those kinds of calculations, **you are not a journalist anymore. You’re some sort of political actor**.

Immediately followed by...

&gt;I want to ask about some edits that were made after publication, the deletion of the second half of the sentence: “The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.” Why did you do that?  
&gt;  
&gt;Even though a lot of us, including me, had looked at it before the story went into the paper, I think that **the campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct**. And that’s not what the sentence was intended to say.

So, “we don’t want to worry about politics because JoUrNaLiStIc InTeGrItY, but also Biden’s campaign can just call in and ask us to edit published articles”... Again, Biden, *the man being accused of rape in the story*, can call in and ask that sections of the article be changed because he doesn't like how they make him sound.  


Next up, we have this opinion piece with the tagline ""A sexual assault accusation against the presumptive Democratic nominee is **being used to troll the #MeToo movement**."": [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/tara-reade-joe-biden.html?searchResultPosition=1](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/tara-reade-joe-biden.html?searchResultPosition=1)  


And finally, their original article about the accusation, which they waited close to a month to release until after Biden was the only candidate left running and then proceeded to edit at the request of the man accused of rape in the article: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html?searchResultPosition=2](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html?searchResultPosition=2)  


These are the only pieces of coverage they've done on this. One article, one opinion piece, and one interview with the executive editor to address criticism in the differences between how they reported on this and Kavanaugh. If you don't remember the Kavanaugh coverage this article provides a nice breakdown: [https://reason.com/2020/04/12/tara-reade-joe-biden-new-york-times-sexual-assault/](https://reason.com/2020/04/12/tara-reade-joe-biden-new-york-times-sexual-assault/)  


&gt;It's an excruciatingly matter-of-fact article, bereft of the emotion and rhetorical flourishes that have often characterized the *Times*' past reporting on #MeToo stories. The *Times*' investigative piece on Deborah Ramirez, Brett Kavanaugh's Yale accuser, was headlined, ""[Brett Kavanaugh Fit in With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/sunday-review/brett-kavanaugh-deborah-ramirez-yale.html)."" The paper also ran ostensibly objective pieces with headlines like ""[For Christine Blasey Ford, a Drastic Turn From a Quiet Life in Academia](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/us/politics/christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh-allegations.html)"" and ""[With Caffeine and Determination, Christine Blasey Ford Relives Her Trauma](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/us/politics/christine-blasey-ford-testimony.html)."" These were *news* articles, but it was not hard to detect an agenda: portray the accuser as so likable and sympathetic that readers would want to believe her.

Remember how they wouldn't want to paint someone who has been merely accused in an unnecessarily bad light, especially if wording the story differently doesn't change the facts? ... and that's why sterilized articles about Biden, that he is allowed to request edits to, are totally inline with journalistic integrity.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know whether or not Tara Reade is telling the truth, but I do know that it is massively hypocritical to at least not treat the accusation with seriousness--and journalistic integrity means treating this the same way we treated accusations against Kavanaugh. Delaying coverage, down playing Biden's actions, adding weird snippets about how Reade faces arrest if she's lying, and then allowing Biden to request article changes are \*not\* consistent with the coverage around Kavanaugh's accusers. I'm a lifelong Democrat, and this is honestly pretty devastating for me to see unfolding. I am completely open to the possibility that Reade could be lying, and if she is I would love for concrete evidence of that to come out--but so far all that has come out is circumstantial evidence about whether or not we should question her credibility, along with a number of things to indicate she's telling the truth such as friends and family she told the story to decades ago and interns who worked under her that confirm she disappeared from her job without warning. Regardless of how the evidence goes, we should all be demanding that this is investigated thoroughly. The way that this story has been covered is painfully reminiscent of the treatment Harvey Weinstein's accusers received, and none of us should be ok with that. Regardless of Biden being made the official democratic nominee, or how you choose to vote, we should all remember how news organizations like the New York Times treated this story."

 What do people mean by they have less recruiting or internship opportunities, is that because students would be busier or they are offered fewer opportunities by career servics?

*UChicago, Molecular Engineering*

Pros: 

\- Extremely good prestige/name recognition

\- World-class education

\- Best prep for grad school, possibly

\- The Core (both a pro and a con) would expose me to a lot of really interesting material I might not otherwise study and can make me well rounded

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: 

\- I know the ""where fun goes to die"" motto is largely an exaggeration, but my parents and I are pretty worried about the stress culture and ridiculous amount of work that students have there

\- I am very social and am worried that the social scene there is less vibrant (less time to have fun, meet new people, etc.)

\- Super into music and don't think I would have as much time or as many opportunities to play/jam/etc. Don't have nearly as many opportunities for jazz, etc.

\- Cost (full price or close to it, still waiting on aid but won't get any major scholarship)

\- Weather

\- Worried that the engineering ""program"" is a lot less practical and wouldn't be as helpful to me when I graduate

\- The Core might take away from my ability to study other stuff that I am more interested in (I have never liked studying English and History very much, for instance)

\- Grade deflation (or lack of inflation)

&amp;#x200B;

*University of Southern California, Chemical Engineering*

Pros:

\- NMSF Presidential Scholar, which is about 28k off, per year, plus honors perks. My family can probably afford all of these schools but this would leave a lot more money over for grad school and feels more reasonable.

\- Ability to be in the marching band!

\- Great social culture and opportunities to make friends

\- Tons of music opportunities for me, including minoring in Music Production (which UChicago doesn't offer)

\- Beautiful everything: campus, weather, etc.

\- Less intrusive core requirements mean more time to study stuff I am genuinely interested in

\- More traditional engineering program which could lead to more internships, job opportunities, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\- Lose some prestige and the possible opportunities that come with name recognition

\- A lot further from home (which I don't necessarily mind but my parents do)

\- Known as a party school, would worry I am selling myself short and throwing away a major opportunity?

&amp;#x200B;

*Williams College, Chemistry*

Pros:

\- Stellar education, opportunities to work with professors, etc.

\- Great community of really smart people without the stress culture of UChicago?

\- Family aspect and feel (many people have already reached out, feels the most tight-knit)

\- Very active campus (I love to bike, hike, etc.)

\- Great jazz program

\- Prestigious

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\- EXTREMELY isolated location (I have always seen myself in a city)

\- Not a lot to do off-campus

\- Worry about the lack of a vibrant social atmosphere

\- Do not offer engineering, which I am fairly certain is something I want to do but, of course, have no experience in

\- Small student body (not my style)

&amp;#x200B;

USC feels like the best option in some ways, but I have really started to second guess myself, especially since the UChicago acceptance is a very recent development. Even when I don't consider the money, USC seems like it might be more of a fit, in some ways, but I feel like I am overstating the ""cons"" about Chicago and might have a much better experience than I think I will in my head. I am worried about throwing away an opportunity here and making the wrong decision. I'm personally not extremely worried about prestige but I know that name recognition has importance in this world. Any thoughts at all would be appreciated."

I am looking to build a gaming PC. I had to part with my previous computer (an old Dell gaming PC from 2011) because I was planning on moving out of state for the Summer for an internship and needed extra cash, but the internship is instead going to be done remotely.

Woo! Money saved on rent!

That all being said, I am trying to come up with a list around $1k. I am not looking to play major AAA titles like CoD or GTA, mostly casual games like House Flipper or Car Mechanic Simulator or the Dark Souls series and Sekiro. I want a PC that can run these games at a consistently high FPS at max settings on 1080p resolution.

I am going into my senior year of college next semester and want to make this as my early graduation gift.

Any suggestions are welcome! I'm probably going to wait until Black Friday/Cyber Monday to make purchases, but who knows? Maybe I'll have the money and the itch before then :P

g2nvmr,2,2020-04-16,I was part of a summer internship that took place at my SUNY college during 2019. Me and 2 other students worked on the project for 9 weeks before being told to not return until the legal paperwork was finished. We still have not received a paycheck and are financially struggling.,Xelratr4236,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/g2nvmr/i_was_part_of_a_summer_internship_that_took_place/,"I (21M) tried to keep this brief but it came out a little longer than I thought. It's all important information though \[TLDR at the bottom\]. I am a recent graduate of my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. I was looking for internships for the summer of 2019 to get a good start on my career, as all students do. I was made aware of an internship that would be located on my college campus. My State University of New York held a ""get to know each other"" meeting that involved a startup company that we would be partnering with.

The founder of the startup company told us that we would be doing an envelope study to design wind turbines for the NY and PA area. He said that we would be potentially paid for the work that we did. Out of 30 alumni and students that were at the meeting, 3 of us decided to stick around. 

We worked closely with the founder and his turbine design engineer friend for a week before they each had to return home. One of the mechanical engineering professors worked with me and the other 2 students for a few weeks as our project manager to keep us on track and to give us tasks.

Fast forward 2 weeks into the project, we had not heard anything from the dean of engineering or the founder of the startup. So I sent the founder an email giving him an update on the project and asked about if we were going to receive pay. The founder responded thanking me for the update and told us that when the paperwork was finished on the schools end, we would be compensated for our efforts. He said that it would take around 2 weeks. Our project manager informed us that we would be receiving school wages which was $12 an hour. We worked 5 days a week with 8 hour days.

After week 4 into the project, there was still no update. So another email was sent to the founder. He apologized for how long everything was taking and as soon as the paperwork was settled, he would fly back to NY and pay us what we're owed. He said another 2 weeks.

Week 5, our project manager was no longer meeting with us during the work day. He must've had other things to work on before school started. But the 3 of us kept ourselves busy improving on the work we were producing.

Week 6, still no word from anyone. We found out that the dean of engineering was only a temporary interim dean and had recently retired from his position. Another email was sent to the founder asking when this all was going to be finished and reimbursed. He once again apologized and congratulated us on the work we were doing, saying that he will reimburse us soon.

Week 9, the 3 of us had grown frustrated with the situation but continued to be kind and respectful. We received an email from the school telling us that we were not allowed back on campus until everything was settled. We thought that the school was looking out for us and it would all be cleared up soon.

Fast forward 4 months (now November), we receive word from the new dean of engineering asking for a meeting with us (This was the first time he had even reached out to us). We thought that everything was finalized and we would be reimbursed. He apologized for the situation saying that the whole thing has been a headache, the school and the startup could not come to agreements on the legalities. He told us that this all started with a handshake agreement. He said that there were no working papers filed, that we were doing illegal work on school grounds for 9 weeks, and therefore the school could not reimburse us. The only thing that he could do was argue with the founder until he payed us.

We felt like the other parties were just dragging this whole thing along until we would just forget about it. We felt scammed and we are now all broke. My girlfriend had to cover my end of the rent for the whole year lease because I couldn't afford it. She paid just under $3,000 to cover my rent, she also covered the utilities and our groceries and any other expenses (She has been a tremendous support system through all of this). One of my colleagues had parents that covered his expenses. And the other colleague had continuous car troubles from travelling an hour (there and back) to the college every day and I have no idea how he is doing.

There is currently a capstone project (senior project) in the works for the company where one of my colleagues is continuing to research and design the turbine blade for maximum energy output. But once the project is done, all capstones are solely owned by the school or the party involved. The students who created the project have no rights to their creation and are not protected. This project is done through a class requirement and does not require compensated pay.

Coming around to February, I sent an email to the dean of engineering and the founder of the startup saying (very respectfully) that we have been patient with everything but that this cannot drag out for much longer. If they did not finalize the legalities and reimburse us soon, that we would have to consider getting a lawyer or taking this to the media.

We all had other jobs that we could have used to make money during the summertime but we chose this one for the experience, even though we would have been paid less. We went out on a limb working with the school and the startup and now we seriously regret even sticking around.

That covers nearly everything. Me and the other students have felt very small during this whole situation and we feel like no one was ever looking out for our best interests. Any r/legaladvice would be very helpful to me and my colleagues as to how to handle this situation. Thanks in advance.

TLDR; Me and 2 other students started an internship through our college during the summer of 2019. After working for 9 weeks on the project we were kicked off campus due to liability concerns and have not been reimbursed for the work we did. It has brought on a lot of financial stress and we fear that the school is now trying to cover up the agreement."

I did not do any internships during my college degree. I was very aware that my starting pay was low, but due to my lack of actual experience in the field, I decided to take the opportunity. Outside of classes, I spent over a year on Udemy courses with a primary focus on JavaScript.  Currently, I’m working as a React developer. They hired me knowing that I did not know React at the time. They basically paid me to do Udemy courses on React. I still have a long way to go, but I’ve become fairly comfortable with React and I’m making massive improvements with my CSS skills as well. Even though my wage is significantly lower than the national average (and other comp sci grads from my university), I am very comfortable at my job. I really like my coworkers. They’re all very chill and super nice. The type of work I do is very interesting and I’ve learned so much working here.  In addition, I’m so grateful that I’ve been working remotely for the past month.  I’m actually providing results and my supervisor tells me often that I’m doing a great job. It took me about a month to become comfortable enough to work on the codebase.  Since then, I’ve really stepped up to the plate and now I have significant tasks assigned to me. I’m the only web developer on our team. In my spare time, I’m constantly doing more Udemy/YouTube tutorial series. I’m learning as much as I can. I’ve almost been here for 4 months and I’m starting to realize that it’s about time I should ask for a raise. I’m thinking of only asking for a $5 hourly increase. I probably could ask for more, but I am still new and with the current economic climate, I am want to approach this cautiously. Plus, where I live, I could be fairly comfortable at $20 /hr for now. Plus, the work life balance is amazing. It’s very casual and I love wearing shorts to work. I’ve never had a software developer job before.

I started uni mid-2018 and due to some setbacks I will likely be graduating mid-2022 if I can't do summer units or do an extra unit for two semesters. I had to take medical leave for a semester last year due to some intense surgery and recovery I went through, and I dropped to half-load this semester with the move to online schooling (my units were fairly intensive for me so I didn't want to risk failing without proper tutorials). 

I currently have distinction average grades and a commerce related internship with a non-for-profit but my academic record looks pretty strange (with the units I dropped still showing up but without a grade attached). How will this look to employers? will this affect my chances of of moving to the interview stage for internships?

Just to note, I'm not aiming for IB, more big4 or commercial banks.

cheers and thanks."
g2tq56,0,2020-04-16,Confused Sophomore,BaowChikaWaoWao,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g2tq56/confused_sophomore/,"Topic: (it may sound cliche but its not): What exactly tech industry or a computer-science-related job want from an Interviewee (specifically Intern). 

Context (Warning: long and depressing): 

So today I had my Google Online Assessment for STEP Intern 2020 (Sydney) at 9:00 am Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST). Online Assessment went reaaallllyyy bad like got wreck in no-time, which was kinda obvious cause I'm not an active Competitive Programmer. While i was depressed thinking bout my future. I thought whats the point of doing these projects if these company like to hire ""Gods who speaks the language of STL Libraries"".

Believe it or not but i only think about coding and stuff .I really love coding but only the software development side where i can build something useful,and  not to check if a string is Palindrome or not. Not against the idea of Competitive Coding or somethin but really confused that should i focus on learning Frameworks or reversing a Linked List. I have done 9-10 projects and learned frameworks (Django, React (beginner-level), matplotlib, Numpy, pandas)  during my quarantine-time but lookin at the current scenario it looks like that was nothin but a waste of time instead i should have done some Competitive Coding.

And when i look at preferred qualification for SWE at any big tech company it seems to me like they are asking for people who are jack of all and master of all.

So my questions are:

Q1. What should be the ratio of Competitive Coding vs Framework learning that i should keep considering the fact that i will apply for internship again in 3 months from now?(and i know most the people will be like ""iT's uP tO YoU or TheRe's No NEed"" but till now what I've seen, it looks like i have to spend a hell lot of time on CodeChef, CodeForce,SPOJ and Leetcode.

Q2.If you are a competitive coder tell me what got you interested or started maybe that could become my motivation(till now my only motivation is getting past these Interviews).

Q3. Now that I understand the importance of Competitive Coding I'll get started from now on but will that pay me/be worth it even after interview or in my CS career.

Q4.Are problem solving in Coding Competition and real Software Development somewhat same?

Q5. Do people like me exist who don't like Competitive Coding( too much) and loving building stuff that can be used by someone?

PS: I am really frustrated so instead of thinking that I'm some other sophomore with an IQ less than the room temperature please HELP ME! or i should say guide me i am ready to learn.

Also before posting this did a lot of search but couldn't find an answer that could quench my thirst they either start talking about there own career/experience and dilute the answer very much or there is some Anonymous user who is giving definition bullshit.

One more thing  if you think i should take this post down for whatever reason lemme know."
g2tz4j,3,2020-04-16,"Struggling with grad school affordability--should I not go? If not, what should I do after college graduation?",molliefroth102,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g2tz4j/struggling_with_grad_school_affordabilityshould_i/,"Hello. I am a 23 year old female college senior. I am graduating in May 2020. I have been applying for graduate schools, but as you can imagine, that has become complicated due to the coronavirus. I applied to a couple of schools but couldn't finish the application process because some of them required in-person interviews. I did not want to put myself at risk because they were far away. Zoom/online interviews were not available for some of these schools.

Right now, I think I have a chance at being accepted to one of the programs I applied but have been struggling with financial aid. My only choice is to pay with loans because I do not have money saved up; I have also failed to get a graduate assistantship as either a TA or RA. I have no research experience, making it difficult to apply to an RA position. Before the campuses shut down, I tried doing a senior thesis. I worked on the research proposal for that thesis but it got rejected because they professors supervising it dislike my research topic. My GPA is a 3.7, so pretty okay. My Major GPA is only a 3.4 though. My GRE scores were a bit below average.

If it helps, I have been trying to apply for a Masters in Counseling program. I know Ph.D. programs have better funding, but I wanted to do a Masters because I am more interested in psychotherapy than research. I also do not have the prerequisite research experience that Ph.D. programs are looking for.

I have tried contacting the financial aid office for the program multiple times because they told me that my FAFSA application was flawed. I was told I am not eligible for any financial aid because they said I made a mistake with my application. I was told that I made an error, saying I was only an undergrad next year when I plan on graduate school. I called FAFSA and verified that I did not make that mistake. Despite telling the school this, I got no response back.

But even if I got the loans, would they be worth it? I already owe $30,000 in debt for my bachelor's degree. If I went to graduate school, that debt would double. And I know the kinds of beginning salaries most therapists make. It would be difficult to pay off.

Because of all this, I am thinking of a.) applying to other psychology graduate programs or b.) changing my career goals entirely. When I was younger, nursing was really pushed as a career. I didn't want to do it. I'm still not sure if I'd want to do it. But health-care workers are in high demand and always will be. It's definitely not my dream job, but maybe I wouldn't totally hate it? I was thinking of taking CNA classes to see if nursing would be something I am interested in. I would never jump straight into an accelerated BSN program without being sure it's what I really want to do. 

As for working in my field, then hopefully saving up money..it's going to be difficult to find a job working in my field after I graduate. I never did any internships in college. I did some volunteer work and had some fast food jobs, but nothing too relevant to my field. I volunteered in a food pantry. Right now I am volunteering for a crisis line but for one a.) I just started to do it and b.) It's a text line so I am not sure if it would count as relevant experience.

I have already had interest in doing a gap year/service year with Americorps but the program is going to be very different due to the coronavirus. I'd probably be teleserving, which I don't totally mind, but it would different from doing it in person. Also, if I planned on going to graduate school afterwards would a year with Americorps be looked down upon? I am not sure.

Overall, I am feeling very lost. For these past couple years, my plan has been to go onto graduate school, earn my Masters degree, do the supervised hours, earn my licensure, and become a LPC (Licensed Professional Counselor). To prepare for this, I tried earning the best GPA possible, studied for the GRE, tried to get research experience, joined societies like Psi Chi, etc. but it seems like nothing has gone as planned. 

I got no research experience, no valuable internships, my GRE scores are poor, and I have difficulties paying for graduate school. What do you suggest I do? Give up on graduate school entirely, delay it, entertain a different career? I don't feel like minimum wage jobs are below me. If I need to do that just for the money, I'll do it for the mean time. It just feels like I have no options right now and I could really use some advice."

###FAQ

**Blanket statement** 

It goes without saying, this is uncharted territory for the vast majority of consulting firms.  With things changing day to day, the short answer is no one knows for sure what will happen.

**What will happen to consulting?**

With the economic slowdown, our clients' businesses are impacted and so our business is impacted.  While some industries may be doing relatively better than others, they will not be able to make up for industries that have been devastated, such as travel and leisure.  

The big open questions are whether or not we enter a recession and how long it will last.  Multiple different organizations, including consulting firms like [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/covid-19-implications-for-business), [Bain](https://www.bain.com/insights/tracking-the-global-impact-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-snap-chart/), and [Oliver Wyman](https://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/v2/publications/2020/March/COVID-19-Primer.pdf) have put out scenarios that posit recovery being anywhere from a quarter to over a year away.  That's a lot of uncertainty.

**What will happen to my job / offer?** 

Most likely you will hear from your firm about any impact on your job / offer before you read about it here.  Some firms have already begun communicating their intentions. 

Longer term, we can try to speculate based on what we've seen in the past.  In my opinion, the closest worst-case analog (from a business perspective) we can compare to is the Great Depression of 2008.  [See here for some perspectives on what happened to consulting jobs during that time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/fmpapf/covid19_impact_on_consulting/?)

**Should I reach out to HR / recruiting?**

For many firms, there is much still undecided.  Some because firms are still waiting for more information and some because they don't need to make a decision right this instant.  Furthermore, much leadership effort is currently focused on ensuring the safety of current staff and managing the business.

When more decisions are made and provided to HR / recruiting, they will communicate broadly.  There's little appetite for responding to every email like whack-a-mole.

Apologies for the cryptic title question, but it really can't be any more true to my situation.

I'm a rising Junior at a business school and my current major is corporate finance and accounting. I recently did an internship at one of the Big 4 Accounting Firms near my area and realized that I didn't really enjoy the culture (both political and social) and the general work I was doing at the firm I interned at. In fact, I didn't just dislike it, I abhorred it.

This led me to have some sort of an existential crisis (quarter life?) where I realized that I don't really know what I want to do. I always believed that I wanted to work at some ""big"" accounting firm somewhere and be part of a big mission, but I've realized that it really isn't for me. I'm very lucky to have had internships to get to know what I want and don't want in a careerpath but I just can't seem to piece together what this careerpath might be.

I've kinda narrowed everything down and realized the following:

* Instead of the work that I was originally doing (dealing with corporate funding and money) I'd like to be somewhat creative in my work (creative as in, creating content?)
* I'd like to work to do something ""big""; as in, I want my work to be valued and I want it to impact other people!
* I enjoy stability and general wholesomeness. Okay before you call me out for this and call me a raging optimist, I just wanted to explain that I am severely impacted by corporate culture, especially if it is toxic, gossipy, disrespectful, etc. I'm aware that no one would want to work in these types of conditions, but I just absolutely abhor it. No Susan, I don't want to hear about what happened during Happy Hours with so and so.
* Somewhat business related? Like I'd like to do a career that is based in business but allow me to have creative freedom
* If I had to be EXTREMELY picky, maybe a place that doesn't thrive on extreme regularity. Like, I'd like some excitement in the work I do.
*  Somewhere where I can work individually yet also have time collaboratively (one thing I hated about my internship was that it seemed as if everything was done collaboratively and you were shoved with different people all the time. I barely had the time to just do things by myself and process everything for myself). 

My career counselor at college said that it seems I'd definitely enjoy working at a place like Nintendo, Disney, etc, and I agree! I'd love to work at such great companies! But I have to be realistic and understand what I want to do before finding a ""dream company"" to work at.

I can't help but feel like I'm being unreasonably picky with my choice in a careerpath. Don't get me wrong, I'm willing to sacrifice for certain priorities. But I was hoping I could get a bit of insight on what type of a careerpath might be the best for me. I'd like to also note that I am extremely lucky to have the option of changing my major without any severe repercussions as I was planning on graduating early anyways and now have enough time for a sudden major change.

Sorry for the long ramble!"

g355j8,1,2020-04-17,The Ethics of Revenge,Bear_Punch,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g355j8/the_ethics_of_revenge/,"I need some advice on something that has been occupying my consciousness for the last year or two. Here it goes:

This has to do with my ex who I had been with (5 yrs) and was legally married (2 yrs), we broke up 2 years ago. Before I begin, I'll start with some key information about myself.

A year before we started dating, my childhood best friend committed suicide. It was something I was struggling with at the time. I think about it every morning still, but back then it was really bad. I felt a lot of guilt for it and spent years coping with it poorly. Looking back, I should have gone to therapy. Instead I took a lot of drugs with ex and read a lot of philosophy.

Another thing to point out is that I have Dyslexia, which I was diagnosed with in the US and DK I was studying abroad and was not getting any assistance due to errors in the school. I have very poor reading comprehension but I am off the charts in lateral thinking and long-term memory, (I remember many things very vividly).

I met my ex in a creative business school in Denmark (2013). We were in the same class. We shared a love for Art and Existentialism but primarily drugs. This was a creative business school that focused on marketing and fashion, a good portion of the class took designer drugs. In the beginning it was swell. I loved to party, but for the wrong reasons. Escaping feelings of guilt of my best friend and some other shit. I was not aware of it at the time, but once it dawned on me. The need to get sober and take care of myself became my mission as I started feeling more for my ex. She loved the drugs though and couldn't understand why I wanted to get sober. To be fair, sober me is boring, I wasn't as charismatic as I was when attempting to face my demons.

As we were broke students at the time. I didn't go to therapy and was heavily depressed. She was very supportive, trying to boost my self-esteem, but death wasn't real to her. She did what she could. During this time, our grades in school began to drop. She took a job as a student assistant and I tried to focus on school.

Even though we live in a socialist country we were very poor. There were times at the end of the month where I'd be eating a bag of pretzels for dinner so I could buy her chocolate. Or I would skip dinner so we could go out with friends for beer. As money got tighter, I was skipping more dinners, and she was beginning to get depressed.

She was sad that we were poor and wanted things, so she began shoplifting. In the beginning it was cute, a grown adult stealing a Kinder Egg. This grew out of proportion and she started stealing expensive stuff from malls. Like 2 hundred-dollar Kenzo shirts and shit.

The prospect of stealing didn't sit well with me. Sure, if you read Marx, you could say that you are stealing from thieves, but that would make us no better. Then it bled into the professional life. She's a talent graphic designer but began plagiarizing work in her portfolio. She would do this by searching for things on Behance in a different language, usually Spanish, altering it a bit in photoshop, then add it to her portfolio. Through this she began to climb the academic ladder.

I was stuck at home dealing with depression not eating, and being a deadbeat. In Denmark, you get paid to go to school, it isn't much but it covers rent. She would brag openly about the plagiarism, classmates saw the success she was having and began to follow in her footsteps. She was very supportive of me so I turned the other shoulder. Soon a good portion of the class was lying to get ahead after rumors of her success came out. This gave me a very ugly view of the world. Some people followed in her footsteps.

I was not doing too well in school, which is primarily my fault. People would make fun of me, telling me I was lazy. The school administration wasn’t answering my call for assistance (Dyslexia, they have a program too), so my Teachers didn't take my diagnoses seriously. People made fun of me and didn't respect me, so I decided to download all the lectures onto a hard disk and work from home.

Any who, when we graduated (2017). She applied for a graduate position at L'Oreal (2018) in Copenhagen. Before doing so, **she changed her job experience on Linkedin** (like going to other countries for internships), **alter a digital copy of her diploma to show higher grades,** and lied through her teeth. She bragged about it openly to close friends. She got the job. I was very happy for her because I knew she really wanted it. I was working at full-time at 7-11 at the time, we were still struggling with money, but now that she had that job, things were good. I wanted to quit working at 7-11 and do an internship so I could climb too. During this time, I had another friend, who I had lost contact with, kill himself.

She thought it was stupid I didn't just lie/ plagiarize information and get a job like her, but initially respected that I didn’t. It was important to me that I didn't. Being Dyslexic, I've have always been self-conscious of the merit of my work. If I climb, I do so because I earned it. Any who, I made the mistake of quitting my job before finding an internship. I still had the lectures on a Hard disk, and would drill them aimlessly.

One day we have argument, over something incredibly small and petty. Things build up and she tells me ""YOU MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO KILL THEMSELVES"" I was so distraught. I packed up my shit and left. She wanted to get back together but didn't understand why I was so upset. My parents intervened, I hadn't told them what she had said, she then forgot my birthday, so I decided that was that.

A couple months later, I begin studying my Master's and she’s still working at L'Oreal. I write to her to ask her how she is doing. She's doing better, told me she forgot what she said that day. Apologized for ""anything that I said"" and told me she broke up with me for ""survival"" and was because she wanted to kill herself. This pissed me off immensely, but worse it made me really sad. It was hard for know if she was capable of understanding, or if she even cared, I said nothing. Later I told her what she actually said that day, she denied it twice, and then eventually gave an empty apology.

I turned in my thesis this January, and completed my Masters with an average 3.5 gpa. I was studying 80 hrs. a week (I wish that was an exaggeration) and working my fucking ass off. Now I'm applying for work, which has been tough due to the quarantine. I do some freelance work, philanthropy for the UN, programming courses, but I'm still broke. as. shit. I live with my brother and I still depressed, but a lot more functional. I hear shit from mutual friends about where she is talking some shit. Essentially that I was deadbeat, but denies it my face.

She's got a corporate salary, got promoted recently, has her own place, and living the high life. All because she lied her way through. It pisses me off on so many levels. As I still squander to make end's meat.

So I wonder, what is to stop me from calling the school we attended telling them that she altered her diploma and committed fraud? Or the HR department of L'Oreal?

Would they check? Would they even care?

Can I justify my anger even though it’s been 2 years, even though I can remember things like they are yesterday and she has the memory of a goldfish? 

Am a part of the problem if I don't say anything? 

Is it my duty as an honest man or petty to report her, should I wait for karma to bite her in the ass, or am I the karma bubbling in the darkness? 

Even though I see it everywhere, I hate living in a world where deception is the name of the game, and the only real crime is getting caught, and ignorance can get you out of anything."

Although I'm definitely a competent coder and mathematician, I think my real advantage over others in my program is my understanding of markets &amp; economics. I  applied to be an intern at BNY Mellon's asset management division, but got a response back saying that they decided not to hire interns to fill that role (so the internship program I applied to was canceled) but that my resume was a good fit for their Technology Summer Analyst program. I figured what the heck, and applied for that, and got the position. During the interview process I was fairly forward in expressing that I wanted a career in finance and not to just permanently be a developer for a financial firm.

I like devoting myself to the work (especially the design portions), and I enjoy the challenge. I never really dabbled in web technologies, but I have passing familiarity. I've always worked with back-end stuff or application UI.

I got hired at a company first for data entry, and then become more and more involved in their software development arm (such as it was). When I started they were mostly pen-and-paper transitioning to Excel and Access. I was promoted to a ""Project Engineer"" position, which nominally meant I was working as a full-time developer, but actually meant I was filling in for other clerical roles because I was good at it and we're chronically understaffed.

Last year, their lead developer (who pushed for everything to be Access and VB) retired, and I was promoted to an actual honest-to-god software developer position! Mostly its been the same stuff I worked on before, but no more routine clerical work. The back-end stuff I love, even if wrangling with ancient VB and decrepit SQL queries is a mess. I was doing great and received high praise.

My superior, the only other developer, is a self-trained IT-guy-cum-programmer and now much of our in-house software is from his various stages of learning and development. I never know if bad code I'm examining is broken or working as designed but designed poorly (and of course, there's no time for refactors or testing).

We're now trying to tackle a big project turning our hulking, aged Access database application into a fully-featured internal web application; but I don't know anything about web design except what I've picked up in the last few weeks. I've been trying to figure things out, but everything is new to me and I'm not making good progress.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it my responsibility to learn about these technologies on my own time, or should I expect to do some basic training on company time (I'm salaried but we clock our hours and have nebulous deadlines)? Or should I be seeking a different position because I'm so woefully unprepared to work on this project? Should I take vacation time to bone up?"

I googled to look for possible reasons. I have the latest drivers, and I regularly check for Windows Updates (even if they are occurring every alternate day !!!!). I had Mcafee antivirus pre-installed so ran it to see any malware infections, but couldn't find any. As a precaution, I also installed Malwarebytes and ran it, only to find a few malware items. I quarantined them immediately and restarted, which made things better, but only briefly as malware popped up after I reran the tests sometime later. During this, the aforementioned Service Host kept hogging memory like a bitch.

I still think it has something to do with malware, but I am not sure how. I am worried as my virtual internship starts this Monday and such nuisances can hamper my productivity."

I have made a Help Desk Ticket program using C# for the final project of my internship.

I wanted to see if the program would run on a regular computer. I figure there must be a way to make a program that someone can run without them having to install Visual Studio, .net frameworks, SQL Server, etc.

I created the program and database with a simple filepath so I could instruct the user to basically create a folder on their C:\ drive, extract the zipped files into that folder, which is where the filepath inside the program points to, and off it should go.

Running the program on the test computer I get a .NET Framework error that it cannot establish a connect to SQL Server. In the details it says JIT Debugging has to be enabled, which it is enabled on the machine I built the program on. I downloaded SQL Server on the test machine with no change in results. If I continue past the error the program runs fine, it simply has no data and cannot save any new data that gets added.

I'm missing something. Any help would be appreciated.  I've submitted this to the professor in charge of the internship but I haven't received any response."

This is my first post ever on Reddit so sorry if I make any mistake.

**Demographics:** I've lived in Chile my whole life, competitive middle-sized catholic school, and upper middle class.

**Financial need:** I think that my family could pay for what college costs here (\~$10.000 USD per year) but no more than that. So I really need some financial aid (Private universities usually give way more aid than public ones to international students)

**Things I'm looking for:** Diverse campus, ideally located in a big city (or relatively near an international airport), chances of being able to do interesting internships and research, cultural activities and a decent student:teacher ratio.

**Intended majors:** Political Science, International Affairs or Public Policy.

**Stats:** 

**GPA:** 3.94 UWGPA, probably one of the best in my class (my school doesn't give stats on that)

**SAT:** Got 1300 on my first SAT almost without studying, but I'm taking it again on august (or whenever it's possible) and on my last mock tests I'm getting 1450\~1520.

Schools like mine that follow the chilean curriculum (the most expensive ones have IB, AP or even Italian Maturita) don't let students choose courses, we just have the chance when we turn juniors to choose between having more hours in Math and Physics, Biology and STEM or Humanities, I took the latter and had a lot of philosophy, Spanish and history, we also have to write two thesis works (like the ones you do in the University), one as a junior and one as a senior, which means a lot of hard work.

**Awards and summer stuff:** 

* Received the highest award to receive in my school as sophomore (for being like an ""holistic person"")
* Honors award for my whole 4 years of HS. (It's given for having high grades all quarters)
* Best speaker and many debate awards in debate tournaments organized by different universities.
* Took a pre-calculus summer intensive in the best university in the country
* Took a Political Science summer school in a very good university
* Won an scholarship to a summer school in Anhui, China thanks to my Chinese abilities. (This was as a freshman, does it still count?)
* Won third place in a national Chinese competition.

**Extracurriculars:**

* Environment delegate (freshman), arts and culture delegate (sophomore) and president (junior-senior) of the students' union. Here I organized a lot of things, like HIV prevention campaigns, cultural tournaments, forums, volunteering and recycling.
* Class president for all HS.
* Regional Vice-President of the youth of a political party.
* Regional leader of one of the biggest volunteering NGO in the country.
* National representative in a children's rights related table (which is closely linked with my volunteering initiatives).
* Debate club captain for two years (four years in the club).
* I am also working in a political campaign for mayor as a community manager.
* I am also taking some online courses for university credit, from ASU. (Precalc and English Composition)
* Learning French (I already speak Chinese, English and Spanish)

**Essays:** It worries me a bit since it's in English, but usually I am a good writer. 

**LORS:** I think that I can get really good letters,  I have a really good and close relationship with many teachers. I could also get a letter from the former governor (I am working for him rn) do you think that it might improve my application? 

I am not really sure where to apply (bedsides that Columbia is my dream university) but these ones I've been checking out: Columbia, Georgetown, Northwestern, Brandeis, Northeastern and Arizona State. Maybe I am dreaming too high, what do you think?

​
Okay, excuse my ignorant question and indecisiveness, but, how do you guys answer the question, ""What field do you want to work in?"" during your internship interviews?



I just want to say that I'll take \*anything\* but that comes off as desperate. I have interests, but they're more post-grad type things so they aren't viable at the level of these internships. This question always kills me and they're like, ""Well you should figure out what you want to do"".



I know what I want to do; I want to survive and make it to grad school to pursue my interest. 

​
Is ""software development/engineering"" an adequate answer? That seems too vague, and for sake of trying not to sound vague, I usually avoid it. Honestly, though, I'm just looking for the experience and being able to afford a roof over my head.



What would you guys recommend I say to this question? I want to say like, ""general programming, I just want to experience"" but that doesn't really impress anyone.



Also, second very ignorant/dumb question.. Is there a ""list of fields"" within CS? I know like, ML/AI, data science, app development, web development.. But is there like, a more exhaustive, recognized list of some sort? I'm sure something in there would fit my interest more specifically so I could give a better answer to this question."

I would appreciate any advice you might have on tips / suggestions to be most prepared in the coming years for graduate school admissions (masters / PHD program). This is coming after a very long conversation with my MIL who received her PhD later in life (after 3 children, and getting a divorce) and really encouraged me to look into this route. She was tenured and recently retired.

Here is my background:

* I graduated about 6 years ago from a reputable state school with a 3.6 GPA in Finance
   * I received one grade lower than a B and it was a D in Calc 2 my freshmen year. I was going through very personal matters that semester and this class was structured where the final counted for most of my grade (\~75%). I'm not proud of this, but this is my reality. I never had to re-take it because I had other credits that fulfilled that component.
   * I was very active in extra-curricular in school and had many part-time jobs and internships. I was president and community leader of various clubs (my strong-suit is with people). I was also apart of specialty programs within my major.
   * I have about 3 or 4 professors that I can think of that I would love for them to give me recommendations but I haven't kept in touch with in the past 3 years.
* I worked as an investment banker on Wall Street for about 3 years (promoted from analyst to associate - strong track record). I worked on M&amp;A, IPO and other types of strategic advisory work.
   * I have colleagues I could turn to for recommendations.
* I worked at a non-profit where I did some cool travels and expanded my mindset. I studied for an english teaching certificate at this time.
* I worked at a corporate finance / investment function.
* Then I got married and have been mainly a housewife as I was taking time to figure out our goals as a couple. Coronavirus hit before I really got a chance to try out a new career. I'm re-thinking and want to be open to all of my talents and skillsets.

This is my full background and I would love to hear any valid concerns / comments.

Some general questions I have:

* Do you go into a PhD based on your work experience? I truly enjoy finance and learning about it but am not sure if it's too concentrated a field to head into.
* Would it be most advised to get research experience with a local college?
* What would be a valid first step? I'll take it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance. I have nothing to lose to try and ask. I'm really humbled by life right now and I really appreciate any help / wisdom / harsh reality you can provide."

I am an upcoming undergraduate student who is tryna decide between UofT CS and Waterloo S.E or CS.

So I have been doing a lot of research and I realized that obviously uoft is really prestigious and the best academic school. I love the campus location and especially the college I got into (trinity). I have heard that the life is a little bit stressful tho, despite of all the socialization and social life opportunities in such an active location! Tbh, enjoying my college life besides doing good in academics is my goal! I am looking for the balance but I thought that hearing from you guys who are actually in the program would more to my opinion of uofT. Are you guys genuinely enjoying your time of living in downtown and socializing while you get a world-class education? Also, do you guys get considerable internships during the summers as a ca student or is it really hard to find opportunities in good companies where you can actually learn and gain some useful skills? I know about the PEY program but I think PEY alone is not sufficient as it is held in only a single company and position. 

On the other hand, as you know waterloo is well known for their co-op and the industry opportunities they provide but really the education is the same but they do have a big contribution in connecting the students and employers which ends up with a good resume for students! But after all, waterloo city and social life, connecting with diverse people is nothing like toronto and with all the pressure I don’t think people even tend to socialize cuz all they care is the endless competition they are in! 

So long story short, is UofT worth choosing it over Waterloo?! Or the social life position and the pressure is almost the same as waterloo?

Lastly, if you had the chance would you choose waterloo or uoft?

Thank you so much for anything you advise guys!"

I've heard 143 is pretty hard but I feel like knowing Java to that level will be advantageous to me in the future, especially with internships and jobs. I've also heard that Python is a better language for engineers, so I'm not sure exactly how helpful 143 will be. Any input would be great! For reference, I want to go into the aerospace industry.

Edit: thanks for the advice! I think I'll go for 143 this summer :)"

I have a choice to make for next year and I’m not sure how to proceed. 

I am currently a STEM major with a language minor. The country of my language is not offered by my school as a study abroad option, but I recently got a good offer to come study at an international language school in my desired country, summer of 2021 (couldn’t go this summer because of the virus).

However, this would mean losing the summer between my junior and senior year to get an internship in my major. This summer, if I am still able to, I plan to get an internship at my moms office related to my major.

I’m really hoping to use my language of choice in my future career. Would it look good on my resume if I were to study abroad? I’m worried that a lack to internships in my major would hamper my chances out of college.  

Any advice would be appreciated. 

Thanks!"

I've been considering doing two years to get my basic classes out of the way then transfer to Parsons. I've heard mixed reviews saying it's either not worth it or it totally is to go there, but it's hard to get in of course. if I take two years I can use that to work on all my art and designs and get better at them but is it really worth it for such a competitive industry? would it just be a huge waste of money if i got my degree in fashion then not even get in to the industry?? I'm probably not even close to the standard of designing to get into the industry.. I feel so stuck and I know I have time to choose my major and I can change it, but if I decide now I have more opportunities at the school I'm going to (such as studying abroad freshman or sophomore year and internships). getting a fashion degree is probably pretty useless since what really matters is your talent and who you know, but I have no idea what I'd even major in if it wasn't something artistic or creative. I fully know how useless going to an art or fashion school is or getting a degree in it, but im truly not interested in anything else enough to consider a career. I've been depressed for years and all I want right now is to help myself become happy and forcing myself into a job I don't want would ruin that, but at the same time getting a useless degree could make me equally as sad. I have no idea what to do, please give me some advice"

CSCQ has been a huge help in my interview process, so I want to start off by saying thank you. I will now pay it forward with some data and my experience breaking into software.

**for those interested in pure data**:

applications sent: 149

Rejections received:  35

Online Assessments taken: 4 (3 failed, one passed to phone screen, then rejected)

Phone screens: 5 (2 rejected, 1 hiring freeze)

Onsites: 2

Offers: 2 (one unofficial offer rescinded after asking for extension, due to ""uncertainty of covid situation"")

&amp;#x200B;

I had only one referral to the companies I applied to, which is the job I ended up getting. It is a Big N in NYC. I got this referral through a hackathon. Two of my other phone screens I got from reaching out to recruiters directly at the company I wanted to work for.  9 times out of 10 it is not worth it to just apply directly for entry level roles. IF YOU ARE A NEW GRAD REACH OUT TO RECRUITERS. MY RESPONSE RATE IS PROBABLY 20-40% REACHING OUT DIRECTLY VERSUS 2-5% WITHOUT.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Experience:**

My junior year in college I realized I really liked software development when working on a research project in Python. This was essentially my first experience writing anything that could be considered ""real"" code. My senior year I took an intermediate programming course in C/C++, and I realized I wanted to get a job as a software engineer. I knew I was pretty far behind in terms of applicants; I had no internships, no work experience, and only one class in CS.  While I did go to a school with a pretty good name, I had transferred in and knew very few people in computer science, so I didn't have any connections.

I graduated in May of 2019, and spent the next year taking a Coursera course in data structures/algorithms and reading a little bit about operating systems. I finished off the year, and a few months into the next, working through App Academy's full stack development course (I really didn't want to pay for a bootcamp, and this was open source, so I figured why not). It took me a bit longer to complete than it would have if I paid for it, but I think the amount I saved was worth it. After this was done, I worked on some personal projects to put on my resume, and began the grind of applying to jobs and Leetcode.

I worked through the first six chapters of CTCI, and did about 100 leetcode questions (50 Easy 30 Med 20 Hard, or something like that).  I studied the leetcode questions from the curated list link that is floating around on this sub, and by paying for leetcode premium and doing the leetcode questions for the companies I had onsites for (didn't end up being worth it for me). A leetcode question I saw a lot was counting 1s in a binary representation of an integer. I think I saw it 5 times in my onsites/phone screens/online assessments. You should know this question if you don't.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways that was my process. I think if I were to do it again, I would choose a different open source bootcamp to learn from, as Ruby/Rails, which is what App Academy teaches, is a bit niche. I would also do my leetcode questions as I go, rather than in a last-second cramming method of studying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Best of luck on your job hunt, feel free to PM me if you have any questions or are in a similar boat as me.

**If I can do it, you definitely can!**"

What kind of services do they offer to find internships, connections, meet alumni, get experience in your field, or anything like that?

What are BU's Computer Science and/or Business classes like? Would you say they're difficult or about average? I've read a little about grade deflation but how much of a difference does it actually make?

What's one thing you LOVE and one thing you really don't like about BU?

What is it like living on campus? How are the dorms/dorm social life, what are the students like, what do BU students do for fun, etc?

g3gpzs,2,2020-04-17,How do I stack up for grad school?,cantdecide23,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/g3gpzs/how_do_i_stack_up_for_grad_school/,"I am asking this here, because my time in undergrad has been a bit 'different' than most of my friends in engineering, so I have no one else to really compare with. Thus I seek your opinions/advice. 

When it comes to things like jobs after undergrad or possibly going straight for grad schools, what matters most, GPA or experience?

My particular background, as someone nearing graduation: 

GPA:

I will likely finish with about a 3.05 ish GPA. I struggled hard and dropped out of my first school, then pulled together VERY well towards the end. Does this upwards trend count for something? 

Experience/Research:

After my initial struggles I found a lot of good opportunities and ended up on 5 projects total on things such as sounding rocket payloads and high altitude balloon launches that my school did with NASA, and later scored a year long JPL internship. I worked up to being some sort of student lead on most of these, and published a paper along the way.

Usually people say that to get into decent grad school you need a 3.5+ or else don't bother. But this (and most other) advice mainly pertains to those who have a GPA and not much else. What about when it is the other way around, where I have more experience then high grades?"

I mean I know how to code so I can do simple data structures and have surface level knowledge of advanced ones like trees, linked lists and advanced algos such as dfs and bfs but I definitely couldn’t solve problems around them at my state.

I wouldn't necessarily be looking at FAANG. I get that it's important to build experience before you can shoot for the moon, and so almost anywhere in tech where I can get a software APM/PM title is good with me.

**Demographics:** First Gen Asian Male, Southeast, Lower Middle Class, Competitive Public Magnet School

**Intended Major:** Computer Science, Music Minor

**Honors/Awards:**

1st place in regional Programming Competition

A couple of high placements in Cybersecurity CTFs, Top 5 State

Cybersecurity Club

Game Developer, Music Producer

Worked in Restaurant Business and Math Tutoring

**Essays:** I'm not great at writing eloquent/detailed essays but I think I had some great unique ideas and really know how to convey those ideas. My main essay is about jazz and others included passions in-game development/programming, analyzing jazz music.

**LOR:** Pretty good, both teachers knew me well and were involved in my extracurriculars.

**Results(Assume RD):**

**Rejected:** MIT(EA), Rice, WashU

**WaitList:** GTech(EA), CMU, Columbia, Emory

**Accepted:** Yale, UVA(EA), Duke, NYU, William and Mary, Couple In-State safeties.

**Final Comments/Conclusion:** I'd say that this cycle was really good for me for the sole fact I got into Yale/ Super surprised at the results, I'd say to all underclassmen to just live your life and pursue things you actually want to do. It really shows when you start writing about your EC's and actually have deep ideas about them. I notice that schools that had both strong liberal arts and a decent stem program like Duke, UVA, and Yale accepted me, while a lot of the more engineering-focused schools like Gtech, CMU, and MIT didn't accept. Part of it I believe is how much of my essays were about music and potentially a lack of professional coding experience/projects, and maybe a reflection of how well I'd fit into a school. Overall, I thought my application was strong, but average, with really nothing outstanding, but had a unique perspective."

g3jqg3,2,2020-04-18,CS major to Math PhD,polopower69,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/g3jqg3/cs_major_to_math_phd/,"Hi everyone.

I am a first year computer science student in India. I have always liked mathematics and have performed well in it. I want to pursue research in pure mathematics. I did some research on the internet and found out that it is indeed possible and people have done it in the past by having some 'relevant undergraduate/graduate level math classes' under their belt.

The problem with this is that my college does not offer any math classes except linear algebra, calculus(including multi-variable) and discrete mathematics. Here are the other math - related classes I can take as electives : computational geometry, theory of computation, probability and statistical methods, graph theory, computational number theory, parallel &amp; distributed algorithms and randomised &amp; approximation algorithms.

How should I go about things now? I have self-taught myself proofs and calculus and I am also good at algorithm analysis(my college has not taught me that yet).Here are the other ways, I found on the internet, that I think would help my cause -

Does self-preparing for GRE math subject test and scoring highly in it help showcase my skills?

Would doing a math heavy research internship in CS help?

Do letters of recommendation from CS faculty carry the same weight as a math faculty?

Is doing a masters in mathematics a better path?

What are the other ways in which I could show the admission committee that I have the required knowledge one would expect from a math major(assuming I can attain that through self-study) and that I can pass the qualifying exam by taking courses at that university?

What other math topics should I study? Do I copy a standard undergraduate curriculum or should I read advanced graduate texts too? Please specify the topics.

I want to do research in the US as there are much better institutions there. What advice could you give me for undertaking this journey? Feel free to even claim that admission in a top PhD program would not be possible if that is what you think.

Thanks for reading!"

I wanted to know which résumé formats are better ― which have a single column or multiple column.

I am a CS undergrad looking for an internship and my résumé has two columns. One person who reviewed my resume said that most of the ATS have difficulty parsing multi-column résumés.

On the other hand, single column résumé do not have enough space to list out multiple projects in a single page.

What do you recommend?"
g3nhb6,1,2020-04-18,Reverse chance: International student looking to study Physics,kidnee,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g3nhb6/reverse_chance_international_student_looking_to/,"Hi all! I'm a junior attending a US high school in Asia. My counsellor has suggested that I consider attending a selective US university, but I'm not sure where to start looking... If you have any recommendations to check out, I would be eternally grateful! Sorry if the formatting is whacky.

Location: I prefer to go somewhere where it gets cold, but I'd still be comfortable in hot weather. Specific area of the US is not a crucial factor for me, but I'd like to be able to go downtown or into the city and walk around and shop with my friends.  I also am looking to play competitive rugby either at the school or for a club (this is kind of niched, but I'm hoping someone on here plays).

Preferences: Overall ranking is not very important to me, but I am looking for a reputable, well-respected physics programme which will allow me to continue to grad school or find work if I choose to.

g3nl8k,125,2020-04-18,Some Thoughts for Those Struggling with Uncertainty,JamKieferson,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/g3nl8k/some_thoughts_for_those_struggling_with/,"Like many of you here, I've been admitted to bshcool to start in the fall, and the uncertainty of an online semester has had me questioning the value proposition of getting an MBA. I think the primary question a lot of people are asking is, ""If the first semester were online, is it worth it for me to quit my job and pay to go to business school?""

First and foremost, everyone's situation is different, so I have no intention of offering a blanket answer here. Second, I'm not here to offer arguments for how ""MBA applications rise in a recession and the markets will be great in two years so this is a great time to get an MBA"" - that's basically the whole concept right there... Rather, I can only speak to my situation and some of the considerations I've been mulling over in the hopes that they ring true with some of you who are feeling anxious and indecisive about the choice ahead of you.

One of the most common concerns I've heard from people is that a first semester online wouldn't allow you to ""get the full MBA experience"" - and that's true. But I guess I'm wondering what that really means... What is the full MBA experience, and how does it relate to *why I'm going to bschool?*

The  most important thing for me has been (and still is) clarifying *why* I'm really going to business school. In my case, I wasn't happy in my previous job, I knew I wanted to change industries and functions, so an MBA represents an opportunity for me to find a *job that excites me*, one where I can *solve more difficult problems and have more impact*, one that I *enjoy waking up to* every (most) day(s)*.* In my mind, I'll be able to accomplish this goal regardless of whether or not the MBA starts online (would love to hear dissenting thoughts on this point). The journey might not be exactly how I envisioned, but nothing really works exactly how you envision anyway. 

Deferment, for me, doesn't make much sense. I want to move on with my life, get to the next chapter, and waiting another year, even if it means getting a more traditional ""MBA experience"", seems like an unnecessary delay that's just going to put me a year behind in achieving my long term goals. 

I don't want to get too into the specifics on recruiting implications, but I heard an interesting opinion recently that resonated with me. Assuming a much higher percentage of digital recruiting and potentially fewer internship offers, a unique opportunity exists for students who are able to really clarify their long term goals, adapt to the present situation, demonstrate the ability to do good work in any environment, and be proactive about going after what they want. Certainly not saying the situation would be ideal, but I believe there are opportunities to be found amid the uncertainty, and driving toward a long-term goal or general long-term success would not be unduly hindered. 

A first semester online is far from ideal, but as a worst-case scenario, does that really change the opportunity I have for accomplishing my long term goals and fulfilling the *why* for getting an MBA? In my situation, not really. Sure, I may have less time to socialize, see some cool speakers, and participate in many of the 'in-person' elements of an MBA program, but I'll surely make friends in the remaining year and a half, I'll have access to the same alumni network after graduation, and I'll be able to get a job that's better than what I have now and start in on the next phase of my life *now* rather than waiting another year. 

Anyway, those are some of my thoughts, and they're certainly subject to change as we learn more - honestly this is mostly a helpful exercise for me in clarifying my thinking, but on the off chance it offers some hope or alleviates some stress for some of you out there, well then here you go. 

Good luck to you all in deciding what's best for your particular situation."

I have studied in IT for about 5 years, and completed intern roles for 3-4 businesses for about 2 years. I have attained my Certificate III in Cyber Security (From TAFE in Western Australia), so I do have experience in a lot of Cyber Security fundamentals.

I was looking at using my spare time (due to Covid) to earn a new cert, and figured that the Sec+ would be a great place to further my knowledge. Will I need more experience before attempting the Sec+?

I am primarily concerned as I do not have a huge amount of experience with networking fundamentals (how to calculate subnets, port forwarding, etc), but I do have experience with network security (encryption, IP Address blacklisting, network hardening, etc)

I am looking at completing my Certificate IV and Diploma in Networking next year, then aim for my CCNA. Should I wait until then to attempt my Sec+, or should I have a good enough chance with the experience I currently have?  


Any tips and answers are much appreciated!"

I've done some basic internet research about getting started with freelance development, such as finding a niche demographic, building up a portfolio, getting experience, etc. I am a CS undergraduate with only 5 months experience in an internship I had to leave due to transferring colleges. 

After I graduate college, I want to shift my career towards a direction where I have more control and freedom--to travel, pursue my hobbies, and choose work that doesn't make me utterly miserable. I don't want to remain stagnant in one spot for a long time, I want to be moving and acquiring connections and experience. I have two questions: 1. Does freelance enable you to do what I stated before? Can you travel while being a freelance dev or is it actually not any more feasible than working at a 9-5? 2. If I wanted to research further into how to start aiming for freelance, what in depth writings can I use? I'm looking for something more in depth than a typical internet blog. 

If you have any further questions or I've done anything wrong please let me know. Thanks!"

I applied to MBA with the intention of transitioning to a PM role in the Big Tech/hot tech start-ups in the US (have relevant PM experience), which will pay double than what I am currently making + have better progression (so I know it will make sense financially if I can secure these jobs), while also preparing myself to build my own tech companies/take senior management positions in my geographical region in the long term. 

However, I understand it is much harder now to get employment in the US, and when looking for pre-MBA internship I realized how easy it is to get PM roles in ""hot"" tech companies in my region with my current experience.  I may have to enter 1-2 paygrade lower compared to if I join post-MBA, but I won't have to spend US$250k and 2 years (which can be used to move up to the ladder). 

International alumni whom I have spoken to did say that international opportunities can even be better than opportunities in the US  (due to fast growth and the scarcity of people with strong credentials and management skill here), but I am not sure I have what it takes to get these opportunities. Seems like many of these opportunities are PE/VC, but I do not have the right background

I tried to justify paying for MBA (which will take up my entire saving with financial aid) by thinking that it will be the best two years of my life, but I am not sure anymore due to covid situation.

I know this is a very privileged problem to have, but hope to hear everyone's thoughts"

BS in Biology with CS  lower div req coursework

2 CS internships in startups totalling \~10 months

1.5 years at a 1000+ person public company

1 year at 'unicorn' startup -&gt; 30-40% total laid off - company was not able to generate projected revenue which lead to major cash flow issues.

15 months at 'unicorn' startup -&gt; 10% total laid off - company quoted issues due to pandemic, but the company has 3-6 months runway left and is struggling to raise the next round.

After getting laid off a second time, I'm focusing on applying for roles at FAANG, but I'm starting to wonder whether continuing to pursue front end / full stack roles is the right way to go.

1. How worthwhile will this opportunity be for the future and will it be helpful for getting into a masters/PhD program?



2. I understand that bioinformatics can be applied to many things and various disciplines of bio, so will I need to get experience in multiple industries before things click?




3. How much more does a stats background prepare me for bioinformatics as opposed to a comp. sci or biology degree?

I am currently a student in Australia, doing a degree in Software Engineering @ University Of Sydney.

I received an invitation to participate, in the online google challenge, and to be honest I bombed it pretty bad/didn't attempt anything because I was completely unprepared for it(assignments piling up).

I already have an internship ready at a big 4 (professional services) firm, but I hoping for some better opportunities

Now, I am just wondering, first how can I get better at these coding tests/exams. 

Second how can I not be nervous, when participating in these online tests, now face to face interviews IMHO are much easier than the online ones.

Now, the things I am planning on doing 

\- Purchasing a copy of CTCI in Java

\- Practicing on my premium leetcode account.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else I should be doing? **How can I get better at Data Structures and Algorithms. How can I be a better programmer overall? Any books I should be reading.**

My university offers a senior algorithms, course I can opt in to take, should I take it, it is more Maths heavy. Now I am fairly proficient at maths.

Finally, would taking up competitive programming as a hobby be wise?

Now I realise that there is alot experienced programmers/engineers in this reddit. Now from one engineer to another.

What are some things I should do, to excel in this field. I am already working on some projects and doing accelerated/advanced coursework.

I have a Github account, however I am not sure it is of high quality (approximately 15 repos, but then again quality over quantity.

Sorry this is long but please help, I have no one to talk to and I need someone.",arcticpenguin11,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g3swmz/are_parents_entitled_to_respect_sorry_this_is/,"I (20M) like a lot of other people have been displaced from my college campus and am now back home and it's tough to say the least. 

My parents are on the brink of divorce so things are tense in the house. My mother seldom leaves her room and my father occupies the entirety of the lower level. As for my relationship with him, its never been a good one.

Growing up, he was an absent parent. Initially, it was because of financial issues and then health issues, but we eventually got our feet under us again when I was around 6. After that he really had no excuse-- he would come home from work around 5:30 and would sit around watching TV or playing clash of clans and if one disturbed him he would lash out with shouting. He put food on the table for me and I know I should be grateful for that because not a lot of people even have that, but does that entitle him to his definition of ""respect""? 

For reference, his definition is to do what you are told to do and forbid the possibility of a unique thought or opinion, and in general, he has no regard for other people's thoughts. He's a person that thinks he knows everything and as a result, he jumps to his own conclusions about what someone is saying to him before they finish their sentence. He's an extremely manipulative personality and ""plays victim"" so that others will feed his ego by telling him he's always right. He has an extremely ""fixed mindset"" and it's sad to see because I know he could achieve so much more if he humbled himself and embraced a growth mindset, but I know this is a lot to ask of him. 

Anyway, it was my birthday a couple of weeks ago and my girlfriend had come over to celebrate. We were eating cake when he started bombarding her with really intense questions like: ""do you pray with your family every night?"",""why do you pray with them?"", ""do you believe in god"", ""what does religion mean to you?"" 

She was visibly uncomfortable because she understands who he is and didn't want him to judge her on her responses and was looking at me desperate for help. So I told her, ""you really don't have to answer him if you're not comfortable."" I then requested him, ""please stop barraging her with such loaded questions, you can see how visibly uncomfortable she is.""

He lost it and came back with ""don't disrespect me like that in front of her."" I didn't respond to what he said because of how absurd I felt it was plus my mother had just suggested we go upstairs so we walked away from the conversation. My girlfriend said she'd rather just leave so I walked her out and headed back to my room. Needless to say, he came banging on my door, aggressively demanding I respect him in his own house, which I really didn't feel what I said was disrespectful. So I tried staying calm but I lost it when he brought up my school saying, "" you think that because you go to Georgia Tech you mean something?"" I have worked my ass off to get to this school, and I know it comes from him being insecure about the fact that he got rejected from the school when he applied several years ago. So after some shouting back and forth, he ended the conversation with ""you have lost me as a father"" and as much as I wanted to say ""good, not like you were one in the first place"", I held my tongue because I knew it would just make things worse. I want to say that I think he's just extremely insecure about me because my school has put me on the trajectory he wanted for himself and he's watching my successes while belittling himself as being just an uber driver. On top of all that he's not on speaking terms with my mother and has no work right now because of Corona. 

I haven't spoken to him since and have found a place near campus and plan to live there for the summer semester. I'll be able to get by this summer on scholarship money, but I am worried about my next few semesters because I lost my internship to corona and my father had been paying my expenses up to this point. (granted my total cost is only around a few hundred, but each time I needed to ask for money I was terrified by what I would have to listen to just to get it).

I just don't know, am I crazy for thinking that even though he's my father, he doesn't deserve the respect he demands because he doesn't respect others?? Should I even say anything to him before leaving? Is there anything I can do?

Please help :("

As a student taking loans, earning money by publishing apps from my free time is encouragement for me to program, rather than work to get some extra spending money (yeah I know I'm more than likely make more money at a job, but I'd prefer to be programming at home. And also given the world circumstances). 

Do you guys think I'm better off just posting the code/apks to GitHub instead of publishing them when I go out and apply to internships. I understand that the recruiters like to comb through code to see if they have weird quirks that make them ""incompatible"" with the team. 

Is anyone aware of any Google Play policy to prohibits me from putting the Source code (but not the APK, people will compile it themselves) while having a published app.

How much do you guys think ""X app with 1k+ downloads and 4+ stars"" would matter over being able to read someone's code. I will be working on other projects, but I'm considering publishing Android apps for some side money."

It started January 2019, when I returned to college to finish the last semester of my freshman year. Now to preface I had a pretty bad roommate, but things got even worse the final semester. She only contributed passivley to the hell I endured, so were done talking about her. Just a couple weeks after the start of spring semester, I got a text from my mom. 

'Call me when you can.'

Uh oh. My heart started racing becuase we don't call unless it's something serious. I was walking back to my dorm and still had 20 minutes left to go. My mind was stuck on my elderly dog back at home. Ealry November of the prior semester my mom called and told me vets found a tumor on our dog and she might not make it to Thanksgiving break. Luckily she lived until I could see her during Thanksgiving and through winter break, all without showing discomfort. 
I was mentally preparing myself to hear my mom tell me they had to or need to put her down. 

I got back to my dorm room and called my mom. 
'Grandpa died.' silence. 
'Wait, grandpa, or grandad?'
'Grandpa.'  

I was shocked, speechless. My grandpa died during the middle of the night, seemingly out of the blue. I called my grandfather's grandpa or granddad depending on the side, and my granddad had be battling cancer for years at that point. That's why I needed to clarify. That's why my grandpa's death came with so much more of a shock. My grandpa's passing was also the first time I experienced a death in my immediate family. There wasnt going to be a funeral, just a memorial later on. 

The semester, and life, progressed. Still suffering from my hellish roommate, but as the semester passed there was a light at the end of the tunnel. I'll never have to see her again! Around Easter we had my grandpa's reunion. I wasn't super close with him, so time had healed the shock for me. The most difficult part was seeing how it affected my widowed grandmother and my parents. 

The semester finished and I started a summer job at home babysitting. I just wanted to make some extra money. That summer wasn't a horrible time, save for my mom hounding me as to why I didn't look for internships or a real job. But then my elderly dog started having accidents on the floor. Number one and two. My parents always said once that started happening it was time for the animal to go. As my dog didn't seem to be in any pain (she was already on arthritis medication) I argued back and forth with my parents that we can work around it, that they didn't need to kill her. Keep her in the kitchen so any mess will be easier to clean, make sure to let her outside more frequently. My parents did nothing to solve the issue so I solved it myself by buying dog diapers. 

The rest of the summer was uneventful. Come August it was time to return to college. I was in an apartment with two other roommates, and we got along fine. The semester was going well. Then I got a call late September. 
'Grandad died.'

My mind immediately flew back to the last time I had seen him. Just a month and a half ago before I departed for college. I almost didn't visit, but my mom reminded me I don't know if that will be the last time I would see him. In retrospect I should have known that myself; the cancer had really started to show. 

My grandad's death wasn't as shocking as my grandpa's, but still as sad. There would be a funeral mid October. I didn't have a car on campus, so the weekend before the funeral my mom came to pick me up. On the drive to my hometown she told me her and my dad are getting divorced. My parents were never happily married, so only the timing surprised me. No other family knows, so don't say anything at the funeral, I was told. Not that a funeral was a place to talk about anyways I told her not to worry. 

My grandad's reunion and the funeral passed. I needed to go back to school. The day I was planning on going back my mom told me this was the last time I will see my dog. They are going to put her down soon. I had mere hours to process that and say goodbye to her. The last time I spent with her was talking to and hugging her outside on the back deck. The whole drive down to school I stared at the bright red rose I got from the funeral earlier that morning. 

October finished and November began. I started asking about divorce details and who would go where. My mom was moving to an apartment in the same town mid November. My dad told me he would stay at the house for a while. A week before Thanksgiving break (also my mom's move out week) my dad told me he's moving out too. The same week my mom is. I.e. in 7 days. 
'So get you crap out', he said. 

Oh, my birthday was also over Thanksgiving break. I don't even remember how I spent my birthday. Probably with lots of tears. That entire week was a hectic move out process. Being a college student, I wasn't going to have much room to keep extra things. So many of my things I had to throw away or donate to Goodwill simply becuase no one would have any room for them. That week left me feeling numb. Seeing the house get gutted. Coming back to find some of my things already thrown away or taken somewhere by my dad. I didn't know the weekend of my grandfather's funeral when I said goodbye to my dog that I was saying goodbye to the house as I knew it too. The next time I would see it it would be empty, cold, desolate. 

The suddenness of the move and getting everything out left me bitter. Bitter at everything and everyone. My mom even told she felt sorry for as I was affected the most and the most negatively by all of this. My dad moved an hour away and my mom is in a single bedroom apartment. So I moved in with my SO for the time being. 

The fall semester finished and it was winter break. The normalness of college muffled the pain I was feeling. But returning back to my hometown for the holidays and realizing I wasn't going back to my house, that everything would be different ripped open the wound again. It was difficult to have happy holidays. This was the first time where I admitted to myself that I am extremely unhappy. I don't feel loved. I felt abandoned. 

I couldn't talk to my parents about it. One will not have serious conversations, and anytime I would talk to the other I just felt that they spoke to me condescendingly. Like I shouldn't be this upset. Like I need to grow up, I'm not a child anymore. 
Maybe that type of talk is what taught me to bottle every single emotion up in the first place. 

I survived the first awkward holidays as a new offspring of divorce. I returned to school in January and welcomed the normalcy and routine with open arms. Then, I think we all know what happens now. The vid spread and I am now back in my hometown living with my SO like the previous break. I saw and talked to Mom once before all the lockdowns were in place. She told me her and my dad had their mediation a little bit ago. She told me my dad didn't say my correct age during it. That if my college fund runs out he wouldn't agree to he and my mom splitting it 50/50 (for reference, with my scholarship I'm not expecting anything more than $2000 of debt, if that). The feelings of not being cared about and abandoned came back with a vengeance. 

The middle of March my dad said he quit his job at the beginning of the month so my health insurance (I was on his) will be gone in two weeks. A few days ago he told me he's going on a friend's cellphone plan and my service will be terminated in two weeks. I don't know shit about health insurance or finding a cell phone plan. I don't make much money. He dropped all of this on me without offering any assistance in finding a new plan or even point me in any direction. 

I'm hurting. I haven't healed (when could I have?)  I'm crying more and more, especially at night when I just breakdown. I don't know how to recover. I feel like this has worn down my soul. Living with my SO, I'm in the best place I could possibly be. Many of these changes are ones I would have to make eventually, yes. But the timing and the manner they occured in has left me exhausted, depressed, angry, lost, alone. Since January 2019 I've felt awful. And I can't help but just exist right now, bracing for whatever else is to come. To the few who read this through, thanks. I really just needed to get this all out. 

Tl;dr Starting January 2019, my grandpa died, my dog died, my other grandpa died, my parents got a divorce, one already has a new SO, I had a week's notice to move all of my shit out of my house (also during my birthday week), first awkward divorce holidays, my dad dropping me off his health insurance and phone plan"

I’m currently a sophomore studying Computer Science and cybersecurity. I’m interested in both subjects. I’ve received an offer for a SWE role at a big tech company for this summer. I’ve also received an offer to be a cybersecurity consulting intern for next summer at one of the Big 4 in consulting, and I need to give them a response back by early September. I’ve never had any experience in consulting and I’m open to this internship, but at the same time, I’ve never interviewed for FAANG for a SWE/security role and accepting this offer would mean that I’d be unable to interview at other companies. 

I was worried that if I take the cybersecurity consulting role for next summer (my junior yr) that it would be harder for me to get a SWE role at a big company my senior yr. Also, if I decline this offer would it be hard for me to apply for the same role at this company in the future? What do you guys suggest?"

I never expected to be placed in a situation like this. That's okay, because I guess no one ever did, no matter who you are. 

\--------------

The 4 years of what is a once-in-a-lifetime moment I would never get to relive they've passed. I've always been a planner, a strict planner with academics. Maryland Honors College with a scholarship, obtained a 4.0 GPA last semester with a 3.98 cumulative currently taking courses that are the **core fundamentals** to the degrees I am obtaining. 

Flipping through the string of 0s from my ELMs notifications this past week. Missed assignments; too much work, not enough time, extra work assigned, extra quizzes, extra projects, no cuts in work in integral classes despite lack of adequate lectures. Being someone who could barely pay attention to even something like Netflix, you could already imagine my struggles with trying to pay attention to pre-recorded lectures. My sense of self and my responsibility as a teaching assistant? All feel lost to me. 

This is beyond the fact that professors have already catered hard to make things less stressful for students by not requiring them to attend lectures during the times the classes were originally administered. This is the issue with the thousands of dollars we are still paying to teach ourselves on our own time, a skill that not everyone has when it's happening with over half of your classes. On top of this, this is an issue with professors assigning extra work as if we have all the free time on our hands. 

* I was in a lot of clubs where physical activity/interaction were crucial to the functioning of the club
   * lost hope even as board member in some of them
   * gave up completely
   * completely depressed over the fact that a lot of people counted on me to do so much good but now I've lost all sense of self and motivation and just haven't been opening GroupMe or anything as much because a lot of it is honestly just fucking depressing 
* Struggled with anxiety, depression symptoms, an eating disorder (which I was on the path to recovery, but relapsed this quarantine) 
* Victim of domestic abuse; severely disconnected from my family, especially my mother 
   * Being physically on campus was one of the ways where I was able to clear my mind off of a lot of issues affecting my life 
   * Don't want to go into too much race details, but my culture emphasizes strong connection to traditional, collective identity, and family. I feel very detached from my family due to a permanent mark left upon me by my mother's abusive actions yet each day during quarantine, they expect me to commit to familial tasks like household chores and helping and eating with family when I hardly have time to sleep/try to finish my work since I spend half of my day doing nothing but being depressed 
      * would like to hear thoughts from others struggling through similar situations 
   * this issue has flooded my mind to the point where I've been giving up social interactions (digital) just from the fact that my mind is flooded with anxiety from her and the whole uncertainty associated with being able to know when exactly I can leave the house for a good bit of time and not have to live here (renting another place/emergency housing is not an option so don't try to suggest it) 
   * parents offer no emotional/mental support; they don't believe in mental health problems because of the stigma and there's no hope in trying to talk them in; I get my ass beat up if I even start to cry for ""feeling weak"" 

I've avoided emails for class registration, lost a lot of care/motivation, lots of unfinished assignments. It felt like everything I worked for was taken away from me: my plans to study abroad, my plans to have a summer internship and live away from my family this summer, my plans to be on my own, my plans to finally have a better social life after struggling due to occasional social anxiety. Everything was going so well socially from January to February to early March...and it all shattered down. It felt like I used to work so hard to achieve some of these goals, yet, a situation completely outside of any of our control just took advantage of everyone. 

What's the point in even trying to put in more effort/plan more if I did it in the past and lost almost everything, from friends, to things that I used to enjoy, to almost having lost a relationship? It isn't helping how some people just say we might not be able to go back until like 2021/2022. I want to seriously think about dropping out for now, and putting everything on hold despite stigma from my community, or at least taking a gap year. Want to hear other people's situations and wonder how they have put up. Mostly just writing this to get off my chest.."

Hello r/cscareerquestions!

I am a 2nd year student that is an incoming business intelligence intern, I was wondering what sort of things I should just hear or even familiarize myself with even if it is just a little before I begin. I have spoken to both the manager of the department and HR; HR gave me a better idea of what I would be doing but it was still vague. They said that I would be working in the BI Department working with things such as AI and general BI work. I have had zero exposure to anything AI related so this sort of spooked me, but they told me that I will be doing a lot of learning in the first part of the summer. I just had a few questions what I could be doing to get ahead of the learning curve that I'm about to meet.

1. What software, programming languages, and OS do you BI professionals typically use, I search have searched on the internet and have been getting mixed answer.

2. In your experience what type of AI work have you done relating to BI?

3. Does this position have a mixture of both being at a desk and talking to other professionals, I specifically applied for this internship since I wanted to have a mixture of both being at a desk as well as interacting with others (I very much enjoy talking to people)"

Like many college graduates, I have been having severe difficulties landing any sort of job related to my field despite having internships and proven experience under my belt. Out of the countless applications I've put out, I've only been offered two interviews, one of which was cancelled at the last minute and then was told the position got filled, the other got to the final round of interviews but then was ghosted. Here's all that I've tried:

* I've sought advice on my resume and cover letter from numerous people, both inside and outside my field. One person's advice will often contradict another's. Get told hundreds of times my experience is good, I just need to word it better. Re-written resume and cover letter countless times, still don't see any improvements.
* I do have a linkedin and tried reaching out to recruiters at companies, maybe I'll get a response, but every time I've been eventually ghosted.
* Tried applying various companies and industries (live in DC area), since my education is so broad, but still don't hear back from anything.
* Reached out to my old internship company, said they were downgrading and had to let people go so they couldn't offer me anything. Said they would recommend me around, still haven't heard anything.
* Asked friends and former classmates if their companies were hiring, passed along my resume, still haven't heard anything.
* Tried a few networking events, never had much time to go to these because tied down at family business, still never heard back from any of the companies I spoke to.
* Any chance I get rejected via an actual person instead of an automated email, I always ask them why I got rejected. Obviously I word it better than that, but each time they don't tell me anything. I know legally they can't tell me anything, but it sure would be nice to know why I keep getting rejected.

I just don't know what else to do now. I feel like I've tried everything but nothing is working. I've been consistently told it's ""just a numbers game"" and to be honest I'm getting tired of hearing that. What's the point of constantly applying for jobs, getting ghosted or rejected, not knowing what you're doing wrong, and then doing it all over again. And now with this pandemic and looming recession, I feel that my chances of landing a job are even slimmer.

I don't know what to do anymore and I feel absolutely hopeless about the future.

**EDIT:** I'm sorry for being rude and dismissive. I know I shouldn't lash out at people that're just trying to help. I want to keep pushing forward, I really do. I just feel tired right now."

I'm currently in junior in HS, and for the past year I've invested a lot of time into learning coding and projects; also, given the situation with COVID, I have nothing but time to develop these skills for the foreseeable future

I am interested in learning/gaining experience aside from just technical skills, such as gaining real work experience, as well as learning about how startups run first hand, in addition to the myriad other things that are immediately relevant to real-world software development outside that *arent* just writing code.

My question is first, will interning (or volunteering, whatever you call it) at a startup help me learn about these skills and will it ultimately be a useful experience for someone who is interested in pursuing computer science in college and likely a related career in future? Or, will my time be better spent elsewhere?

Secondly, I am curious as to how I might go about beginning this. I got this idea of working at local startups by the recommendation of my CS prof at the community college I am concurrently taking classes at. I live in area where there is a decent amount of tech startups but I don't live in the big tech hotspots like San Jose, so I need advice regarding what exactly small startups might be looking for so I can maximize my chances of getting to work with them. I'm not expecting to be able to do much for them as a HS student, but I do want to hone my technical skills beyond just menial work (which has been my experience while working at local research labs; things like ""clean this beaker"", etc).

Finally, would a tech startup even be interested in taking a HS to help intern for them? Like I mentioned earlier, I have a decent amount of experience coding as well as a few CS classes from my local CC under my belt, but clearly this is very little compared to *many* other people. I intend to send emails out asking the local startups regardless, but I want to know what I'm doing first.

Thanks everyone"

g3yf2y,0,2020-04-18,Deciding On a College,A_Panchal,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/g3yf2y/deciding_on_a_college/,"So recently I was admitted to UIUC off the waitlist and as I only have two weeks left to make the decision I wanted to get some current student's inputs on the school. I am intending to pursue Mechanical Engineering as a career path and I am extremely interested in motorsports (I will be joining SAE). Besides this I'm also looking to do many internships throughout the summers and breaks I'd have. I am OOS for reference and the other option I have is Purdue University.

So my questions are the following:

1. What does a degree at UIUC give me career-wise that a school like Purdue won't? (Because I've heard that almost all Illini were admitted to Purdue)
2. How heavy is UIUC's commitment to research? Does it obstruct the university's career services for internships and co-ops?
3. What is the job placement realistically like for Mechanical Engineering Students? Is it all focused on the Masters and PhDs?
4. What's the social life like on campus? I know UIUC is the highlight of the town but what's a typical Friday night like?
5. Why did you choose UIUC over all the other options?"

This makes it virtually impossible to decide on... well basically everything in my life ever. I don't know who I want to be, what I want to do with my life, what I'd like for dinner, what task I should be doing next, etc. (I'm female, 24)
This inability to chose a path started to become a major problem for my career. I study literature and media culture and I'm actually having really good grades. I have quite high standards for what I can and want to achieve. But also, I have a talent in painting and always dreamed of pursuing a career as a freelance artist. 
So one day, I'm completely sure I'm going to be an artist. That I will finish university to please my dad, but that academic work is actually not good for me and that I will be a wild, free spirited person, following their own path and not the systems rules. I daydream, fuel my creative side and despise everything rigid and structured.
But literally one day later, after reading a tweet from a professor I really admire, I'm completely convinced again that I want to pursue an academic career! I suddenly have great interest in all those scientific texts and feel like becoming really structured, productive and a reliable worker. I think about doing my masters degree after finishing my bachelor and even working at university with these great minds I admire so much. 
(Those two options are only the main ones. There are a bunch of other smaller ones that occasionally pop up.) 
This constant change of direction makes it impossible to invest enough energy and dedication in either of those paths (whoever read ""Narziss and Goldmund"", it feels like I'm both of these in one person). I feel like I'm underachieving in all fields that interest me, because I never finish what I started and can't put in a constant effort. I'm currently in my 10th bachelor semester and have never even done an internship. I really don't know if it is just my anxiety, keeping me from pursuing an academic career, or whether I'm really not suited for it, despite being intelligent enough...
I just have all these intense emotions and epiphanies when ""choosing"" a life path and like 3 hours later my emotions steer me to the completely opposite direction! It drives me insane and makes me mistrust my own gut and decisions. 
And at the same time, life and the world feels like such an intense adventure to me, that I really don't WANT to decide on anything, because I can't bare giving up on those other options! 
I dunno, this has been a lot but can anyone of you guys relate and how do you/did you deal with it? 🙈"

Most things I see about coming up with projects says to choose something that interests you or that solves a problem that you have, but I don't have anything in my life that interests me enough to build a project around and I don't have any real problems that I would really be able to solve with programming.

I have social anxiety, so having people judging and assuming things about me based on their perception of my age doesn't help either...
I've never noticed that I looked younger than my age. In fact, when I was 15 and doing some work experience in a pharmacy, my colleagues thought I was an intern. It wasn't until I was in my senior year of highschool, that I realised. I was with a bunch of friends sitting down during a school carnival. A girl who was in year 9 (14 year old), told us ""silly year 8 kids"" to move to another spot, thinking we were younger than her. My friends and I are all Asian too, so that certainly adds to the whole looking young thing.

A whole new world of people constantly mistaking me for a child was about to begin, despite finally reaching adulthood.

When I was 19, my mum asked me to buy her a lottery ticket. The lady at the counter started placing her hands on her hips ""I'm not allowed to sell to you"" in a very condescending way, speaking to me as if I were a child. I asked her why not, as the legal age is 18 and I am over 18. She proceeds to ask me if I'm sure about it and to ""surprise her with my age"" I told her I was 19 and she still didn't believe me. I handed her my I.d and she stared at it in amusement. Turns out her son was also my age and apparently looks 15, so I didn't understand why she didn't believe me.

When I was 22, I tried to buy lottery tickets again. The lady serving me didn't ask for I.d but the girl working next to her (who looked about 18) was adamant that she check my i.d. The funny thing was the lady said looking young is a good thing and that I don't want to look old like the other girl.

Going shopping, buying food etc, I get people calling me names such as sweetie, hun, darling etc all the time. They're usually people who are younger than me, so that's pretty annoying. If I'm out during the day, I get looks from much older people, who must be thinking why I'm not in school. 
Sales people at department stores rarely approach me as I probably look like I am too young and wouldn't buy anything. Teenagers think I'm around their age, so they're constantly looking at me in judgemental ways, as teenagers tend to do to their peers.
People asking if ""I'm okay to sign this paper"" because they're unsure if I'm old enough to.
My family friends and distant relatives think I've just finished highschool and they always ask me what year I'm in. Even the relatives that I see every few months or so, forget how old I am and speak to me based on how old I look.
Whenever I go to the dentist, they ask me how old I am or if I'm over 18, (there's a children's list and adult list) despite me handing them my concession card with my d.o.b on it. 
During my previous job last year, customers would ask me what grade I was in or if I finished all my (high) schooling. Some would make comments such as ""you look really young!"" Or ""you look like you've just finished highschool"". 
Getting carded when buying alcohol and lottery tickets to this day. I haven't been to an R rated movie, but I'm sure I will get carded.

Bonus: last month, I went to sign up for a new phone service. After telling him that I wanted it under my name for tax purposes (I may be wrong, but what child has a job where using a mobile phone for work is essential?) and the guy asked me if I've turned 18 yet. 

Honestly, it's really starting to annoy me. I consider myself pretty well educated and having a decent professional career, with good knowledge in life. I just want to be taken seriously and not to be viewed as a child. 

Anyone else have similar experiences?"

A bit of background first:

I am an exchange student currently doing an exchange year in Germany. During my exchange year, I must do a mandatory internship (Pflichtpraktikum) at a German company or institute.

I study computer-science and want to apply to an internship related to computer-science (e.g. software development).

I had previously found an internship at the Fraunhofer Institute and was really happy that I had finally found an internship, and also in a field that I am really interested in (data science and machine learning), and that I was accepted.

Before receiving my contract, however, I was informed by my supervisor a few weeks ago that my internship was cancelled because he is doing Home-Office because of COVID-19 and can't supervise me anymore.

I am currently looking for an internship and hoping to find one in one of the companies that are in the city I am living in (Kaiserslautern) because I don't want to move to another city, given the COVID-19 situation.

As you can see, I am in a very desperate situation and really need to find an internship. If I don't find one, I won't be able to graduate next semester and have to wait an entire semester more in my home country to do an internship there.

Now onto my question:

Most articles about making a good German CV include a section about ""Hobbys"", where one lists their hobbies.

Unfortunately, I don't have many hobbies other than occasionally playing video-games. I don't want to list video-games as m hobby because I don't want this to reflect badly on me and make the person reading my CV assume I am undisciplined or anything. I can't think of anything else I can list as a hobby; I occasionally watch TV shows, I workout at home (but that's not really a hobby), and I watch anime sometimes. 

Is it really necessary to include a section about my hobbies? Would not including it also reflect badly on me?

Thank you for any and all answers! :) "

I’m currently finishing up my junior year at a top 50 school in the US (US citizen), majoring in Data Science and Business Administration. My GPA is kinda shit bc I always spent time working on side projects (3.0) but I have experience in project management and data science at a unicorn, marketing experience at a business big-n firm, SWE experience at FAANG (all internships), as well as pretty high involvement participating in my university’s research fair every year. 

I’m fairly certain that I want to go to grad school, but I’m not sure for what. I really want to get into VC, but it’s not how I want to start my career - thinking I want to either start a company or establish myself at a larger firm, then transition to VC. 

Ideally, I’d want to do a PhD, but I’m not sure if my grades are good enough yet, so if I do pursue that route, I’ll probably get my master’s first. 

I’m pretty sure I can get into a good MBA program if I wait a few years after graduating, since I can make up for my low GPA with high test scores and work experience, but I’m told that that doesn’t really help with a master’s in CS and that an MS program weighs academics more heavily. 

All that being said, I’d be fine with doing a PhD anywhere since I don’t have to pay money and it’s more research oriented, but with the cost of a master’s, I want to make sure the opportunities at the end are worth it, so I’m aiming for a top 10 program in either an MSCS or MBA. Which one would you say I have a better shot at? Is there anything I can do to offset my low GPA?

Edit: forgot to mention I can get good prof recs too"

I do not mean that in a depressed way: I mean it literally.

So my goal was to do an research internship this summer. I got into an chemical engineering REU at a top school. However, my goal for next summer (after junior year), was to do a company/industry internship. From then on, I would be able to choose my path of life and decide whether to go industry or research/academia.

Now, my research internship got cancelled. Fortunately, I still have a spot for next year. But, the issue is, what if I want to do industry? By the time I graduate out of college I would only have a research internship that doesn't build skills for the industry. As much as I am interested in getting a PhD and becoming an academic, that is such a scary commitment. I want to be sure that this is what I want to do before I committed to 5 years of my life.

So yes, I have no idea what to do with my life. I have no idea if I want to become an engineer or a scientist. And now I feel like without having an internship in BOTH areas, everything is a gamble now. Anyone relate with this?"

How does your job handle the current limitations in place with COVID-19?

* And do you believe this is overall a negative, or a positive for the company? As in, will the company generally learn from this and become better or stronger from it in the future?

With the current limitations, how do you personally make sure you keep up with your tasks, making sure you don’t drift off and end up behind.

* Have you noticed or had to talk a co-worker up because they had trouble keeping up with their tasks?
* And how did you handle that?

This one is more related to the aspect of actually getting a job; What did you do that made you stand out from the rest? Did you do something special? Or was it a derivative from an earlier internship?

What advice would you give to a newer person within the world of game-development to stand out more, have a higher chance of getting a job, allow them to be noticed."
g4cwqu,4,2020-04-19,"extreme social anxiety - how to deal with regret, and how to improve my life?",sport54123,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/g4cwqu/extreme_social_anxiety_how_to_deal_with_regret/,"I am 28 years old from Canada. I moved from South America with my family when I was 11. 

Ever since I remember (since I was 2 or 3) I have been extremely shy and anxious. Kids at school would always comment how shy I was and how little I spoke. In south america I finished until grade 5, and then I moved to Canada. Shyness and speaking a different language at school made things a lot more difficult. It was very tough to make new friends for me. My parents also sent me to a summer camp in the summer for a few years and remember kids always making fun of my accent, and one kid especially made a song about it. High school was difficult, I was often alone, and never reallly had any real friends. I tried to fit in but was never integrated to any groups. In grade 9 when I started people did make some effort to get me involved with them but I was so shy and socially anxious that I avoided them. Then, later in the year, I tried to make friends and it became really tough. This never improved throughout high school.

I became day camp counselor for two summers in high school. I thought I would get out of my shell like that and even that did not work. 

Then university came, and ended up deciding staying at home for university. This is one of my regrets. Every single day I think what would have happened if I have gone aways for university. If things might have been different. One of the reasons I did not go away, was because a) scared I would not fit in, and people would make fun at res and b) in my culture, people dont usually go away for university, they stay at home

University was tough. Again, never really fit in with anyone. I decided to study engineering.. After my first year of university, I decided to be a camp counsellor at an overnight summer camp. I felt i was bullied quite a bit by other counselor, and at the end of the summer, I was voted the most socially awkward counselor at camp. One of the most embarrasing moments of my life. Also, on visitors day, the mother of a fellow counselor apparently asked his son, if I had some sort of mental problems. And she did not event interact with me. That really hurt. Other counselors also never took me seriously and made fun of my acceent.

During second year of university, I decided to join a fraternity in university. It gave me a temporary group of ""Friends"" but again, i felt i never really fit in. I was so socially anxious that I never told anyone that I was in a fratenity for fear of what they think of me. I was always scared my engineering classmates would find out so I always hid it, and was extremely scared of being caught. The fraternity gave me possibility to go to parties that I would not have been able to go otherwise.

I becams ""friends"" with a fellow person from the same country in the fraternity. I have always been really closed off with everyone and never told him I had a sister in the USA, or a brother in the US who was a phd. I was afraid I would be judged for being wealthy. Now, he messages me once in a while on facebook, and I am scared of telling him about my siblings because I am extremely afraid he will be mad at me for never having told him I had siblings in the US. I also did not mention about my sister for fear he would make fun if she was good looking. That happened to me in the past.

During my third year of university i joined a music club in the university and became part of the board. I felt this was a good way to make friends. Again, never really became close with anyone.

I took an internship after my third year, and worked at an office for the first time. My fellow intern, who was from another university made me feel really bad about myself constantly. He even denied taking me on his car for lunch when the boss told him to. 

I took improv classes after university for two years but even though they were really fun and worked in the moment, after couple months the effect of the improv classes faded.

Been working for the last 4-5 years and I feel drained. I quit my new job in january after 3 months because i was dreading waking up. I was going to go on an organize trip abroad for 4 months to be an intern but in the end i did not. Part of it was because of fear people would make fun about my poor social skills. Then i regretted my decision and looked for other programs but then the virus came in March so this plan was out of the question. I ended up finding a new job that starts in 2 weeks. The only thing i dont like is the hiring manager was looking for someone to stay there for a long time, and i do not like that. 

Anyhow, how can i deal with the constant regret? one of the regrets I have is having gone away for university. Also, not going on an exchange program at univeristy although I never really thought about it when i was in university.

Also, I have always hid things and lied a little about myself. For example, not having told people I had siblings. Scared people will be really mad if they find out I do. Sometimes, i want to say that my oldest brother had two kids but i do not because they do not know I have a brother in the first place. Also, never told people what my parents do, or where I have i travelled to, or that i used to play tennis tournaments, or that I was a camp counselor.

Another thing i lied during university was the high school I went to. I went to a religious private school. For fearing of being judged as wealthy, I just said i went to a public school. Now, I really regret that.

Another issue i have now is dating. I vee been on a few dates from online apps but really scared getting close and girls finding out about my non existent sexual experience. How can i deal with that?

During school, university, and work, there has always people that made fun of my poor social skills and how shy I am. It's been really challenging living like that. 

Sorry for the really long rant - I want to get better. I want to make friends but it is just so tough, especially now. Ive been seing a therapist for the last 3 years. I started a new therapist a 1-2 months ago. Ive made some progress with them but lately i feel ive regressed a lot. I have really low self esteem, and I extremely nervous about people judging me."

GPA: 3.99/4.0 unweighted - One B in Calculus BC sophomore year. I made up for it with a solid A second semester and a 5 on the AP test. My first semester in 10th grade was a bit rocky with several A minuses and the one B in AP Calc BC but going from there, I had very solid grades with A's and A pluses

&amp;#x200B;

SAT: 1580

ACT: 35

SAT II Math 2 - 790

SAT II Biology - 800

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*AP Classes\*\*: I have consistently taken the most rigorous courses available to me (our school is pretty weak when it comes to AP course selection). My AP classes and scores are: AP Biology (5), AP Calculus BC (5), AP Chemistry (5), AP Physics 1 (4), AP US History (5), AP English Lang (5), AP Government (TBD), AP English 4 (TBD), AP Statistics (5), AP Physics 2 (TBD)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Extracurriculars\*\*: I have good ones that mesh well with my career goal of med school and neuroscience. I also have some others that will stand out from other premed kids.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Leading member and captain of our school's high powered rocketry team - we compete in Team America Rocketry Challenge (TARC), and placed 16th in the nation at Washington DC last year. We have also been invited to Huntsville Alabama by NASA to participate in the Student Launch Initiative to launch a huge rocket with an experimental payload. It's normally for college students but we are a pretty accomplished team netting about 20k in scholarships from Boeing, Aerovironment, Aerojet Rocketdyne, etc.

\-10th grade UC cosmos accepted but shut down due to coronavirus :(

\-10th grade summer plan - nonprofit - I have two viable ideas with connections and have already pitched them. Without disclosing my plan it will be meaningful and not come off as something I did for my application. POSSIBLE EDUCATIONAL YOUTUBE OR NONPROFIT ETC OR NONPROFIT INVOLVING GETTING TECH DONATIONS THROUGH CONNECTIONS I HAVE AND PARTNERING WITH LARGER ORGANIZATION TO PROVIDE A SOURCE OF FREE TECH FOR THEM TO DISTRIBUTE

&amp;#x200B;

\- 11th grade summer RISE at Boston University.  month-plus long program in computational neurobiology. Did research and presented OR SIMR at stanford which is a cost free research internship for medicine over the summer and you actually get a stipend for working there.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Academic Decathlon Captain winning several medals 9-12th

&amp;#x200B;

\- I've worked at Kumon all my years in high school. In addition to Kumon tutoring I tutor on the side at school.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I finished Calculus BC in 10th grade and went on to take classes at community college like multivariable and diffeq's

&amp;#x200B;

\- UCLA Math Circle, a pretty selective program where you attend math seminars and learn about higher math topics with graduate student mentors.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have been teaching high level math classes at my local Math Circle for a couple years now.

&amp;#x200B;

\-skiing - recreational but good enough to be sponsored if I pursued that (means nothing for chancing because - have not gotten sponsored due to no longer being in close proximity to my home mountain so I've sort of given up on that)

\-I play Tabla, an eastern percussion instrument and as an Afghan American it is a way for me to express my culture and heritage.

\-Exceptional essays by college admissions counselor/expert's standards (already begun working on them)

\- Westminster free clinic medical internship - providing free medical care. It's an actual internship rather than ""hospital volunteering"" 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Finally, I think I will be able to seal the deal with neuroscience research with a professor from Caltech that I know personally. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Recommendations\*\*: I have recommendations from my AP Biology teacher, AP English lang teacher, and superintendent. My Superintendent who is the organizer of our Rocketry team. He and I are very close and his letter is very meaningful as are the other previous teachers who I am also favorites of. I have really good relationships with teachers so my recs will be close to 10/10 from all. I know for a fact that my superintendent will note me as the number one student he has come across.

Had just started a job a couple of months ago after my graduation. I already had about a year and a half experience before my master's so this is not my first job by any means, but it was my first job in a new country. Pay was pretty decent.

Anyway, I was in the most toxic environment with the worst boss I've ever faced - with micromanagement down to the name of file and variables (which were far from the standard naming convention in case anyone is wondering), impossible deadlines to meet (which I learned later he was just using as a power play) and became extremely insecure when I did manage to complete those by the deadlines. Blocked me from meetings with everyone higher, all the interviews that I was previously attending. Also, I would like to add that he was technically incompetent and full of ego, rejected ideas just because they came from me and had totally useless suggestions instead. Every day became a struggle, with him breathing down my neck for as long as I was in the office, nitpicking every single thing, saying ""I don't want to micromanage but.."" and doing the precise same thing. I could not even use the washroom for 15 min without him asking where I was. There were 3 people in the team but the throughput was of 1 because he could not tolerate anyone working separately till he wasn't working on it as well. In addition, the only other person in the team was condescending about any questions I asked. I was treated with absolute disrespect (I've been treated with more respect when I was an intern at other places) and even though I was actively looking for new jobs, finally toward the end of it, I didn't have the energy even to apply for a new job as I was so physically and mentally exhausted from everything. Fortunately, I was laid off a few weeks ago and I can now see the full damage it caused to my physical and mental health, and I believe the layoff was the best thing to happen to me.

I've worked in around 3 different places apart from this, and every time I had an amazing boss and exceptionally helpful co-workers.

The thing is, reading so many similar posts on reddit,  and in so many other places with such similar stories, I've lost motivation to apply for new jobs because I can't take another job like that - I just can't. Even when I think of applying for a new position, I get flashbacks of this. I am okay financially for a couple of months without a new job but I can't stay like this forever, and also I know job search can take a few months especially in this covid 19 environment, so what do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Memory and flashbacks from a previous job preventing me from applying to a new job, but I need a job to survive"

Graduating with a BSc in Computer Science this august and have 2 Internships under my belt. Job offer delayed due to Covid-19.

Credit Card Debt: $2000

Student Loans $25,000

I am thinking going into a Master of Computer Science online each course cost $2100 and there are 10 courses, I wanted to do 3 Courses a year starting August. I got into the program but still debating.

I am also very interested in leaving Ontario all together to a less expensive province, preferably with a work from home setup, I found some places around $100,000 with the mortgage being $400 to $500 max.

I plan on paying off the credit card and closing it first, any advice on balancing the rest of the 3 options, Student Loans, Housing,Masters program. Is it naive to try and accomplish all 3 within the next 3 years, or should I focus all of my attention on Student Loans, I'm pretty set on the Masters Program because I feel there will be a time I would regret not taking the program.

TLDR.Debating between paying off $25000 student loan, Masters Degree($22000(Pay as I go-no loan), Buying Property."

Anyway I’m gonna be graduating but COVID szn has affected the job market pretty bad at where I live. Companies are mostly on hiring freeze, and have rescinded internship offers and job offers, or are just on the fence when it comes to confirming someone after an interview. 

I haven’t really put in much effort to find a job even before covid became severe, went for one second round tech interview but I flunked it because I was caught off guard about the question. I spent one week to practice but just didn’t practice that qn. 

Was also discussing with my friends and they were talking about how hiring freeze may go on 1-2 years... 🤔🤔🤔 i was really worried about getting a job especially because some of my peers put in the extra effort to interview more than me. In the end I just put my mental health first and focus on schoolwork plus health (get adequate sleep daily and ensure I exercise few times a week).

My bf said that I need not worry about job, and I’m welcome to go work with him 😂 I asked my friends about it and they say nooo they wouldn’t work with their bf/gf. But I’ve worked with my bf on school project before and it was fine, nothing personal was taken, and it just boosted the amount of time we spent with each other. Also, I know the boss from doing a project together as well. Well... honestly my skill set would be useful for them. However I must admit bf working there is a main factor why I would want to work there too lol. Otherwise it’s not really a “want” but I’ll still consider...

Other than that I could work for my parents too. 

Or should I try to spend idk how long looking for another job? I do have some alumni networks that offer referrals to some pretty large companies that are apparently still hiring.... tbh that’s kinda my dream first job but I would need to intensely grind interview qns before those too. 

If I factor in job and interview anxiety, and upgraded difficulty of looking for a job (I would suppose with constant demand from people who are graduating, and less supply... more competition right?), then the bf option seems the best. Idk if it’s a suicidal move career wise tho"

g4k33j,1,2020-04-19,"Australian that was planning to arrive on a working holiday to Canada this month and can't arrive until the lockdown's lifted. Looking to start my career after being caught in the 'no job, no experience' loop. Any advice would be appreciated.",raphtafarian,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/g4k33j/australian_that_was_planning_to_arrive_on_a/,"Hi  there, I graduated at University back in 2016 specialising in Games  &amp; Interactivity. I knew I faced an uphill battle entering the  workforce in Australia but I didn't expect to still be struggling many  years later. During my final year of Uni, I was working on a video game  called Hyper Jam that recently released on the Switch, after being out  on Xbox One, PS4 and Steam for most of 2019. The game managed to get  green lit on Steam Greenlight during PAX Aus 2016, where I and the rest  of the team were presenting the game in the Indie section.

During  2016, I got to briefly work full time for an Agriculture Analysis  startup building a demo environment using Unreal Engine 4. The people  there were very impressed with my leadership skills and the level of  detail I provided when marking my changes in the git repository for  other programmers to see. I'm not a programmer but I know enough about  programming to know that adding comments for other programmers to  understand what you're doing is expected and appreciated. Anyway, once  the demo was done, it was a wait and see if Huawei or other investors  would pick it up. The demo went well but the CEO of the company decided  to move onto a GIS platform and didn't have work for me.

At  the start of 2017, I left working on Hyper Jam as the Directors (also  lead software engineers) were having a tough time securing funding. I  left to pursue other opportunities.

When  I graduated, I planned to explore similar fields such as digital  marketing, PR, UI or anything to do with digital media or the design  landscape as the opportunities in the Games Industry are very hard to  come by. However, navigating the job market in Australia has been  exceptionally brutal, demoralising and honestly confusing. I've had  plenty of interviews, but I tend to get knocked back for not having  enough experience.

I secured in  2017 a 2 month internship with an International eLearning company. I  largely did QA for the content team and prepared courses for  translation. I also had a project working with a client in Myanmar,  preparing a sort of example course for ESL students to assist the  company to secure new clients.

2018  was a disastrous year where I got even fewer interviews and at this  point was basically constantly going through cycles of unemployment and  short term positions. I had many interviews where I was shortlisted but  then told that they were looking for someone Senior or someone who had  more experience.

The beginning of  2019 looked hopeful when I got a job as a camera operator filming live  TV for the Australian Open. This was a great opportunity to interact  with some of the people who were in similar situations to me. I also  finally broke the cycle of short term gigs then back to unemployment by  getting a supermarket job. It's a massive step back but at least I'm  getting something consistent on a weekly basis.

g4k8m7,0,2020-04-19,Asking to WFH for summer internship?,throwawaybean12,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/g4k8m7/asking_to_wfh_for_summer_internship/,"While I understand this may be a weird question, it's mainly due to the unique circumstances that we're all in. Let me provide some context. My internship is in San Francisco, but I live a little less than 2 hours out. Originally, I was supposed to move to SF for the summer in order to be closer to my internship and received some assistance for housing. Of course, due to the current circumstances the people at the company informed me not to find housing in SF (plus it would be very difficult at this point anyway) and that I could work remotely, although I would be asked to come into the office once lockdown restrictions are lifted. I feel very lucky to be in a position where I can do so, so I don't want to seem ungrateful or not hardworking.

We talked last week about the internship and they said that if we were to return to the office, then I could come in a few days a week or commute every other week and WFH the next week. However, I feel that this would be incredibly difficult for me to commute 4+ hours on a given day to get to work, especially since I do not have my own car so I would need to take public transportation. Frankly, this would be extremely tiring for me but I also want to keep this opportunity. I also cannot move to SF as I have no idea if/when restrictions will be lifted so we may be remote for the rest of the summer anyway, in which case I would have no reason to move. I live with older parents who have immune conditions, so of course I would not want to expose them as they are going to be staying inside for the foreseeable future. I want to express to my internship that I would prefer to WFH exclusively, but I'm not sure if this is a reasonable ask or if I would come off as ungrateful. Is there a way in which I could ask them to allow me to work remotely entirely this summer?

g4lgpa,0,2020-04-19,"Australian that was planning to arrive on a working holiday to Canada this month and can't arrive until the lockdown's lifted. Looking to start my career after being caught in the 'no job, no experience' loop. Any advice would be appreciated.",raphtafarian,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/g4lgpa/australian_that_was_planning_to_arrive_on_a/,"Hi there, I graduated at University back in 2016 specialising in Games &amp; Interactivity. I knew I faced an uphill battle entering the   workforce in Australia but I didn't expect to still be struggling many   years later. During my final year of Uni, I was working on a video game called Hyper Jam that recently released on the Switch, after being out   on Xbox One, PS4 and Steam for most of 2019. The game managed to get  green lit on Steam Greenlight during PAX Aus 2016, where I and the rest   of the team were presenting the game in the Indie section.

During   2016, I got to briefly work full time for an Agriculture Analysis   startup building a demo environment using Unreal Engine 4. The people   there were very impressed with my leadership skills and the level of   detail I provided when marking my changes in the git repository for   other programmers to see. I'm not a programmer but I know enough about   programming to know that adding comments for other programmers to   understand what you're doing is expected and appreciated. Anyway, once   the demo was done, it was a wait and see if Huawei or other investors   would pick it up. The demo went well but the CEO of the company decided   to move onto a GIS platform and didn't have work for me.

At the start of 2017, I left working on Hyper Jam as the Directors (also   lead software engineers) were having a tough time securing funding. I   left to pursue other opportunities.

When   I graduated, I planned to explore similar fields such as digital   marketing, PR, UI or anything to do with digital media or the design   landscape as the opportunities in the Games Industry are very hard to   come by. However, navigating the job market in Australia has been   exceptionally brutal, demoralising and honestly confusing. I've had   plenty of interviews, but I tend to get knocked back for not having   enough experience.

I secured in   2017 a 2 month internship with an International eLearning company. I   largely did QA for the content team and prepared courses for   translation. I also had a project working with a client in Myanmar,   preparing a sort of example course for ESL students to assist the   company to secure new clients.

2018   was a disastrous year where I got even fewer interviews and at this   point was basically constantly going through cycles of unemployment and   short term positions. I had many interviews where I was shortlisted but   then told that they were looking for someone Senior or someone who had   more experience.

The beginning  of  2019 looked hopeful when I got a job as a camera operator filming  live  TV for the Australian Open. This was a great opportunity to  interact  with some of the people who were in similar situations to me. I  also  finally broke the cycle of short term gigs then back to  unemployment by  getting a supermarket job. It's a massive step back but  at least I'm  getting something consistent on a weekly basis. I'm still  underemployed  but it's at least kept me somewhat more sane, hopeful  and feeling more  productive.

The  decision to leave  Australia came when I didn't make it to the 3rd  interview for a Studio  Coordinator position for a post production film,  tv and sports company.

To give you a little background, I do have pretty good grades in university and have lots of leadership roles. Also had an almost perfect score in an English assessment (TOEIC) which I believe could help on my resume. I'm also good at writing up reports, explanations, and presentations.

What are some things a student should know before entering their 2nd year of university?

Currently, I know: C, C++, a bit of Java, HTML, CSS, and Git. I have 2 side projects in Python and I am working on one in C++.

I feel as if I dont know enough, and that I should know alot more, considering that I see alot of first and second years from other universities getting internships at Big N/unicorn companies.

My goal before I enter second year is: learn Android development and make an android app on the playstore, along with learning JS to make a website.

Now for those of you that have done internships before, do you guys think that this is a decent portfolio to land some solid internships for next year (I wont really be going for Big N next year, maybe after I have cometed an internship I might go for a Big N company, but rather companies like IBM, Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc......)"

Given the strength of the business school and my pursuit of that degree first, all my internship since 1st year have been at business firms in various roles, but nothing requiring technical programming knowledge.

I am currently in my final year, with one more semester in the fall of 2020 before I graduate. I had a data science analyst role lined up for this summer but unfortunately, the firm is no longer able to take me. I wasn't overly excited about the role as I don't believe it was technical enough.

I have come to really grow fond of CS work and the freedom of being able to build what I can imagine. The world of data science and machine learning has also been all I've focused on over the past year and I know my skills have grown quickly, and I hope to keep growing them.

So far, I have been working on various projects, most recently a model for predicting NBA match outcomes (@ a 73% accuracy).  I guess what I'm wondering is, I go to a university that isn't exactly a top-tier target CS school, I am graduating with a CS degree, I enjoy it a lot, especially data science, but I have never had a technical internship, let alone at a Fortune 500 firm.

To be completely frank, my aim is to work at a Quant Fund such as Jane Street, Two Sigma, D.E Shaw, among others. I am less so wondering how difficult it will be, but rather what do I need to do in order to achieve this goal? Does anyone have any advice for a lost student during these times :(

EDIT: I also want to clarify that I am not exclusively looking to work at the big trading firms, I just want to set a higher goal and work towards that and reap the benefits even if it were to not follow through. Hopefully that makes sense."

Unfortunately, without a strong reason for learning computer science, I find it extremely easy to get discouraged when things get too difficult. Either that, or I get caught up in all the details and lose my motivation. To avoid this I typically go back to the reasons why I'm doing this in the first place, which is to make my parents proud and prove to myself that I'm capable enough to pursue something like computer science. Of course, there are the reasons everyone knows like job security and a nice salary, but I was wondering what are your ""why""s?"

The reason why I am posting this is because I applied the previous year, with less experience and worse grades and I managed to score a technical interview, which I then didn't get past.

I apply again this year, with one internship under my belt from another company and a better GPA, but this time I didn't even qualify for a technical interview?

I am not sure the reasoning behind this as I am now in my final year of university (which is a preference for this program), I have more experience, a better constructed CV and better grades. I'm not sure if Amazon does a darts approach to selecting applicants, but I just don't understand how I don't even qualify for the technical round.

I'm not trying to bitch or complain that I didn't get in, it's just that I am far more qualified and arguably a better candidate than I was the first time round yet I don't even get a chance to prove myself AND I applied early.

If anyone has experienced this, is there a reasoning behind this? I don't think this has to do with Covid-19, since they did not explicitly state this in their email (plus why would they even advertise the position).

It's frustrating because I've worked hard to to get an internship at Amazon, yet my friend just applied willy nilly and passed all the interviews last year and scored an internship, when I know he isn't as qualified as I am now."

I have also mentioned to them that I wanted to complete a MCompSci at the University of Warsaw simultaneously which might be one of the reasons they've told me that.

g4u46u,3,2020-04-20,Should I quit even if I was hired back in IT job ?,browniex18,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g4u46u/should_i_quit_even_if_i_was_hired_back_in_it_job/,"Hi everyone,

I know I am probably gonna be judged for making so many bad choices that led me here asking you a question on reddit. I am just really in need for different perspectives here. I do **not** live in USA and job perspectives in around here isn't bad at all.

I graduated a couple years ago in software engineering, I loved studying in that field, because I love learning and the projects we did were so interesting. I was often a team leader, because I was really motivated and often did the project planning, went to a startup weekend pitching my ideas and go to conventions. I was a very active student. The more I progressed and the more I did internships the more I became disinterested. At the end, I did not really study at all, did the bare minimum and since I had excellent grades previously, I could finish with a good average. I thought it was just me being tired of school.

I went to work in multiple jobs in multiple types of companies. I quit my current job back in december because I thought I had a great opportunity (IT-related) but it was a disaster. I had an house to pay and the job was so financially unstable, so I pratically begged my old employer to hire me back, since I had a good counter-offer to keep me there. I tried large corporate jobs and startups, preferring the latest.

I went to carreer counseling one year ago to understand what fit me more, and me being so pragmatic, software engineering and construction were top two. I thought it was just that I needed to find a job with better management. It's been since I graduated that I complain that I hate my jobs...

I now find myself completely unmotivated by everything computer-related, I am so sick of sitting all day working at a computer and I avoid it at all costs whenever I can. I am so unproductive...

I'm thinking of going back to engineering school but in construction engineering, since I won't be sitting on a desk all day, and I have numerous dreams about real estate development (I am now a landlord and love the challenge). But it is quite a sacrifice for me, financially. It also involves me moving cities, and I would go back to my parent's town, which is great. Although all my friends will be very far away.

The problem is, I told my company I wanted back in, and they will never expect me to leave again, I feel so bad and it's not fair to them. I had asked for more mentorship and more involvement in the product development and the opposite happened. It's even worse since covid19 : we are remote and only have one meeting per two weeks and do not really have any part in the product development, because our bosses all speak in private. It's ridiculous. I do not know how to feel about this. I had been offered a manual job and I really want to try other stuff, explore what I love before I go back to school in one year and a half.

Would you rather stay in the company for a while just not to loose credibility or would you just leave to explore other opportunities ?"

I had originally started a Bio undergrad in 2014. Uncontrolled depression led to my dropping out after the first semester. I worked for 3 years pulling minimum wage until I decided to start over my education and applied to community college. From community college I transferred to the local state school. 

Community college was supportive but did not prepare me for post-bachelor plans. I have only been able to get a research internship my junior year once I had transferred. The problem was lack of exposure, if anything. I know I could have done more those first two years.
I'm approaching my senior year and I only have one year of research behind me. I have not thought of volunteer work until now, almost at the end of junior year. I have only established contact with a spare few professors. My summer internship prospects are completely destroyed by coronavirus. My GPA is 3.77. My depression has come back when weighing all these options and my current grades are much below that mark. Because of the virus my university has allowed every class to be pass/fail which they will all appear as on my transcript.

I want to be a wildlife researcher and nothing else. I am comfortable scraping the bottom as long as I am scraping the bottom outside in the field. Do I even have a chance at pursing a graduate program? Would I be able to find myself in a PhD program? Will those pass/fails hurt my chances even if they dont hurt my GPA (they include Ochem 2, Mol/Cell bio, and physiology)?

I am trying to get my foot in the door. I am currently taking classes to receive a undergrad GIS certificate at the University of West Florida, I also have my Associates of Arts and I plan on transferring to UF for a online bachelor degree once I am done with the GIS certificate in December. I have been reading a lot of other posts here that has made me understand that I should take a few programming courses to help me out. To start off I don’t know much about this type of work environment. I am a server and never have been in a office or professional environment. I would like to work for the government doing something with GIS. I have been looking at local jobs but I feel like I am under qualified. I just need some insight. I don’t know what degree I should be considering, UF has 2 degrees in [B.A. Geography ](https://ufonline.ufl.edu/degrees/undergraduate/geography/) and [B.A. Geography (environmental geosciences)](https://ufonline.ufl.edu/degrees/undergraduate/geography-environmental-geosciences/), or should I consider a [B.S.

Is there any difference between a geography degree vs a computer science degree to employers? Would one be considered to be less or more valuable? Would I need to know something about geography if I choose the C.S. Degree? Again I have no experience and I do have a portfolio of my work that I have currently been doing for my GIS classes. Also why is it that some government jobs like zoning or planning for example will accept a geography degree and some GIS knowledge?"

g4xz2h,2,2020-04-20,College Expulsion and Future Prospects,nothopeless97,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g4xz2h/college_expulsion_and_future_prospects/," Hi everyone, I hope you all are safe and well during this quarantine season. Make sure to get a lot of nutrition, exercise (Even a little bit), and try to keep yourself busy doing things that will make you better as a person.

A little bit about me—I am a 22 year old college student who grew up with everything I could have asked for. I grew up with a solid education, parents who love and support me through strong moral principles and financial support, great friends, and opportunities that are not offered to everyone. I have strong moral fiber and I try to live the best life I can, and one of my main values is growth and progress.

Anyway, the main reason I am posting this is because I want to talk about my past and my future, and gain some insight on my future.

Backstory: 

I attended a prestigious college in the Eastern side of the U.S., and I had the time of my life for three years. I got a great friend group, I was well known on campus for being the light of the room, and took the initiative on a lot of club activities, on top of being a fairly well student in my classes.

In 2018, I got expelled because I was accused of two women in my friend group for assaulting them sexually. Just to be clear, I DID NOT COMMIT WHAT WAS ALLEGED, or anything of the sort. I had defended these women like they were my blood sisters many times in the past, both from physical threats and unwelcome advances from men. I had a reputation by many on campus that I was of strong moral quality, and that was most certainly one to take direct action against those who disrespected women (and men) in gross, unjustifiable means. 

I am in the mindset right now that what I went through was not a regular (or even legal?) procedure, so I will try to describe what I went through (The contents of my experience is too convoluted and ridiculous, and it would take a whole day to explain it so I will save your time). :

I was notified by a staff member that I was accused of sexually assaulting two female students after a small get-together involving the friend group. Then I went through an investigative process by attorneys hired by the school from a firm near our area. I went through the long and grueling process of being interviewed, while they took notes and did not record anything. After countless back and forth, they drafted up a massive document compiling what they had found (I found several fact discrepancies and what I believe to be are biases in the document, will try to give examples if asked about in the comments), and I was dealt the notice of expulsion. They told me I had an opportunity to appeal, and so most certainly took it. I appealed to a Dean as opposed to a council of sorts (because we do not have a Council for this, apparently), and I was rejected.

Skipping ahead of all the emotions and hell I endured throughout the next months, I hired a professional who had helped many students in the past with this kind of situation. He recommended a state university that he had sent many students who were in my position as well, and I got accepted. I failed to get into any other schools I applied to, so I went to this one and I am finishing my degree this coming May of 2020 for the business field with a 3.7 GPA. 

There are not many resources for young men who have gone through what I have, so I came here. I want to apply to grad school and this economy complicates things. On one hand, everything I read and hear tells me that I need work experience after undergrad to give me quantifiable achievements to talk about and write about during the admissions process. On another, I have thoughts that schools just want your money and this job economy will push schools to…not exactly lower their standards, but be more understanding with the current difficulties in life due to the virus. It is harder to get a job now, the economy is bad so schools are losing much money, etc. 

In terms of my past experience, I have one really good summer internship that I learned a lot in, and have gone beyond expectations at the firm (to the point where I worked on a secret project that helped save the company money by tracking truck routes and optimizing deliveries). I presented this project at the end of my internship, and I had direct impact in saving them thousands of dollars. However, that seems to be my only solid experience directly related to the business world. I worked as a Shift Manager at a high-end juice shop, and only just started to work on a tech startup with a friend (which I do not have much to write about for the latter, but I have many skills I extracted from the former).

I ask of the community to please offer me some insight into what would be my options and the likelihood of success for applying to business school at this stage. I am leaning towards trying to get through the struggle and finding a good job that will teach me things and give me experience. However, I am also considering applying now and using the time I have to study for the GMAT, as well as develop my story through the experience I have acquired thus far.

On a final note, I want to say that although I may have not gotten a job yet and “succeeded” as much as I want, there is hope for those who are expelled from college. I consider getting a degree a high achievement, after I had lowered my standards. It took time to lower my standards, but I understand now that I was given a second chance. **I need advice in terms of my options and likelihoods and how to present my detrimental past when I apply (whether it be now or in the future).**

If you’ve read this far, thank you so much. I appreciate your attention and am looking forward to your feedback and advice. Stay safe everyone, and let's look forward to the end of this global crisis."

g502f1,22,2020-04-20,Tiger Mom Asian Parent In Singing Competition,jerryliufilms,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/g502f1/tiger_mom_asian_parent_in_singing_competition/,"Hey everyone. I lurk on this subreddit sometimes but never made a post until now. I was originally making a video about this, but I thought this story deserved an even more expanded discussion, so I'm sharing it here. I look forward to the discussion.

So in June of 2011, I randomly took part in this singing competition in the US for Chinese-American youths. The competition was supposed to be a preliminary selection for a final televised round in Beijing. Basically, the organizers in China wanted to gather youths of Chinese descent from many parts of the world and get the most ""talented"" to the Bird's Nest to do a singing competition and learn about China. Various areas around the world would hold a preliminary selection event. My city had a preliminary event. No, I'm not some professional. I just wanted to try something new, and one of the selection events happened to be in my city. I was bored and looking for some inspiration. Most of the ""contestants"" were like myself, going to school, doing internships, working jobs, and just there to try something new and have fun. Some of the girls who showed up were more intense, but they also had fun. The one exception was this one girl and her crazy mom.

So the competition was supposed to be for 14-22 year olds. I was almost 21, so I caught the upper end of the age limit.  This girl in question looked 10. When it was her turn to sing, she sang a very famous Chinese song, but in an overly sexual way. The song was one of the most famous 90s CPop songs. The original song had zero sexuality to it. It was pure Kawaii type of vibe. But this little girl sang it completely wrong. It was so uncomfortable considering how young she looked. And then afterwards, I saw her mom scold her for not doing well. Her mom purposefully kept her from interacting with the other contestants. I didn't think much about that detail until later. All the other contestants were having fun and supporting each other. We were all chatting backstage and giving each other cheers when we were onstage. It was such a supportive environment. For most of us, this was the first time we ever competed in singing, so it was scary and fun.

Then, the mom's tigerness really came out. During this little girl's second song, we were all giving her support. Tiger mom literally came over to us and told us to ""shut up."" We were all so shocked. ""Why the F\* are you taking it so seriously? We're trying to encourage your daughter."" We were all thinking.

Eventually, her daughter got a pretty high score despite not singing her second song well at all. She ran up to her mom and hugged her in relief. That hug was a hug reminiscent of ""I'm not going to get my ass kicked tonight by my mom.""

So now's the really sketchy part. This little girl won the singing competition and was supposed to advance to the Beijing round on TV. Most of the other contestants found each other on social media after the event and we chatted about the competition and about life. Some of the other contestants got curious about this little girl too since she had such an intense tiger mom and also looked so young. A few did some research. It turns out she was barely 12. She was way below the accepted age range for the competition. So in essence, her Tiger Mom entered her into this competition illegally and told her to lie on stage about her age. On stage, before her first song, she said she was 14-years-old to the judges and the audience. She said it with such confidence. So she definitely practiced that lie. And that just made everyone feel so sad. ""It's not good to teach a 12 year old to lie like this,"" one of the contestants later said on Facebook. For what? The chance to be on TV in China on a show that probably wouldn't even be seen by many people?

So I kept in touch with the other contestants for a while on Facebook but after nine years I haven't talked to any of them. I don't know what happened to that little girl either. Knowing she was only 11, she's probably in college now. We love to laugh at shows like Toddlers And Tiaras etc. that show the crazy psychopathic moms that want their kids to become beauty pageant winners and celebrities, but once I met an equivalent in person, I just felt so much sorrow for the kids in those situations. Do the kids really want to be famous? Or do their moms just want them to be famous so that they can gloat about their kids to their friends and family and feel a sense of superiority?

Did this girl get to compete in China? The answer was no. A few of the contestants (probably mostly their parents) raised a big fuss to the organizers, and it came to light that she was underage. So the organizers took her off the competition. She was still allowed to go to Beijing to ""perform,"" but she wasn't allowed to compete or go on TV.  So in a way, it's good that she got caught in a lie early in her life. Hope that teaches her that there are better ways to do things in life, but I also cannot imagine the pain she must have experienced at home after her Tiger Mom found out about her being disqualified.

And the final detail about all this was how much the little girl's dad seemed like a cool person. The family had another kid (a very young son), and the dad was taking care of the son back stage. The dad also attempted to have a conversation with me and even gave me some encouragement. He didn't seemed like the type of dad to force her daughter to do anything. Or maybe he's just good at hiding his crazy side? Does this type of dad serve as an enabler to the mom's behavior? I know in cases of narcissism, they often have an enabler.  

So that's it. For those of you reading this. Have you experienced stuff like this or met parents like this? What motivates a parent to be that intense? I'm sure many of us had parents who cared too much about academics, but how does a Tiger Parent in this situation take all that psychopathic energy and devote it to something different like ""becoming famous""? These are just questions that I want to hear your thoughts on.

This is my original video that inspired this expanded written reflection. It has some additional details and is also missing some of the details in this written reflection:

Not sure if this is the right place for this, but wanted to see if anyone had advice.

I'm graduating next month with a bachelor's degree in CS. I currently have a job as an intern at a small company making $15/hour. My boss (the owner of the company) told me to come to him when I graduate to discuss getting a raise, because he wants to keep me with the company. 

What is a reasonable amount to ask for as a recently graduated software engineer in South Florida (Palm Beach/Fort Lauderdale area)? Keeping in mind that South Florida isn't the most expensive market in the country, but it's not exactly cheap either (rent is about $2000/month). 

I've been researching on GlassDoor and PayScale, and apparently recent graduates make something like $65,000-$72,000 per year, or about $30-35/hour. Does this seem like a reasonable amount to ask for? Or is this too much?

I've pretty much made between $10-15 my entire life, so I feel weird asking for an almost $20/hour raise.

I was wondering what the hiring timelines were like for these internships (when to start networking, when is the best time to apply, when these companies do their hiring, etc. )"
g53srx,1,2020-04-20,How do I stay strong with so many rejection letters?,iwrestledmylifeonce,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g53srx/how_do_i_stay_strong_with_so_many_rejection/,"Hi. I'm a senior in college and as y'all know the COVID-19 situation has changed everyone's lives in a way no one guessed. I am definitely one of them. 

I worked so hard to graduate in 3 years and was looking forward to a career. I am a Business Management major, but I wanted to do Accounting. I know it was a bit of a reach, but since I have experience as an Accounting intern, I thought I could. It wasn't going to be the end of the world to me if I didn't though. 

Now I am only about 4 weeks before officially graduating with no offers. I got some interviews for sales jobs that were sketchy in general and noped out of them. Any position for an Accounting job or Analyst job, I've been rejected from all of them.   
The more I think about it, the more I feel unprepared about going out to the workforce now. I have applied to two grad programs and waiting for... another two rejections, to be honest. My GMAT scores sucked and I just don't know why I can't do it. I am going to apply to another school that I know I will get in, but it's 70 miles away so the commute would suck. On top of that, even if I go to grad school I still have to work in retail which makes me really anxious. 

Now I'm stuck with papers that I just kept on procrastinating like always because I just don't see myself having a great future even if I complete them. It's always been the same. Somewhere, somehow I just feel like I shouldn't even exist. Yes, I have major depression and I am getting medication for it, but that doesn't seem to be helping much. This low self-esteem is making it super hard for me to ""sell myself"" and I keep taking rejections personally. I just don't know what to do and how I should deal with these doubts in my mind."

This is my first post on reddit :) I've been kind of stressed out about college, and the people on here seem friendly, so I thought I could do a ""chance me"" post. I 'm trying to follow the guidelines in the ""how to do a chance me"" post. Any feedback is appreciated :) 

I'm a junior by the way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Major: engineering, but some told me I should apply as ""undeclared"" and then try to switch. For UC berkeley, i'll apply as B.A. in Computer Science, UCLA-maybe undeclared, other schools-engineering. 

&amp;#x200B;

SAT: 1560 superscore, 1550 one sitting without essay, 1520 one sitting with essay (i didn't know about the essay when i took the sat with 1550 :( )

SAT Subject tests: i'll be taking math 2, chem, and physics and am aiming for 780-800 (hopefully)

ACT: I will take it when test centers open, and have been getting 35s on my practice tests. \*crossed fingers\*

UW Gpa: 3.96. I'm 99% sure i'll get straight A's for this semester. My school doesn't rank. 

Coursework (APs): 10th grade-AP stats and AP psych; 11th grade-AP Comp sci principles, AP english language, and AP us history; 12th grade-AP Calc BC, AP Chem, AP Physics, AP Bio, AP English Literature. I'm also taking a college class called Intro to Stock Markets (I personally want to know more about stocks and how they work). 

Awards: I got this small award for qualifying for the modeling the future challenge program/contest. At the end of senior year, i'll also get the usual AP awards. 

Extracurriculars: I don't have that many, but I spend a lot of time in the ones I am involved in. They're kind of weird... here goes:

1) Software Developer Job (part time) - I work as a software developer for my moms company, and i'm actually doing a lot of work for them like fixing bugs in a report-making system and working with adults who would normally do this kind of work. I have a microsoft certification in html, javascript, and css and that's the main reason they took me. I was initially a summer intern for them in the summer of 2019, but now i'm an employee and just got a raise. I hope that takes off the ""mom"" part. I do this 4hrs/weekday and 8hrs/day on weekends. 

2) Clubs - I'm in 2 clubs: Care Club and FBLA Club. I'm secretary of care and applied for a cabinet position in FBLA. For care club, we plan activities to raise awareness about the need to care for animals and we've planned many activities like dog toy making, etc. For FBLA, there was supposed to be a competition in may but that got cancelled. I went to their club meetings, and that's about it. I'm pretty sure I'll get a cabinet position for next year though. 

3) this one is kind of weird - I help my mom a lot in her job. I basically do her job for her (it's work from home) and that's how I learnt how to code. I spend a lot of time on her job, maybe 2-4 hrs per day on average. It was like this: in 7th grade, I was bored so I decided to do random KA stuff and ended up learning how to code. My dad also kept telling me all day that I should be able to pay my own rent, so I was even more motivated. I became microsoft certified at the end of 8th grade, and started helping my mom out in 9th grade -&gt; now. On the way, I learnt more and more about the coding world and my mom really needed my help because she had memory issues (minor, but enough to make her need my help). At the end of 10th grade, I thought I had learnt a great deal (I know there's much more to learn :) ) so I had my mom ask her company if they could take me as an intern. Intern =&gt; Job in 5-6 months. 

4) Tutoring - when school was on, I used to tutor afterschool 2 days for 2 hours every week in 2nd semester. I've asked the counselors if it would be possible to continue this online, but they haven't replied yet. 

5) Volunteering - I was supposed to volunteer this semester :( I did volunteer for \~70 hours from April-late July of 2019; I was many elementary teachers' assistant and worked with little kids to help make the learning environment better. I loved the kids &lt;3 

6) Hindi class - I do this hindi class in my temple. It's once every 2 weeks. Sometimes we go help little kids with hindi learning, but most of the time our teacher teaches us. I'm going to take a college test for hindi in 1-2 months (whenever we can). 

7 - I played badminton in 10th grade. 

Essays: haven't written them yet :) 

LORs: probably from my ap lang teacher (i think she likes me). I have a good reputation among my counselors as well. 

Schools: I want to apply to UCLA, UCB, UCI, UCSD, UCR, USC, UPenn, Cornell, Columbia, Caltech (huge huge reaches loll), Harvey Mudd.

g54q5f,2,2020-04-20,Best Options for Clinical Psychology Route? Am I Qualified?,colemarvin98,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/g54q5f/best_options_for_clinical_psychology_route_am_i/,"Hi all, I know you get these a lot, but I thought I'd give it a go.

I'm an undergraduate Psychology/Addictions Counseling student heading into my senior year with a GPA of 3.8 (4.0 within Majors), and am getting ready to make some fairly big decisions in the coming months. I'm mainly looking at Clinical Psychology Ph.D programs, as this has long been an interest for several reasons (mentioned below). I just wanted your thoughts on my stats and experience, as well as any advice you might have for this particular stage in my academic career.

Having gone to a smaller, Christian liberal school in Indiana, I've been blessed with access to a multitude of unique educational opportunities. As part of our Addictions Program, we are taught basic counseling skills, documentation and ethics. Although at graduation I'll have enough observation hours to become a licensed LAC (in limited capacity), I wanted to add the ADC major to take psychopharmacology and more psychopathology classes. Furthermore, due to the university being relatively small, I've been able get very close with most of my professors, and this has led to both strong references, with decent research opportunities:

\-Working as a liaison between the lab of my division chair and the county drug court for a year. In this role I scored simple assessments and input them into SPSS (fairly simple). This is ongoing for next year as well, but paused due to university closure.

\-Worked on a psychometric study with my division chair for the last year with 3 other excellent researchers. I began the study as an observer, but began taking up more of the writing of grants, the measure construction in Qualtrics, etc. as they were needed. We have moved on to the manuscript writing, and hope to have it done soon. From what has been discussed, I'll be third author.

\-Took part in a Node-Link Map study with a prestigious Adolescent rehabilitation high school in Indianapolis for a semester. This involved Qualitative data, and was the conclusion of a five year study. We coded node-link maps, wrote stories based on the coded data, completed data analysis on the quantitative, and are now scheduled to disseminate our results in July.

\-Did a brief IAT study involving homophobia and presidential candidates, this will expand into a homophobia/intervention study this coming Fall.

\-I have one other project in the works that I pitched with a professor, and this will most likely be sort of a thesis for my senior year.

\-I also did a study for my Research Methods class, and even found significance. I don't count this one though due to the informal classroom setting.

Along with this research experience, I'll be beginning my second year as a Psychiatric Technician at a large Psychiatric facility, and have worked with every age and acuity level. My passion for Clinical Psychology stemmed from my time here with patients, and being able to sit down to listen to their individual stories. The idea of using empirically based practices to bring integrative healing brings a great deal of excitement and joy (but I could write about that all day).

This position as a PT, has led to a clinical internship where I administer Psychological testing for an assortment of mental health issues (particularly ADHD and ASD), scoring these assessments, and doing one on one with Clinical Psychologists.  By the end, I'll hopefully have 120 hours.

While I have yet to take the GRE, I plan on taking it this summer with two or three months of practice (depending on how events go with the pandemic). I also plan on taking the Psych subject test. I'm not the best at test taking to begin with, so I'll certainly update this post when I get my scores.

I'm mainly looking at Western Michigan, IUPUI, Central Michigan and Rosalyn Franklin; as these show some promise in faculty fit (sexual deviance/sex addiction, Addictions Studies, and Psychiatric Care Contexts). I have more options, but for the sake of space, I'll leave out the 15 other options (lol).

I've also thought of backups, like Masters programs at Eastern Michigan (they have an excellent Clinical Masters program I've heard) and Ball State. I've also looked at Psy.D programs, but I'm not sure I want to amass that much debt.

So, with all of this in mind, what do you think I should expect? Should I go masters then doctorate? Will these stats outweigh a potential poor GRE score (Not wanting to make excuses, I still want to do my best, but it helps with the anxiety) I'm a realist, and try to stray away from being too idealistic, yet I also don't have a real clear idea of what I'm stacked up against other than what I find on Reddit.

Your honest advice would be appreciated.

Also, for those of you who this applies, how have you seen Christians fare in the application process? I read studies saying that Christians are viewed as less intelligent, and I'm wondering if this will have any effect. Just curious!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to those who have read this far. While I find the competitiveness of the field intimidating, I find that the unique human experience behind studying topics within Clinical Psychology bring a greater depth to understanding of those around us. Clinical Psych integrates the power of empathy with empiricism, and I hope to get a taste of that soon. Again, much obliged, and sorry for the long post. Stay safe, and stay healthy.  "

* Work experience:
   * \~3 years of increasing responsibility in web accessibility roles
      * 1 year as an intern, then individual contributor performing QA-style accessibility testing and reporting for products that my company wanted to procure, and working with the vendors (at least the ones willing to engage us) to remedy issues or draft legalese that ensured that they would remedy issues within defined timelines.
      * 1 year developing accessibility internal processes at a community college, working with individual IT technicians by training them to perform basic accessibility testing of technology products, to collaborating with a VP on creating an accessible marketing site.
      * 4 months as a contract Subject Matter Expert for a known Fortune 500 company. Worked heavily with software developers, QA specialists, and UX designers to improve workflows and promote accessible development of a high value re-platformed service. Basically a product you've likely never seen, but guaranteed have interfaced with.
      * Past 11 months at a globally recognized media conglomerate as an Accessibility specialist, primarily assigned to be the sole specialist on a newly launching product. This product and its design system are a guinea pig for a unified design language that will define future products and the re-platforming of current products. Primarily focused on UX consulting, but also collaborate with stakeholders of various levels to set company-wide standards for testing and how to divide that responsibility. Improved project management workflows that affected me. Basically, if I see an opportunity to make the puzzle pieces of the company, work process, or team fit better together, I call it out and I can usually count on seeing change; I feel that my voice has been well-respected in this regard in my relatively short time here.
* Extra curriculars: None to speak of in undergrad - I commuted and was focused on working to eat while I was in school. Nowadays, I contribute to the international standards committee that sets web accessibility standards (the W3C).
* Undergrad school/major:
   * No-name school that did not assign a GPA. Major: Business Management, IT
* Other education/coursework:
   * M.S. Computer Science - University of Illinois, Springfield
* Race/nationality: Hispanic/Latino
* Sex: Male
* Age: 31

**Stats**

* GRE Score: V - 163 (92nd percentile), Q - 164 (88th percentile)
* Undergrad GPA: Overall 2.53, Last 60 Semester Units 3.32. This is accounting for my degree-granting school that did not assign a GPA.
* Graduate GPA: 3.73

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA: Short term (possibly while in the back end of my program), work as a product manager and use that product as a proof of concept for integrating accessibility specialists at all stages of the product development process (outlining requirements, user research, UX design, development, and QA). Long term, lead a social responsibility, philanthropic, or accessibility arm within a major corporation.
* Target schools: Booth and Haas are my reach/dream schools, UW Foster is a sentimental favorite (I'd always wanted to be a Husky but never shot my shot). Have an acceptance in hand from UT Dallas - Jindal (Professional/Online), but I want to see how much higher I ought to aim. Extremely open to suggestions on other schools that'd be a great fit."

**Subjective:**

Essays:

- Common App was decent, maybe 7/10. I did have a story in it, which I fully believed from the bottom of my heart (how a beloved game really guided me in my decisions and led me to who I am today). I reread it, and it really wasn't as good as I thought, and just seemed a little cheesy at the end, but it wasn't a terrible essay.

- Supplements were really iffy. I don't think they were that high quality, and some were super cliche or just had crappy writing. I found grammar mistakes in some of them (where I was accepted anyway, so small typos shouldn't make you fret as long as you get the point across). Otherwise, they were all at least 5/10 for the places I was accepted to. 

Recs:

- French teacher I've had for 3 years who said she had a very ""unique"" way of writing rec letters and colleges have called her telling her how they loved them. But she's also crazy so I'm just going to say a 7/10.

- My comp sci teacher who I've had for 3 years also, we know each other very well, 7/10.

**Schools:** 

For all of these schools, I picked Computer Science as my first choice, and if possible I did not apply for it in the engineering school (except for Berkeley). As a second choice, I picked a combination of either bio, computational bio, applied math, or cognitive science.

I applied REA to Stanford, and I applied EA to all the schools I could've.

- Accepted!: UPitt (Honors with $5k/yr scholarship), UIUC (James Scholar Honors program), Rutgers NB (Honors College with $10k/yr scholarship), Georgia Tech, WPI (EA II, $28k/yr scholarship), JHU, UCSD (Accepted Cognitive Science Major, Marshall College, $5k scholarship), U of Rochester ($13k/yr Dean's scholarship), CMU, Northeastern (University Honors Program, total $120k scholarship), Cornell, Tufts, UMich (EA, deferred then accepted)

- Waitlisted: UCLA, Duke, Brown (my dream school, rip)

- Rejected: Stanford (REA), UC Berkeley, UW - Seattle

The three schools I was rejected from are all from the west coast, and I hate planes. I guess it's a blessing in disguise lol. Surprisingly, the one person who commented on my /r/chanceme post was weirdly accurate. I ended up not applying to MIT for personal reasons (though I slightly regret that now). 

I was in between Cornell, CMU, and Tufts for various reasons, but I will likely choose Cornell and commit within the next week. There's also the matter of getting accepted off of the waitlist at Brown, and I am only submitting the LOCI for there, but who knows if I'll attend if by the off chance I do get accepted. 

This community has really given me so much help and advice. Thank you for the help, and good luck with wherever you are in this process! If you have any questions, feel free to comment or shoot me a PM (this is a throwaway, so I might take a while to get back)."

The problem is my EC’s, which are substantiat lacking outside of basketball. Because ball is a huge commitment, I ended up with mock trial and FBLA as my only ec’s . I also have an engineering internship this summer.

If I take the recruited athlete route, do I stand a chance at getting recruited at ivy’s or top academic schools? I don’t care if the college basketball team is good or na, I’ll be playing but academics are the biggest focus. I have good connections with my coach, and he is known in my state (maryland).  I would absolutely not try to make it to the NBA, and would stay all 4 years in college.

So all in all, do I stand a chance as an athlete at top academic schools with my stats, or should I just take the academic route and go to UMBC or UMD."

I want to either go into CS or data science and eventually get a master's in business to become a product manager. I'm wondering how much more a private school provides in comparison to a public school like Berkeley in terms of internships, jobs, and overall support and resources. I'm torn because although CMU is well known for stem and is a private school with more support, Berkeley is in the middle of Silicon Valley with all the tech companies, so interviews and finding jobs would probably be easier? I'm not sure. Also, how do the environments and competitiveness compare? What do people do a lot in their free time? Thanks so much for the advice in advance!"

The interview process in this industry is very draining, and a lot of your ticket to a Big N offer depends on luck on what question you’re asked. You could get a LC easy or a LC hard depending on your interviewer, and it could really mess up your chances. I know you must keep practicing, but I just wanted to know if anyone else has failed a lot of interviews, especially at the round?

For a while I was turned off to UCF just because I wanted to go away for college and UCF felt so local 

Right now I’m between the UF PaCE program (I really wanted to go to Florida but PaCE feels like a scam to me) and UCF. I got the UCF gold scholarship for $14,000 and have bright futures so that looks really nice to me, plus a job here if I needed it. For PaCE I’d probably stay home the first year and work so I could save some extra money to move to Gainesville. Financially, UCF is a big win 

I’m not entirely sure what I want to major in. I switch off every day between biology, premed, nursing, psychology, I don’t really know. I’ve been hoping the college experience will help me figure that out, right now I’m down for biological sciences

I wanna know about the culture at UCF. Are there a lot of opportunities that will help me figure out what I might like to do? How are internships etc? Student facilities? What about the party life, not that it’s a priority but are there a lot of good parties and chances to get a little crazy? 

Also I’m really interested in the arboretum, if I choose UCF that’s the first thing I wanna sign up for, I love plants and follow the Instagram and it looks like those would be my people. And the outdoor adventure club seems really neat!! 

UCF is a great school and I know that, it’s just hard for me to get over the UF hype everyone gives around here. If I choose UCF I want to be really excited about it and get over my old dream of being a Gator and be genuinely stoked to be a Knight! 

I’m sure next year will be a little strange because of the virus right now and the coming years in general life will look pretty different. I’m trying to make a decision the best I can through the current circumstances

TL;DR if you can offer and advice about UCF, anything about your experience and why you chose it and the great stuff it has to offer I’d love that! Cons as well, just anything about your experience a potential incoming freshman should know. 

Thanks so much! Go Knights!!"

I've lurked here for a while, and I'm hoping some of the fine folks here can help.

I'll start with some background about myself: I am a machine learning engineer based in a major city in Canada. I only have a Bachelors in Statistics and a minor in CS, with a poor academic history for most of it. This has hampered me into getting into a lot of the ""hardcore"" grad programs (CS and stats mainly). However, I'm a decent programmer when it comes to actual work, and was lucky enough to get an a couple of data science internships as well as a couple research assistant positions doing ML stuff, and even got my name published on an ML paper in a small journal. Almost all of my experience throughout this time has been grounded in NLP, text mining, or ML stuff based around text.

After graduation, I was able to get a job as an MLE at a fairly successful startup in the city with a pretty good pay, again mainly doing NLP and text-based ML work. I recently got an offer from another company, with a top notch pay, but again, doing NLP stuff. In general I've been very, very lucky with getting this far with just a Bachelors.

But at this point, I'm really interested to work in other fields outside of NLP and text-related stuff. There are many other fields that I am interested in, and I want to grow my career as a DS/ML professional. I've tried really hard to interview/get interviews at companies doing other sorts of DS/ML work (in retail analytics, banking, marketing, product) outside of the text realm, but without much luck. A lot of the feedback is that I'm either lacking a graduate degree to get past screening for some more competitive roles, or that my experience has been too grounded in just one area.

So I decided to apply to some graduate schools to boost my profile. I have gotten rejected for my online MCS applications (poor marks in CS fundamentals). However, since some of my research experience was in Bioinformatics and Comp. Bio labs, I was able to get some interest from a few Bioinformatics programs, along with a money grab DS program. Here are the options:

1. Msc. Bioinformatics from John Hopkins (really, really ,really expensive), online and part time
2. Msc Bioinformatics from Brandeis (reasonable price, but may be relatively unknown in reputation in Canada), online and part time
3. DS program from an iSchool at one of the top universities in Canada, core set of DS classes are completely elementary and useless, but gives a lot of autonomy for electives from CS and Stats, full time program (2 years!!!!) and I would have to quit my job and stop my career temporarily, however, pretty cheap compared to the other two. The program is also really new, not much I can do to look at alumni. However the school is very respected.

To be clear, I like studying Bioinformatics (I've taken a few courses in my undergrad), and it is an interesting field, but I probably won't aim to become a bioinformatician in the near future. However Bioinformatics is probably the closest thing I can get to a technical, ""respectable"", Msc. type of program. There is also a good mix of programming, stats, and ML coursework.

My questions are :

1. Given my circumstances, what program should I pick? Should I give up my job and go back to school full time?
2. Can anyone comment on the reputation of Brandeis University? I've read some good reviews, however I am Canadian and am unfamiliar with some of the smaller schools (please don't take offense!)
3. Is it worth doing a ""technical"" Msc. just for the sake of it? Do DS managers care about technicality and difficulty over the prestige of a school?

I know that this is a long post, thank you all for reading through this! I'm looking forward to any advice. Appreciate it!"

**TLDR: Was the most energetic person I knew 5 years ago, was a** ***natural*** **bodybuilder (worked out 7 times/week), diet on point.  Suddenly got really tired for a few weeks before it got better. First blood test done, came out perfect. Got a bit better. Year later, fatigue came back but was a lot worse. Accompanied by  lightheadedness, insomnia, dry mouth and most importantly depression (from being tired or was I tired because of depression?). About the depression: Had some family-related issues but even today I am not sure if that would be enough to cause it. Then I had multiple blood tests done spread over a few months , all clear. Hormones were OK. Fatigue got so bad to the point that I was almost bedridden. 50 meter walk would get me feeling as if I would faint (tired, dizzy, sweaty). Last half year (internship) of uni on hold to work on my health. Was prescribed 5 different anti-depressants before I tried a psychologist. No personality disorders and consults were going nowhere so decided to quit. At this time I noticed persistent widespread muscle fasciculations (mostly in my calves, 24/7 present there). After these six months I Finished my degree even though health didn't improve, as I felt that my situation wasn't going to change any time soon so it would be better for me to at least not waste time. Went for 20h workweeks. Did this for a year. No improvements. Went to a neurologist. Muscle fasciculations made him want to do an EMG to rule out serious neurological disorders. First EMG: Scary results. 3 Months later: Second EMG: No regression so OK. Diagnosis was BFS (Benigne Fasciculation Syndrome). Nowadays I have a decent full-time job, can manage relatively easy workouts but am still tired all the time. Some days are better than others. Walking a couple of miles still makes me lightheaded and I noticed small things such as difficulties talking/texting after the walk. Home initiation test for sleep disorder shows high probability for mild to moderate central + obstructive sleep apnea (to be confirmed in a later sleep study in an actual lab). Family-related stress still going on.**

**Opinions?**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have been feeling exhausted for the last five years now. The level of fatigue is enough for it to interfere with my daily life (or at least make a lot of things a lot more challenging).

Five years ago i was a natural bodybuilder(yes, natural, I never took any drugs or supplements other than whey protein powder - so that's ruled out). I got a decent instagram following from it and absolutely enjoyed what I was doing. I couldn't really think of anyone with the same energy levels as I had. It happened quite a few times that people complimented me on my incredibly hard work in the gym (lots of weight, many exercises, high reps). I felt like I could just keep working out with heavy weights without getting tired. My diet was on point (176 cm, 73-79 kg depending on cutting or bulking, 2300 kcal when cutting / 2800-3300 kcal when bulking, working out hard 6-7 times a week for about 1-1.5 hours).

Then I started going on a cutting diet and I got in the best shape of my life. It was also back then when my issues with exhaustion started to show (could have been coincidental, but I am still not sure up until now - was i overtrained?).

I then went to the doctor for the first time to get a blood test done. Results showed I was a perfectly healthy man, so the fatigue must have been in my head. I upped my calories to maintenance at this point too to make sure that what I was experiencing wasn't due to eating too few calories for too long.

I felt a bit better after about 3-4 weeks and continued what I was doing for another year. It was at the summer of 2016 that things got a lot worse. The fatigue came back harder than ever and I had a lot of other unusual complaints that I never had before: Contstant lightheadedness (as if I had a constant flu and had a slow understanding of what was happening around me), a dry mouth, difficulty concentrating,... And most noticably of all: depression, even though I had always been a super happy person before.

As time passed, I went to get my blood checked every other month because the exhaustion and my overall health didn't seem to improve. Had my hormones checked but nothing seemed off. But i felt really off. Something was wrong and it was worrying me, a lot. At one point I was so exhausted and the accompanying complaints such as the lightheadedness got so bad that I stayed home for half a year. Please note that at this point I would get extremely dizzy and sweaty just from walking 50 meters. I looked like an athlete but felt the opposite. I sometimes had difficulties speaking, as if it was harder to get out the words or something was trying to keep me from doing so.

Six months had passed and the doctors couldn't figure out anything. I was still very depressed (and up until today I am not sure if the fatigue was caused by depression or if my depression was a result of the fatigue and the lack of results that explained where my fatigue was coming from). I was in my last year of uni and decided to take a break to work on my health. At that point I was at an internship and I just wasn't myself anymore. I was really vulnerable, felt weak and felt like crying all the time. So i stayed home for 6 months and went to a psychologist (for your information, I had already been prescribed about 5 different anti-depressants before ever seeing a psychologist). When I started my consultations, it became clear quickly that I didn't have any underlying mental disorders and after 4 or 5 consults, I decided not to go back because it really wasn't going anywhere (apart from being prescribed another 4-5 different anti-depressants).

It was at this point that I started noticing some really weird muscle fasciculations/twitches (involuntary movements) especially in my calves. I say especially my calves, because that's where they were present 24/7 for over a month now. But other than that, they basically occured everywhere throughout my entire body, just occassionally. They were often to be found on my triceps, back and abdominals.

After 5-6 months of staying home, I went to work part-time (20h work-weeks). This was really hard at first as I had a hard time understanding things at this point and was still constantly tired and dizzy/lightheaded.

At this point I just decided to accept that I wasn't feeling right. The doctors couldn't find anything anyway so I just decided for myself that I had to live with waht I felt. So time went on and after one year working a 20-hour work it really started bothering me again that I was so limited: I couldn't even exercise lightly (as in doing 10 push-ups or going for a 1 mile walk) anymore without feeling as if I would faint and most importantly, I couldn't even work full time and pursue a carreer that I had always had planned. So I continued going to doctors to find out what was really wrong with me (at this point it had been three years).

I then went to a neurologist who did a first EMG-test after seeing my muscle fasciculations. The results were pretty scary as they were so far off from what's normal. I then was told to supplement with magnesium and vitamin D (which I had already done in the past anyway, so I knew in advance that this wouldn't save me and my long list of physical complaints). I also had to wait three months for my second EMG-test, which would possibly rule out serious neurological disorders such as ALS - IF my EMG-results wouldn't turn out the be regressive. Scariest three months of my life.

You can understand how incredibly happy I was when the three months had passed and the results showed that regression wasn't the case. But happiness subsided quickly when I realised that I still didn't progress really from where I was before going to this doctor: I was still really tired, lightheaded etc. I however did get some vague diagnosis of 'Benign Fasciculation Syndrome'.

I just accepted it again and decided to work with the limited tools that I had, instead of giving up I just kept working hard and I now have a pretty decent full-time job. I can manage some very light workouts but am overworked really easily. It's definitely a much harder challenge for me to take on daily tasks than it would be for other people. Fatigue is still present (even though to a lower extend), muscle twitches are still 24/7 in my calves (even though I notice now that they are stronger when I slept shorter than usual or had alcohol on a night out) and the lightheadedness hasn't faded ever since it first started. I still wake up feeling unrefreshed even though I work really hard to make sure I do what's best for my health (staying active as much as I can without overreaching, having a great diet and getting my 7-8 hours of sleep a night). I can manage a 4-5 mile walk but will feel more lightheaded towards the end, I will have difficulty talking and notice that small things like texting will become harder.

I recently did a brizzy-test, which is a new test to be done at home as an initiation to finding out whether a person might have a sleep disorder (especially sleep apnea here). Turns out I might have ( as I only did the home test, the actual test in the sleeping lab is still to be done later) both central as well as obstructive sleep apnea (even though its a fairly mild form: 11.5 events/h). Now even though I realise some of my physical complaints (such as the fatigue) could be caused by an underlying sleeping disorder, everything seems really weird when I look back at my whole story: From feeling tired to feeling a bit better to feeling tired and depressed, to having a weird EMG with BFS as a diagnosis to this...

What are your thoughts? Anyone else had a similar experience?

Sorry if that title was a mouthful! 

Background info: 
I’m currently a sophomore in college (will be a junior in the fall) and have been interning at a small IT company in my college town for about four months now. The work culture is great and also very lax, and my internship coordinator has also been a very great resource. This IT company has been known for providing internships for students at my college and lots of alumni work here too. The networking between my school and the company I’m interning for is great. We’re working remotely now too due to the coronavirus. 

Now, because of this worldwide pandemic that’s happening, many of my friends (including my boyfriend) have struggled with finding internships in the midst of all this and getting their internship offers rescinded. This segways into my question: 

Would it be wrong or unethical of me to ask my internship coordinator if there will be any summer internship programs on behalf of my friends and boyfriend? Or am I crossing some kind of line if I do this? I don’t want to come off as unprofessional, but I do want to help my pals and boyfriend if it’s ethical for me to do so. Would this be considered nepotism? 

Thank you all in advance :) hope you all are staying safe!"

I've finally accepted my ECE offer. Recently I've been trying to work on preparing for my first coop job in quarantine (in case I get placed in stream 4). I was wondering if any upper years can give me any advice on landing dev/software jobs earlier on. I already have a few basic shitty html/css/js web side projects, and I'm currently working on projects using the MERN stack. I also had a hs software internship (focused on automation testing) which didn't really prepare me all that much tbh. Should I be worried about Leetcode for early coop interviews? I've only taken ICS3U and ICS4U, meaning I have next to no in depth knowledge of algorithms and data structures, only the basic shit needed for CCC s1 and s2. Is there anything else technical I should keep in mind or prepare for? I know not to expect much for my first coop especially under the impact of covid; I just want to have some insight in advance.

Recently, Ive accepted the fact that coding is not something I can see myself doing as a job. So Ive not looked for software jobs, instead searching for data analyst, or business analyst or anything non software related in tech.

But i keep getting the same problem. They all want someone with experience. If not 3-5yrs, then 1-2yrs. And they all want someone with experience in a similar role, or something like that. So how can anyone join these roles? How can I join these roles? I thought about getting a Grad. Certificate but they cost &gt;$13000 and I cant spend that. Should I get a certificate from Coursera, or edX? How does that look on a resume? Is it even comparable to experience? If an employer sees its been about a year since I graduated, what will they think? It doesnt help that Im in Australia, where jobs arent as abundant as USA and also we're in this pandemic. As each day goes by, I hate myself even more. What can I do? Any help is much appreciated. Thanks."
g5dl4b,2,2020-04-21,Stay at university or cut short for technical leadership role,MajesticAnswer2,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/g5dl4b/stay_at_university_or_cut_short_for_technical/,"So I was wondering if I could even just get an insight into what those who have been through the ringer think. I am in my 3.5/5th year of a double degree with compsci, math and economics. I took an internship at a startup in my first year, and ever since I was sort of involved in some way or another. At one point I even took a little time of university to work for them full time after the CTO left. So i got forced to learn A LOT very quickly, and do pretty much all of the technical side the CTO managed whilst another person helped manage the business side of CTO responsibilities

This was certainly a great learning experience, but the responsibility was pretty intense for a young person and I felt I was a little locked in. This was pretty much all I had time for every day and spent all day doing it. AKA WL balance was not great, but thats generally the way startups go. On the other hand we made great progress and the team really liked me personally and my work. But it was too much at the time, so after about 9 months I quit and returned to university.

The company has offered me essentially a technology lead role (pretty much CTO without the title) if I come work full time from next semester. This would of course mean graduating early with one degree and one major, and singing up to 60-80 hour work weeks for the next two-three years. The company is well funded (raised last year) and growing quite aggressively so I could make a massive impact. It will also probably raise again, and even if it is mildly successful it will probably sell for a substantial amount.

The downsides are that I have no mentor, and even though I am pretty capable at just figuring stuff out I feel it is a little risky. The tech is also not in great shape. The CEO never prioritised it and due to a pivot there is a lot of not so good stuff going on. And even though they are enticing me with a leadership role, I see it as quite likely that if they raise again they will hire someone else with more experience and I will have quit university for no reason.

I guess what I am asking is:

1. This is the only company i have worked/interned for. How seriously should I consider other options knowing id take a 20-30% pay cut even at FAANG, and software engineers do the same work everywhere generally.
2. Is it worth having diversity in degrees and experiences? I can have 2 degrees and 3 majors with unknown (and probably terrible) job prospects when I graduate end 2021, or 1 degree and 1 major but a potentially lucrative opportunity to establish myself and also give up my a little bit of sanity and diversity. University is not overly expensive where I live, so thats not a major concern.
3. I want to do an MBA. Having good leadership experience at a fast growing company (could) look good.
4. Of course you'd need more info, but if you were in my situation, what would you be leaning towards.

I have plenty of money saved and could easily live on my own this summer with no problem. I could be lazy and just chill and hangout with my girlfriend here. 

However, living at home is free and I could probably go back to the job I was working at and make 8-10k this summer to save for after college. My life wouldn’t be fun and I could only see my girlfriend 4-5 times the whole summer. 

I’m torn, my body is telling me live on my own, but my mind is saying the logical choice is to go back home and work. What should I do?"

Although it seemed super interesting in the beginning when I was learning all the fancy languages and technologies, it became too boring and too monotonous eventually. I got so bored of the work life that I decided to ditch it and started reading philosophy specifically related to mathematics and science and I am kinda glad I did that although it sucks financially. I love learning and reading about intersting theoretical concepts and hence I think I belong in the academia. I am a late bloomer I guess but 24 is not too late, yeah? 

Now I am planning to go for masters abroad (west) in a stem field (scientific computing or computational engineering/mechanics) to not only enhance my knowledge but also to experience the mature research discourse and environment. But it's been so long since graduation that I don't think getting admission in a decent university/college would be that easy plus I don't even have recommendation letters from my college profs, I would probably have to beg for it which is gonna be awkward. 

Coming to the IISC part, I think I need a stem related internship/lab experience from an institute like IISC (I am a bangalorean) to build a proper profile for getting admission in to a good university. 
 
Q1) Since all the internships are cancelled this year due to corona, is it still possible to get some kind of internship/lab work after lockdown? I am planning to email some profs about it but I decided to ask here first.

Q2) Would I realistically get an internship in IISC given that I studied in VTU? 

I have a good understanding of statistics and numerical analysis so knowledge shouldn't be an issue, It's just that my background sucks and my BE marks aren't that good (69%, funny I know).

Q3) What would you recommend I do? Is there any alternative to IISC? What would you do if you were in my position?"

**Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**


Budget is around €1000-€1200 pre-taxes, could maybe get a little more budget from the company if it's a good deal. Country is Belgium.


**Are you open to refurbs/used?**


No


**How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**


form factor isn't important. The laptop will most likely be plugged in at all times when in use so battery life isn't either. As for build quality and performance 'decent' is ok, not expecting greatness in these area's. The biggest issue is that a displayport 1.2 is required. 


**How important is weight and thinness to you?**


not at all


**Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**


N/A


**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**


The laptop will first only be used to by a intern at the firm the develop a VR demo for the company. After he is done the laptop will only be used to showcase this demo to potential customers at shows etc. The recommended specs for the vive pro that the company has are a gtx 1060/amd rx 480 or higher and a i5-4590 or fx 8350. (more specs can be found here https://www.vive.com/eu/ready/ ). 

However i'm pretty sure that we will have accept that this laptop will most likely be worse than this. The hope is that we can get something like a gtx 1650 and that this will be good enough to run our demo as this not going to be a 'full' game.


**If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**


N/A


**Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**


displayport 1.2 or better and 1 usb 3.0


**Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**


The company i work for atm bought a vive pro a couple of months ago and wants an intern to create a VR demo for the company. The intern does not posses a laptop strong enough to run VR and the company doesn't have a laptop/pc to run this demo on atm. They are now looking to buy one for both purposes but because of the corona situation paying €3000 for a laptop isn't possible. 

I have looked around for a laptop with a displayport 1.2 but i'm having trouble finding one, esp in this price range. I have informed the company that in order to get a displayport 1.2 for this price the better option is to buy a desktop or even build one themselves but they want the mobility that a laptop provides even if during the showcase of the demo it will be plugged in at all times. Since i can't find one i'm hoping this subreddit might have a suggestion. 

I have also looked around for adapters but most i find are very expensive since it would most likely have to be hdmi 2.0 to displayport 1.2.

I’m an EE student set to graduate at the end of next summer.  I have one last internship in my co-op term and have to start applying for either the fall or winter semester (with next summer being my last school semester).

My first internship was doing Q/C for a pretty big software company.  I did my second internship at the same company but in a completely different team in a design position, and I learned A LOT in this position.  Was given a lot of responsibilities and the work was challenging and rewarding.  

I’ve been offered to come back to the same company for a third internship, and I would definitely be interested in coming back full-time once I graduate.  They’ve told me they’d hire me once I graduate but nothing official.

From a career point-of-view, should I do a third internship at said company?  Or would it be better to spread my network a bit by trying to find a last internship at a different company?  How bad do you think this could affect my chances at getting the full-time position at the first company?

Back in November/December I got an offer to intern at a defense company (company A) in a perfect situation for me. I completed the onboarding process and was all set then the whole COVID situation happened and I got nervous that they would cancel as many companies have. The corporate part of the company has been in contact weekly over the past month letting us know at this time everything is still on as planned. I was still nervous and got a call a few weeks ago from another company (company B) that I had applied and they were offering me a intern position and gave me a bit of time to accept. I was unsure what to do because unless my original internship at company A cancelled I wasn't planning on working at company B. With all of this happening I reached out to my manager at company A to see what his thoughts were regarding the status of the internship. And of course he had not gotten back to me by the end of the day on the day I was supposed to give company B a decision(couldn't have asked for an extension because I already did). So without a response from company A accepted the position at company B. After accepting, the corporate of company B reached out saying they are pushing back the start date of the intern program with a chance of cancelling. Then a few days later my manager at company A reached out saying the internship is still on either remote or in person so now with some clarity on the situation I feel more secure just having the job at company A. Then company B reached out with what I should complete to onboard. Is my best bet just to tell company B I cannot accept the position before doing any onboarding? They already pushed back the intern program and will not be doing remote work so it's still possible they may cancel. My worry is that I would be blacklisted or something as it is a fairly prestigious company but I would hope they would be understanding given the situation. Obviously continuing the onboarding process would be worse if I intend on cancelling but I am just worried about what will happen since I accepted a week or so ago then after hearing news from them about pushing back I change my mind. Also, what are everyone's thoughts on accepting multiple internship offers in general? I know alot of people who did this with job offers but not internships. I feel like in the case of COVID it is a little different with so much uncertainty.

tl;dr: Had an internship I definitely wanted then got worried because of COVID and accepted another offer after reaching out to original company and didn’t get a concrete response then after accepting second offer heard from first company internship will still be happening. I understand there’s a pandemic so some companies have to cancel but with that in mind how do I navigate while being professional and also making sure I have a set internship/not screwing my career over"

Here is the eighth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?  

   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?  

   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?  

   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?  

   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).

All the best,

\--Nick

Especially if you're the overachieving type, and you just want to do more and be more. Everyone is trying to win that first place in scioly, or get into varsity soccer, and these four years that is just supposed to be study well, do well is not that anymore because of the environment the whole aspect of college admissions comes with.

and the idea of ""friends"" really hurts. because as long as you graduate in the same class as your friend, every single person is inevitably pitted against each other by who goes where for college, who did what for their extracurriculars, and so on.

i have a friend who is incredibly smart and witty and i enjoyed being around. But i moved and i try to stay in contact with her but its so hard since she never discloses anything about herself and what she's doing.  It feels like she put up a wall and isn't sharing her ecs cuz that just means more competition for whatever she's doing. we used to be really close but she's been keeping to herself.

that's where the problem lies. because I realized I've been doing the same thing, by keeping my plans and ecs to myself because i don't want anyone else to have my resume. why would i want to share my startup with someone when I could do it all by myself? founder looks better than co-founder on your applications, doesn't it?

I don't tell my friends about possible programs that could benefit them, because i want to attend it. i don't tell them about internships and research positions because if they have that on their profile, it diminishes the weight of the same thing on mine.

this awful race of college admissions ruins the last few years of your childhood with or without you realizing it.

edit: thank you for the comment replies! i've started reaching out to older friends that i lost some contact with since i moved (not too long ago) and am asking how they're doing and providing some ec tips that i've learned from browsing a2c, i sincerely thank you for the feedback"

g5jk7k,4,2020-04-21,How can I best utilize my time/opportunities as an undergrad CS Major?,Aggressive_Math,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g5jk7k/how_can_i_best_utilize_my_timeopportunities_as_an/,"Hi all,

I'll be entering college next fall as a CS Major at a T10 CS school and wanted to get advice from this community on essentially how I can best use my time and opportunities to reach my long-term goals. In the future, I'm hoping to pursue either an MS in CS or an MBA at a top-tier school (Stanford, MIT, Harvard, etc) -- looking to work towards high-level executive positions at large tech/engineering companies (PM/CTO type roles). With that in mind, I had a few questions regarding the best ways to reach those goals, avoid any pitfalls that students may make, etc:

* Grades: Many people have told me that a lot of getting SWE internship positions, jobs, and even grad school is your GPA. I understand the value of having a significantly high GPA but should grades be my first priority? Is it worth grinding to have a 4.0? To what extent do grades matter in unlocking such opportunities? 
* Research: It seems like almost all CS students engage in some sort of research and I was just wondering how it plays into all of this. One of my CS teachers in HS told me that having meaningful research published can guarantee acceptance to a top grad school -- is that true? Is it even worth pursuing if I'm more interested in the industry-side. 
* School Clubs and Organizations: I plan on joining a few organizations that interest me -- some being CS-related while others not -- and working towards contributing something meaningful. I'll also be working towards leadership positions in these organizations. I'm curious as to how relevant these extracurricular opportunities are to grad school applications, internship applications, etc. 
* Internship Opportunities: Obviously there's a pretty big and competitive market for internships so I'm curious as to the importance they hold. Does having an internship at perhaps a FANG company hold more weight than that of a smaller or local company? Is it more about what company you intern with or the work that you actually do? It seems like everyone has SWE internships -- are there ways to differentiate yourself? 
* Would it be worthwhile for me to pursue a second major or minor in Economics or other Business concentration? I've heard that having experience in these fields helps unlock other positions besides SWE roles for internships/jobs. 
* Lastly, I'd love to hear any personal advice any of you all have in regards to what you've seen to be the most important factors in finding success in this field.

I know this is a lot but I'd like to get a better understanding of what my priorities and immediate goals should be to find success later on. Thank you all for reading and I'd much appreciate your input!"

1. Stanford (family legacy (undergrad)) - Deferred, waitlisted
2. Berkeley - ACCEPTED (L&amp;S CS)
3. MIT - Rejected
4. CMU - Rejected CS, Rejected CE, ACCEPTED Stats + ML
5. UIUC (family legacy (grad school)) - Rejected CS + Stats, ACCEPTED CS + Math
6. UPenn (family legacy (undergrad)) - ACCEPTED CS
7. Cornell (family legacy (undergrad)) - Rejected

14. UCLA - ACCEPTED CSE
15. UCSD - Waitlist
16. UC Santa Cruz - ACCEPTED CS
17. Cal Poly SLO - ACCEPTED CS
18. Michigan - Waitlist

To be fully transparent I included where I had legacy status from parents/siblings. Some were for grad school and some were for undergrad. I'm sure it helped much more at privates than it did for publics.

Choices have boiled down to Berkeley, HMC, UIUC, and CMU based on industry reputation and silicon valley prestige. I didn't care too much about overall prestige. The ivies of the CS industry are very different lmao.

I've kinda ruled out CMU and Berkeley at this point.

CMU I got into stats + ml. ML is a buzzword so probably not a good idea to do a degree in it by the time the hype dies down. Also the curriculum I saw last year when I visited does not teach you nearly enough as a CS curriculum does in areas pertaining to software engineering (systems organization, backend support, caching, parallelization, concurrent programming, etc).

As for Berkeley, it definitely is not worth the risk of not being able to declare CS and having to do data science or math. I've had friends who transferred outta Berkeley cuz they couldn't declare CS. Problem with the DS major that many save as a backup is that it makes it much harder to make it past resume screening for SWE positions. Companies want to see that CS degree. Also if I do manage to declare CS, probably wasn't worth the 2 years of effort since schools of the same tier (GATech, CMU, UIUC, HMC, Waterloo, UT Austin, etc) are gonna be the same in the eyes of grad schools and recruiters.

My essays were focused on my Stanford internship and startup internship. Experience speaks volumes!

Stay safe and healthy! Best of luck to you!"

Before that, I was a software engineer for 2 as well as a software eng intern, all at the same company. Just about to turn 25.

I'm thinking of quitting my current role in order to earn my OSCP and perhaps start looking into a master's in cybersecurity at GA Tech. I'd like some extra dedicated time to better understanding this industry and pursuing the technical topics I most enjoy (reverse engineering, Linux security). While I do enjoy this field, I haven't been given as much opportunity to learn on the job as I'd hoped (many days are really just writing up policy documents, responding to Slack queries, or doing on-call work- only the occasional pentest or code/design review, and it's mostly web apps at that), management is becoming more and more disorganized after several high-profile departures, coworkers are becoming complacent and knowledge siloed, the old company culture is eroding away, and I just feel completely lost. This experience really wasn't what I was hoping for when I transitioned to this team, and I feel like I'm just missing way too many fundamentals to be as effective as I could be to be able to thrive elsewhere. I've been turned down for other training opportunities that would've otherwise been on the company dime; my manager thinks they're either not relevant or that I should be doing these things completely on my own time. I've done plenty of the latter, but with chronic pain and mental issues as of late, it's become more and more difficult to do so on a regular basis.

I am extremely lucky in that I have enough money saved up to pay for essentials like rent for at least 2 years (I live in the Midwest, so COL isn't so bad), and I do live with my S/O who is a software engineer. GA Tech's master's program is also on the much cheaper end than most places. I also feel however that this isn't exactly the best time to be considering a break that'd last for at least a few months. My alternative was to apply to some other roles, possibly software engineering for other security-facing products, instead of taking a career break. 

Am I incredibly stupid for even entertaining this?"
g5kkzd,5,2020-04-21,"We will meet people who will discourage and doubt us and our potential. Sometimes it's from someone unexpected, sometimes someone close to us, our family or friends even.",montalpe,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/g5kkzd/we_will_meet_people_who_will_discourage_and_doubt/,"I was a decent student in high school, I did not like certain subjects but I still managed to gets As and Bs in those subjects. I liked chemistry at first but after the teacher changed, I did not really accommodate well with how she taught. To me, it seemed like my problem so I would read up and I even requested for tuition lessons. My marks improved and I was happy about it and went on with the usual revision and such. After sitting for our A levels, on the last day I said bye to my teachers cause the only time we would return to school is to get our results and usually a lot of the teachers are not present.

As my best friend and I were walking towards the main exit, I saw my chemistry teacher. I said bye and she asked me what my aspirations were. I said Oh I would like to attend \_\_\_\_ University (which is the top university in our country) instead of maybe saying a word or blessing or encouragement she immediately scoffed and said 'You sure you can make it?"" I felt horrible, why would a teacher say something like that? I was always polite and I never created trouble in school. It was pretty shocking and so distasteful. My best friend comforted me and I pushed it aside. A few months later, I got accepted into the university and after 4 years I graduated with First class Honors and 3rd in my entire cohort. It was amazing. My best friends decided to post my graduation pictures on Facebook where they were friends with almost everyone in our high school, including teachers. A few days later I get a message from that chemistry teacher who migrated and was working in another country.

She was saying things like *Oh I did not know you could do it. I'm so proud of you and that you were my student. I feel like I had a huge part in this.*

Now I actually forgot about her comment over the years cause I had other things to focus on but when I saw that text from her I remembered what she said and I'm so glad I did not ponder over her comment cause look at what I did. I managed to not only get accepted but I graduated and I got offered a job immediately after my internship.

I simply *thanked her and said please do encourage your students next time. Everyone has potential and with a little motivation, it can do wonders.*

She ignored my message and I never heard from her. My point is that we will meet people who will discourage and doubt us and our potential. Sometimes it's from someone unexpected, someone close to us, our family or friends even. But despite what your relationship is with a person, if they ever berate, laugh or discourage you, just remember, you don't even know your own potential, and I highly doubt they do. Believe in yourself and your aspirations. It's not important what they think, it's important what you think of yourself, your dreams, your goals. I did not achieve my goals cause I was hung up on her words, I simply pushed them aside cause I knew what I wanted and I went for it. Of course, I've had some obstacles along the way but I knew I could do it, I never regretted taking the first step and I trusted myself, I relied on myself.

Don't ever underestimate yourself and give yourself credit. After all, you make the universe a brighter and better place so believe in yourself. In the universe. Stay safe and take care."

Please help me escape this.",Frosty-Frolics,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/g5nv25/many_ideas_nothing_gets_done_please_help_me/,"I (28M) have been recently diagnosed by my therapist as having a combination of Anxiety and ADHD, as well as Aspergers (ASD), something me and my family had suspected for a long time.

I grew up a straight-As kid, raised on the promise of a bright future. Fast forward to now, it's far from the case. I think many of you can relate.

Having spent 6 years in college, I haven't been able to keep a paid job to date. I have ""survived"" through unpaid internships, and have only got one actual job. This job was somewhat technical and decently paid. Alas, I couldn't hold it for a month. Between spending the hours on the verge of falling asleep, not getting along with co-workers and haunted by the sheer ugliness of the grey numbers, the documents, the excel sheets, the ""interface software""... Within roughly 30 days I was wishing I was dead rather than there.

It is needless to say that I am seen as a disappointment to my family, poorer folks who really worked hard to provide me and my siblings with a good education. And I, who was supposed to be the smart of the bunch, feel crushed by the weight of these expectations. After years of living alone, I'm back home, and although my parents are supportive, it hurts to hear their occasional vented, bitter comment.

My glimmer of hope is my creativity, perhaps also my curse.  I came up with ""worlds"" and stories of my own ever since I was a young kid. As a form of escapism from the real world, I'll admit. And having become a fan of fictional media (films, video games, books, etc), I have often thought to myself ""I could do something like this."" And thus I have come up with a myriad of ideas. Dozens of stories, from horror to fantasy to drama, even ideas for video games. Those with whom I shared the ideas were positively impressed. One day, someone working on the animation industry said one such idea was ""extremely workable"", strongly advising that I make it happen.

And here kicks in the ADHD... I have already studied what I should do. Yet when the moment to write comes, I freeze, feel intimidated by something I don't fully comprehend myself. I look for excuses to do whatever else, just sink my senses into whatever video game is at hand, all too feel horrible about it as I see the days turn to weeks. Weeks of nothing done, with me seeing my youth escape me.  
On top of it all, there is the matter of the dreaded Master's thesis. As you might have guessed it, it has been ""on hold"" for about three years now. My mother in particular is extremely disappointed about this. Predictably, this thesis undone keeps me awake at night. Whenever I try to sit down and do something about it, of course, I am stricken with all the mentioned above but also quite the sadness.  


Not all has been hopeless. I used to be a musician. Last year, I wrote and recorded a rock album by myself with the help of a friend who owns a studio. Again, all those who have heard it claim it is surprisingly good. And again, even after having had recorded it, the task of looking for a way to ""get it out there"", find a label or something, has been sucked to the twister of incomplete works...  


Thinking about it is very depressing. It often crosses my mind that I have simply failed at life. That perhaps from a darwinian perspective, I failed to adapt to survive, and all else is the delaying of the ultimate fate of those who fail to adapt. I am very ashamed. Hastening this crosses my mind sometimes. But I cannot submit my family to such monstrosity, I love them too much.  


So, I'm looking to fight through this. Just writing here is part of that exercise. I have a therapist that has helped a lot recently. He insists that I make a plan, stick to it, and correct my sleep schedule, which I have dragged through the mud for years. I would really like to hear the thoughts of other people with ADHD, however. Someone hear might just have the perspective I need.

I will admit I was very hesitant about coming forward. I can't help but be afraid that this might just be seen as an annoyance or just cringe. But I'll see how it goes. Thank you for your time, I would be happy to hear your insight and advice."

I was constantly being carried by my group mates and only crammed studying last minute. Because of that I felt too bad to even try applying (I know it's stupid). I knew I'd have to study for interviews but I have barely even studied properly for tests and interviews are a whole nother level. 

A little more background. I did do two internships but both were unpaid and I did no programming in either of them. The first one had a set timeframe but the second one was from 2016-now I just help with reaching out on linkedin whenever needed. I don't know how to put that on my resume. 

I tried to apply to companies through indeed but I never got any replies. After half a year I got an email from a recruiter and was able to make it to an on-site interview but I couldn't finish the simple programming question and failed. They reached out again after another 3 months and the same thing happened. This has been going on since and I'm sick and tired of feeling like I'm not doing enough but then procrastinating and not doing anything to improve my situation. 

What should I do?"
g5p7ka,3,2020-04-21,Making an internship decision,actualsnek,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g5p7ka/making_an_internship_decision/,"I have 3 choices for interning this summer and I'm having a hard time deciding between them. I'm a first year undergrad and eventually want to specialize either in backend or ML engineering. Here are my options:

1. Mid to large size startup that is quite well known, rapidly growing and pays well. I'd be doing pretty vanilla fullstack or backend engineering in a stack that I have some experience with. 

2. Small research startup in a really small niche with market success likely years away, but something I'm very interested in. They have the ability to pay but are iffy on their internship program as a whole due to corona so I'm afraid to ask for salary. I'd be doing machine learning engineering and working with really cool software. 

3. Small to mid size cloud startup that is growing quite quickly in market share but still doesn't have much name recognition. They pay decently but not as well as #1. I'd be doing backend development and maybe some frontend as well in a stack I'm pretty experienced in.

Can you guys give me some input on what choice would be best for me given my eventual goal? How do each of these things matter as pros and cons?"

***sorry for dumping my whole resume/life story, i just want realistic advice and criticism***

general info: competitive public highschool in the tri-state area; usually sends around 10-15 kids to ivy/t10 schools every year.

4.0 UW GPA, around 4.7/5.0 W GPA

test scores: i didn't take any big standardized tests but i got a 1390 on my PSAT in october \[740/760 math and 650/760 english :/\]. *i'm aiming for a 35-36 on the act and 1540-1600 on the sat.* i think my math is fine as long as i study a bit more, but my english is really concerning as my average practice test score is like 670-700. any tips for cracking the reading section? im using erica meltzer right now.

aps: my school doesn't usually let freshmen or sophs take aps :// next year i'll be taking AP Calc BC, AP Chem, AP Bio, and AP Lang. i want to self study AP stat as well and during my senior year, i'll be taking advanced physics (you basically take all 4 physics tests after), multivariable calc, AP LIT, and APUSH. i'm trying to go to college for something STEM related.

ECs: i don't really have many big ECs so please no harsh judging :) i have a list of things i want to do/applied for below

1. cellist; cello is a huge part of my life and i've been part of selective state orchestras and i plan on auditioning for prestigious ones such as NY youth symphony and philly youth orchestra. i've been school section leader for my school and will probably continue to be until my senior year. i also want to do competitions as well.
2. certificate from harvardX CS course; this isn't that big but i learned CS and have evidence of it from an online cs50 course i took over corona break.
3. hospital volunteer: volunteered for 4 hours/week every week
4. club swimming for 8+ years, varsity swimming since freshman year
5. leadership position of friend's 501c3 nonprofit (not STEM related)

things i want to do/applied for:

\*edit: i didn't do these yet but i applied for some of them and i really want to do them\*

1. {state} governor's STEM scholar: this is a program where outstanding STEM scholars meet 4x a year for conferences
2. columbia science honors program: i applied for this but i'm concerned bc since the tests are online now, they'll probably look at report cards due to cheating. i had B's in marking periods but my final grades were A's.
3. research/internship opportunities \[such as NIH\]: i plan on applying for this summer internship program for next summer (too late this year).
4. writing contests: i really like writing so i applied for a few contests online
5. cello competitions: i think this is one of my standout ECs and i plan on competing at some big competitions in NYC.
6. peer leader: this isn't that big but it's a mentor program at my school for freshmen and i want to do it
7. individual research: i want to research stuff in bio and submit to programs such as regeneron, any ideas or advice?
8. founder/prez of school HOSA/med club: this isn't official yet but my friend and i submitted an application to start a HOSA chapter at my school.

my DREAM (i know these are SUCH stretches) schools are UPENN, dartmouth, and columbia.

please chance me! i'm not afraid of harsh criticism; in fact, i want it! thanks for reading this post :)"

I found this ""list"" of skills every computer science major should know: http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/
I feel like you can not really know all of that. Is it better to know the basics of most areas of computer science or dive deep into 1 or 2 technologies and use them on your resume instead?
Also, as the summer approaches, I will have more free time to study on my own. What do you guys suggest I dive in and get a good understanding of in those 4 months. I want something, which can be used to make a full project that I can put on my portfolio and will be beneficial when applying for Junior Software Developer positions after graduation."

I used to be so liberated and free and happy. 2 years ago I was dumped my boyfriend who I loved more than anything. After that I went on a downwards spiral of trying to find love to fill the gap, I have slept with 4 men since then and I was raped by one. I have also sent nudes to most of these men, all on snapchat and I doubt any of them were saved. However I still feel so dirty and ashamed. I don't know why I had to send nudes to people or why I had to sleep with them, I feel like such a slut. Everyone in my life thinks I am so amazing and smart and I just think I am so messed up and that I am damaged goods. I am in a good school program and I am at the top of my class. I even received one of the best internships for my class. Everything looks good on the outside, but I wish I had just been more focused on myself than looking for male validation. 

I decided to take a break from dating, however a romance quickly formed between me and my best friend. I really didn't feel ready to dive back into a relationship. However, I am starting to fall in love with him and I haven't felt this way in years. I don't think he deserves someone as messed up as me. I have explained pretty much everything above to him and he still thinks I am an amazing person, who made mistakes but I just cannot accept that someone could really love me. I feel like he would be so much better off with someone who wasn't so messed up and everyone would just be better off without me if I was dead. I'm worried he will leave me and the next guy I meet will think I'm a slut. I want to be married and have kids someday and love them like no one ever could but I just feel like no one will ever be able accept the mess that I am. I know it looks bad when a girl has had so many lovers and it reflects I cannot keep a relationship. I never thought that when I was out sleeping around that it would ever catch up to me and bother me. I have been trying to take action by going to therapy and getting medication, but I just cannot get over my past. My current boyfriend has been helping me through this but I still just feel so ashamed of everything."

I want help contributing to my retirement, benefits like health and medical stuff, and a cool, down-to-earth environment with people who can help me learn and improve and grow and gain great experiences.

I am not into self-harm in anyway, so no need to worry about that. However, it feels like I am losing my mind. I am an international student graduating this May. I worked so fucking hard for the past 4 years to get a couple of internships. My dream internship started in February as part time and was supposed to continue until the end of summer. I was actually pretty happy since I felt a fulltime position was within reach. I almost felt like I made it after working so hard. Then I was let go.

Being let go, and with a small amount of savings, I decided to jump into the current stock market. Made some money, but fucked up big time cutting my savings into half losing 5K. I regret it. I fucking hate myself for it. I think I almost died today from high blood pressure.

This all comes down to the fact that I feel like everything I had worked so hard for is gone. I am competent. When I put my mind to something I get it done. I was told by my team lead on my last day that I was already an employee for him, then I was let go. I cannot blame them, tough times. But why me? It is not fucking fair.

Anyways, this all comes down to this feeling of suffocation. My initial plan was to take a break for two weeks and then start aggressively working on LeetCode and applying to big tech. However, just before I started, it became clear that even big tech is cutting their hiring. I feel fucked. I do not know what to do. I cannot just go back where I came from, because that just means all is lost. I just want a job for a year and a half to make some cash and apply for grad school so that I can get into Fall 2021.

I do not know what to do. I lost my composure. This is my last semester and I am losing my shit school-wise. I am also pretty broken because of how my savings got fucked. And I am also feeling like I  have zero chance of getting a job or surviving for the next two years. Things could not have gotten fucked up at a worse time. Fuck COVID-19. Fuck the recession.

Thanks for reading my rant. Please do not worry about me harming myself or anything like that, I am just extremely panicking."

I plan on using it for AAA gaming and occasionaly programming and data science projects for school, but I have a laptop that I'll continue using for that for the most part. Performance wise I'm hoping for 60fps at 1080p on higher settings on most modern AAA games. My total budget is around 2500 USD at the most and I am buying in the United States. For some more detail this is the last summer I'll be staying with my parents while working on a remote internship and I want to build a pc that will last for a least a few years. 

As for my actual build related questions. The first is the power supply, I'm really not sure what to get here, I'm hoping for something not super loud as that was a problem I had with a pc I built in high school. The second is the cpu and cooler for it as well. I haven't kept up with current cpu's as I haven't had to build a pc in a while so I'm not sure if this is the best option. For the cooler, preferably quiet and rgb. I'm getting a glass sided case and plan on using this for a while so I want it to look cool. Finally, case fans as well, I'm hoping for something not very loud and with rgb too for the same reason as the cpu cooler. Also if you think there's any thing else I should change I'm totally welcome for any opinions, I'm asking for advice for a reason.

g5srot,6,2020-04-21,extreme social anxiety - how to deal with regret,sport54123,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/g5srot/extreme_social_anxiety_how_to_deal_with_regret/,"I am 28 years old from Canada. I moved from South America with my family when I was 11. 

Ever since I remember (since I was 2 or 3) I have been extremely shy and anxious. Kids at school would always comment how shy I was and how little I spoke. In south america I finished until grade 5, and then I moved to Canada. Shyness and speaking a different language at school made things a lot more difficult. It was very tough to make new friends for me. My parents also sent me to a summer camp in the summer for a few years and remember kids always making fun of my accent, and one kid especially made a song about it. High school was difficult, I was often alone, and never reallly had any real friends. I tried to fit in but was never integrated to any groups. In grade 9 when I started people did make some effort to get me involved with them but I was so shy and socially anxious that I avoided them. Then, later in the year, I tried to make friends and it became really tough. This never improved throughout high school.

I became day camp counselor for two summers in high school. I thought I would get out of my shell like that and even that did not work. 

Then university came, and ended up deciding staying at home for university. This is one of my regrets. Every single day I think what would have happened if I have gone aways for university. If things might have been different. One of the reasons I did not go away, was because a) scared I would not fit in, and people would make fun at res and b) in my culture, people dont usually go away for university, they stay at home

University was tough. Again, never really fit in with anyone. I decided to study engineering.. After my first year of university, I decided to be a camp counsellor at an overnight summer camp. I felt i was bullied quite a bit by other counselor, and at the end of the summer, I was voted the most socially awkward counselor at camp. One of the most embarrasing moments of my life. Also, on visitors day, the mother of a fellow counselor apparently asked his son, if I had some sort of mental problems. And she did not event interact with me. That really hurt. Other counselors also never took me seriously and made fun of my acceent.

During second year of university, I decided to join a fraternity in university. It gave me a temporary group of ""Friends"" but again, i felt i never really fit in. I was so socially anxious that I never told anyone that I was in a fratenity for fear of what they think of me. I was always scared my engineering classmates would find out so I always hid it, and was extremely scared of being caught. The fraternity gave me possibility to go to parties that I would not have been able to go otherwise.

I becams ""friends"" with a fellow person from the same country in the fraternity. I have always been really closed off with everyone and never told him I had a sister in the USA, or a brother in the US who was a phd. I was afraid I would be judged for being wealthy. Now, he messages me once in a while on facebook, and I am scared of telling him about my siblings because I am extremely afraid he will be mad at me for never having told him I had siblings in the US. I also did not mention about my sister for fear he would make fun if she was good looking. That happened to me in the past.

During my third year of university i joined a music club in the university and became part of the board. I felt this was a good way to make friends. Again, never really became close with anyone.

I took an internship after my third year, and worked at an office for the first time. My fellow intern, who was from another university made me feel really bad about myself constantly. He even denied taking me on his car for lunch when the boss told him to. 

I took improv classes after university for two years but even though they were really fun and worked in the moment, after couple months the effect of the improv classes faded.

Been working for the last 4-5 years and I feel drained. I quit my new job in january after 3 months because i was dreading waking up. I was going to go on an organize trip abroad for 4 months to be an intern but in the end i did not. Part of it was because of fear people would make fun about my poor social skills. Then i regretted my decision and looked for other programs but then the virus came in March so this plan was out of the question. I ended up finding a new job that starts in 2 weeks. The only thing i dont like is the hiring manager was looking for someone to stay there for a long time, and i do not like that. 

Anyhow, how can i deal with the constant regret? one of the regrets I have is having gone away for university. Also, not going on an exchange program at univeristy although I never really thought about it when i was in university.

Also, I have always hid things and lied a little about myself. For example, not having told people I had siblings. Scared people will be really mad if they find out I do. Sometimes, i want to say that my oldest brother had two kids but i do not because they do not know I have a brother in the first place. Also, never told people what my parents do, or where I have i travelled to, or that i used to play tennis tournaments, or that I was a camp counselor.

Another thing i lied during university was the high school I went to. I went to a religious private school. For fearing of being judged as wealthy, I just said i went to a public school. Now, I really regret that.

Another issue i have now is dating. I vee been on a few dates from online apps but really scared getting close and girls finding out about my non existent sexual experience. How can i deal with that?

During school, university, and work, there has always people that made fun of my poor social skills and how shy I am. It's been really challenging living like that.

g5tqob,0,2020-04-21,I think going to a top undergrad ruined me...,demonic_overtaker,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/g5tqob/i_think_going_to_a_top_undergrad_ruined_me/,"Greetings everyone. Hope you are all doing okay. In this time of quarantine away from campus, I'm realizing just how much I feel that I'm not gonna be able to go to a good grad school, and it sucks. A little tale on how I fucked up my undergrad lol.

I'm a junior at one of HYPSM, and college has been so rough. I really wanted to study physics (it's what got me into the schools), but my family convinced me that pursuing a career in physics was irresponsible for both my financial future and the stability of our family (we're very low income and struggle). 

So after anxiously fumbling around with different majors, trying to find a balance between interesting content and future earnings, I fell upon CS. I don't like it per se, as in, I'd never do this by itself if money weren't my chief concern. But for a brief moment in time, my possible interests in research started to become clearer. I figured, hey maybe I can work in software engineering for a little bit, save money, then go to grad school to do something combining CS and physics, with the expectation of returning to industry after grad school to do even cooler, and potentially lucrative, work. And I really missed physics and wanted to find any way that I could continue studying it. So I sought help from my advisor who could help me with discussing this path.

And essentially the story is, unless I do some sort of a Masters to get more research, take more rigorous courses, and get to know more faculty, grad school is looking bleak. I'm sort of doing the bare minimum for my degree right now because my health took a nosedive in the past year (and my parents wouldn't let me take time off from school), and also I switched into the major late after fumbling around with physics and mathematics and such. So my schedule doesn't look very rigorous whatsoever; it just appears scattered without any focus. 

And if I want to do something combining physics, I'd at least need to do a second major with physics, or try to get those courses in somehow, but I'm already so behind on that front - I've only finished up to the quantum mechanics track, nothing past that. I've only done one summer of research (which I really enjoyed!), and no paper from that, only a poster presentation. According to my advisor, even if I managed to get into a lab my last year of college, it's unlikely to be enough. My GPA is okay at a \~3.8, but if my schedule isn't rigorous to my advisor, I guess it doesn't mean anything. So their advice is essentially, think about a masters, and ways to pay for that.

I'm just so sad about this. I feel like going to one of these schools has hurt me. Since day one, I have felt soooo behind my peers. My high school did not at all prepare me for the rigor here. I almost feel like I might have been better off taking an offer at my top state school. My friends who did worse than me in high school went there, and they're all doing super well leading balanced lives and on track for graduate school. I've seen syllabi and homework for their courses, and I am not trying to diminish their education in the slightest, but the rigor of their classwork would've been something I could've handled. The pressure and expectations here have just strung me out so much, weakened my transcript, and maybe even delivered a fatal blow to my confidence. 

Is there merit to the idea that being a big fish in a small pond can actually make you more successful, even without the immense opportunities available at big ponds like HYPSM? Or am I just being whiny about my own lack of success? Maybe I'm just not cut out for grad school in something like CS or physics? Maybe it's best that people tell me now that I am not gonna excel in research so I don't waste my time and miss out on earnings from a job? Idk. I've secured decent internships on the cs side of things, and as long as I continue to grind on that front, I think I should be okay as far as well paying entry jobs are concerned. But I just don't like the work. That summer of research (was a DoE funded one) was the most enjoyable thing ever. I feel like maybe research is for the privileged, not for people who come from families like mine.

Sorry for the long rant. I'm not even sure if I'm seeking advice, though I welcome it. This is the most relevant community I could share my thoughts in."

Although I am quite comfortable with programming and I plan to further my skillset, I was never a good student.

This semester my academic performance is just barely subpar and I am starting to get lost in the work due all my professors pushing assignment after assignment down our throats

&amp;#x200B;

I always pondered whether I can learn everything they teach for my degree online, get certificates, complete freelance/individual projects, etc... I am really interested in data science/machine learning and I've done more for my online course than I have for my actual school work lol. I recently received an opportunity from one of my distant relative to attend a 6 month bootcamp hosted by his data science consulting company for free. The course is indeed rigorous, and we'd have to work in a collaborative setting completing projects we get to put on our resume. Based on my performance, this may lead me to potential internships since the company has connections to many other companies. 

So I guess my question is...Should I take a break/potentially drop out in an attempt pursue an early career in data science or should I still continue with my academics? Personally, I just feel like I am wasting time, energy, and money with college (especially since its all online and the value of instruction has gone down imo). I recently met someone who is the same age as me working as a sales director in the marketing department of a software company, and he makes $230k/yr and he dropped out of college.

I've contributed a lot to this company and in return, I got offered certain job promises by the manager in the future once my current projects get over. 

I have learned a lot in these 8 months as well as feels like I can go for a software developer job, but since I will only be graduating in 2021(not sure whether that changes due to the pandemic), I'm not able to apply for a full position. 

For all the companies that I apply to, the only result I'm getting is ""Sorry, we have founded a better/more qualified candidate"". It's devastating sometimes since I feel like what is the purpose of doing an internship with 8 months experience, with a Graduate degree?

Even for the junior level or no experience required job posting, no one is even considering having a further proceeding after the initial stage of job application which is Resume. I even thought it was my resume that people didn't like, and I have altered it a lot.

What should I do? continue with the internship or quit it and contribute to opensource?"

Indecisive on my post grad plan.,jake7405,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g5wjne/just_finishing_up_sophomore_year_in_us_indecisive/,"So I am majoring in CS with a focus in Software eng. at a large university in the US. I’m just wrapping up this semester, and have finals in 2 weeks. Having gotten through half of college, I’m now thinking about my plans after I get my BS. 


My university does offer an accelerated masters program where I can start some grad classes my senior year/double count some classes for grad credit and get my masters in 1 year, no GRE. This is originally what I had in mind, but I’ve been exploring other options. I am a US/Canada dual citizen, and have been exploring a return to Canada for personal reasons. (Moved here in ‘08)


My only worry would be finding a job. While any hope of an internship this summer was dashed by COVID-19, I’ll be pursuing personal projects, networking, and internships over the next 2 years very heavily. I’m not sure what the job market will be like in Canada or whether they’d hire someone living in the US even if they’re a citizen (heard mixed opinions on this before). 


If I did get a job soon  after graduation, I could hopefully find a role that offered subsidized continuing education if I do want to pursue a masters.


I’m just not really sure what to do. Basically, do I stay or do I go? If anyone has some insight on this, I’d appreciate it.


TLDR: get accelerated masters in USA or try to get a job right out of college in Canada with citizenship for both?"
g5ww6s,3,2020-04-22,Choosing between 2-3 fields,girardfe,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/g5ww6s/choosing_between_23_fields/,"Hey,

I am studying Computer Science and Mathematics in my Bachelors (Germany) and future-wise I am split between somewhat divergent fields. I am fairly certain I'll do a PhD after completing my masters since I like the type of work you do in research. I am not worried about what I'll do after my PhD, since I guess I will have found out by then, but I don't know which field to focus most of my time and energy on.

Maybe this is too field-specific, but I'll give it a shot anyways.

* **Progamming language theory/type theory/mathematical logic:** Within computer science, I am most interested in programming language theory/functional programming/type theory and would love to dive deeper into those and adjacent fields. I am currently doing an undergrad research project and I can imagine spending more time in that field, since I am very comfortable with the methods. The research questions themselves don't interest me as much as they do for other fields, and I am not sure about the 'big picture' impact work in this field would have on the world, but I know I would feel comfortable going into PL theory.
* **Cognitive science:** I have been very lucky in that I have been able to work as an RA in a great cognitive psychology lab. While being there, I have found a mentor who is *very* supportive and who has given me amazing opportunities so far. Thanks to him, I have been able to do a research internship at a great place which I *really* enjoyed, and which got me hooked on doing a PhD. I am currently completing projects together with him and preparing for a conference (which will take place online due to the Covid situation). What I really like about cognitive science are the research questions, what I don't feel comfortable with are the methods. I haven't really gotten into empirical sciences so far, because the methods feel inherently 'fuzzy' to me. Whatever I do in cognitive sciences, I miss the formalisms, clearness and rigorousness of algebra/logic/discrete maths. Also I am not a huge fan of analysis, so I doubt whether the more physics-born dynamic-systems-approaches to cognitive sciences/neuroscience are right for me. Also, as a bonus, there are many fun people in cognitive sciences.
* **Nursing:** The odd one out, but a choice I have already considered before going to University. I guess I am biased here since both of my parents are nurses, but I've worked on and off in an ICU for a couple of years doing maintenance work and (recently started working there again due to the Covid situtation) and I sometimes feel directly working with patients would be the only way for me to *meaningfully* affect the world around me (this has become especially apparent to me during the current situation). It would be an option for me to go to do a nursing apprenticeship after finishing my Bachelors in CS and maths.

**To sum it up:** **Cognitive sciences** would be the most fun/interesting/effectful; **computer science/math** would be the most comfortable/beautiful/enjoyable methods-wise; **nursing** would make me feel most fulfilled in a superordinate need to do good.

Also, I don't know how I could combine my specific interests in computer science and cognitive sciences, since deep learning/statistical methods don't interest me as much as symbolic logic does, which has not proved itself a successful tool (to my knowledge) after early attempts (Andler, D. (2012). Mathematics in Cognitive Science. In *Probabilities, Laws, and Structures* (pp. 363-377). Springer, Dordrecht).

&amp;#x200B;

This may be a bit messy, but that is part of the reason why I am here. I am open to any stimulation/experience any of you has had in this, may it be field-specific or methodologically.

Thank you."

I am taking all the pre-reqs in Math and CS now to get into an online CS master's program like Georgia Tech or University of Texas.  I am not sure yet whether I want to aim for SWE roles or DS/ML. Interestingly enough, the pre-reqs leave me close enough to picking up a post-bacc in Math in 1-2 years. It would take me over twice as long to get a post-bacc in CS because the local state school requires more than 10 extra electives compared to the Computer Science degree.

As an alternative to the math degree, I could focus my scarce free time on personal projects and then overlap that with the grad program to land an internship while in the grad CS program. I could also go the bootcamp route. But with the endgame of potentially working in ML, should I just  get the Math post-bacc and postpone grad school? Does this make sense and would it make me more marketable for internships? I cannot tell whether that level of mathematical education is just a nice to have or something that can make or break my prospects with my limited background? The math courses I would take include both applied math and pure math. I'm also not sure how much longer I would work full-time in an unrelated role if it meant seriously delaying the completion of the degree.

Tldr: I might want to work in ML without CS or STEM BS degree, would getting a post-bacc Math degree first make me a more competitive candidate for breaking into an SWE role or eventually working in ML?"

I am considering dropping out; the thing is I do not have a definite plan. 

It’s been my dream to study in Germany.

On the money front, I plan on continuing to work and get another job in the time that frees up from my college. I make decent money so I hope on saving from that.

The majors I am considering are Bachelors in Computer Science, Bachelor in Management &amp; Technology (BSc) , BEng in Business and Engineering. I would best prefer doing my courses in English, because I don’t know german.

What is currently going through my mind is

\- I drop out

\- Continue my internship and tutoring. Start working full time for my internship or get another full time job.

I am in intern, in my last semester of school.
This semester was supposed to be my best one yet, but pandemic and all. Previously I had completed a university required internship, where the university placed students in a internship somewhat relevant to their field. The internship I was placed in was exactly where I wanted to be,  even though the bosses were luke warm and barely interacted with interns (long story aparently these supervisors had gotten in trouble for partying with the previous round of interns)I felt as though anything I learned was self taught, and the biggest victories were inclusion in various meetings. 
My second ans current internship is with a huge nationwide company. I fought for it, research heavily for the interview, and was elated when they picked me. Before the pandemic, I was doing alright, the employee they picked as my supervisor is sweet, mild mannered, and patient. Her boss is not, her boss has violent, and fast mood swings from hostile to overly complimentary. Since the pandemic, I've been working remotely, which has been more difficult for me in many ways. I am a high risk for Covid-19, and I have many family members who are also high risk, but dont believe it's a real risk, they recite the old, it's the flu, wash your hands bullshit.
Since working from home, I have been a ball of stress, every interaction I've had with these two bosses I have swallowed my stress and been pleasant, informed, interested, really trying my best. Since the pandemic, my job roles have changed. I no longer learn new skills, I primarily enter data. I've made a good handful of simple mistakes,  number transposed, etc... nothing unfixable,  nothing severe in my opinion severe.
I try every day, go super slow, and even read things out loud. I cant seem to catch some of the mistakes I'm making, but im making them often enough that it's an issue, past the humanity leeway.

I've been applying for jobs since February, many of which are responding to my application with an update they are closing with out filling.

Finally I got an interview, its 5 part process. I made it to the 4th round, which is where they checked references. Every previous job I've had gave me a wonderful review, I've  made a point to never leave on bad terms even in unideal circumstances.
This current internship, both managers  contacted me after the reference call, explained how excited they were for me, and claimed their reference were wonderful.


I found out in interview number 4 that wasnt the case. They had apparently complained I wasnt detail oriented, made a lot of mistakes, but talked alot about how great of a person I was, and how I team played well, collaborated well. They couldnt really vouch for how quickly I learned because since I've worked from home, I haven't had the chance to try to development skills, at least with this company.



I'm writing this post for two reasons,
 First, I need advice on what to do to avoid making mistakes.
Second, is this reference a kiss of death to my career?

I spent $60k in loans, and 6 years of my life to get to this point. I worked retail for a long time, and I never want to go back. But I'm worried that I'll have no choice, no options, but to take my degree off my resume and do what I have to do to support my family. Dying a little inside every day. This is all of course, assuming I don't have extreme issues when I do eventually contract covid-19.

I'm just lost, disappointed in myself, scared my future is  fucked .

I'm writing because I found myself in an interesting situation that I think many students don't even encounter. I'm doing my Bachelor's CS degree and will finish it next year, but before that, I must finish one semester of ""internship"" at any IT company. Usually, students from our faculty do it in the last semester so they can then carry on with official employment after graduation. Here in Slovenia, those ""internship"" positions are paid equally as a junior developer position if you're not complete dumbo who doesn't know how to pass a simple FuzzBuzz test. Nevertheless, many of us have a lot of hobby projects to show our future employers. Because our faculty offers an opportunity to finish this internship abroad via Erasmus, I'd take this opportunity and go do it in one of the cities in Europe (Amsterdam, Brussels, Berlin...).

Did anyone here do such a thing? How did employers react? Should I just look for a junior developer job and then mention this internship thingy the way? :) I personally don't see a big problem if I pass their code test, show some references and if they're satisfied with my performance and with the fact that I wouldn't have my official degree for the first half of the year. I also wouldn't want employers to think they can pay almost nothing just because I'm obliged to work for half a year due to my UNI.

g649hl,226,2020-04-22,A few tips for applying to co-op jobs - from an employer,elias_lstu,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/g649hl/a_few_tips_for_applying_to_coop_jobs_from_an/,"First, I have to say I was overwhelmed by the number of people who applied for our two positions. There's so much talent available and I'm messaging every company owner I know in the hopes they'll hire more UW co-ops.

After reviewing over 200 applications, I have some advice for those of you applying for co-op jobs.

Who made the short-list, and why?

1. Make sure you are actually relevant for the position. If the position is for a Marketing Intern and you're a programmer, tweak your resume. Why do your skills lend themselves to the position? Just wildly posting your resume to every last job is a sure way to get lost in the shuffle. As a hiring manager, I may look at an applicant for 30 seconds or less. 
2. Don't talk about your grades first. Talk about your real-world results. 
3. Don't make your resume into an eye-chart with size 7 fonts and paragraphs of text. I had two applicants for one position - one gave me a paragraph all about a course they took, and one gave me a 1-sentence point about how their work resulted in a 33% increase in X. Who do you think I selected for an interview?
4. Make your cover letter relevant to the job. Even better if in the first paragraph you can tell me why your past experience makes you a good fit for the job. Show me you understand my pain. Don't just tell me about your past experience - I'll just say ""so what?"" *Show me the so what!*
5. Don't attach your term paper for me to read. It looks awesome but I don't have the time.
6. Tell me what you did at your past jobs, and tell me *why it mattered.* What were the *results*? Did you decrease turnaround time by 30%? Did you increase engagement by 15%? Did you help the team ship code faster by 2 weeks on average? *Everybody can work as part of a dynamic group and reduce overheads,* or some other generic jargon. Why did what you do matter? What were the results?

tl;dr: Talk about your results. Customize your cover letter. Don't give employers an eye chart to read. Make sure your skills are relevant to the job. And talk about your results! Those matter the most - if I see you can talk about the results of your work, that demonstrates to me that you can see the big picture and understand why what you do *matters*.

Good luck out there!"

I currently live in Colorado, and am on track to wrap up my current paid internship second week of May.

My question is if I can file for unemployment?

Details:

I have been searching for a job, sending applications out every day since February, with a few interviews but no offers yet. A lot of courtesy responses explaining that the job has closed with out being filled.

I currently do data entry, and employee maintenance. When I've terminated an intern in the past the reason I select is ""shortage of work""
 unless the  intern leave before the end of their contract, then it's a resignation.

As I understand,  any workers whom the reason for the end of their employment is shortage of work, are eligible for unemployment.

My question is, can I file for unemployment after my internship ends? It's had a known ending date.
I've seen some pretty nasty unemployment battles with my company my boss really doesnt value unemployment. My bosses are absolutely slammed, and barely available to chat about any family work I have, so I dont feel comfortable asking them, their opinions on it. I also don't want it to sour my reference. My main boss has pretty hostile mood swings, ranging from harsh and blowing up to sickeningly complimentary. I never know what mood I will catch her in either.

I need income though, I'm nearly in financial ruins as is, since this is my last semester in university..

I guess I vent it off through this post. Please correct me if my post doesn't belong or breaks any rule in this subreddit. Also, as I am not a native English speaker, so forgive my grammar mistake.  


I like to talk some of my background before I go into my current situation. So I am coming from Asian Family. While my story isn't as extreme as story in AsianParentStories subreddit, but it does affect my current mental health. As the eldest son in my family, I was "" taught"" to be have the responsibilities to ensure everyone close to me is ""perfectly"" fine. Got grounded couple of times because something bad happened to my brother or them. And this become a basis of who am I currently, I always have a habit to reach out and ensure people I care about does not have any issue (usually my family and couple of my close friend), do my very best to cover other responsibilities if they are unable to finish.   


During my school lives, one of my teacher started to worry about my weird behavior and decide to have a talk with my parents as she think I shouldn't be overloaded with this kind of responsibility. She gives her perspectives as a parent, and trying to correct my parent parenting on me. It quickly leads to a big quarrel, where my parents tell the teacher to mind her own business.   


So, during one of my university internship where I had to work remotely (at my rental house for couple of days), my younger brother  suddenly ask me to do house chores. When I told him I would do it after my work as I am busy at the moment, he suddenly snapped at me, and expect me to do it now as it has always been my usual responsibilities. This is where it started my fear. Then, that's where  I started to experiment on rejecting other people request on purpose. I just found out that no one gives a fuck on me, basically people only call me when they need me but wouldn't helped me when I need their help. The worse part is everyone including my parents are expecting my help or else they think I am out of my character. During these period, I starting to get worse by each days and I started losing some of my friend.   


During my last year, I  started to exhibit some of the signs that I need help from counselor. I started to be very trigger-happy, would suddenly show my anger towards other out of nowhere if they claimed I am responsible for thing I shouldn't have in the first place. For example, there is one time where a volunteer comes up to me and wants my donation on the poor and needs. When I am about to take out my wallet and makes a donation, he suddenly said as someone (me) that are fortune enough, I have the responsibility to give back the community. I couldn't control myself and I immediately put back my wallet and tell the volunteer to fuck off. I proceed to have a panic attack for 2 hour. I know I what I am doing is not normal and very rude to the volunteer, but the tone of the volunteer just remind of me being used by other and I couldn't help myself. This is the time where I started to meet my counselor where I am still going today.  


Recently because of the quarantine, I am still working at my home remotely for about a month. Today, I had a retrospective meeting on the last week project with my head of department where he gives disappointment on me based on my performance today. One of my new (very recent) colleague (senior) accuse me of not being very helpful for the past few weeks as I overlook his message on requesting my help on certain things. But what they didn't know is that I worked my ass a lot because my new teammates are unfamiliar to the project and unable to do most of the assignment from the client, as a result I have to work overtime for a week and a half, sacrificing my sleep just to allow the project to finish on the due date. After the meeting, I starting to afraid being bullied like the last ex-colleague (a senior) I had where she shoved most of her works on me.   


This is today trigger I had followed by housemate (unintentionally) jokes on me for not doing my job in protecting him on some online games and some facebook and reddit post where I saw some doctor-shame, rich-shame on the current pandemic issue. These are what fuels my fear this evening. For the last three hours, I uninstall my facebook app of my phone and several subreddit where their usual post that trigger my fear. Then followed by having a mild panic attack. Currently it is on midnight on here, but I still trouble to have my sleep because of it.   


I am very tired of my weakness as it is really troublesome.I know some of the action triggered by other sometimes are not intended, but I couldn't help myself at that moment, where I goes anger and paranoid at everyone intention. I am unable to contact my counselor because of the quarantine my country place."

After that shot in the face, I emailed the other company for at least an internship over the summer and they told me the same exact thing the other company did.

In light of present events I've been made redundant by my employer - a restaurant. I'm in my first year studying Mathematics and Statistics with the Open University (UK) online, that's how I was able to balance both work and studies full-time. 

Now, I have about 4 months of expenses in savings so I could afford being unemployed. I want to use the free time as an opportunity to retrain intensively to find an entry-level position or paid internship, preferably with Python, but I understand there's a bunch of frameworks and librairies, and even other langages such as JS that I'll have to learn as well.

I have completed CS50 (edX) before and have some n00b understanding of how to program.

The problem is, this feels like a mountain and I'm not sure what to aim for. There is an incredible amount of free resources on the internet and I've learned to Google things up, but I would like to optimise my time. All I know is that I need to be job ready in about 3 to 4 months (because I need money to pay bills eventually) so I would value any oppportunity in software engineering, should it be front-end or back end. I live in London, so there will be options available I hope. My older brother works as a techlead in a bank so he's happy to help me, but very busy with his family in confinement, and ultimately it is all down to me.

g66wng,1,2020-04-22,New Grad: Job update,Trelyin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g66wng/new_grad_job_update/,"Thought I'd share my experience so far  as a new grad and provide some insight. A bit of background: I graduated from a 4 year state college with a B.S in computer science. I've only had one internship and I started my first job in January at the company I interned at the summer before as a software developer.  Here are some things that I feel will help out new grads:

Learn how to read and understand other peoples code: You won't be coming in creating or designing any new applications. You'll more than likely be working on a code base that has been there for years. In my case the code base I was working on was first written when I was in middle school.  It can be overwhelming making sense of all those changes and refactoring that's been done throughout the years, but that's something that just comes with practice.

A majority of what you need to know to do your job, you'll learn on the job: Before starting my job I had no idea what how to deploy using Jenkins, or building applications using Spring or Maven.There was just a lot of things I just dind't know how to do. College just taught me the fundamentals for the most part (OOP principles, Data Structures, etc). It didn't teach me how to develop enterprise applications or add business value to my company. The company doesn't expect you to be a top tier programmer off the jump. They want to see your ability to learn and problem solve efficiently.

Learning how to learn:  Our field is constantly changing and with that we have to adapt to the changing environment as well. Being able to grasp different concepts efficiently and being able to apply it to the problem you're solving is something that will benefit you throughout your career. Coming in I had to rethink my approach to the way I grasped new topics and approached problems.

Biggest obstacle that I faced: Imposter syndrome: I am by no means the greatest programmer. I believe I am below average honestly. There were times where I'd get stuck on an issue or defect that I couldn't resolve and I'd get hella discouraged to the point I almost just shut down. Just know this, the company wouldn't have hired you if they knew you weren't competent enough to be there. Once I realized this I was able to deal with the issue of getting discouraged a lot better. Some days I still get stuck on an issue and some days I'm able to code my ass off.

I know things have been hella crazy because of the Pandemic and shit but try to keep your head up everyone and I hope this helps."

I'm a rising junior and I'm not so sure what class schedule I want to pursue next semester. I was originally planning on taking ECE 391, ECE 313, and possibly an easy technical course and/or a gen-ed, but I'm frankly not so sure anymore. I've heard that ECE 391 really requires one to be comfortable with programming/version control/debugging (specifically talking about tools like Valgrind and GDB). I've chugged along well enough through ECE 220 and CS 225, but I'm by no means extremely fluent at these things. If it gives some reference, all my 'computer' experience is from ECE 220 and CS 225 (and to a lesser degree, AP CS in HS), and I haven't done much outside of class. My dad, an embedded systems guy who's done a lot of work with Linux kernel related work, is really discouraging me from taking ECE 391 next semester.

Really, beyond my skills, I'm worried about my ability to manage my workload. I have ADHD, and I have trouble with time management. That isn't to say that I'm a bad student - I've done fairly well up to now, but I haven't taken anything as heavy as ECE 391 yet, and I don't know how well I'd be able to hold up.

Would it be a good idea to take ECE 385 instead? I'm also particularly worried about course scheduling and internship opportunities... If I were to take ECE 391 second semester, I feel like I'd be limiting my ability to take special interest courses, as I know I can't take as much of a courseload while taking ECE 391. Also, I've been told that the internships that are 'opened up' by ECE 385 are much more limited in scope than those relevant to ECE 391."

* I graduated from my bachelors last year in molecular biology with a specific interest in genetics and biochemistry. Its aligned with the subjects I was most interested in as a kid; the world of microscopic machines and DNA.
* Research is something I definitely want in my future. Throughout my undergraduate years I took a special liking to the hours i spent at the lab. I liked it so much that i decided to build my rudimentary lab at home. I want to understand the fundamentals of Biology and the Chemistry within us and apply it to technology in a way that I believe is quite lacking in todays academic literature.

* My fascination with synthetic biology and biomedical engineering lead me to get in contact with prominent researchers at the pasteur institute and max plank society to ask for guidance on how to go about realizing that dream.
* They advised me that biomedical engineering degrees are a good way to learn interdisciplinary science and to be able to apply it is a huge plus

&amp;#x200B;

**Why specifically X?**

&amp;#x200B;

* I find the way the program is structured is interesting with a first semester purely theoretical section and a second semester internship option. In this structure it allows me to gain much more practical knowledge than if it was kept for the fourth semester like most other schools 
* I find that the program is well suited and structured for individuals who are interested in pursuing a PhD and this is something ive wanted to do for a long time and eventually have my own lab someday. 
* I have been in contact with both professors, research institutions and alumni at the university to ask questions about the program and hear their opinion on it
* The responses were overwhelmingly positive, which cant be a bad sign.
* Ive also been in touch with influential researchers like Ceers Bekker and Kate Adamala and I sent them a list of programs they could review. They advised me to apply to X in particular as the opportunities at the collaborative universities are quite vast and the research going on in my field of interest is quite pronounced here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do you feel prepared to start graduate school?**

&amp;#x200B;

* I have finally been able to pinpoint exactly what I want to dedicate my life to. During my undergraduate years I often speculated what kind of molecular biology research I wanted to conduct specifically. 
* It was during my senior year that I moved away from theoretical molecular biology to more applied molecular biology in the shape of nanotechnology and biomedical engineering 
* I also showed myself that I am able to handle a large amount of stress during my final year of undergrad without giving up which. I believe is a beneficial attribute to have going into graduate school and to be a successful student, and researcher in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Biggest strengths and weaknesses**

&amp;#x200B;

* Im a detail oriented person, which is a blessing in terms of getting things done on time and with the highest quality possible. That said I find that ive needed to work on seeing the bigger picture of things this past year. Its still something im working on but i feel like ive made alot of progress in that regard
* Academic achievement and learning has always been a priority for me and like most things in life, the downside to that is I find myself to be too self critical. This is also something i work on addressing, how to balance becoming more flexible while still maintaining a commitment to achieve my goals.
* Right now im focusing more on my family. This is why at least once every couple of days I call my parents and siblings. I believe a cornerstone of the graduate experience is to be deeply involved and passionate in my research project . A key factor to succeeding I would say would be to have a strong protective structure such as having a proper support system. Thats something ive been doing recently and has been incredibly fulfilling

&amp;#x200B;

**Research Interests**

&amp;#x200B;

* This is a question with a two part answer, every goal has a certain path but goals often have multiple paths in order to reach it.

&amp;#x200B;

1. First, my ultimate goal has always been, and probably will always be to increase the productive natural lifespan of a human being

* The fact that we only have 80 years of life is pretty unfortunate in my point of view.
* If i can learn enough about aging, senescence and its molecular mechanisms then I hope to be able to advance the knowledge in this field in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Secondly, the path towards my goal has been fluctuating somewhat throughout my academic life. I base my changes on the utility it can have to the public. Currently, the way I see is best to achieve my goal is through nanobiotechnology.

* As I see it right now, the first step towards that is to create nanoscale autonomous biosensors that imitate the quorum sensing capability in bacteria and report back to an artificial intelligence able to process the data in real time
* During my masters degree at X id like to develop this idea into a testable research project

&amp;#x200B;

**Development of the field**

&amp;#x200B;

* Currently synthetic biology is used to create high value molecules
* In 2018 a joint team from MIT and Harvard actually produced several molecules like pyrrolnitrin within a remarkable short period of time 
* Research is ongoing to eventually be able to predictably engineer novel metabolic pathways, genes or even entire organisms from scratch.
* There is a lot of research into producing theranostic cell lines that can sense a diseases state and trigger an appropriate response but our metabolomic research isnt good enough to produce a disease fingerprint yet
* A lot of research is currently going into microfluidic systems and lab-on-chip development along with biosensors and biomaterial development and it seems most funding goes to these areas 

&amp;#x200B;

**Most significant accomplishment**

* There are two but they are interlinked with each other

&amp;#x200B;

* The first one is actually my homemade lab.
* Ive managed to create machine that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars such as the Nanodrop machine for a fraction of the cost
* The nanodrop machine cost me less than 100 dollars in supplies
* It showed me that I dont need to rely solely on asking people for permission when it comes to doing things that I like
* I no longer needed to wait for my lab days to be in the lab, I could just open a door and id be there
* It also gave me experience in asking questions to a more independent degree that I did before I started building it
* When designing your own experiments out of pocket you have to optimize every process in order to cut costs and work as effectively as possible
* In this way, I learned a lot of methodology planning and general scientific procedures to reach a conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

* Second is that I proved to myself that I could handle an immense amount of stress and mental discomfort by pulling myself out of my head after my kidnapping with the help of others
*  Since then Ive learned that a large part of getting the places you want to get is largely dependent on yourself individually but the support network you have around you can help significantly in doing so
* Those two points laid the groundwork for who I am today and will likely be responsible for my future accomplishments

&amp;#x200B;

**Long term career goals**

&amp;#x200B;

* If there is anywhere I want to be in the next 5 years, its in a lab of my interest.
* Theres a few in particular that i would like to explore if i am admitted to the program, for instance:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Pasteur Institute

*  David Bikards Synthethic biology team
* Charles Bariouds microfluidics and bioengineering team
* Pierre Lafayes Antibody Engineering team

&amp;#x200B;

1. Curie Institute

The Multiscale Physics-Biology-Chemistry and Cancer department

* They are experts in the interdisciplinary field of synthetic biology and nanobiotechnology and the research they have produced is remarkable papers
* For example they detailed a method where they used click chemistry to label and visualize a large range of dynamic small molecules in vivo
* This is of great interest to me and my biosensor research interest

&amp;#x200B;

1. University of Paris

Microsystems and Nanobiofluidics lab in the center for nanoscience and nanotechnology

* They have great team headed by Pierre-Yves Jourbert that deal with issues that are relevant to my research topic
* Their biodevices and nanobiofluidics especially.
* Their research on microswimmers prompted me to actually send an email to Joubert asking if he would be willing to allow me to shadow their team if I am admitted to the program

Functional and adaptive biology department

* They have a very relevant team for degenerative processes and aging that interests me
* Their research involve the pathology of aging and it would be incredible to get to learn under a team with such a vision

&amp;#x200B;

**What else should we know about you / What sets you apart from other candidates**

* Yes, I dont believe we talked about it but I have quite a lot of experience in programming with different languages. I currently know 4 computer languages and plan to dive deeper into computer science by learning about computer architecture, neural networks, and artificial intelligence.
* I believe these skills will come to good use when if I am admitted and  something that sets me apart from other candidates"
g67spl,8,2020-04-22,TIFU be being No.1 and becoming the number one asshole,04chri2t0ph3r,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/g67spl/tifu_be_being_no1_and_becoming_the_number_one/,"This happened a few years ago. I was reminded of this after someone posed the ""most embarrassing story"" question. Apparently mild alcohol abuse and avoidance haven't been enough to keep this jewel repressed.

Let me stage this:

During college I worked as an intern for a youth group. They took various trips throughout the year and I was to be there as a chaperone. This particular trip was the longest, at approximately 6 days. If you've ever been on a trip like this, you know that after day four (when this happened), everyone's nerves start to get a little irritated. Especially when there are 40+ high schoolers fresh into summer break. 

We are making our way back down to Ga. and it was time to stop for lunch. We all unload and go in. The restaurant is absolutely packed; it was busy before we got there. Once you place your order they hand you a ticket with a number. 

To my delight, I was order No. 1. Now, to this day, I have no idea why this made me so happy. I was filled with joy! I mean, what are the odds? There was a 1/100 chance of being number one at this exact moment in history! And it was me! The stars had aligned. God had smiled on me. Some planet was in retrograde or whatever the fuck. Bottom line is, I'M NUMBER FUCKING ONE.

I quickly took my ticket to our table and sat down with the senior guys. I expectantly listen as the order numbers are called. 97. 98. 99...oh shit! Is there an order 00 or am I up next?? I'm prepared. 

""NUMBER 1""

Remember that moment in history I mentioned earlier? In this blink of an eye three things happened simultaneously.

1st: I stand up excitedly, ticket in hand, proudly waiving it over my head like a winning lottery ticket, and exclaim, ""I'm number one!""

2nd: The entire restaurant stops and looks at me.

3rd: A child is walking down the row and gets hit by some dumbass standing up yelling ""I'm number one.""

Yep. And this isn't some annoying loud mouth ten year old. Oh no! This is the cutest freaking 3 year old boy you've ever seen. Upon collision he flew backwards and landed on his face at his mother's feet.

The restaurant is silent. Not only had I sent this kid flying, I had summoned everyone's attention that they might bear witness to one of humanity's great atrocities. 

There I stood. That once-coveted Ticket No.1 slowly sinking down from above my head. After what some may hyperbolically describe as an eternity, the silence is shattered by the child's screams. His mother quickly picked him up. There's blood on his lip. I'm praying he didn't have teeth before the incident because he certainly wouldn't have them now. The screams fill the restaurant as parents look on with concern. Mother's clutched their children to their breast. 

I rush over to check on him immediately. I apologise profusely. Can you believe that mother was angry and made clear that she wanted me nowhere near her baby? 

All she offered was a look. That look which is understood without interpretation throughout the entire world. A look which our ancestors were familiar and our posterity will discern. It says four little words:

""Eat shit and die.""

Had I the provisions, I would've done just that. But with no opportunity to remedy my error, I had no alternative but to shamefully pick up my order as everyone watched in silence. It was the longest, most shameful walk of my life. I can't describe the guilt. I had wounded one of God's most precious and innocent creatures. But no one could tell how sorry I was. To them, I was just an asshole.

Do you know how bad you got to fuck up when high school boys don't even laugh?? 

I tried my best to eat, but the nausea and self loathing were too great for me to bear. I threw my food away and returned to the counter; head hung low.

""Go 'head""

""Y-yes ma'am. I'd like to buy that little boy an ice cream cone.""

I took it over, the poor child still in his mother's arms, tear streaks marking his face.

""Can your son have this?""

She nodded but there was no hiding the scowl on her face. The boy took it. But it wasn't enough. There was no redemption for a monster like me. Not after what I've done. I quietly loaded myself onto the bus.

It was never the same after that; the looks these once friendly youth gave me...the look in the actual ""grown-up's"" eyes. But when you fuck up like I did, that just becomes the life you have to live out.



Tl;Dr: Am idiot. Got excited when my order number was one, jumped up, called everyone's attention to me, and collided with a small child and knocked him down and busted his lip."
g67uws,0,2020-04-22,Q&amp;A of Potential Grad School Interview Questions,MigorRortis96,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/g67uws/qa_of_potential_grad_school_interview_questions/,"A few days ago I reposted a list of questions that you can answer during a graduate school interview. This is my response to the ones that were particularly useful for me. Im applying to a biomedical engineering master's degree with a molecular biology background, in case that's relevant. Hope someone somewhere gets some use for this. My interview will be tomorrow so wish me luck!!

&amp;#x200B;

**Tell us a little about yourself**

&amp;#x200B;

* I graduated from my bachelors last year in molecular biology with a specific interest in genetics and biochemistry. Its aligned with the subjects I was most interested in as a kid; the world of microscopic machines and DNA.
* Research is something I definitely want in my future. Throughout my undergraduate years I took a special liking to the hours i spent at the lab. I liked it so much that i decided to build my rudimentary lab at home. I want to understand the fundamentals of Biology and the Chemistry within us and apply it to technology in a way that I believe is quite lacking in todays academic literature.

&amp;#x200B;

**What motivated you to apply to grad school:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a student studying computer engineering in my third year. I received a behavioral interview from an aersopace manufacturing company over the phone and made it to the next round, this one will be video which I've never done before. My previous internship offer was rescinded due to the pandemic so I feel a lot of pressure to get this, or I won't have a single internship throughout undergrad.

&amp;nbsp;

I have a couple of concerns, my major is computer engineering and most of my experience is software development and FPGA design, but this position doesn't have very much information and is titled: ""engineering intern"". When talking to the first interviewer, she didn't really give much detail other than I'd be working under a mentor and it would be whatever project they'd have for me this Summer. My main question is, how should I represent my value to the interviewer? What if they're looking for someone with aerospace/manufacturing experience? Regardless, I want the position because I want to learn as much as I can and it seems like an interesting company, even if it's not directly related to my specialties.

&amp;nbsp;

If I don't receive an offer, I'll do a major project this Summer and get a job doing electronics assembly so I did something relevant with my time.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you!"

I am graduating in less than a month from a top 50 undergraduate CS program with 20 months total of internship experience, the most recent one being at a big bank. I have gotten around 10 legitimate interviews out of hundreds of applications (Fortune 500/startups) but only ever made it on-site twice to Big N, where I always bomb it near the end. The most frustrating part is that I started recruiting last August, and I had a job offer fall through because of COVID, and some other chances but it never came into fruition because of some unknown generic phone interview failure.

Regardless, as a generalist software engineer, I feel like I do have the skillset to perform on the job, but I don't have a specific focus on front-end/back-end/systems, so my only way in is through leetcoding (it is what it is). That got me thinking though, is that if/when I do ""make it"" into a job, I don't think I'd really be in love with web development or creating APIs, even if I can do it.

I have been looking at engineering in trading firms/quant roles, cybersecurity, or ML, where I am genuinely a lot more interested in the material and applications, but I am no where near qualified for any roles for it. At this point I feel like I need to choose one that I can dedicate myself into rather than being a sub-par generalist software engineer who can leetcode. Some online masters also look very appealing, but I'm stuck at wit's end. Any advice would be appreciated"

I started applying pretty late (over winter break), but I still haven't been able to land even an interview yet. And most positions for now are closed, so there's nothing more I can really apply to (I've already applied to cloudflare, roblox, and those companies who've expanded their programs)

I've been pulled for some interviews, but in all this time, I've never gotten to actually talk to anyone yet: in the few times I've been contacted to move on, the interview was either been canceled due to coronavirus (they called me like an hour before to let me know they canceled internships), or I called the person only for them to let me know in the first five min they weren't looking for summer interns, but wanted semester-long internships. (I can't afford to take the semester off if I want to graduate next year)

What makes this worse is that I had an interview scheduled with a really big tech company today (FANG/unicorn), but they emailed this morning saying that the position has closed. And I had spent two weeks trying to schedule this and rescheduled more than 5x: basically the recruiter would give me a time, I would confirm it, then I would get another email with a new time the day of. And one of the times they gave me, I showed up but the interviewer wasn't aware bc apparently the recruiter never got the interview confirmed with the team.

I still have one chance left with an interview scheduled for next week, but I'm worried that I'll blow it or it'll be canceled for some other reason and there's really going to be nothing left.

I know its not the end of things but I'm planning on graduating next year and it's looking like I'm probably not going to have any experience which is going to make full-time recruiting so much harder. In the meantime I've been continuing to grind leetcode but my motivation is honestly close to 0 after all this.

edit: Hey everyone, thanks for all the responses. I’ve been reading them all and it’s comforting to hear that there are other people going through the same issues and honestly very inspiring to hear they’re recommendations and how they’re all getting through this and how they’re going to spend their summers despite it all

I wrote this when I was feeling pretty bummed after getting baited by the canceled interview bc I was really looking forward to it, but your words have all put this into perspective. Thanks so much y’all"

As I've completed my bachelor's in Business Management from an accredited university, I got my first job out of college in LA working in entry-level finance. While I see that many people's goals in the world of business is to eventually become an executive or head of their department, I aspire to be the most diversified Swiss-army knife that I can make myself to be in my career. Throughout college, I was able to obtain internships working in fields such as finance, business development, marketing, corporate training, etc. I feel that I'm equally passionate for all these areas and hope to eventually find a position (or multiple) that lets me utilize all these skillsets. 

I have a plan to get myself educated further by obtaining multiple grad school degrees within the following fields and my employer will help cover most of the tuition:

1. **(2020) Data Analytics/Coding:** I have no previous experience dealing with programming with Python, R, SQL, Tableau so I decided to enroll myself in a data analytics bootcamp to help me become familiarized with these concepts. Once I'm more prepared, I will be enrolling at Georgia Tech's analytics program to get more specialization and experience. It's a Top 10 program in the US for an affordable price. 
2. **(2021-2022) Accounting:** Because I work in finance, accounting is technically the language of business and will help me bridge the gap between the accounting team and the finance team at my job. That way I'm able to understand both aspects and can contribute to both departments. U of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is fully online and a top 2 program. I can get CPA certified once I've graduated by completing the exam.
3. **(2023-2024)** **Finance:** Getting a specialized master's in finance will only make my financial skills improve so why not? Especially working in corporate finance, it's a necessity to work my way up the finance ladder. Harvard Extension School offers an MS in Finance and will be going for that. 
4. **(2025)** **Marketing:** I never realized how important having a quantitative background in marketing plays in the business world. From being able to understand consumer trends and forecast how pricing changes will affect sales is all thanks to marketing. UC Berkeley Certificate should do. 

Am I insane or is this feasible?"

I've been in school for two years and the only useful programming skills I have so far are general OOP in Java, Python, and implementing some data structures in Java and C. I don't even fully understand how to use git. Right now I'm taking a web applications course to learn how to build dynamic websites. 

What are some examples of projects that someone not very skilled like me could do that would teach me a lot that could also look impressive on a resume and show off some technical expertise? 

Also, I'm graduating early (next year) and I fear that may actually be detrimental for me because I have one less year to intern and work on side projects that may help me in my career. Is this the case? Even this year, I was only able to get an internship as a sales engineering intern, rather than something like software engineering, which would be more relevant. What can I do to ""stay ahead"" so that I can get a good job when I graduate?

g6gyaw,1,2020-04-23,"I (20M) need to breakup with my girlfriend (20F), but whenever I try I always end up getting back with her",NorthPhrase,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g6gyaw/i_20m_need_to_breakup_with_my_girlfriend_20f_but/,"Basically, I don’t see a future with my girlfriend. We are involved in a polyamorous relationship, and while it hasn’t been a big issue in the past, I don’t want this dynamic in the future when we are out of college. While it’s nice having two other companions at all times, I miss being monogamous and I hate it when my girlfriends other boyfriend gives her any sort of attention (which has been happening a ton lately). I find that I’m happiest when we all act like a group of friends, but I also want to be in a monogamous relationship again. I also feel like I missed the college experience due to my relationship, which is starting to cause me some serious regret, especially with the whole COVID situation.

Another issue is my girlfriend expects us three to be together forever. She wants to get an apartment after COVID ends, and constantly points out apartments we can live in when we’re driving by them. I definitely do not want to live with them again, but I don’t know how to tell her that without breaking her heart. Not only that, but my girlfriend is head over heels for me. She’s my first girlfriend so I kind of want to explore and see what else is out there (I realized this when I developed a crazy crush on a coworker), but I’m like her third relationship and the first one where she was confident in her choice (basically she wants to be with me forever). She is constantly talking about how happy she is, and I’d feel terrible if I broke her heart like that. 

I actually tried breaking up with her the other day, but it didn’t end up going well. It started over text late at night, and at first she seemed okay with it. However, she kept making small remarks like “you said we would be together forever” and things of that nature. I started to think about all of our times together and I could feel myself being okay with leaving her. Then, she started to talk about how much stuff of hers is at my house and it just tore me down. She also said that she wanted to talk in person. The next day I just went over to her house and it was almost like nothing happened. We both apologized for how we acted, and we went on with our day as usual. 

Not only that, but our lives are extremely intertwined. She uses my email addresses for her accounts for various things, and even has her PayPal connected to my bank account for her etsy clothes selling service, which would be a pain to switch. I know that in the grand scheme of things this isn’t a big deal, but the process of switching everything over would create another opportunity for us to say “what are we doing” and get back together. 

I also get extreme anxiety when I’m alone, and my girlfriend and her other boyfriend are my only two friends. I’ve tried going a day without them and I started to literally freak out. I would say I’m extremely extroverted, and without them, I’d have nobody to see in person. I don’t know how to handle being alone and this is one of the major factors holding me back (COVID has also made this much worse). I’m also afraid that I won’t be able to leave in the future when making friends becomes exponentially harder due to the lack of school. 

Lastly, I still love her a ton and she is quite possibly the best friend I’ve ever had in life. She is the reason I got into college and got accepted for my dream internship. She keeps me motivated and is able to help me through all of my problems. She’s been my rock for the last four years and I don’t know how to handle losing her. 

That’s pretty much it. I’m not sure how to breakup with her since I feel terrible about it, but I know I don’t want to be with her in the future. Have you guys been in a similar situation, and if so, how did you get out of it? Any advice is appreciated!

TL;DR I don’t want to be with my girlfriend in the future and know I need to breakup with her now, but I can’t mentally bring myself to do it. I can’t imagine life without her and the process of “untangling” our lives makes the thought of actually breaking up extremely hard."

2) Must my course be the one of the courses they list? Like for example, CSIT lists electrical engineering and Electronic and computer engineering for NP. But my course is neither of those, it is Engineering science. So can I still apply?

3) Also a bit of an annoying question, but how's my chances if I can apply ? My current CGPA is around 3.86-3.87, I don't have a CCA but I have one Service and Leadership point each, under the schools CCA Pearls system.

This will let you know which companies are still hiring and moving forward with their internship program with the current pandemic.

I know that a remote internship isn't the same as an in-person internship but the coronavirus is a big deal and it is important for people to stay home and stay safe during this time. Besides, a virtual internship is better than no internship at all.

You'd be surprised by how many companies are still hiring remote interns for software/web dev/marketing/design/etc. positions even now. None of these companies hiring for remote positions on Indeed are FAANG or Big N companies, but they are legitimate companies nonetheless. 

I've applied to tons of companies both yesterday and today and already have 5-6 interviews lined up for later this week and next week. 


Don't lose hope. Despite it being so late in the game, there are still companies who want to hire you while ensuring that you - along with other company employees - are staying isolated and being safe.

I have worked at full time positions before, and I have just realized how much stuff communicated in office is through casual conversations and small talk.

I was stressing over applying to colleges wondering if my stats were good enough or if my ECs were good enough and looking over all these threads with you all starting your wildly successful nonprofits/winning academic competitions/taking 10000 APs etc. didn't really make me feel much better. My point is that you'll be okay in the end. Don't let other people's achievements make you feel inadequate but at the same time always strive to be great.  :-)

Take care and enjoy the rest of high school xx"

Will be matriculating into SUSS BSBA full-time this July and after researching online as well as on similar threads in this sub-Reddit, I am still unable to get these answers. Moreover I do not know anyone studying BSBA in SUSS personally. And hence, am wondering if there are any seniors here who able to shed some light on this course?

1. Would like to know what I can do now to prep myself for uni both logistically as well as academically. E.g. type of programming language mostly used in SUSS BSBA and recommended laptops to run said programmes etc.
2. Also, one's typical schooling schedule as well as internship &amp; overseas opportunities for BSBA students. Furthermore, is it true that for some modules, we will be attending classes with students studying part-time? 

Thanks in advance! :)"

g6ju1z,1,2020-04-23,Student Worried About Job Market... Worth Delaying Graduation to do 1 More Internship?,themeaningsoflife,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g6ju1z/student_worried_about_job_market_worth_delaying/,"I'm a junior with a planned graduation of May 2021 from a top-4 CS school. I've done an internship in the past at a startup and will be doing one this summer (that is, if covid doesn't cancel it). However, if I were to receive a return offer there, it isn't a company I would want to return to because of location.

Although the company I'll be at this summer (knock on wood) is well-known, I really doubt that an internship here + internship at a startup would be enough to be considered for full-time interviews at the companies I'd want to work at, with or without referrals. I say this given my lack of success landing interviews in past recruiting season(s). Would it be better for me to:

1. Graduate in May 2021. Go all-in on FTE recruiting this summer/fall/winter as necessary.
2. Graduate in May 2021. Apply to FTE roles and internships only at companies I'd want to work at full-time. Full-time offer &gt; internship offer &amp; stay an extra semester. If I have no offer, then keep applying to internships and delay graduation.
3. Stay an extra semester (graduate: Dec 2021), which gives me enough time to finish a second somewhat-related major for what its worth. Use Summer 2021 as an opportunity to do an internship ideally at a company I'd want to work at full-time. Thus, only applying for internships this summer/fall. I am fortunate enough to be in a position where this decision is financially possible.

Any advice is gladly appreciated."
g6ju8e,1,2020-04-23,I’ve been struggling with anxiety and in general at my new job and am concerned about losing my job. Where do I go from here?,thesemenarenihilists,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g6ju8e/ive_been_struggling_with_anxiety_and_in_general/,"I don’t really wanna doxx myself at all.  

But I graduated more than a decade ago, and worked a legis. internship, and then worked at a coffee shop and restaurants and a few campaigns in increasing roles as intern,  organizer and small time campaign manager, and I’ve been a journalist too.   

Took a new job last year and moved for it and it’s double what I’ve ever made, but still not even 50k.  

But ever since I started, even when I’ve tried to get some, my boss on my very small team has never given me much guidance. Which was fine when he let me do my own thing within reason.   

But now, it feels like they’re pulling me out of everything. I’m no longer apparently running our Fb ads (admittedly I was having trouble getting verified), our email campaigns, and even since when I started I’d email all my work product and other things and not hear back for a week.  

It’s always felt like if I don’t do anything, no one says anything. And if bust ass, no one says anything. But then every so often my assistant manager and one coworker will tell me they love my work and Thanks for working so hard on these projects. Boss said thanks a month and a half ago pre covid and gave me a raise.  

Since then, I’ll admit I’ve been struggling with severe mental health, depression and personal issues especially with social isolation. And the constant job anxiety makes it worse.  

I’ll feel fine one day that my job seems to be going well. But then there will be something that makes me question it.   

I guess what I’m saying is how do I best manage this situation? I continue to work hard, but I can’t seem to get any feedback and I would like to be prepared for any potential negative thing that may happen.  

I have several years of management experience, on top of modest graphic design, and social media management and ad experience. I just want something mainly 9-5 in at least this income bracket and hopefully less stressful (it’s politics, and covid politics especially lately). I like my job but I want to be prepared for the worst case scenario. And this job caused anxiety has been killing me for six months.  

Where do I go from here? just  to be prepared for the worst case scenario?"

Although both the programs seem great, I am having a hard time making a decision.

Here's what I can list about the programs:

**UMN:**

* More RA/TA opportunities
* Cheaper
* Better collection of courses
* US News CS ranking: 29
* Weather sucks (I don't mind that much)

**NWU:**

* Higher overall reputation and ranking
* Quarter system (So, I can graduate earlier as compared to UMN)
* Almost negligible RA/TA opportunities
* Lower faculty to student ratio
* US News CS ranking: 30

Although I seem to like UMN's program more I am wondering if the overall better ranking of NWU will bring up better job opportunities. I am interested in the field of Machine Learning. I have heard good things about UMN when it comes to research in Data Mining and Machine Learning but haven't heard a lot about NWU.

Do you think that NWU's location and overall reputation will trump UMN's somewhat better program when considering job &amp; internship opportunities? I couldn't find a good comparison between their CS programs. In your opinion whose program would you deem better?"

Since September of 2019, I've applied to over 700 jobs and I've only gotten 5 responses (3 of those being post-undergrad internships) from a few small companies.

I desperately need your help, Reddit.

A little about me: I'm a career-switcher based in NYC. I have a ton of professional experience (lightly tech-related). For a variety of reasons, I decided to go back to school in my late 20's because I fell in love with coding and I was stuck in a shitty career/industry. Now I'm only a month away from graduating with zero offers.

I busted my ass these past several years -- 3.85 GPA, while working part-time, grinding leetcode, studying system design, practicing object-oriented design, making side projects, and yet 99% of companies have absolutely zero interest in me. For some time I thought maybe it was my school (meh city school) or major (not CS), but a bunch of my classmates received offers from all kinds of companies including Goldman Sachs, Chase, Lyft, Microsoft, MailChimp, etc. I'm not even aiming for FAANG or well-known companies.

Is it my lack of an internship? Am I on some do-not-ever-hire list that's accessible to most employers? I really don't know what it could be. Even pre-COVID, my ratio of apps-to-responses was abysmal.

Things I've done/do to improve my chances:

* I've made endless versions of my resume with continual input from a couple of job coaches.
* I include a brief cover letter with every job app.
* I reach out directly to recruiters when I'm really interested in a job.
* I've reached out to my classmates and network for referrals that haven't materialized into much.
* Like I mentioned: I've created some pretty decent projects outside of school using modern frameworks and tools.
* I've applied to jobs in every conceivable job market - Madison, Chicago, Connecticut, Philly, Washington-DC/Baltimore, SLC, Denver, NYC, Raleigh, Boston. The last thing I want to do is move away from my family, but if I have to that's what I'll do.

Any advice will be appreciated.

TL;DR: Have sent out 700+ applications with hardly any responses. Good GPA, solid side projects, but companies show little to no interest. What gives?"

I have 2   
 uni options and it's very hard to choose. Let's call them School A and B

So School A has an established Co-op program that I required to Co-op at least 4 times to graduate. I know it's very beneficial for my future after graduation. It has a great engineering program but a bit lower in the ranking. But because I'm an international student so my visa restricted me to Co-op only for 1 year, I have to either go back to my country or to another country to find a co-op experience, which is very complicated in paperwork and in practice, that's why it makes me hesitant. Overall, a good school to attend.

School B also has a great engineering program but no co-op requirement. Still, it encourages students to co-op/intern and will accommodate if students need help. But I can only work full-time in the summer. I also personally like School B more. 

The question is if I choose to attend School B, how possible is it for me to get some internships or co-ops in my 2nd and 3rd-year summer? Is doing research while studying helpful to find jobs? And if you were me, what school would you choose?"

I live with my dad after my mom divorced him my dad got remarried so I live with a stepmom too. The only problem is she is a drunken smoker who shows no respect to me or my dad. And before she moved in with us me and my dad had an extremely healthy relationship it felt like I could talk to him about anything and I wouldn’t be judged heck I even convinced him to watch a few animes with me amoung these would be Bleach,Dragonball Z, and One Piece.  

But ever since my stepmom has moved in I have lost that connection with him much worse is that the stepmom shows me no respect. Like I would answer any questions and she would respond with “you should just know” in the most stuck up tone possible. And then she would blame me for anything that is wrong with the house. Say for example the sink is leaking she would yell at me about it for hours and no matter how much I try to convince her it isn’t my fault she just won’t listen. Also she steals and lies to me about everything. Like she took both the ps1 controller which was gifted to me by a close friend and the laptop I use for my robotics internship. And whenever she gets the chance she tries to punish me for not doing chores. Like last night my internet got blocked because I didn’t do any of my chores which is completely false seeing as I cleaned the entire kitchen numerous times,my room, and upstairs. It honestly feels like she treats children like they are her slaves. And then she spouts some bullshit like my children don’t treat me with the lack of respect you do. Which is just false because your children don’t live with you because of how you act. 


But back to the fight that happened last night. I went down stairs to get some ice cream and she was fucking spouting that shit about I didn’t do any chores. So I just ignored it because it is really annoying to deal with and I was already in trouble for something that had happened 3 days ago so I didn’t want to make it worse.  So I just eat my ice cream and watch a movie on my phone when suddenly my internet gets blocked. Which I felt like it was complete bullshit because I have done nothing wrong asking have done all my chores with no complaining to boot. I ask my dad about it and he just lies to my face 3 times before he says the truth that he blocked it. That was the final straw you can block my internet if you tell me a reason but if you do it just cause you have another thing coming too you. So I just snap and decide  to take my computer back seeing as I am gonna need something for school and because I really want to play video games with my friends during the quarantine. This somehow leads to a brawl with her and my dad. With my dad trying to fucking choke me and I really couldn’t breath. So I push him away to run as my stepmom is hitting me over the top of my head. 
 
Luckily one of her friends steps in and told my stepmom that she is clearly in the wrong here and that you are treating me like total shit. Which my stepmom responds by hitting her on her way to trying to hit me. And God bless her friend because we ended up talking about it and she definitely helped me kinda calm down especially after I was backed into a corner like that. See usually I try and calm down by playing video games but I didn’t have access to them seeing as my stepmom try’s to take anything that I can do to calm down. And it really seems like she is trying to destroy the relationship between me and my dad and that she wants to get rid of me like how she got rid of my brother. 




Anyways what I am asking is there anyway for me to survive this situation seeing as I have one year left till college life?"

* Gigabyte GTX 970 G1 Gaming

* S340 case, fans, and some storage

Question is, is there any point to upgrading any parts in this system? It seems like my stuff is so old that it doesn't make much sense to. 

If I upgrade the GPU, I can only get maybe a 1070 before I get bottlenecks. I can get a 2070 Super for the same price as a 1070. 

If I upgrade the CPU, I need to upgrade the motherboard and ram as well, which could end up being pricey. That might be a good option though, and then I can upgrade the GPU down the road.

I don't really want to spend a thousand dollars on a new PC, I just thought it would be fun to upgrade (I have a software engineering internship this summer that I will be making a fair amount of money from)

I'm leaning towards upgrading the storage (2-3 TB of SSDs) and getting a CPU watercooler (x63 kraken) and just overclocking the shit out of my computer. I already have some good fans and thermal paste on standby. I mean I really don't NEED more PC power, I literally just play rocket league and CSGO. I might play new RPGs like fallout or borderlands but I haven't had problems running those two on medium so far. I have a 144hz monitor so I usually like to get 100+ fps if I can

g6rdqb,1,2020-04-23,Biomechanical engineer looking to change fields,smnmblst,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/g6rdqb/biomechanical_engineer_looking_to_change_fields/,"I have an MS ME with a Biomechanics specialization that I earned in 2012. I've been working in a motion capture/gait lab at a major University since then as a researcher running data collections, post-processing the data with niche 3D modeling biomechanics software no one's ever heard of, and analyzing the data with MATLAB/Excel.

For some quick background, I loved studying MechE during the first few years, but quickly grew to loathe the career options available in my location after a few internships (mainly HVAC/construction and power). I just have no interest in these fields and am much more interested in things like mechatronics/programming. In hindsight I probably should have majored in EE/CS, but at the time, the thought of changing majors was too daunting. I discovered the biomechanics subdiscipline in my senior year of undergrad and got involved in research. I really enjoyed it and decided to continue through to get my MS, thinking it was a way to ""escape"" having to work in the traditional ME field that I had grown to dislike.

It was, but now I'm stuck in an extremely niche position with limited opportunity for career progression without becoming a professor, which I'm not particularly interested in doing, or moving across the country chasing the small handful of positions available in this field. When I started this position, I was very happy with it. The starting pay was (extremely) low since it is an academic position and not technically an engineering job, but I've had some raises over the years. Despite that, I'm still making barely what an entry level engineer would make, and I just simply need to make more money.

I'm also very reluctant to move, which I know is very limiting to my career, but it's something I'm simply not willing to do as my entire family lives where I am, I am about to get engaged, and I'm in a large enough major metro area that jobs should be plentiful enough for me to find work if I just weren't so hyper-specialized. With the added uncertainty of COVID now, I'm also more concerned than ever about not having a wide enough skillset to find employment elsewhere should I ever be laid off.

So all that being said, I am pretty set on making a change. I'm mainly interested in picking a new area of career focus that uses as much of my current experience as possible while also addressing the issues of having more widespread positions available and offering better pay rather than a complete departure into a totally unrelated field. To me, the best choices seem like Data Science or something more along the lines of Robotics/Automation. Data science seems like it would be a good synergy of a lot of my various skillsets - I've already been doing data analysis at a more amateur level for my current position for several years in an academic setting and am pretty proficient with MATLAB, so transitioning to some of the DS software doesn't seem like it would be too hard (I've already been taking some online courses for Python and SQL and am enjoying them). There's also a very large, very well known healthcare IT company in my area that has been posting lots of Data Science positions lately.

On the other hand, something in the realm of Robotics/Automation would still definitely be within the ME realm, which could give me an advantage, since so many people seem interested in DS right now, and I'm sure I'd be at somewhat of a disadvantage to CS majors. There aren't a lot of Robotics/Automation jobs in my area but the field is very interesting to me. I really excelled at dynamics/mechanics and it'd be a shame to give that up entirely if I moved into a pure analytics position. However I don't want to end up in yet another niche field.

All that being said, anyone have any thoughts or advice?"

Like does it really matter which school I get this degree from? I am currently highly considering doing the university of oregon industrial internship program for bioinformatics which combines 9 months of classes with a 9 month internship. It does technically fall under a masters of biology degree though because it focuses a bit on genomics, but from what I’ve read about the program can be catered to be more CS heavy or genomics heavy. Ultimately I do think I am looking to get into a more bioinformatics engineering and algorithm development rather than data analytics because I know it pays a bit better, and frankly I am more interested in the CS side of things than data analysis. Am I hindering my ability to get jobs like this if I get my masters in bioinformatics or should I pursue a masters in pure computer science? The other thing about the UO masters program is that the required internship really lets me put my foot In the door. How difficult is it to work my way up from bioinformatics data analyst to a position like bioinformatics engineer?"

I think every person pass by this point in his life where he wanna know where he wanna work  in his career
It might be early for some but i feel im late because im kinda lost.
Next year i will probably finish my mechanical engineering degree and i wanna continue my masters in the robotics field. Mainly i wanna design the robots but i am curious also about programming,its my hobby to have some fun with electronics and program robots.
Now that i said the scope.
I have no problem working in foreign countries.
As i am from middle east,  big robotics industries arent  many here.
So im looking for universities in europe mainly to study the robotic field, i have looked at many university but i wanna know the experience from people who did a masters in this field and knows where is the best place to go.
Also  im looking for an internship that could help me, there is many in europe and basically  it would be dream job to work later in companies like tesla or BM or any of the companies that will lead the world in the future.
I would like to hear about experiences from you. 
Sorry for english.

I have a so-so history with the language, so I started looking into ways to learn it. I found JetBrains Academy, which is being testrun by Hyperskill (they make a pretty popular IDE).

They offer three tracks: Java, Python, and Kotlin. Each has several hundred topics that walk you through the language and around 20 projects with an autograder. The projects range from basic command line programs to pretty complex applications with GUIs.

I don't usually recommend things this way, but I've made it through around half of the Java projects and am much more confident in my ability to work with the language  [Definitely check it out.](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/)

TL;DR: [Sankey diagram.](https://imgur.com/a/HR908Gd)  

**Background:**   
Location: California (I'm a US Citizen)  
University: Big school in California with a strong CS program (think UCLA, UCSD, USC, Cal Poly)  
Year: Junior  
GPA: 3.3  
Started programming January of 2019, when I switched my major from econ to CS. My previous jobs were random entry level positions (like bagging groceries).  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Internship stats:**  
Leetcode questions completed: 40 (mostly easy/mediums)  
Applications: ~155 (probably closer to 170+ but I didn't include LinkedIn easy apply ones)  
Rejections:  33  
Ghosted: 104  
Screening: 7  
R1 interview: 4  
R2 interview: 2  
Offer: 1  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Recap:**  
Considering I didn't know how to program until last January, I got extremely lucky. I applied to 155+ jobs over the course of four months. I'm already graduating late, but I switched from econ to CS sophomore year, which put me behind in units. Not knowing a thing, I've been taking stacked schedules + summer classes to catch up. I applied to a bunch of CS clubs at my school for 2 semesters, and I've been rejected every single time. My resume was basically education, work experience (random nontechnical jobs I did over the summer), and for personal projects I included 2 school projects and 2 personal projects (full stack websites I made). I've always felt behind the curve - I had to take lower div CS classes, so I was usually one of the older people there while my CS friends were in upper divs. For Leetcode, I did a few problems every week or so, and I made sure I 100% understood every single problem. I sent ~30 applications on AngelList, which proved to be pretty useless: expired/outdated job postings and random flaky unpaid gigs. The rest I applied via LinkedIn/resume drop at career fair.
&amp;nbsp;  
I was surprised during technical interviews - even random startups I applied to ask me LC mediums which weren't a walk in the park. I received a remote offer from a medium sized company after R1, which has filled me with joy.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Lessons learned:**  
-Know your worth. I declined unpaid internships, seemed like a waste. Even though you might be rejected by hundreds of companies, that still doesn't mean you're a bad applicant.  
&amp;nbsp;  
-Don't compare your chapter 1 to somebody else's chapter 20. I did this a lot - some of my CS friends have interned at Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, etc. and it made me feel like shit. Some of my friends would nag me ""it's already January! so were are *you* interning?"" while they had internships lined up. I really wanted to tell them to screw off but I just brushed it off and said I'm still recruiting.  
&amp;nbsp;  
-Don't get too attached. I would get excited when I made it to R1/R2/onsite. I remember thinking I killed it after a R2/onsite, only to get rejected the next day. They might be friendly but it's just business.  
&amp;nbsp;  
-Being rejected from a club doesn't mean you won't make it as a SWE. Maybe I'm just salty, but I'm convinced some of the CS clubs at my school that are pretty competitive are corrupt. I know girls / people that are friends with the eBoard get in with 0 coding experience, meanwhile I know juniors who are rejected. I know tons of CS majors who are some of the smartest people I know/intern at FAANGs and were rejected by these clubs. After I was rejected my first semester, when I applied again my mindset was: It's only a matter of time before I become a SWE. Joining your club may make the process faster, but eventually I WILL make it *with or without* your help.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Hope this helps provide another data point in your internship search."
g6tu8m,196,2020-04-23,[Poly] My O-level to ITE to Poly Journey + Tips,Doinkmeisters,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g6tu8m/poly_my_olevel_to_ite_to_poly_journey_tips/,"Hi everyone! I'm writing this post to share my experience and tips from O-level to ITE to Polytechnic.

Disclaimer: This is MY experience and MY tips that I have found useful throughout MY journey. You may use these as a reference guide but take this with a pinch of salt.

Background: I did not do well for O-levels and I'm talking double-digit points. Honestly, I had a really rough time in secondary school and I couldn't get myself together. So, I ended up in ITE doing Higher Nitec in Accountancy.

**O-Level**

I took E-Maths, Combined POA and Geography, English, Higher Malay, Malay, Pure Physics, and Pure Chemistry. I did not do well for all of it except for maybe English, Maths and Malay where I got C6, B4 and B4 respectively. I barely studied and eventhough I received tuition, I really still couldn't turn my studies around. I even ended up not taking my Physics paper because I just hated it.

During my O-level result collection, I thought I was going to get like a 20+ or something. Lo and behold, my results were truly horrible. While my other classmates were jumping and had multiple lines of JC and Poly courses, I had none and only ITE courses. I was the last one to leave my school hall that day and I stayed there for 4 hours.

**ITE**

So eventually, I had to make a decision and thankfully, I managed to get into Higher Nitec in Accountancy which is only 2 years. Course-wise, it is actually quite tough so you need to be hardworking and persistent. You need to do past papers and practice a lot so that you are able to predict the questions and actually be mentally prepared for it. PLEASE WRITE NOTES!  And for my fellow ITE students who are eyeing for a spot in local poly, YOU HAVE A CHANCE. Don't expect to get into poly when you don't work hard for it because it is competitive but it is achievable. For poly courses, please refer to the catalogue on GPA requirements for ITE students to apply for admission into Poly. For Higher Nitec in Accountancy to Banking and Finance, my requirement was 2.9 which is my first 5 semesters GPA in 2017. Initially, I got rejected despite meeting the requirement and posted to my 2nd choice but I appealed into my 1st choice and got in anyway.

Friends-wise, I met a group of like-minded girls who wanted to go to poly so we all pushed each other and taught each other. Those stories of typical ITE kids? Yeah, they exist too but it is always up to you whether you want to mix with them or not.

Teacher-wise, I met the best teachers in my entire life in ITE. I would do anything to have them again because it was the sweet spot between being coddled like a secondary school kid and allowed to make your own decisions as a young adult. My teachers never gave up on me no matter how stupid and repetitive my questions got and were happy with my successes. They checked up on us always (and also our uniform) and I miss it dearly.

ITE Summary: Be hardworking, choose your friends, your teachers care for you so don't disrespect them it's not cool

**Poly**

As previously mentioned, I got into Banking and Finance. When I tell you that poly is extremely different, please believe me and be mentally prepared. Firstly, I am a 20&gt; pointer for O-level against single-digit pointers. You can only imagine how I felt on the first day of school amongst a sea of smart kids (like literally, I am 2 years older but don't laugh, you will feel the difference).

1. Year 1

I struggled. If I had to describe how I felt in one word, it would be death. I had 12 modules in year 1 such as Accounting, Statistics and Economics. I struggled so much and god, I wished someone had told me how hard the transition was going to be. If you're not good at Math, Statistics will absolutely murder you. In Year 1 Semester 2, my grades had improved and I attribute my improvement to a change in my studying method.

2. Year 2

My Year 2 was equally as hard as Year 1. One thing that I really had to learn was time management because a lot of project timelines can clash. This is made even more difficult when you have to consider when should you start studying for your exams. There were also 12 modules in year 2 so it really was a hectic year for me.

3. Year 3

Sem 1 Internship: I did my internship in a local bank for 6 months and it was a good learning experience for me. I got to attend meetings and contribute to projects. My tips would be to ask questions and take the initiative to ask for more things to do. It will really make your experience more fulfilling. Get a letter of recommendation as well from your supervisor at the end of your internship.

Sem 2: Finally the last lap! My last 6 modules including the legendary FYP. During this semester, I was burnt out. My teammate and I carried our 4-member group for FYP while balancing 5 other modules at the same time. For some reason, the semester felt shorter and more rushed than normal. At this last point of your poly life, just push through and put in your best effort. I lacked sleep, lost weight from irregular meals and my skin was horrible. But I just held on tight and put my best effort until my final paper.

**School Essential Tips**

1. If you have a Macbook with USB C, I highly recommend an adapter especially for presentations because the common pointers use a USB A and you will need to plug in HDMI or VGA cable few times in your poly life. Also, if your presentations have audio, you need a hole for that too.
2. Get a pointer from Shopee or Carousell. I got a knockoff for $11 and it works. If you can't afford it, borrow from another group with prior permission.
3. Bring your laptop charger to school always and mouse (if needed). For phones, I highly recommend you to bring a spare charger and cable than to plug in and out your home-use charger.
4. Find out what reference format your course is using e.g. Harvard, APA etc. In a pinch (but tbh for most of the time for me), I use citethisforme website to mass upload links and it will generate the reference for me
5. If you need icons or graphics for your slides, search for ""icon websites"" that offer FREE PNG files
6. Prepare 1 or 2 sets of formal wear. It really doesn't have to be expensive (carousell, shopee, uniqlo or h&amp;m sales) but it has to be presentable and ironed. This will last you all 3 years even during intern. *Safe outfit 1:* long-sleeve buttoned shirt, formal pants/black skirt, blazer (optional but would definitely recommend for cold classrooms) and black flats.                                *Safe outfit 2:* long-sleeved buttoned shirt, belt, formal pants, blazer (i would say this is compulsory but you can always lend someone else's) and black formal shoes.
7. Find your tried and true stationery and stock up! I highly recommend you to carry around post-its because it's good for pasting on your computer. Although there are post-its apps on your computer, when your computer dies, you can't access it
8. Everyday wear: for the most part, you can dress however you want in poly. But nearing exams, you can expect yourself to be in comfy clothes for long hour days and finals prep e.g. shirt, shorts, the famous pants from Bangkok and slippers/slides
9. For my makeup-wearing friends, you can wear a full-face or even minimal makeup or no makeup at all. Carry some blotting sheets and maybe some lipstick to touch up.
10. Buy concession pass because you can use it unlimited times in a month. Please google for the updated price. Also, your poly ez-link card is sooooo important for student meals, haircuts, movies etc so please carry it everywhere.

**Study/Project Tips**

1. Come to class as much as possible. I know some days it's so hard to wake up or sometimes the day is too long but try to tahan. If you really want to skip, please ensure you are extremely on top of your attendance rate plus the requirement because it isn't nice for your name to be flagged for attendance.
2. Work hard!
3. Find a studying method that works for you and your go-to study spot (i studied in school but wherever you feel like it works for you, stick to it.)
4. WRITE NOTES: I rewrote my notes until they were perfect and it ended up helping me to memorize better.
5. DO YOUR PAST PAPERS AGAIN AND AGAIN (this is super important especially if you are a last-minute chiongster)
6. For practice papers, please time yourself using your clock every single attempt. For me, I aim to finish a 2-hour paper in 1 hour 30/40 mins to allow myself time to check and just relax
7. Ask questions
8. Do your tutorials
9. If you are a slow learner like me, please review your lecture notes and tutorials before your classes start. You might not understand but at least you prep yourself to be tortured.
10. For projects, PLEASE DO NOT BE LAZY. I feel like no one ever mentions this but *your reputation as a teammate actually matters and it goes around.* If you are lazy and don't put in the effort, your reputation will follow and people will be reluctant to have you as a teammate. For certain modules, there are peer evaluations and do not underestimate the power of words because students will not be afraid to express their anger and frustration about lazy group mates. Although peer evaluation makes up 5-10% of your assignment, this can make you go from a B to C+.
11. SAVE YOUR PROJECTS AND REPORTS TO YOUR DESKTOP IF NEEDED. I can't tell you how many times I forgot where I saved my documents so just put it where you can see them
12. Time-management will be something that you need to learn and use because you will be required to complete so many projects on top of preparing for exams
13. For exams, please bring your calculator, stationery, spectacles, and a watch because sometimes, invigilators don't show the time and you're left wondering how much time you have left (this was a hard lesson for me)

**Social/CCA/Life/Other Tips**

1. You don't need a lot of friends. If you do have a clique, great. But if you don't and just end up with a solid 1-2 friends, it is alright too. Throughout my 3 years, I chose to only be close to 2 friends because I did not want drama.
2. You can join CCA/interest groups if you want! It looks good on your portfolio. But remember to manage your time well. I personally did not have any CCA or part-time job so I was able to spend more time studying and resting
3. Do fun things! If you are legal, a night's out with your friends after exams is such a bonding experience. KBBQ, karaoke, day trips to JB or staycations in SG are other fun ways to bond. If you are an introvert, you can just stay home, Netflix and just bond with your loved ones. School will take a lot of your time but remember to set aside time to have some fun and ease your tensions.
4. If you are in need of extra money to supplement you and your family, do check out your school's financial aid. There are bursaries and scholarships available.

Finally, it is possible to pull up your GPA to 3.0 but from my experience and in my opinion, you need to either have a close to 3.0 GPA at the beginning of Year 1 or you need to work your butt to get majority As for the remaining semesters especially 6 and 4 credit modules. I had a 2.75 and managed to get a 3.08 GPA for my final GPA.

PS: you can PM me if you have any other questions like what was my studying method etc. I'm open to all questions! Just here to help out others"

NY,throw22334455__,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/g6txrj/how_to_contact_company_to_confirm_internship_is/,"Hello, I hope this post is within the guidelines for AskHR! I am a STEM Master’s student who is required to participate in a summer internship as a condition of my program. I received a written offer for a summer placement with a large company on March 2. My primary contact has been a specific person in HR at this company, and he indicated that I would be receiving an email to complete a background check within a week but otherwise should plan to start in June. 

I reached out a few weeks ago to follow up because I hadn’t gotten an email with the background check information. He responded saying that, in light of the COVID-19 crisis, their operations were somewhat changing and they were considering changes to the internship format (such as having interns work remotely) and they were still deciding whether the internship would take place at all. He promised to get back to me by the end of the week. 

I didn’t hear from him for a week and a half and sent a quick follow up email to check in. He promised an update by the end of that week, but I didn’t receive an email or call. I sent another email more than a week after that deadline (this Monday) and haven’t gotten a response from him at all. 

I understand that the pandemic is causing issues for everyone and that HR is likely very busy. My issue is that I really need to get an update on whether or not my internship will be taking place at all, so that I can scramble to find another placement if it is indeed cancelled. I am supposed to send my school details about my summer placement next week. 

I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to handle this. I don’t want to come off as rude or impatient but I need some sort of confirmation or cancellation. Should I send another email to this person? 

Thank you in advance."
g6u29a,1,2020-04-23,[IT] Recently laid off from an awesome SaaS company. Don’t want to go back to Help Desk. Feeling down and confused?,VapesfromBible,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/g6u29a/it_recently_laid_off_from_an_awesome_saas_company/,"
Hi everyone — 

Unfortunately I was laid off from my company due to the impact of COVID-19, along with almost 30% of the company. Scary times, but I am motivated to keep pushing forward. 

My company I was working at was a SaaS based company that sold a low-code web development tool and also a live streaming tool. When I was initially hired, my title was “IT Support Specialist” and I did everything from providing internal support to the employees and being the “IT” guy. After about 5 months of learning the IT processes - they approached me and asked if I wanted to be a part of their Customer Software Support team, which would entail helping customers with their questions about the product. Since the IT was sort of slow, I figured I would take the opportunity. 

I had a training period where I learned the ins-and-outs of their SaaS product and master it. Master it enough to answer customer tickets, be on live chat support, hop on phone calls with the sales team. I REALLY enjoyed this. I enjoyed working with customers and representing the brand, helping different companies achieve their goals with their products. I also liked being pulled into calls with the Sales/Customer Success team as a “technical contact” to explain or demo the product. I wrote technical documentation for the software. Maintained relationships with customers on projects. 

I was able to collaborate with Engineering team and Development team when certain bugs came up on the software and pick up some basic HTML and CSS tricks along the way. I learned that the software was hosted on AWS and I really wanted to get AWS certifications to see if I can branch out and maybe help on the backend side.... but this all came to an end when I was laid off. 

My resume is very Desktop Support / IT Support heavy due to all the internships and part time stuff I did while I was in college. Once I got my degree in Computer Information Systems - I started at that SaaS company and began to realize that my love for IT Support wasn’t there anymore. 

I am trying to find a new role and getting contacted by recruiters, but they are for Help Desk positions. I am trying to break away from Help Desk and hopefully stay in the SaaS space. I was thinking about getting the AWS Cloud Practitioner and Azure Cloud Fundamentals certifications (I have a lot of downtime to study for these) to sort of beef up my resume. 

Here is my resume to get an idea of my experience: https://imgur.com/gallery/oDUYFRg

Does anyone have any advice? I can PM you my resume. 

Any help is appreciated... I’m going through a rough time right now."

I called the veterans crisis line. It wasn't really for me. I tried making an appointment with the VA but can't get anything till late June.  I don't plan on hurting myself right now but I know its coming. I figured I'd try this. I don't really expect anyone to read but I wanted to write.

I had a girlfriend; she's was a huge part of my life. We had been together for five years. She's an international student from China. She went back to China briefly for an internship fully intending to return to the United States. Then COVID19 happened. She managed to get into Canada and was waiting for a chance to cross into the United States. While in Canada, I found out she started to cheat on me. One day, she told me she was going back to China out of concern for her family and wouldn't be able to come back because her visa will be expire. She kept in contact with me. I later found out it was a lie from a mutual friend, she never left Canada.

My mind can't stop. What could've I done differently. Who is this other person? What are they doing? Will I ever see her again? I'm constantly in a state of hyper-vigilance. I'm so tired and I cannot sleep, I cannot focus. I feel like the only way out is shooting myself in the head. If only we could've called it off in person; I think I would've managed but now it feels like I have no closure. It's nearly impossible to stop thinking about it with all the COVID shit everywhere.

g6w0xp,2,2020-04-23,Does not having PEY hinder chances of getting a job? (International Student),Azamat2001,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/g6w0xp/does_not_having_pey_hinder_chances_of_getting_a/,"I have posted a similar post before so I’m sorry if you’re seeing it for the second time. The deadline for accepting the offer is approaching so I wanted to ask this subreddit for advice/help. Thank you in advance y’all!!

I was accepted into both UTM and UTSG (for Computer Science) and received a 110k CAD scholarship from UTM, making its total cost of attendance 42k CAD per year compared to UTSG’s 70k CAD per year. 

I know the difference is insane; however, there are some things at UTSG that isn’t available at UTM, the main thing being PEY for international students. If I do end up going to UTM because of 💰, will not having the PEY put me at a huge disadvantage when it comes to finding a job (I plan on starting my career in Canada/US)? 

I thought of making up for not having PEY by doing summer internships, but how easy/difficult are they to land? 

I see both universities as an investment so will the return of going to UTSG be significantly higher (because of its PEY and being in downtown)? Or is 110k CAD to good to pass up on because the degrees are identical? 

And lastly, if it was up to you (taking into account me being intl and also the pros/cons of each campus), which campus would you personally choose? 

I have got less than a week to make a decision so i appreciate any input. 

Have a great day and stay safe y’all!"

It was before the coronavirus outbreak. But from day 1 on the company i have been having trouble with cowokers. Well, they tried everthing to mock me, hid my things, one guy told me he was going to order some hamburguers, didnt order nor did he tell me, there was this intern who told everyone by whatssap that they should mock me (one guy showed me). I didn't complain, but i decided not to talk so much with these people. Anyway, after that, there were some more incidents like that. About the jokes, i didnt really want joke with then because they would loose respect to me if i let then joke with me. But everyone there seems so connected, even the RH started treating me so bad. Like i was talking to a lady and she filling the nail while i was talking to her and she answered in monologues.

Anyways, the coronavirus came, and boom home office. That was great. When i came to work for this company, two girls came with me. One was pretty so she got treated pretty nice and she was more laid back. The other got fired these days, and it wasnt even her fault. It kind was because she wasn't so cooperative when the company asked to cut the salary because of Corona. But no one got treated so bad as nealy as me. After she got fired, she sent a message to the CEO of the company complaning, i thought this was pretty funny. But, anyway, i literally have nothing to do in the company right now, just when the CEO asks some questions on the group i respond. The cowokers are still assholes, when i talk only the ceo talks, when my asshole cowokers talks everyone talks.

g6xim7,1,2020-04-23,I want to be sad.,terroraaa,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/g6xim7/i_want_to_be_sad/,"(Hi, first, english isn’t my usual language so it could get confused sometimes... And I could be rushing some part in my text too.)

I don’t really know where to start, I don’t know what kind of behavior I have but it’s pretty simple now : I want to be sad, to feel bad. 
I don’t know how could I describe it in another way and I know that I could sound like a typical teenager in his weird phase.

To talk about me I’m 20yo, and almost 2 years ago I had a really bad period. Because of love, familial problems, overthinking, poor social capacities and mostly a low self-esteem, a thing that I still have now. This period has continued until last December but my daily life has changed just after christmas. Cause everyone in my school had an internship and so we were not able  to see each other a lot. It lasted 2 months and at it end there was the quarantine that also made me not able to see my friends. So during this new period of 5 months now, my problems and way to think and feel has disappeared. Well there still a little part but I was more kinda « happy ». 
I went to the conclusion that it was my friends that made me pretty sad, and made me overthink. Just the fact to get into the big circle on discord with them make me pretty inconfortable now.
Whatever, during this new period my brain has stopped to think to much, about « sad » things, it’s like when I wanted to think about something bad and find some solution to it my brain just stopped to fonction, I wasn’t able to go further in the reflexion. 

And with this new behavior I’ve started to feel like I was not the real me anymore. I was scared to not be thinking like the way I used before, by thinking too much and be able to have strong emotions. Emotions and especially sad ones are the things that made me feel alive. 
Now I want to get back the « old me », even if I always feel useless and have a low self-esteem. Because I have the impression to be just a machine that live and do the same things as everyone do and then die. I don’t want that, I want my emotions, I want the things that make me, the « real me ». I want to feel alive. 

Maybe I’m not used to those new ways to be and feel, to feel « happy » in part, for the moment. But it’s been months now that I’m scared of me, of the what I’m becoming into. I don’t know, it’s hard to explain how much I want to get my sad feelings and my old way to think. 

And here the stupid part starts too, cause each days where I went to be sad so bad, I’m thinking about taking a bottle of alcohol and scarify myself to let things go in my mind and immerse me in poor condition. 

I know, it’s stupid because maybe I’ve reached to get out off my kind of depression but I want to get back in.
Maybe you’ve felt the same, or maybe we could just talk about it. I don’t really want some help, I want to talk and see your opinion, if I’m not the only one to think like that."

For some insight on my work experience, I finished a REPE internship this past summer and am currently working for a small boutique bank. 

Obviously Haas is known as a better school but the issue causing my dilemma is that Haas requires their kids to finish in two years, not allowing a student to delay graduation at all. As a community college transfer, I know that it will be very hard to land SA 2021 if I go to Haas as recruiting is already wrapping up. With UCLA, I know that it is possible for me to delay my graduation so that I'm technically a sophomore coming into my first year. 

The question that I have would be if you guys would choose to go to a school that is more renowned but poses a larger challenge for recruiting or a school that isn't as prestigious but allows me to roll back a year. 

Thank You!"

g6yvxi,35,2020-04-23,TIFU by humiliating a child at a talent show,Clock-Doc,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/g6yvxi/tifu_by_humiliating_a_child_at_a_talent_show/,"So this actually happened about 5 years ago

When I was in my junior year of college, I worked as an engineering intern at a factory that packaged surgical equipment. Every few months the company liked to host events like talent shows to raise money for the local public schools. So me and the other intern signed up for the upcoming talent show and told our boss we were going to have a rubiks cube battle where we would see who could solve it faster; to make it more interesting, we decided to do best out of three and dress up in ridiculously tight workout attire while doing it (cropped tank top and booty shorts). 

I used to think I was pretty good at solving Rubik's cubes, but my intern friend blew me out of the water. On average, he could solve one in around 30 seconds. I spent the entire week before the talent show practicing and couldn't do better than a minute and a half. Everyone in our department was hyping up our imminent face off on and by this point I was like, ""screw it I'm just going to go up there and have a good time"". 

On the day of the talent show, my intern friend and I are getting ready to go up and we are just stoked to make a fool of ourselves and have fun. Hundreds of people at the factory showed up with their families! We were sitting in the audience waiting for our time to go on and I noticed a kid in front of me was actually solving Rubik's cubes for fun. So me and my friend asked the kid if he'd like to come up with us and show off his skills. He happily agreed. He definitely took longer than us to solve it, but he's like ten years old. So we were impressed and delighted to make him part of the act. 

We decided that after we do our best out of three Rubik's cube duel, we'd call him up on stage and have a three way challenge where we let him win. We didn't tell him we were gonna let him win, we wanted him to feel like he showed us up in front of everybody. The audience would laugh, the kid would feel good about himself, everybody wins. 

Eventually it's our turn to go up and do our act. My friend and I go up and he destroys me in the first round. Then the second. The crowd is applauding and everyone's digging the show we're putting on. So our best out of three duel is over and my friend invites the kid up for the three way challenge. 

By this point I should point out that I was feeling very embarrassed about how badly I lost. I'm very competitive and losing like that really got to me. 

The three of us stood in a straight line, with me in the center, the kid to my left, and my friend on my right, all of us facing the audience. My competitive side started to get the better of me and in my head I'm thinking, ""ok I'm not gonna let him make a fool of me again, I'm gonna win this one"". All considerations beforehand of letting the kid win went completely by the wayside. The announcer shouts ""GO!"" and off I went to reclaim my honor as a Rubik's cube champ. 20 seconds in my friend looks over to me and notices that I'm taking this round seriously and says to me, ""dude what are you doing?"" and in a haze of adrenaline I respond ""I got this!"" I swear to god the only thing in my mind was solving that cube. Then... boom I solved it and out of joy I slammed my cube on the ground and threw my hands up in victory. The crowd went wild and everyone's applauding. I turn to my side to see my friend who is in absolute shock over my actions. The kid was gone by this point. He later pointed out to me that when I threw my hands up and the crowd started cheering, the kid put his hands in his pockets and walked off the stage with his head down. Words cannot express how embarrassed I was at myself and for weeks after. I couldn't believe that I made this kid feel so small in front of so many people all because I was salty over a fucking Rubik's cube contest. 

I still cringe when I tell this story but so many of my friends have laughed at me about this. So I thought I'd share this story with you all. 

tl;dr - I went on stage at a talent show to show off my Rubik's cube skills and asked a kid in the audience to challenge me. I was supposed to let him win, but I didn't."

I'd like to start working in this field and really building my career. But I have no real experience working in business or marketing, outside of hourly retail management positions. I'm in my mid/upper 20s and have never had a job other than that. I've had a short, unpaid ""internship"" in my field with a start-up company, plus plenty of relevant volunteer hours during college, but everything else has been retail and fast food. My problem seems to be breaking into my own field, which I went to school for, when my whole past was defined by college/high school jobs I held in retail and fast food. Now only those places wanna hire me because that's where my experience lies. When it comes to ""adult"" jobs that I actually went to school to be qualified for, no one will take me seriously or seems interested because they look at my previous work history and all they see is ""kid"" jobs.

I recently moved to a new state and quickly applied to some random retail jobs online. Got called, interviewed, and hired as a retail manager just a couple days later and accepted the job because hey it was a job. It barely pays enough for me to pay the bills and definitely not something I wanna do long-term, but it's better pay than minimum wage and better than I would've made anywhere in my previous state. So on the one hand, it's a decent job. It pays respectably for the position, I don't hate my bosses and coworkers, and there is potential for advancement with the company. Part of me says I should stick it out a couple years and see how far I can move up with the company. Or even just six months or a year and see what happens. I could end up being promoted. On the other hand, I know I might never make it that far with the company, and it's not something I'd really wanna do long-term even if given the opportunity. I think my time and effort is better spent just starting to look for another job soon, one that's actually related to my degree. A downside is that I'd also be potentially trading stability, taking a chance by moving to a new job that I have no idea whether or not I'd like or feel comfortable or wanna keep, when I have a job and a steady paycheck now.

Maybe I'll give this job a few months. I don't wanna just up and quit right after being hired. But within the next year, what can I do to start better positioning myself for jobs that are more related to my field, rather than just more jobs related to the one I already have?"

I have a bit of a time constraint as during the summer I'm going to have other commitments like summer school and (hopefully) an internship I got during June-August. So ideally I would want to have a good chunk of time to build everything and just relax and play games until I have to do things (which is not feasible with the shipping times I've seeing). I found a local seller of computer parts through facebook and after talking to him and giving him my budget he gave me a build based on what he has on hand and I just wanted some opinions on whether or not this seems like a good build or it's over priced (knowing that I'm paying a bit for the convenience of getting it right away).

I'm soon going to graduate from McGill university in Canada. I did a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science, and I want to work in finance. Ideally in trading/quantitative trading/asset management.

However, it feels like most the jobs that are open to me right now are more IT/ Middle office roles. And most trading jobs require candidates with more finance experience than I do.

My first idea was to do a masters in finance. But the problem is I don't have a very good GPA (it's even pretty bad). Which mostly came down to :

- Working as CTO of a start-up quantitative hedge fund from mid-third year to mid-fourth year.

-Working part time as a Risk analyst in a big investment bank all throughout my 4th year.

I have good finance internships: Software engineer at S&amp;P, AI innovation at BNP Paribas, 8 months working part time in risk at BNP Paribas and this summer portfolio analysis in a big Canadian pension fund.

However I still find it pretty hard to get into S&amp;T / front office roles without the finance background. So my question is this: How valuable would it be to get a CFA level 1 to get into FO roles? What about other certifications? A master in finance is also an option but I have no idea if they would like my profile, even assuming a 700+ GMAT.



Thank you very much, all help and opinions are appreciated!



TLDR: How valuable is a CFA level 1 to get into FO roles in trading/Asset Management for a BSc. Maths and CS grad?"

I am looking for some suggestions on what college to attend because I am faced with a very hard decision between Brown University and USC (uni of southern cali). I'm interested in one day going into some form of the music/entertainment industry and will probably end up working in LA or NYC. The most important factor in determining my school is whatever will give me better options in my future (more job ops, internships, better degree, more impressive) . I will be paying close to the same price for both schools so that is not a factor, although I am focused on getting the most out of what I am paying for. 

Here are the pros and cons: 

**Brown University -** 

Pros: 

\- great school (ivy league) with incredible education

\- open curriculum where I can take classes in what I like and explore my passions (take business/entrepreneurship/econ classes for my major along with music/media classes)

\- room to explore/grow/decide/figure out my future

\- impressive to future recruiters/employers, could make grad school admissions easier

\- positive environment with intellectual and kind people

\- great activities and groups

\- nice city with fun things to do 

Cons: 

\- cold in winter :(

\- Providence is not an entertainment capital like LA or NYC (although it is close to NYC and Boston) so possibly not as much access to the same types of internships?)

\- does the Brown name carry any weight on the west coast? I am currently from NY but I might want to move/work in LA after college. 

\- not in a specific program for music/entertainment business - will I be as qualified if I definitely decide to go into this field or will I be at a disadvantage from other students?

&amp;#x200B;

**USC -** 

Pros:

\- good education and great program specifically for music industry in the Thornton School of Music 

\- location in LA - I love the warm weather and the city will have many opportunities for not only fun times but also internships and future jobs 

\- social life/fun times in california 

\- many internships and learning industry specific skills rather than a broader ""business/entrepreneurship/organizations"" degree

\- good alumni network specifically for music industry program

Cons: 

\- not ranked as high - is it as respected and will it provide me with the same opportunities that a Brown education will? 

\- educational value is important to me - will a USC degree in a specific music major be as useful as a Brown degree in the more general concentration? 

\- not as much room to change my mind since I am in the music industry major (might want to explore other aspects of the entertainment industry) 

*Thank you so much for reading! I am hoping some of you can provide some insight into what would be a good idea for me. Again, I am trying to make a decision that will provide me with the best opportunities for whatever my future holds. :)*

g73fra,2,2020-04-24,Should I hear out a friend who has been arrested?,Nicoleaf,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g73fra/should_i_hear_out_a_friend_who_has_been_arrested/,"I (19F), could seriously use some advice about a friend of mine.

At the beginning of April, my state held a presidential primary. My dad volunteered to work at the polling station behind my house since most volunteers had understandably dropped out. Around dinner time, I went over to vote and deliver my dad some pizza for dinner. While there, I ran into a friend (18M) of mine that I'll call Dave, whom I hadn't talked to in a while. He and I started talking, which was great as I hadn't seen him since Thanksgiving. Suddenly, he got really serious and asked me to walk outside with him, I did, and once we got outside he told me that the reason I hadn't heard from him in a while was because his phone had been taken away. I asked him why he didn't have his phone and he revealed that he had been arrested and lost his job. Knowing my friend, I figured that he had been arrested for Weed or something like that and his parents, who are very strict, had taken the phone as punishment.

Dave told me that when one of our friends, Luke, came back in May, we could all meet up and Dave would tell the two of us what happened and why he got arrested. I said okay, and gave him a hug and told him everything would be ok. I went back home fully assuming that he had been arrested for weed. You know what they say about assuming.

After a little while, I still couldn't' get the conversation with Dave out of my mind. Something wasn't sitting right with me. I started thinking and realized that Luke probably wasn't coming back in May, he's camping out at a friend's house close to his college because he couldn't afford to return to our town on such short notice. Luke was also planning on not living at home this summer because he had an internship lined up. Realizing this, and realizing that I wouldn't be able to wait that long to know what happened, I did something REALLY REALLY REALLY stupid. I looked Dave up on our State's record system. I KNOW I shouldn't have done this, and that it was a dick move, but something felt genuinely off and I couldn't stop myself.

What I found is bad. Literally the last thing I would expect from Dave. He's being charged with 9 counts of child pornography. I broke down crying, and eventually told my parents what I had seen. My dad is a lawyer, and he looked at the available records and what exactly Dave is being charged with. If Dave is found guilty, he's facing up to twenty years in jail.  My dad says that based on both the number of felonies and the severity of the felonies, Dave will likely get the full twenty. 

I'm freaking the hell out. I desperately want to believe that there must be some sort of misunderstanding, or that Dave had some underage girlfriend he didn't tell our friends about, but all the evidence is pointing towards it not being a secret underage girlfriend. I feel sick to my stomach and just want to cry. All of this makes sense with why he couldn't have his phone, in my state, if you've been arrested for anything like this, you are not allowed on social media of any kind or to be in contact with any minor until you've either been found innocent or served your time + some. 

A few days ago, his mom reached out to me on Facebook. She's always liked me and encouraged Dave to hang out with me more. She wants me to come over to their house, or have Dave come over to mine so we can talk about Dave's new ""situation"". I told her that I was incredibly busy due to online college (true), but she wants Dave and I to meet up ASAP. Part of me wants to meet up with Dave so that he can tell me that he didn't do these awful things and that its all a big misunderstanding, but I also know that there's a very real possibility that he's going to tell me that yes, he likes looking at little kids and that he is being arrested because of that. I don't know what to do. My dad says I have to know exactly what I want out of my relationship with Dave, and if I'm willing to remain friends with him if he is in fact, a pedophile. I wouldn't call Dave my best friend, but we are close. I've known him since we were in diapers and we were friends on and off through the years before the above-mentioned friend, Luke, reconnected us. We have yearly new year's eve parties at his house (save for this year, I was abroad) and hang out whenever I'm home. He was one of the first people I came out too. I hate the thought of losing him, but I also hate the thought of being friends with a pedophile. I feel like I would somehow be condoning his actions if I stayed his friend. I don't know what to do. I don't want to abandon him, but I don't know how I can do so without seeming like I'm condoning his actions, assuming that the charges are true.

Should I go meet up with him (somewhere we can social distance), or should I just leave it for after his court date or whenever Luke gets back into town? 

Another question, should I tell Luke what's happening? My parents are split on whether or not I should tell Luke, as on one hand, I should probably let him know that our friend has been arrested for child pornography, but on the other hand, if Dave isn't guilty, and there's something else going on, it's probably best for Dave to tell Luke himself. 

I'm in serious need of some advice, please let me know what I should do."

I've recently received admission letters from both schools for concentration on computer engineering of the ECE program and had a hard time deciding on which to attend. Frankly, I'm more apt to UCSB personally, but there are some factors in reality that I can not completely neglect. Therefore I'm hoping to seek advice from a much more ""local"" perspective. Suggestions from current ECE students are even more welcome!

Here are a few pros &amp; cons of what I think:

* UC Davis
   * Pros:
      * Lower living expenses
      * Accessibility (20min from Sacramento, 1hr from SF)
      * Portability: I've heard that Davis is a bike town so cars aren't really necessary to get around
      * Internship opportunities:  I've been hoping to have the chance to work in the States during/after my graduate studies. I know there are a few tech companies such as Intel, located in Sacramento. Plus, UCD is much more closer to the SV, indicating more job/intern opportunities. But I'm curious about how UCD students are favored among the employers?
   * Cons:
      * UCD is known for agricultural and environmental studies more in comparison w/ engineering
      * Countryside scenery: don't get me wrong I love the countryside as well (been to Napa a few times during the previous summer vacays), but the seaside view of UCSB seems much more fascinating
      * Slightly lower overall ranking
* UCSB
   * Pros:
      * Higher academic reputation in the fields of engineering
      * Better ranking overall
      * Better living conditions and campus environment (what beats having a beach right by the campus?)
      * I have never been to SoCal, plus I have a few friends studying in LA already
   * Cons:
      * Higher living expenses (housing prices in IV are surprisingly unfriendly)
      * Accessibility (2hr ride from LAX)
      * Internship opportunities: Since UCSB is located in a comparatively suburban area, Idk what the chances are getting internships opportunities from tech companies nearby despite that I'm not a green card holder.
      * Party school: not a party guy lol

Any sort of help or suggestion is greatly appreciated! Thx"

Trying to avoid getting back into Help Desk and don’t know where my career is going...,Calculation,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g78cjf/recently_laid_off_from_a_saas_support_job_trying/,"Laid off from a SaaS Support job. Feeling down and don’t know where my career is going to go from here...

Hi everyone — 

Unfortunately I was laid off from my company due to the impact of COVID-19, along with almost 30% of the company. Scary times, but I am motivated to keep pushing forward. 

My company I was working at was a SaaS based company that sold a low-code web development tool and also a live streaming tool. When I was initially hired, my title was “IT Support Specialist” and I did everything from providing internal support to the employees and being the “IT” guy. After about 5 months of learning the IT processes - they approached me and asked if I wanted to be a part of their Customer Software Support team, which would entail helping customers with their questions about the product. Since the IT was sort of slow, I figured I would take the opportunity. 

I had a training period where I learned the ins-and-outs of their SaaS product and master it. Master it enough to answer customer tickets, be on live chat support, hop on phone calls with the sales team. I REALLY enjoyed this. I enjoyed working with customers and representing the brand, helping different companies achieve their goals with their products. I also liked being pulled into calls with the Sales/Customer Success team as a “technical contact” to explain or demo the product. I wrote technical documentation for the software. Maintained relationships with customers on projects. 

I was able to collaborate with Engineering team and Development team when certain bugs came up on the software and pick up some basic HTML and CSS tricks along the way. I learned that the software was hosted on AWS and I really wanted to get AWS certifications to see if I can branch out and maybe help on the backend side.... but this all came to an end when I was laid off. 

My resume is very Desktop Support / IT Support heavy due to all the internships and part time stuff I did while I was in college. Once I got my degree in Computer Information Systems - I started at that SaaS company and began to realize that my love for IT Support wasn’t there anymore. 

I am trying to find a new role and getting contacted by recruiters, but they are for Help Desk positions. I am trying to break away from Help Desk and hopefully stay in the SaaS space. I was thinking about getting the AWS Cloud Practitioner and Azure Cloud Fundamentals certifications (I have a lot of downtime to study for these) to sort of beef up my resume. 

Here is a mock resume to get an idea of my experience: https://imgur.com/gallery/oDUYFRg

Does anyone have any advice? I can PM you my LinkedIn. 

Any help is appreciated... I’m going through a rough time right now."

Really fortunate to receive admits from both Tepper and McCombs. I'm having trouble picking between the two and curious to hear what this sub thinks. 

I'm from the Bay Area and my goal is to go into Tech, perhaps in a PM or Ops role. However, I'm not 100% set on any one goal and I'm keeping an open mind as well.  I'm in the Bay Area and I have experience working in the environmental industry (public utilities and environmental consulting). Post-MBA goal is to return to the Bay or work in a city like NY, Chicago, Seattle - basically wherever the job takes me. Both schools are awesome, but I've never been to Pittsburgh or visited Tepper (skyped in for interview). I've been to McCombs and Austin and loved it. 

**Career**

Both schools are strong in tech, though Tepper is definitely the more analytical school. I'm drawn to the analytics and leadership development focus - two weaknesses (or undeveloped strengths) of mine and a big reason why I'm pursuing an MBA.

McCombs provides the MBA+ projects and that allows students to gain work experience early in Y1 and leverage for internship recruiting. This is attractive because I don't have a tech BG (though idk if MBA+ projects will happen that early if we start Fall online). Austin is also a tech hub and I could leverage that as a student.

**Culture**

Can anyone here speak to Tepper's student culture? I skyped in for my interview and unfortunately have never been to Pittsburgh either. It'd been tough trying to get a feel from Slack channels lol. For some reason, it's hard for me to combine ""Tepper"" with ""awesome culture"". I don't know why...

I interviewed on campus for McCombs and everyone I met seems super down to earth and helpful! Really dig the culture, both for MBA and broader UT (like sports). I think the active city leads to a more active class.

**Brand**

I come from the Bay so CMU's brand is definitely strong and I get the feeling that Tepper is stronger throughout the US, whereas McCombs' brand is strongest in Texas. I know McCombs is starting to send more alumni to the Bay/PNW, but a majority still stays in the Southwest. Also, I went to large public ivy for UG and I'm curious to experience a private school education. 

Both schools are ranked side-by-side and both have brand new buildings.

**Cost**

Both schools offered me scholarship of about 20% of overall cost. McCombs offered me less $, but their overall tuition is cheaper to begin with. Since the difference in cost isn't substantial, this isn't a huge thing I'm considering, but still worth noting. Tepper is $110K total and McCombs is $94K total.

Pittsburgh is a cheaper city than Austin, so the scales balance a bit more when considering Tepper's higher tuition, but cheaper rent.

**Caveat**

I'm still waitlisted at Fuqua and Johnson, but I need to make a decision with the offers I have by the end of the month. It'll be a whole new conversation if I get off the WL, but until then...

Let me know what you guys think! Thanks!

I am still waiting for an admissions decision from Carnegie Mellon (CMU) (tuition/yr: \~$58,000).

I was only offered aid to attend UNM, and have to pay full price for all the other schools. If money were not a factor, my top choices would be UMD or UIUC (or CMU if I am admitted). Though I find it hard to justify paying full price for these schools, I feel as though the quality of the education, the research experiences, student clubs, and alumni network will pay massive dividends. Another thing to consider is that I may qualify for in-state tuition during my second year (UMD tuition/yr: \~$11,000, UIUC tuition/yr: \~$21,000) which potentially makes UMD a cheaper option.

My goal is to do undergraduate research, complete a summer 2021 internship, work for a few years after graduating, then attend graduate school for robotics. Do you have any thoughts with regards to which college I should select, or maybe just key factors that I should consider? I am currently weighing strength of curriculum, quality of professors, research opportunities, student clubs, and alumni network, but am not sure if there are other things worth considering.

It is very hard to justify spending \~$100,000 on a degree as I will need to take private loans to afford tuition and living expenses. That being said, I am also finding it hard to turn down a top 10 (UIUC) and top 20 (UMD) school to attend one of the others.

Thanks in advance."

&amp;#x200B;

Hello  everyone, I guess the first  thing I should do is begin with my name; I  mean, that's how these  things usually start out, right? My name is  Adelia, and up until a  couple weeks ago, my life has been pretty normal.

I'm a college girl,  going to school for graphic design and looking to  graduate with at  least a Bachelor's before I start looking for work. I'm  a bit of a  loner, not exactly a social butterfly. To me, a good Friday  night is  staying in and logging a few hours into Doom and other FPS  games after  I've done all my homework.

Don't   get me wrong, I've got a decent sized inner-circle of friends, but we   usually do meet-ups a couple of times a month and communicate more   frequently online. If you see me outside of college I'm more inclined to   talk to someone over the phone, rather than face-to-face; social   awkwardness and anxiety can be a bitch, as they say.

This   one particular evening took place on a Saturday, and I was in one of   those rare moods to leave my dorm and do something...adventurous. You   know, I'm not even really sure you can call what I did   adventurous...maybe more like...risky and stupid?

You see, my college is   located not far from a nearby coast; this is definitely not the kind  of  sandy beach coastline you are thinking of though. Oh sure, there is a   fair amount of sand, but there are also lots of pebbles and sharp  rocks  mixed in, along with an entire forest surrounding the shoreline.  Pretty  weird, huh?

So basically,  due to  how the coast was formed, the entire area looks like a giant U  when  viewed from the air, and it is about a mile across, which gives  tourists  plenty of room to frolic and do other obnoxious things. There  are  usually several police officers patrolling the area during the busy   season, but during certain periods of the year, it is deserted. Guess   which time I chose to go on my little evening excursion?

Now,   I'm not entirely stupid, I did pack for the occasion and prepare.   Sometimes you'll hear stories of a body being found on the shore, or   someone disappearing, but it never seems to deter people from flocking   to the beautiful location, in fact, the air of mystique about the place   only seems to fuel the desire for others to travel there. I wasn't  going  to end up on a missing-persons report, so I took a small knife  that my  brother gave me last year for my birthday.

Yes,   he gave me a knife for my birthday, and yes, that is a pretty strange   gift. My brother is in the Marines and recently got redeployed, but  when  he comes back home he always tries to spend as much time with me  as  possible; I'm always so fascinated and horrified by the things he  tells  me about, his little “war-time stories” as he calls them.

He gave  me  this knife because he said, and I quote, “There are things in this  world  more terrible than man, keep yourself safe.” Pretty intense,  right? He  would recount some of the strangest things he had seen and  encountered,  but I still felt like he was withholding far more. Lights  in the sky,  giant bats, enormous sea serpents, humanoid figures hiding  in the  shadows, just all kinds of bizarre shit.

I   didn't tell anyone about the knife, especially my dorm-mate; she   happens to be friends with the Dean's son and the last thing I needed was to get expelled for having a weapon. I stuck the knife in my   backpack, a black sheathe covering the blade to prevent any accidental slicing. I gathered a few more items, such as bottles of water and a few cans of soup.

Yes, I eat soup cold sometimes, I'm a weird bitch; I  also  grabbed a towel, in case I got wet, a few books to read, if I  lounged  on the beach, and a big flashlight, so that I wouldn't bump  into shit in  the dark. I didn't plan on being out there longer than a  few hours,  just enough time to unwind and prepare myself for the week  of upcoming  project work I'd have to immerse myself in. This was going  to be my  night to relax.

&amp;#x200B;

I  left at about 7 pm, there was  still a fair amount of light left in the  sky, which painted the clouds  in gorgeous hues of orange and purple. I  snapped a few pics with my  phone and gawked at the sky for a few more  minutes before snapping out  of it and heading to my car. On my way  there, I ran into a couple of my  friends in the parking lot, including  the Campus Security Intern,  Marty, who I also counted as a good friend.  The three of them were just  leaning against vehicles and drinking beer,  talking about sports,  news, video games, etc. You see, Marty and I go  way back, meaning we  dated for a little bit in high-school, about two  years in fact.

Long  story short, things didn't work out and we agreed to  stay close  friends; we ended up in the same college together, which  worked out  great because we learned to lean on each other during  difficult times.  I'm still single to this day, I suppose I just haven't  found the right  person, while Marty got engaged to a girl named Fia,  whom he met in one  of his classes. I'm glad he moved on, and I'm glad we  stayed friends,  because I might not be here today if that wasn't the  case.

The  group greeted me like  usual, with Kaitlyn awkwardly high-fiving me,  Josh tilting his head up  wordlessly, and with Marty stepping in to give  me a big hug. I tried to  side-step him, but he got to me too quickly.  He knew I hated big hugs,  and I knew he hated being called Martinez.

“Easy,   Martinez.” I teased, feeling just how much his grip had improved with   the new workout routine he'd been using. He rolled his eyes and just   hugged me harder, making me feel like I was gonna pop; he let go soon   after though, and his eyes immediately locked onto the backpack I was   carrying. Uh oh.

“Adel...what is that for?” he asked, as I kept trying to make it disappear behind me.

“Uhhh...research?” My answer made him grin and shake his head.

“I've seen too many comment sections to know that that answer never means anything aside from mischief and/or fapping.”

“Yes, it's for fapping.” That answer didn't faze him, but it did make my friends giggle and shy away a little bit.

“Oh, finally hit puberty, eh?”

“Fuck you, I'm a kid forever.”

“Adelia...”   His voice was more serious now, and I knew continued playful banter   would not satisfy his curiosity. I decided to come clean right then and   there.

“Alright, I'm heading for   Horseshoe Beach, I just wanna spend a couple hours there.” I should  have  just lied. (Just a note, it's not actually called Horseshoe  Beach.)

His expression went completely neutral, and I knew what was coming next.

“No, you aren't.”

“Marty, I'm going.”

“You're   staying right here, Adelia.” Ugh...I hated when he did this! When  Marty  meant business, he had the most amazing poker-face and completely   unwavering tone; he was even starting to convince me to cancel all my   plans, I had to explain quickly.

“Look, I know that place has a reputation, especially at night...”

“Yet   you want to go there right now...at night.” He said, staring at me  with  those blue eyes that seemed so fiery right now; this was the  second  scariest thing to happen to me that night.

Marty   and I had a little back-and-forth for the next ten minutes...maybe   fifteen. Our friends kinda just stood on the sidelines and listened in,   too eager to see who would come out on top of our verbal sparring  match.

Naturally,  I managed to  convince Marty to let me go, but I had to compromise with  him. He said I  would have to check in with him at 45 minute intervals,  and that he  would drive up there and haul me back to my dorm if he  didn't hear from  me in a timely fashion. This compromise sucked, because  I'd have to  break up my fun just to let him know I hadn't dropped dead  yet. At  least he'd let me go without too much of a fuss, little blessing  I  suppose.

Naturally, my friends   asked if they could tag along, but I wasn't one for company that night,   which actually ended up keeping them safe, all things told. If they had   come along...

Mmm...getting a   little bit ahead of myself here, let's stay on track. Anyways, I   declined their request and assured Marty that I was gonna be fine, and   that I knew what I was doing, and that he was acting like my dad. I hate   it when he talks to me like my father, talking down to me is a  surefire  way to get me to ignore everything coming out of your mouth.

He   switched gears pretty quickly after I told him that, becoming more   sympathetic. He's a good-natured guy, and it's honestly really hard to   stay upset or mad at him in any respect; he just has a way of winning   you over, “sexy charisma” as I call it.

After   a couple more minutes of chatter and one turned down offer for Marty  to  drive me there, I finally sat down in my car and turned the key,   revving the engine to life. Soon, the parking lot was just a distant   reflection, but the image of Marty standing there with his arms crossed   stayed with me. I simply smiled and put on some music, a little bit of   Asking Alexandria and Breathe Carolina to get me into that adventurous   mood.

&amp;#x200B;

About  30 minutes had passed before I  pulled into another parking lot, this  one completely empty and just  barely lit. Some of the street lamps were  in bad condition, and so they  either didn't work or flickered  erratically, which gave this lot a  particularly sinister and spooky  appearance at night. A chill ran down  my spine as I realized I'd be  completely alone if anything bad happened  out here.

If I ran into bad   people, I'd be fucked. If I got swept out to sea by a freak wave surge,   I'd be rightly fucked. There wasn't much a little college girl like   myself could do, or so I thought.

Trust   me, it took a few minutes before I could work up the courage to even   open the car door and step out, but when I did, it was all worth it. A   cool wind blew across my face, carrying with it the scent of the sea,   which somehow always seemed to energize me. I took in a deep breath,   enjoying the way my hair swayed as the wind flowed through it, felt damn   good.

Sometimes all it takes is  one moment of positivity to help you  move forward, as I grabbed my  backpack and began trekking towards the  beach without much thought.

Luckily   for me, there is a pathway to the shore, built with wooden planks and   lined with lights to help guide people back to the lot. Even though  half  the wood is now rotten, I'm glad to see the lights are at least   well-maintained; walking from the lot to the shore took about 15   minutes, some of which involved me clearing a bunch of tree branches out   of my way. You see, the path down to the beach cuts into the middle of  a  forested area, so all around are nothing but trees, and with how  much  rain and storms we get here, there is usually a stupid amount of  broken  branches just lying around.

I   didn't bring any gloves, so I came away with a few scratches on my   hands, nothing too bad though. Problem was, all that lifting and kicking   made me a little exhausted, despite the amount of caffeine I ingested   before this little trip. I'm in pretty good shape, but I'm also not  used  to moving huge slabs of wood around on a daily basis, so I ended  up  gasping for breath after a few minutes. I took a short break and  then  cleared away what else I could manage before just kinda saying  “Fuck  it!” and going on my way.

When  I  walked through the clearing and set my foot upon soft sand, I knew I  had  made the right choice that evening. There is just something so  relaxing  about strolling or sitting on beach sand, it's just so soft  and comfy!

I  can't even imagine  what kind of stupid grin was plastered on my face as  I ran to the  shore, gazing out onto the moonlit ocean surface. There is  something  almost mystical about how moonlight bounces and reflects off  the  surface of water, it's almost entrancing! I kinda just sat down and   folded my legs for a bit, just taking a few minutes to take everything   in.

The sound of water lapping  upon the shore was like the sweetest  music, causing me to close my eyes  and imagine what it would be like to  explore the unknown depths of  that near infinite blue.

After  a  few minutes of doing absolutely nothing, I started to unpack my text   books and study a bit, using my little survival flashlight to read each   page; the beam on this thing is insanely bright, so I didn't have any   trouble, and the calming white noise in the background helped get me   into that studying mood. It must have been nearly an hour before I   realized that I needed to call Marty and let him know I was fine. I   really, really hoped he wasn't already on his way to come get me.

&amp;#x200B;

So  thankfully, Marty waited a little  bit longer to hear from me, and told  me next time he wouldn't be so  lenient. At the time I just rolled my  eyes and thought 'Don't tell me  what to do!', but I definitely don't  hold that same opinion now...more  on that when the time comes.

I   let out a gentle yawn and looked back towards the sea, squinting my   eyes as I made something out along the waves in the distance. I remember   audibly saying “Oh shit.” when I realized it was a low-lying fog   creeping towards the shore. I knew I didn't have anything to fear, but   the fog around here was like that shit from the movie The Mist,   low-visibility and enveloping everything. I had a choice to either go   back to the car and wait till it passed, or to stay and take my chances.   Which option do you think I picked?

I   left my pack sitting next to a tree, memorizing exactly where I put it   but also realizing that wouldn't make a damn bit of difference if the   fog decided to hang around. I just shrugged and started walking along   the shore, wanting to see how long it would take me to reach the   right-most side of the giant U which made up the shape of the shoreline.

This  was an exercise in colossal stupidity on my part, just because you   don't want to be weighed down on a lengthy walk doesn't mean you should   put your supplies down and walk away without them. I'd even forgotten   to take my knife out!

Crabs and   other odd things scuttled along the beach, going about their business   and keeping clear of me as I tread on the soft sand. Lights dotted the   top of the cliff that rose up at the very end of the shoreline, another   pathway leading to a small-ish shack where an older man was said to   live. Other than that little shack, there likely wasn't a soul around   for miles. It was both unnerving and pretty cool to think I was alone   out here, left to my thoughts and away from the stress of college. I'm a   pretty introverted girl, so I tend to just keep to my inner group of   friends and loved ones, so I have no issues with being alone.

I   heard a few splashing sounds near me, and I turned my head to look out   at the sea without stopping. If there is something close to the  surface  at night, you won't see the damn thing clearly at all; water  looks  pretty black at night, and the glimmer of moonlight only makes  stuff  glisten if it's coated in water. All I could see were ripples in  the  water, though they seemed pretty wide. Maybe a shark or school of  fish? I  could briefly see something smooth breach the surface, only to  slide  back under a moment later.

That's  something that has always freaked me  out about the ocean, you could  have a damn leviathan right under you and  all you'd see is maybe the  tip of a fin.

I  picked up the  pace, getting an uneasy feeling as the sounds drew closer  to the shore;  maybe it was just a late-night scuba diver?

&amp;#x200B;

It  took me about 20 minutes to reach  the base of the cliff, and I sat down  in the sand to rest for a few  seconds. My jaw dropped as I noticed how  close the fog was to the shore  now, and a feeling of great unease came  over me. If this stuff  swallowed the entire beach, I could get lost  trying to find my way  back. Marty had told me what to do in case of  something like this, and  it was all pretty much just common sense: Try  to walk in a straight  line, don't panic, go slow, and turn back if you  feel water, because  you are walking into the ocean.

I mean, staying calm is way easier just telling someone to do, because   your heart has a way of overreacting to this kind of shit; any kind of   unusual or even vaguely threatening situation gets it pounding, and that   rush of adrenaline tends to impact your critical thinking skills. You   get stuck in that fight-or-flight mindset, and your brain just kinda   goes on auto-pilot as you scramble for the quickest way out.

I figured it would be only a couple minutes till it blanketed the shore,   and I knew I wouldn't make it back in time. The choice was clear: I'd   just lay back for a bit and hope it cleared out, after checking in with   Marty, of course. I told him I was fine, conveniently leaving out the   fact that a thick fog was about to consume the entire beach, because he   would rush down here without a second thought if I let that detail  slip  out. He sounded a bit busy on the other end, so he didn't inquire  too  much about my situation, he simply told me to keep being careful  and we  said bye.

I just shrugged  and laid  my head back, looking straight up to the stars and watching  them  twinkle; I was thinking about how relaxing this all was, the mist  even  added a sense of mystique to the whole thing. I just kept on  smiling,  even when all I could see was a wispy cloud overtaking my  vision. I  closed my eyes, making the mistake of telling myself it would  only be  for a moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I  think I dozed off for about an  hour and a half, and I remember a loud  sound waking me up. Honestly, I  thought the sound was just in my head,  because it sounded like a weird  shriek. I shook my head several times  and gazed at my phone, jumping up  in a panic when I noticed a bunch of  text messages and missing call  icons on the lock screen.

I fucked  up;  Marty would be coming to drag my ass back to campus, and there was  no  way I could talk him into letting me stay if he had driven all the  way  over here. Not that I really wanted to be out here any longer; it  was  already slightly past 10 p.m. and that damn fog hadn't dissipated  one  bit.

I looked at my messages,  and  sure enough I was right on the money. The last text he sent was a  rather  dramatic, “ON MY WAY!!!” Oooh boy, I just knew he was gonna be  fuming  when he got here, if he could even find me. I was starting to  doubt I'd  even be able to find the parking lot, I wouldn't be able to  see the  light from the street lamps until I was practically under them.

Shit,   things had really gotten out of hand, if only I hadn't done something   stupid like fall asleep in the middle of a deserted beach! Well, it was   more like on the very edge of a beach, but you get my point!

I   had to find my stuff before I went back to the campus, so I found the   edge of the shore, right where the sand was moist from where it met the   tide, and just began walking back. I took it nice and slow, using my   flashlight to chart my way along the path, making sure I didn't   accidentally end up walking off into the water; it was getting pretty   cold out, the last thing I needed was to take a dunk and wind up   freezing my ass off.

I kept   checking my phone every few minutes, expecting to see an angry message   from Marty, but nothing popped up. I did contemplate calling him, but he   never picked up while driving, he was such a stickler for regulations   sometimes.

Still, I loved the guy and I really hoped he wouldn't be too   upset with me for making him come out here for nothing. I shot him a   text saying that I was heading back to the parking lot, keeping the   explanation nice and simple.

As   soon as I sent the message, a shrill screech pierced the peaceful quiet   around me, causing me to freeze in place and stare forward. My heart   went from a dull thud to absolutely hammering in my chest, a lump caught   in my throat as it suddenly went dry.

For about a minute I stood  there,  listening for anything else that might scare the shit out of me,   expecting something horrible to come charging at me from the mist.

Thankfully,   nothing approached me, but my fight-or-flight instincts were kicking  in  like a boot to the face. It took all my self-control to not dart off  in  any direction, doing so would be extremely stupid and might put me  in  even greater danger.

I started  moving forward again, stumbling about as I  tripped over a couple logs  that had floated ashore, I had to get out of  that fog. I was just  barely holding back my panic, sweeping my light  from left to right as I  tried desperately to scan my surroundings and  avoid injury. The sound  of a loud, rumbling growl stopped me dead in my  tracks.

I am still waiting for an admissions decision from Carnegie Mellon (CMU) (tuition/yr: \~$58,000).

I was only offered aid to attend UNM, and have to pay full price for all the other schools. If money were not a factor, my top choices would be UMD or UIUC (or CMU if I am admitted). Though I find it hard to justify paying full price for these schools, I feel as though the quality of the education, the research experiences, student clubs, and alumni network will pay massive dividends. Another thing to consider is that I may qualify for in-state tuition during my second year (UMD tuition/yr: \~$11,000, UIUC tuition/yr: \~$21,000) which potentially makes UMD a cheaper option.

My goal is to do undergraduate research, complete a summer 2021 internship, work for a few years after graduating, then attend graduate school for robotics. Do you have any thoughts with regards to which college I should select, or maybe just key factors that I should consider? I am currently weighing strength of curriculum, quality of professors, research opportunities, student clubs, and alumni network, but am not sure if there are other things worth considering.

It is very hard to justify spending \~$100,000 on a degree as I will need to take private loans to afford tuition and living expenses. That being said, I am also finding it hard to turn down a top 10 (UIUC) and top 20 (UMD) school to attend one of the others.

g7d2xj,90,2020-04-24,"26 years old, jobless, living at home",the_beezhive,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/g7d2xj/26_years_old_jobless_living_at_home/,"So here's my story..

In a third world country with some of the highest unemployment rates in the world), I went to college and obtained a degree in film and television a few years ago. After that, I did some gigs which never paid or led to anything. As time went on, it got more difficult to do free gigs, cause I needed money for gas.

I later started working as a delivery driver(paying next to peanuts and using my own car), and then I went own to work as a cashier for a short time before doing an internship which I actually had to pay for....yes that's right, ""paid someone to be an intern"", I literally could not find or land any other internship or job related to what I studied, so I applied for this excuse of an internship which lead to nothing...well the only good thing that came out of it, is that I shot a documentary that actually made it onto tv, that's it.

I started falling into depression and felt hopeless, but continued to apply for jobs all day every day.

Knowing of the poor economy I'm living in, and the circumstances I'm currently living in, I eventually realized that this was perhaps one big poor decision I made in my life...studying for something that is not exactly in high demand here. Creative fields are not something that really brings value to people.

So I decided to get my head out of my ass...I admitted to myself that 'I am not special', all the things people tell you while you young, was BS, I had to face reality, not anyone can be anything...And no one, not even my parents can save me from the hopeless reality I have been living in.

I started researching high in-demand jobs, in the world and in my country. I researched what requirements were needed for many of these jobs, how long it would take to get a position, and most importantly how much time and money would it cost me to finally land one of these jobs...I researched not with the bs notion ""I can achieve anything"", instead I researched with realistic expectations, 'how realistic is it that someone like me can achieve this', with the resources that are available to me.

I eventually decided on pursuing programming. Research showed that maybe even someone like me, who can't afford to study computer science, can still pursue and land a job as a programmer. I know it's MUCH HARDER without a formal education, but I have to try, I have nothing else going on for me anyway. So a couple of months back, I start learning android and web development as well.

Now, I spend all day building a portfolio upon waking up to when I go to sleep. Because I keep my mind occupied, I don't feel as hopeless and depressed as before, but I know I'm not in a good place, and I know in the eyes of my family, I'm a loser.

I just wanted to share my story and circumstances somewhere, because I feel like I have no else in my life to talk about my problems.

I wouldn't mind any advice or motivational stories from people who've turned their lives around...That's actually all I care about at this point in my life, making something of myself. I don't need millions are expensive things, I just want to know that I can still turn my life around."

How can I make this happen?,geekonmuesli,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g7fj1i/ive_finished_my_stem_phd_but_i_want_to_leave/,"I've never had a proper job, just a summer physics research internship. I did my particle physics PhD at a UK university but now I'm living in the US with a greencard.

I don't want to stay in academia for many reasons, partly because I don't want to have to skip between short term post-doc positions in various countries for the next decade. I've spent the last 4 years writing code to analyse data, so I figured data analyst/data scientist/programmer analyst would be a good first step into the real world. I can tick most of the boxes the job descriptions ask for - experience with an object-oriented language (C++ for me), SQL, Python, data visualisation, statistics, documentation - but I'm not getting interviews.

I think my main issues are:

* I don't have experience outside of my PhD, which I'm not sure employers are counting as work experience in spite of it being a ""show up to the office for 9+ hours, 5 days a week"" type of thing
* I don't have a GPA (I graduated my undergraduate degree with a first but Americans don't seem to know what that means)
* I technically don't have a bachelors, just an MSci and PhD (I did an undergraduate Masters, it's a four year course that combines a BS and an MS instead of doing a 3 year BS + a 1 year MS). Because of this and the GPA I've run into trouble while trying to fill out the online forms.
* This is probably just paranoia, but... I have a very foreign looking first name (uncommon Irish name, I've had many people think it's a typo) and I'm concerned people get the impression that English isn't my first language

And of course it doesn't help that after the endless tweaking for each new job description, looking at my resume/cover letters makes me want to cry (hellooooo imposter syndrome). I'm feeling very lost and like I've wasted the last 8 years of my life when I should have done a compsci bachelors.

What can I do to market myself better? I'd rather not go back to uni or a coding bootcamp, so if I can't get these kinds of roles without years of unpaid training... what are my options?"

I’d like to apologize in advance, because this post is definitely going to be too long. Basically, I have no idea what I want to do with my life / what careers I want to pursue. 

However, I know I want to do whatever I can to gain experience and figure out what appeals to me. I’m really passionate about politics, public policy, and government. I looked at some internships with DC think tanks that seemed really interesting but also above my skill level. I’m also interested in careers in finance or consulting. I have to say, this is mainly because I want to make money, but I also do genuinely find securities markets fascinating. 

I was planning on doing an internship this summer with a state legislator, but coronavirus made this impossible since the internship wasn’t in my home state. Now, I have 4 months with basically nothing to do. I have a lot of hobbies and interesting stuff to do, but I want to take advantage of this time so I’m in a good position, career wise. I feel like I’m setting myself up for failure in the future by not doing anything right now. Basically, I’m wondering what kinds of things I could do this summer to build my resume and set me up to get interesting, fulfilling internships next summer and beyond. 

These are some things I’ve considered, and I would love feedback on which ones are worthwhile as well as any ideas about other things I could do. First, I plan to learn some programs that are commonly used in data science and finance. I already know excel pretty well, and I’m looking into learning Stata / R. Is this a good idea? What programs would be most useful? My school has also offered a pretty steep discount on Harvard Business School’s CORe courses--are these legit / worth doing?

Finally, my dad makes a living as an independent investor / trader (ie he’s self-employed), and he offered to give me an informal “internship,” where I would assist him in trading and analyze stocks for him.

(and yes, a request for help)",Trash_To_Throw_Away,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/g7fpdt/here_comes_the_lament_and_yes_a_request_for_help/,"I finally made an alt for this, and I won't deny I feel stupid doing so. But I realize I'm going to end up a burden to others for the rest of my life if I don't change something now, so I'm going to put in the effort and at least see what others have to say. As complicated as my situation is, I think the main issues are fairly simple and almost cliche:

-I'm 23, freshly graduated. 

-The last job I had was in 2018 and it was part time, I pretty much have no experience. 

-Fortunately, I'm living with my parents. I'm an only child, and they're in a decent position, so I didn't have to take out any loans. I can easily admit that I don't feel the pressure to start a career because of the comfort they have provided me. 

-I majored in English/Creative Writing, and my last two years of school focused on book publishing. My school has a great program for helping students get internships at publishing houses, and it seemed like the obvious choice with my degree. 

-I won't say I have/had a passion for books. When the time came to choose a major, the only thing I could stand was reading and writing. At best, studying literature intrigued me. 

-The more I explore the book publishing industry, the more I hate books and everything tied to them. Reading isn't even enjoyable for me anymore, and that's basically the only 'skill' I'm proficient in. Copyediting/Proofreading makes me feel like I'm having an anxiety attack after 5 minutes, my chest feels tight and I get agitated. 

-A few online friends are big into coding, and my dad has even tried pushing me towards that. Besides not having a computer good enough to run Minecraft on the lowest settings, the few times I've tried to learn Python in the past have exhausted me. But it seems that some kind of computer/technical skill is what's in demand nowadays. 


Every path I consider, even ones way out of my grasp, fills me with malaise. I recognize that my easy life supported by two hard working parents will keep me dreading work. I've had therapists in the past recommend to ""just do something,"" try out an easy job in order to get the gears moving. The issue being that every 'something' I look at gives me that sensation of a panic attack, and I just don't try. 


I'll be open to answer any clarifying questions. It may be apparent in what I've written above that I make excuses for not pursuing anything, but I'll do my best to refrain from that when considering any suggestions here. Thanks in advance to all who respond."

However, now that I am working here, it seems to be more of a QA Automation kind of role and they have a lot of manual testing. I don't enjoy my work here at all. I want to work in a backend engineering (distributed systems) space. My previous internship experiences were in a backend engineering space with a large part of my day spent coding. I have to stick on here for 1 year else I'd need to pay back my joining bonus and relocation allowances so leaving right away isn't an option. Further, with the current situation of COVID-19, it pays to stick on at a bigger company rather than try out some stunts.

1. What is the best way to upskill given my situation?
2. How do you network with other folks within my company and at other FAANG companies?
3. Any other suggestions?

* More holistic/forgiving of low stats with extenuating circumstances: I know all top colleges are to some extent holistic, but some are still going to be more stats-reliant over ECs/essays. So I figure, the more weight it gives to ECs and essays over GPA, the better chance I have of getting in
* Specifically for my ED school, a school that's big on demonstrated interest and gives a boost to ED applicants/those who show interest
* **Financial:** Good financial aid would be nice, but not a priority. I'm willing to apply to need-aware schools without any aid if it makes me more competitive
* **School Size:** Medium-large. I don't like the idea of a school where everybody knows you. I'd prefer a wide variety of people to interact with.
* **Atmosphere:** As I've said before, variety is very important to me. I'm a person with different interests and hobbies, so there are going to be times where I'd want to hit up a frat party or a football game, but also times where I'd like to chill and have an intellectual discussion. So I'd like a college that's big and varied enough to offer me both. Specifically though, I'd appreciate an entrepreneurial vibe. Also, a beautiful campus would be a big plus.
* **Geography:** Exact location doesn't matter, but I'd like a campus that's in a more urban location over one's that more secluded."

Right now my summer commitments are as follows;

- Three online courses, which may become four as I suspect I may fail a class this semester and need to retake it.  
- An internship which is letting me remote work for ~40 hours a week  
- My job at Walmart, which I am currently only working at for ~16 hours a week on the weekends 
- My summer research project, funded by my university, which will be time consuming as I have to do field survey work/etc in order to prep.  

Looking at this list, which doesn't account for any other obligations that may crop up, I fear I may be setting myself up for failure. I certainly know that this semester has been rough for me between working at Walmart, working at my internship, and taking 5 classes (one of which has a lab, so it's really like I was taking 6).

I hate my job at Walmart and I've wanted to quit for a long time. But, I'm also very afraid that if the economy gets any worse my internship may decide they don't need an intern anymore. I've been there for 4 months, counting April, so I feel pretty safe.  I've heard this company pretty much *always* offers their interns a job once they graduate. But, at the same time, these are unprecedented times we live in. I don't know if it is safe to ban on them keeping me around for the summer + fall semester.

I understand no one will have a be-all-end-all answer, but is it safe to quit my job at Walmart? If people were in my shoes, what would you be inclined to do?"

I graduated in 2019 from a university in the bay area with a BS in Information Technology. I developed a huge passion for web development in my last quarter. Ever since, I have been self-studying and working on personal projects to build up my resume (I didn't have any work experience other than being a grader at the time).

By November, I had about 3 personal full stack projects (ReactJS, Django) and 1 class project (Vue, Web2py). That's when I felt comfortable applying for jobs. It's been almost half a year now, I have applied to more than 500 jobs, and gotten about 5 interviews, but no job offer except for an unpaid internship position which is where I am currently working.

I was very excited for the intern position because they did have a couple of React projects, and I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to learn from other React developers. However, it turns out that all of my co-workers are interns, and I was the one who had the most knowledge in React. I was assigned to an existing project. The code base from previous interns is really messy and super unscalable. I feel like I'm wasting time working there because it's a company who only hires unpaid interns (so no possibility to become a full-time employee), and it seems like I'm getting worse at React instead of improving.

I should also mention that I am an international student on my F1 OPT right now (expires in 2.5 years with extension). It is important to me to be able to find a full-time position in order to pursue my dreams in the US. At this point I'm feeling hopeless. I don't know what I'm lacking in order to find an entry level job. I feel like my web dev skills are pretty good and I'm mostly being held back because of my non-citizen status and lack of connections.

Let me know if you have any suggestions/advice for me. Should I build more personal projects? Should I perfect my current ones? Should I remake my personal portfolio (I'm not feeling confident about the current one I have)? Should I learn mobile development?

\*Feel free to DM me if would like to see and critique on my portfolio/projects!

TLDR: Recently graduated international student, specialized in Full Stack Web Development (React, Django), seeking career advice. Currently at an unpaid Software Engineer internship with no promotions available. Wondering what I should do next in order to obtain a full-time position."

**Intended Major:** mostly Chem, but some Chem Engineer

**Academic sTaTs:**

* **SAT/ACT:** 1500 (didn't submit)/35
* **SATII:** Math II (800), Chem (790), Lit (610 lol didn’t submit)
* **UW/W GPA:** 3.9/4.3
* **Coursework:** 13 APs (7 senior yr), a couple 3s and 4s, but mostly 5s; 3 honors \[took basically the hardest workload my school offered\]

**Awards:** NOTHING SIGNIFICANT HAHAHAH (like ap scholar, NM Commended, local community service)

**Extracurriculars:** 

2 paid summer internships, one at a biomedical company and the other at a lab (internationally recognized lab but omitted for confidentiality reasons)

Volunteer tutor (4 years)

Swim (11 years, but 3 years HS JV)

President of 2 Clubs, one is the largest club at our school, one is smaller

Violin (4 years), but wasn’t amazing or anything even close

A couple mission trips

**LORs:** 

English teacher: 9.5/10 she loved me a lot and I had her for 2 years. She’s a VERY well known teacher in the educational community (also omitted for confidentiality reasons) so I think that boosts her credibility.

Math teacher: either 3/10 or a 8/10, he’s the sarcastic type so it could either be hit or miss honestly. I thought he liked me but then I could have read the vibe completely wrong.

Chem teacher: 7/10 he liked me and I loved his class, just a normal average LOR

**Essays:**

I think my UCs were a lot stronger because I didn’t have a specific essay topic that I could center my app around. The 4 essays gave a better picture of who I am. I had 2 commonapp essays and both were on cliché topics (with I guess a spin?).

Overall, UCs: 9/10 and CommonApps: 6/10 (both)

**Colleges:**

*SCEA:*

Yale:&gt;!rejected (not even deferred :( )!&lt;

*Regular Decision:*

7 UCs (UCLA, UCB, UCD, UCSC, UCSD, UCSB, UCI): &gt;!accepted to all (regents + honors at UCI)!&lt;

3 CSUs (SJSU, Cal Poly SLO, SDSU): &gt;!accepted to all!&lt;

Pepperdine:&gt;!accepted with regents scholarship!&lt;

Santa Clara:&gt;!accepted with presidential scholarship!&lt;

Boston College: &gt;!accepted!&lt;

Vanderbilt: &gt;!accepted!&lt;

Columbia: &gt;!waitlisted (fat surprise)!&lt;

Stanford: &gt;!rejected!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that I'm an exact replica of every Asian Bay Area male, but overall, I'm ecstatic with my results. I only applied Yale early, because I didn't have the courage to ED anywhere. The Yale rejection shook me, but everything ended up working out. (Tip: Don't apply early if you aren't 100% ready) I'm currently split between UCLA and Vanderbilt so comment some suggestions."

It's a long one. I'm new both in computer science and this subreddit so go easy on me. I come from a physics background, graduated top of my class at a top university in physics but something was missing. Don't get me wrong, I love physics and wouldn't have done it if I didn't, but I knew very early on in my undergraduate career that I didn't really want to pursue it in grad school or industry. What was I to do? I had programmed many times throughout my undergraduate career as it will inevitably be required for some physics task along the way (i.e. programming an arduino to control a shutter for a lab laser, modeling differential equations, etc.) but I saw computer science as just that... programming. I considered switching to computer science, but this idea of what computer science was hindered me. I didn't want to be a rank and file programmer, coding web apps or whatever sophomore college me thought computer science was. Keep in mind that this mentality of ""looking down"" on programmers has changed. Who am I to shit on someone else's career? The fucking ego I had back then. Besides the point, I still today desire something juicier in a sense. 

Two years ago I was ever so lucky to land an internship at a local engineering company as a computational scientist. I can't say too much, but we do cutting edge stuff in terms of electric motors for electric flight. It sparked my interest in computer science and I went on a rampage of gathering information about computer/computational science. Since then I have decided I want to get a PhD in computer science. I know I'm skipping a few parts in between, but it doesn't matter for this post much. I'm attending a research-based masters program in the fall, working with a professor in graphics that I absolutely love and I will hopefully then move on to a top PhD program, or really any PhD program where I get to do what I love (animation/simulation work at the moment).

This finally brings me to the point I want to make with this post. I am so fucking lucky to have discovered this passion. A lot of my friends are pre-med/bio/physics so I have yet to talk with someone who relates and I'm so stoked to be around people who share my passion. Computer science is awesome. It is one of the few things out there where if you have a new idea, you can try and make it work without some crazy lab. In every sense of the phrase, the only limit is your imagination. Of course if you use some idea that requires some massive cluster of gpus for parallel processing you might have a different limit. But for all intents and purposes, if you have an idea randomly during the day, you can go home and try it out on your home computer. 

If you've made it this far thanks for listening to my ramble. I'd love to hear other people's experiences as well. I'm craving some discussion with like-minded people. Hope everyone and their families are safe during this crazy ass time. Looking forward to participating in this subreddit"

I have previously accepted a summer internship at a company I'm excited about.

If I were to get the second offer, I would likely stick with the first internship though.

I'm wondering if it would be in bad taste to interview with company 2? I'm tempted to do the interview since it would be good to learn more about the role/company, and also because of the general uncertainty with COVID (though company 1 seems to be going forward with a remote internship).

Thank you for reading!

&amp;#x200B;

Graduated last May from a good college with a strong GPA with a business degree focusing on information systems. I completed an internship doing SQL / Excel all day in an office and it made me realize I hate working behind a computer and it drains me and makes me feel like I'm wasting my time. In order to please my parents, I went to graduate school to do a masters in data science and dropped out after a month because I realized if I stayed and did this the rest of my life I was going to hate myself doing something I disliked for the rest of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent time working in retail and worked my way up to a manager position and I realized that I loved working with my hands, switching tasks (not having to focus on 1 thing for 8 hours), talking to people all day (this was my favorite),  helping people, and the time actually felt like it went by fast instead of dragging on like it did in the office. However, given that it was long hours &amp; low pay I needed to figure out an actual career path.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about becoming a Physician Assistant because it was a good career that helped people and fit the qualities above (seemed fun when I shadowed one) and I'm basically redoing undergrad right now (have to take a bunch of science courses)  and working part-time in a physical therapy office (which is fun b/c I talk to people and help them all day).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm finishing up my first semester of these science courses right now and while I'm doing well there's a lot of doubts in my mind about the path I'm on. Specifically that I'm going to have to do these classes while working part-time for another 2 years before I can even apply to school which will be another 2 years not factoring in if I don't get in my first time, have to take a gap year to get more work hours, etc. I'm feeling a little burnt out with school and I feel like I want to get my career/life started already instead of delaying it for another 4-5 years. (I'm 24). Another important thing that I'm starting to realize is that even though I'm a good student, I'm not really so interested in science but more interested in the people. Lastly, part of the reason I started this path was because I felt like I needed to pick something to work towards instead of remaining at my dead-end retail job with my parents hovering over me constantly asking about my future.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be able to move out of my parent's house, have consistency in my schedule and have time/money to pursue hobbies and enjoy life which I don't really feel like I'm doing now. However, if I quit this path I have no clue what else I would do which is why I'm posting here. I know a bunch of things that I don't like and a bunch of things that I do like such as connecting with people, helping them, working with my hands, but don't really know what career paths that would translate to. I was thinking maybe something in sales (like maybe a financial advisor) or a trade? Decided I wasn't interested in nursing b/c I really didn't want to work with body fluids like pee and poop. Anyways, please feel free to leave some advice or suggestions because I'm really stuck here.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Graduated with a business degree and was miserable sitting behind a desk doing excel and programming. Enjoy talking to people (connecting with them) and helping them, working with my hands, working in a team, variation in tasks, and feeling like what I'm doing actually matters. Currently on a path to become a Physician Assistant but really am looking for another career path now instead of delaying my life another 4-5 years in school / part-time work. Please help me figure this out!"
g7me7n,1,2020-04-24,[Advice] Roller-Coaster Transcript? Trauma?,TeaRye,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/g7me7n/advice_rollercoaster_transcript_trauma/,"Back in 2016, I began my undergraduate education as a biology major as part of an extremely selective and prestigious accelerated dental program. I had excelled in my high school studies (top tier of my graduating class, National Merit Finalist, great SAT, lots of extracurriculars, 10 AP classes, 4.3+/4.0 GPA). Unfortunately, a lot of my academic success was due to my mother constantly helicopter parenting me and never letting me make my own life choices. I never got to enjoy my summers, she isolated me from talking to any of my friends from school, she never let me get a part-time job because I needed to study, she made me quit band to focus more on my grades, etc. I just assumed that this was the way life was though (didn't complain at all). She also inflicted a lot of harsh physical (such as relentlessly beating the life out of me almost every single day whenever I did anything she didn't completely like), verbal, and emotional abuse. I also always struggled with concentrating on my work, but my mom denied that I had ADHD or any other ""disability"", so that was that.

Once I got to college, I realized that the abuse that I had been dealing with was not normal, and that hit me like a truck. On top of about a decade's worth of untreated trauma, I was completely academically burnt out because I lived simply to please my mom and not for myself. Due to these struggles, my grades tanked, but I was smart enough to still get decent grades (B-, B+, A-) in quite a few of my classes. I also engaged in a lot of self-destructive behavior as a way to cope but also ""throw away"" myself because I genuinely didn't care and didn't know how to care about myself. Eventually, I started getting some terrible grades (C, C-, D) in some of my upper level science courses and dropped out of my program.

Despite these difficulties, I've managed to land some good opportunities and internships (worked as a dental assistant for a semester, am working on publishing a chapter in an open-access behavioral neuroscience textbook, and am also working on revising a paper that will go to Nature for publication). I'm in the process of healing and learning to live for myself. **However, I have heard that graduate schools mainly look at GPA and don't really give a crap about your background and your traumas; they just want to know that you'll succeed academically.** My GPA is pretty trash (barely a 3.2/4.0), and **I'm worried about how in the world I'm going to explain my crappy grades to grad schools without hurting my chances of admittance for being from a dysfunctional family and not being able to handle that properly for quite a few years**. I am doing slightly better now, but even though I've tried everything in my power to remove myself from this toxic environment (tried to move out, tried to declare financial independence, tried to beg to my parents to let me pay my own tuition, tried to run away, BUT they won't let me and shame me for ever thinking that these are options), I'm still kind of stuck and **still not excelling in my studies** (if I were, that would slightly cancel out the effect of my bad grades). I take responsibility for my self-destructive patterns and know that a lot of this is my fault, but will graduate schools ever understand?

tl;dr – **How do I explain my roller-coaster transcript to graduate schools when my reasons are largely due to traumatic experiences without hurting my chances even further? Will my experiences at least give me a little edge?**"

I am a transfer student from CC that recently got accepted into UCI &amp; UCSD under computer science. I am very torn between the two universities and want to hear both perspective to debunk some of the myths, truths and overall questions I had.

**Social/Culture**

How is the social life at UCI? I heard both sides where it is one of the more social UCs or either that it is a commuter school. How is the culture at UCI? I tend to become very shy at first but really want to meet and interact with new people. Due to all of this coronavirus stuff, I'm most likely staying home for my first quarter at the college. Although in the spring quarter, I plan on dorming. Anything I should know when looking for a roommate/ overall info about the dorms?

**Education/Job Opportunities**

Although, UCSD is considered to have a higher amount of prestige and reputation in their cs program and UCI has a very solid and respectable stature in IT. How is the workload/difficulty at UCI? Does the college I go to help when applying for future internships and jobs? Also, how are the internship opportunities at UCI? Abundant or hard to get? 

Overall I just want people's perspective about their UCI experience and want to make the most out of mine. You don't have to answer both categories or have to be a CS major either, anything helps!

Thank you for taking your time to read all of this."
g7olnq,13,2020-04-25,[Uni] NUS vs NTU (Business),Piesonpumkin,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g7olnq/uni_nus_vs_ntu_business/,"I know there is a whole lot of thread regarding this infamous comparison. I have already set my decision for NTU a month ago. But suddenly family members got so much time during Circuit Breaker to think about how NUS is a ""better"" school due to its reputation. Of course. Older generations are always about rankings. Anyways, I question myself easily so now I'm questioning my own decisions and I've come on here for help.

I got offered a place at:

SMU - BusinessNTU- Business with Minor in International TradingNUS - BBA

(Polytechnic Graduate)

In terms of quality, to me, SMU is the best out of the 3 for business, however hearing about the environment and extrovert open nature. It's just not for an introvert like me. I also heard NTU is more chill so it fits into my type of environment.

So it all comes down to NTU vs NUS.

In my situation, I know that my career path would be towards Finance and I am interested in the financial markets, research analyst, and investment. With a set minor in International Trading, this means I can choose another specialization (thinking about Platform Based Learning) to enhance my portfolio.

On the other hand, when researching about NUS finance. It seems like the website only gave a very vague idea of the specialization. They stated 3 core modules, and pick 3 out of 33 subjects?? I actually do not understand that part (NUS finance students please advise), and if that is true, it seems that if I picked the relevant 3 subjects that are investment-related. NTU would have outweighed it anyways as they offered more as a whole specialization. (not to mention how I can double what I learn if I picked NTU due to the minor offered)

I also heard from a friend that NUS is more accommodating to JC students or students who don't know what type of business/finance they would like to do in general. Thus, they give a vague and broad range to choose from. As if you can mix and match different types of finance subjects you would want to learn and not having to adhere to certain specializations. while NTU is more like specializations WITHIN finance. (at this point it's all based on what I researched, so please correct me if I'm wrong)

So I understand that generally NTU has specializations and knowing what I want to do, I should just go to NTU. But, if I choose NUS, with the right subject choice, would it be similar to choosing NTU? (not taking into account that I have a minor in NTU)

The real problem lies with how NTU is effing far and I live in the east. I know that accommodation is guaranteed for the first 2 years. But if I do not get accommodation for my 3rd year siao liao. Just wondering if it is actually attainable to earn my spot at Y3 being an introvert, meaning not participating in camps. Maybe just Inter-Hall and CCA? also if it is any easier compared to NUS? Also wondering which is cheaper considering all things equal (eg. no aircon, single room, etc)

(ps. I guess if i really have to get a few camp activities to add to my points I would do it but I really need to know how the system works to plan for these type of things haha)

Another issue is that, is it true that companies would prefer NUS students more? Feel like its prestige has some influence sometimes even if it is unintentional. Not sure. What do you guys think? I am afraid about if companies value reputation more. Considering I have weak social skills if I have the reputation of the company by my side it could make up for the bad interview skills lol. (Considering grades are good and obviously brushing up those skills as much as I can, I'm just an awkward person)

I am also aiming to secure a scholarship. Which school is easier to get a scholarship? Lol at this point I just need enough pros and cons to decide.

Last question, I have heard about how NTU students have to take a vacation for internship. I have no idea how that works or means. Someone please explain. Also, being a polytechnic graduate, does this mean I am entitled to exemption? And will that free up some time for ""vacation for internship""?

Generally, I picked NTU due to the point above as mentioned about being able to learn more in specialization and having a minor compared to a ""mix-and-match"" NUS degree. The rumors about it being a chill university. Direct honors and a 3-year programme (although a bit skeptical of the 3 years when there is an internship to think about). And just how bad of a reputation NUS have been getting from all that sexual harassment cases which just turns me off but obviously it's stupid to just judge NUS based off of that.

Thanks for answering as much as you can. I know I ask a lot of questions LMAO."
g7osda,158,2020-04-25,Some advice from a CS graduate who had an amazing time at U of T.,theepiphanyofmrkugla,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/g7osda/some_advice_from_a_cs_graduate_who_had_an_amazing/,"Some of these suggestions are controversial, so take everything I say with a grain of salt but this is what I found worked for me personally. I had a great time at U of T, both in terms of the academic experience as well as the classic college one. This is what I would say to someone who wants to find a balance between the traditional ""college experience"" and succeeding academically. What I mean by succeed academically is enjoying your studies without having them overwhelm you. I don't mean having a 4.0. In my humble opinion, maintaing a 3.8+ cGPA in U of T CS NECESSITATES tremendous SACRIFICE. My advice does not apply if these are your goals, unless you are naturally exceptionally gifted.

1) Live on res in your first year(not everyone can afford it but if you can then 100% do).

2) Get involved in social events, consistently make an effort to communicate with people. Go out and party with whatever your own definitions and expectations of ""partying"" are. Every evening you spend alone in your dorm is an opportunity cost to making the memories that most people hold onto from their college years.

3) If the material for a lecture is available online and attendance doesn't count for grades, skip lectures. You can learn everything on your own in half the time.

4) Following up on this, go to office hours. Never skip these. This is 100% the time you should be focusing your efforts in with regards to getting access to your professors. Ask questions, build a relationship with them. This is the one thing I regret not doing more.

5) This follows up on points 1) and 2): MAKE FRIENDS OUTSIDE OF CS. Make friends with people who do consistently have fun at U of T, like students in less academically rigorous disciplines. There are people who party ALOT at U of T but they typically aren't CS or eng kids. Be their friend.

6) If you are in highschool and have the option of taking courses that count for college credits(such as IB), DO THIS WITHOUT A DOUBT. This will allow you take a more relaxed course load especially in your first few years of uni which are really the years that matter most when it comes to building relationships. This will give you time to invest in the memories that really matter, you will NOT reminisce about the hours you spend in a library studying for a 6 course workload.

7) Study together with friends. You will no doubt be less productive than if you were to do it solo, but you will have a MUCH MORE FULFILLING TIME.

8) Do a little work everyday. Even if it is just 1 hour. Take as few days completely off as possible. Make a little progress with regards to your academics EVERYDAY of the week. Yes even Saturdays and Sundays. It is easier to work in short burts more often, than having to work for longer bursts but less frequently.

9) Invest in your personal fitness. Eat clean and use the gym. THIS WILL BENEFIT EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE. You will look better, feel better, have more confidence, and people will be more attracted to you.

10) Do leetcode, apply for internships in the summer after second and third year(or do research with the professors with whom you have cultivated a relationship with following step 4). This is single handedly the most important aspect to your career in the CS industry(for academia the research is just as important). If you are interested in industry, work experience is 1 million times more important than your GPA(this multiplier is not an approximate number, I've done the statistical analysis)

11) Read literature. This will improve your vocabulary and reading comprehension. I cannot overstate the importance of this.

12) Have a hobby, and I don't mean going out drinking with your friends or fitness. I also don't mean reading literature or coding. Have another hobby, like learning an instrument or another art form.

13) DO NOT SINK HOURS INTO REDDIT. I've been guilty of this, but sinking time into reddit and memes is the worst possible investment of your time.

This is what I can think of from the top of my head. Source: I graduated from U of T CS at St george last summer with slightly under a 3.7 cGpa, and with plenty of great ""college memories"". I now work for a FAANG as a software engineer. At the risk of coming off as conceited, I will say that I am lucky to be someone who has always naturally excelled at academics, so your milage will vary with this advice.

EDIT:

14) DATE PEOPLE. The lessons you learn in university about your romantic and sexual life are as important as the academic ones. Invest conscious effort into your romantic relationships, university is the time that society designates for you to learn about who you are as a romantic being. DO NOT NEGLECT THIS ASPECT OF YOURSELF. This is the number 1 thing that all of my CS friends graduating or who have graduated express regret on."
g7pg0n,4,2020-04-25,Please help me decide,_Sadist_,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g7pg0n/please_help_me_decide/,"**Please read the post before choosing.**

So I was dead set on Purdue, I'd filled the deposit, made a group of friends, even planned out my course schedule for the first semester, the entire deal.  But today I got an admission offer from Waterloo with Honours Computer Science Co-op along with the 2000CAD Presidential Scholarship of distinction. Although the amount is quite small compared to the overall tuition fee so scholarship won't matter much. I am listing down the pros and cons of each university, so please help me decide.

**Intended Major:** Computer Science

**Intended Career:** I am dead set in working in the silicon valley. It has been my dream since childhood.

**Purdue University Pros:**

* Great reputation among employers in the US in general
* School name holds weight in the professional environment (very large alumni base)
* Great CS Program - There is a 'Tracks' program in which I can concentrate on particular CS fields in upper years.
* Huge alumni base in Silicon Valley
* Tons of opportunities for research and internships at career fairs
* Extra career fair only for CS majors
* Better traditional college experience (Tons of campus pride and things to do on campus)
* I have already planned out the courses and program which I want to pursue (Double major with data science and combined BS/MS program in CS.)
* Already made some friends with the same/different nationalities.
* Beautiful Campus
* Relatively low international cost of attendance (40k USD)

**Purdue University Cons**

* Not guaranteed a job upon graduation. (**Although I haven't seen anyone who is unemployed with Purdue CS degree)**
* The H1B visa is a lottery base.
* Not as prestigious as top tier CS Schools like UIUC or GaTech
* Have to put a lot of effort to find internships
* Grade Deflation (?)

&amp;#x200B;

**University of Waterloo Pros:**

* Amazing Co-op Program
* 2 years of work experience upon graduation
* Many connections with very good employers
* Almost guaranteed job placement directly after graduation
* Great reputation in the field of CS and in Silicon Valley
* Guaranteed Canadian Citizenship compared to the US. (**But I don't know whether this is directly applicable within a short time that can benefit my visa status when I work in the US**)

**University of Waterloo Cons:**

* Literally no break for 5 years (They divide the year into 3 quarters with each quarter of 4 months. You study in the college for 2 quarters and work in the company for 1 quarter.)
* A very less diverse culture
* More expensive total cost of attendance Purdue (49\~50k USD)
* Cutthroat environment - Very stressful balancing academics and prepping for interviews and applying for internships
* Set up so you have 6 work terms and if you don't get a placement for 2/6 you are kicked out of the program
* Although there's an amazing co-op program, an internship in the top-tier firms like those in the bay area isn't guaranteed.
* Female to male ratio is suboptimal
* Co-op seems to be the only thing people care about.

&amp;#x200B;

**I know Waterloo's Co-op is better but graduating with a Purdue CS degree also has insane job placements.** This is what makes me more confusing. **Cost is a factor for me** but I heard that we can pay back some of Waterloo's tuition with Co-ops. But I'm not sure I can earn $8\~9k with 4 months' co-ops. I want to hear the reputation of both schools from those who are in the US as I am planning to live in the US after graduation.

Meta-ironic commentary aside, here's an update post for you guys regarding the state of our title tags, and on Rule 5 on advertisements!

&amp;#x200B;

**NEW TITLE TAGS**

We've added three new tags - \[Invites\], \[News\] and \[Jobs\]

|**TITLE TAG**|**USED FOR?**|**EXAMPLES**|**NOTES**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|\[Invites\]|Volunteering opportunities, free events that would benefit students.|[This webinar series by Advisory for you to discover your career interests](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g7pogo/invite_discover_your_career_interests_during_hbl/)|Requires prior approval by filling in [this form](https://forms.gle/JrZjodYocGEKDpPb8)|

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of Rule #5....

**CHANGES TO RULE #5 ON ADVERTISING**

This rule has been changed to the following:

&gt;`➥ Any links to content hosted by non-SGExams accounts will need to seek prior approval via this form:`  [`https://forms.gle/JrZjodYocGEKDpPb8`](https://forms.gle/JrZjodYocGEKDpPb8)`.`  
&gt;  
&gt;`❓ This includes Youtube videos, Instagram posts, and notes hosted on a tuition agency's website.`

In essence, it has been **expanded** to include pretty much everything that isn't hosted by or on an SGExams platform. Notes uploaded to [exams.sg/library](https://exams.sg/library) are allowed.

This is to minimise ""free trial"" content whose main purpose is to entice you into eventually subscribing to their paid service, which we have been spotting more frequently during this HBL period.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, you would've noticed that \[Jobs\] and \[Invites\] encroach on the kind of posts that would've been tagged by \[Post-Exams\]. More astute observers would realise the \[Invite\] flair shares the exact same layout as \[Post-Exams\]. That's because...

**REMOVAL OF POST-EXAMS**

When it's all said and done, when the battle's all but won, how will they remember your legacy? For \[Post-Exams\], it would be a blurry mess of misuse and mismanagement. After our review of [posts tagged post-exams](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/search?q=post%20exams&amp;restrict_sr=1), we discovered they can be classified into four broad categories:

1. Posts that are better off tagged by their respective educational level e.g. [Poly](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/dud2bh/post_exams_what_poly_course/) / [Uni](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fcwrpm/postexams_what_is_the_future_for_an_accountant_or/)
2. Posts regarding end-of-year part-time job hunting
3. Posts inviting you to free events and opportunities
4. Rant posts about drifting apart from friends after exams

These posts have nothing in common, so we've decided to split them up. 2-4 belong to \[Jobs\], \[Invite\] and \[Rant\] respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

g7r0tc,1,2020-04-25,Venting and uncertainties,LuckyBoysenberry,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/g7r0tc/venting_and_uncertainties/,"I’m currently a master’s student on track to graduate later this year. I was preparing and thinking for things after my master’s for a while, but now I am not so sure (especially now with the coronavirus situation) so I'd really appreciate sharing thoughts and experiences with someone.

While I was not the greatest undergrad, at least I was above average according to my transcript? I got some research experience and work experience (including “useless” work through undergrad, yay for working when you “should” be working on your thesis). 

Wanted better, got into a master’s program which I thought was a good opportunity. To put it simply, I cannot see myself staying here. I feel that what I thought I was going to be doing and what actually happened will not help me in the future. 

I can accept reality (ie: I can admit that I am not a gold-star top student), but at the same time, I don’t want to be complaisant. Initially, my plan was to find a PhD program, and to work or intern during the months before starting. 

My experience so far has me angry with academia, and I do not feel as though I am prepared for what my background “should have” prepared me for. Frankly, I’m not interested in a lot of what I thought I was and/or in a lot of what I’m doing right now.  I do have other interests that are better explored elsewhere.

I refuse to be part of a stupid rat race where suck-ups get fed with a silver spoon, and I learned I really should think hard about where to go. While research and money are important, so is life in general, so I’ve been thinking about things like how liveable a city is, where I should study (I don’t think Canada or US are too different if I will work in one or the other), and how people in the dept. are. Otherwise, if I’m not satisfied, if I want hard work to be appreciated, at least I would have a better chance of that (in the form of more money) in industry.

I thought I knew what I was doing, but now that I think again, I think I have narrowed down possible schools for a PhD (again), and talked with a few professors already. I’m not exactly sure about the research that I would be doing at one school (must admit it’s not something I’m an expert in, and I should be reading the stuff I have prepared about it to learn more). Another may have problems accepting new students next year.

As for the third program, I’m genuinely not sure, but I should send an email asking questions once I get some coffee to keep me awake today. Problem is that I will be starting rather late, and I would need to find something to do for ~a year in between (yay economy). 

There is a fourth program near my hometown, directly across from where my father works (not at the uni). I won’t get peace and quiet. My hometown is expensive, so I could save money living at home, spend time with my aging parents, but also be approaching 30+ and still live at home.

The time for me to apply is coming soon and things have changed compared to last year."

g7vpxv,2,2020-04-25,[IWantOut] 33F Accountant/AML Analyst USA -&gt; UK,Anissu,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/g7vpxv/iwantout_33f_accountantaml_analyst_usa_uk/,"Quick background rundown: 

* I am a US citizen with a current passport (renewed this year due to name change).
* I have a bachelor’s in Accounting (May 2019), and an associate’s in Medical Administration with a      Concentration in Medical Transcription (December 2010). 
* I have worked in retail for a little over five years, about four years as a medical transcriptionist/patient registration, four months in data entry, and I am currently working as an AML analyst for a multinational bank as of February 2020. 

I am looking for any available avenue to get to the UK, and I will admit there is a bit of desperation that is creeping through. My fiancé is a British citizen, but due to being a type 1 diabetic and ongoing medical issues, he is unable to work and is barely scraping by with Universal Credit. 

Here is where the desperation is coming in: he has double retinal bleeds, and he is slowly going blind. He has already had two operations on his right eye to correct it, and it started clouding over again while there is blood in the left eye that hinders his vision. 

I have tried looking into several avenues to try and get over to England, which includes: 

**Tier 4 Student Visa**: As stated above, I have my bachelor's, so I was considering going over to obtain a master’s in accounting. However, I do not have the funds for the living expense required to obtain a Tier 4 student visa (£1,105/month when living outside of London, from my research). I would be able to stay at my fiancé’s during that time, but I doubt they would take that into consideration.

**Fiance Visa**: This was another option I had looked into, but our problem is that 1) he cannot work, so he does not meet the minimum salaried requirements, and 2) neither of us have enough in the bank to meet the financial requirements (£16,000, last I checked). I am slowly storing away money, but it would take a few years to get that much, which includes compensating for the exchange rate.

**Work Visa**: I was looking at jobs in the UK, but as a recent graduate with zero job or internship experience, it might be a hard sell to get a company to sponsor me. At that time, I had a dwindling savings account with no means to relocate. Right now, my savings are growing, and I already have a ticket to England for October (originally meant to visit my fiancé until I can move there on a more permanent basis). 

**Current Employment**: Right now, my best shot of making it over to England, in my eyes, is through my current employer. However, I have only been with the company for three months, and they require you to stay in your current position for a year. An exception may be possible if I could make a vertical movement within the company, but I believe they would only do that for someone with more seniority (and skill). 

I could make a plea, with my manager, to relocate to England for six months to help my fiancé, which is only possible due to a majority of our workforce working from home for the foreseeable future. I doubt it will go anywhere, but I am going to speak to him, off the record, about the possibility and what hoops I would need to jump through if it is. 

I have read where people have entered the country and started job hunting that way. Still, I want to remain as legitimate in my immigration as possible to avoid any kind of fallout (such as preventing me from marrying my fiancé). I have looked through everything I could think of, and I am trying to think logically about my situation. 

There was some consideration about bringing my fiancé over to the US, but I’m terrified our whole healthcare system (mostly insurance) would kill him. Despite working for a multinational bank, the health insurance I have isn’t that great, and what would I do if I lost my job when he got here?  

I am trying to familiarize myself with UK KYC/AML and have been attempting to become more acquainted with Excel formulas. However, while my current job uses Excel, they are big fans of pivot tables and not much else. I am also working on a CV and will attempt to apply to companies in the UK. 

I may be S.O.L. right now, but I would not be able to forgive myself if I didn’t try exhausting every possibility. Thank you for any and all advice."

I'm a second year Cs student at an ivy league and I'm having a hard time finding an internship for this summer and honestly don't know what to do if I don't land one. 

I switched into Cs this November which was late for the recruiting season (starting August ish). I had my first interview in January but didn't really do leetcode problems before then and focused only on side projects because I literally had none. Now I have a decent amount of side projects including one using the MERN stack, a few simple iOS apps and more. I've been going harder on leetcode questions too. 

But for the past month, I literally cannot even land an interview. I've sent over 100 applications (I tracked it using huntr) and haven't heard back from any, other than ""sorry you're not a good fit"" 

Honestly I dont even know what to do. 
Should I still continue looking for an internship this summer? Isn't it too late? 
What can I do to actually land an interview when sending an application? 
If I can't do an internship this summer what should I do? 

This group is amazing and I would greatly appreciate a response. Thank you in advance!"

I know some of my intern classmates are currently teaching on a PIP or STSP, and I’m not exactly sure how those work. 

My main question is about the CSET, I’ve heard that you can’t get those permits if you’ve taken/started the CSET. So my question is if I get a district to hire me on one of those permits would I be able to take the CSET while I’m teaching...or would that disqualify me for the permit? 

I’ve tried to find the info online, but I haven’t been able to.

So this is part an airing of the grievances, part post-grad questioning, part help me out type post. Also, I've never created a post on Reddit before, so I may make a few faux-pas here and there. 

If there are any Structural Engineers out there, my field of choice is Design structural engineering in the buildings A&amp;E , that could respond, it would greatly be appreciated. To help you all out, I'll ask my questions, then give the background info.

Questions:

1) If you are looking to hire a structural engineer out of a Master's Program what courses/ knowledge base are looking for? Facade design over Masonry?etc. 

2) Is an Undergraduate degree enough? and if so, do you have a preferred University you hire out of?

3)  What was your career path after you got your first engineering position? did you go to management? PM'ing? etc

4) What is your engineering design background in (skyscrappers, facade, commercial, mixed?), and do you feel any area type of design is more challenging/fun that others?

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

So here's the juicy part, I'll introduce a bit (read a lot) of background, so you can kind of understand the direction of my questions. 

Originally I always wanted to be an architect; I love buildings, the angles, curves and materials are all very interesting to me. Unfortunately/fortunately I was not the best at art and drawing, and so I decided to be go down the path of engineering for undergrad and then get a masters in Architecture. Obviously, I ended up enjoying the engineering side of things, and am now getting  a masters of Engineering degree in Architectural Engineering with an emphasis in structural engineering. 

Then; I grew up in the Chicago land area, and the above all started in high school. I found a highly rated university, that was very cheap (graduated HS in 2011 economy=BAD). This university had an Architectural Engineering department, and checked off all the boxes for my personal adventures. snowboarding-check, hiking-check, far away from my parents-check. So without even visiting, I applied to the University of Wyoming(UW), one of the best choices of my life. 

At UW I did a lot of things and ended up taking a long time to graduate. I was a terrible student with mediocre grades at best until my 2nd to last year. Up until my 2nd to last year I wanted to be an Architect, I did all the architect things at a really high level, I did all the engineering things at a very low level. This came back to bite me in the A\*\* later, but I digress. In my 2nd to last year I took Structural Analysis 2, everything changed after I failed that class. The professor said something that just really changed my mind, the gist of which was he worked 70+ hour weeks like a boss and how I couldn't do in 70 hours what he did in 1 hour. Now, I am motivated in 2 ways, the first being self-motivation, but I have to want to do the thing. the second is out of spite, if you or anyone you've known is motivated out of spite, you know that they would literally go to hell and back just to be not wrong. 

So now, with this fresh motivation, I plow head first into my final 4 semesters of engineering class. Surprise surprise, I loved it and I still love it. I was devouring material, I had to basically re-learn everything from materials forward, and I did. I graduate, my professors are all dumbfounded. I pass the Civil FE, not the 'other' which is suppose to be easier.  I AM READY TO BE THE ENGINEER.

I move back to Chicago, and start looking for jobs, the year is now 2017. I don't find a job, I have, to date, applied to over 300 jobs postings. I get 3 interviews, I go in feeling like I'm going to crush it, Answer all the basic questions easily, build a rapport, everything you hope you do well in an interview I do. Then they all ask the question ""Why did you choose Wyoming? did you grow up out there?"", I Understand that they may not get a lot of applicants from Wyoming in Chicago, IL, I understand that they have no knowledge of schools other than the ones they went to. But, I think its safe to assume that I was taught all the same things at UW as you might get taught at Purdue or UofI. I had one guy ask me where Wyoming was... and he was from Illinois. So I feel like no matter what A huge blemish on my ability to land a job is the fact that I went to UW. 

Ended up working as a Project/Construction manager for a small custom home builder, just to be working and pay the bills no one tells you about. I AM MISERABLE! I love the work, being outside, physical type stuff, but I am basically working at the mental challenge level of do A then B then C. So, after about a year and a half of that, I apply to Graduate school, I take the GRE because my GPA never recovered, I am accepted into IIT in Chicago. I think great! ill finally land a job. I am currently ending my 1st semester there. I hit up the career fair immediately, Career resources, etc. overhaul my resume and other application items. I meet with all the big companies in Chicago, SOM, WJE, SGH, etc. I get the same response as I did when I was applying previous crickets, nada, not even a hey thanks applying but you suck. With the exception of Simpson, Gumpertz &amp; Heger, If your're reading this, the greatest moral boaster in the world is your rejection emails, I felt like someone took a minute to even look at me, Truly and Honestly THANK YOU! 

I did end up getting offered an internship with a company outside of Chicago in a field I don't know a lot about but I took it anyway!, but its been postponed indefinitely due to COVID-19. 

My final question is this, am I just inside my own head? are my previous academic choices holding me back? or is the field that competitive that a potential intern needs to really stand out?

&amp;#x200B;

After over 200 applications , 20+ interviews, and a lot of almost giving up, I GOT A OFFER WITH MY DREAM AEROSPACE COMPANY. Crazy thing is... I didn't even have to do a dumb ""code this"" technical interview. I get 60K starting off! with a bonus!! That's amazing starting off in the South. Crazy thing is someone who works there , while I was doing a internship, told me they wouldn't hire a black man straight out of college. I'm glad I kept trying. Shoutout to r/cscareerquestions for all the help in this process.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind support! It means a lot to me. Just to clear up a few things. I graduate with a Bachelors in CS in a few weeks so I'm not self taught. To address the lack of diversity in STEM, do your research. The data is out there, the accounts of what people go through are out there. Educate yourselves and fix the problem. Most of our jobs is googling so you can do it haha.

Edit 2 : Since people are asking, I'll go into a little bit of my background. I am graduating with a Bachelors in Computer Science W/ a minor in Mathematics in a few weeks. I have had a internship every summer of my undergrad which includes two summers at a really famous genomics institute and 1 at a REALLY famous space company. During my time at both companies and in undergrad, I built up a crazy professional network of people I could rely on for information and some for a recommendation. A awesome woman at said space company, recommended me to her friend on another team and I got the interview then the job. So what else did I do in terms of the crazy amount of interviews and applications? I did some Hackerrank, Leetcode, and messaging recruiters on LinkedIn which helped me get interviews. Polishing my LinkedIn helped me get way more traffic and I got a Google interview doing so. I also used organizations like NSBE &amp; ACM to help me get interviews at conferences or find resources. My resume also went through numerous changes over the span of my applying to jobs (August - Now). In terms of job sites, I used everything. LinkedIn, USAJobs, Handshake, Hired.com, Indeed, Seen, etc."

* Extracurriculars: 
   * Director for an entrepreneurship club on campus. Planned for 35 international students (out of 200+ applicants) to attend a weeklong conference/bootcamp on entrepreneurship including talks from VCs, unicorn founders, and professors. Oversaw a team of 25 club members to plan and coordinate the event. Raised revenue of $20k from ticketing fees from conference attendees.
   * CS Section Leader for CS106A/B which are the intro classes on campus. Also volunteered in teaching to non-Stanford students virtually through Code in Place (a class developed by professors from Stanford to help people learn during COVID-19)
* Undergrad school/major: Stanford CS
* Other education/coursework: Currently working on a 4-year MS + BS both in computer science (called coterm program on our campus)
* Race/nationality: Asian (Chinese)
* Sex: Male

**Stats**

* GMAT Score (include breakdown!): Have not taken yet, assuming I score above the median of applicants on the GMAT (SAT was 800M/800W/690CR for any reference)
* Undergrad GPA: 3.88 (will probably hover around 3.8 for both BS and MS by time of application)

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA: Get more practical experience related to the business world and burst out of my bubble as a purely technical CS dude. I want to create my own business one day and disrupt a deeply rooted industry with the technical help of CS, but also with the help of the practical experiences and network gained from attending B-school.

I really want to pursue a career in UX design or frontend development (so tech industry).

I currently have $5k in scholarships and I'm waiting for the results of other ones. If I work hard, get maximum OSAP and school bursaries, use COVID resources, apply for scholarships and aim to get internships or summer employment every year, I'm praying to graduate with a bachelors debt-free.

I know Canadian schools are mostly equal in quality of education. As someone who truly loves Canada, I am thankful for our healthcare, our government, and fellow Canadians.  I'll be able to work in Canada however I want, which is definitely a plus, and TN and other visas make it slightly better for us Canadians to intern in the US. However,

I don't know if it's because I'm infatuated with Columbia, but the schools I've applied to (Carleton, SFU, Sheridan College, Waterloo's Stratford campus) just don't seem like the right fit for me for a multitude of reasons. Current Canadian top choice is Carleton or Sheridan.

**If I go to the US:**

I know Ivy League can give full-ride to low-income internationals, but I'm under the School of General Studies for Columbia, which is only for non-traditional individuals who took at least a break in schooling. The $60k is for a very selective and prestigious scholarship. Upperclassmen I've talked to only get $10k-20k a year that's merit-based (!!), so I'm extremely grateful already. I'm waiting for a bunch of other big scholarships (around $25k each) that I really don't think I'll win.

NYC is absolutely an HCOL area (though Columbia housing is cheaper than Toronto rent, which is funny) and I have to deal with F-1 work restrictions, American kerfuffles, and being international.

If I go to the States, I'll be most likely $20k+ in debt and to avoid that, I'll have to hustle to get more scholarships. People think it's worth it for the Ivy League 'prestige', liberal arts curriculum, better work opportunities, and NYC being NYC (though I think that maybe because I've only gotten advice from ""Cali or bust"" people and Americans used to college debt). I absolutely love Columbia and New York in all aspects.

Also: With the COVID situation, I guess I'll be saving on housing for first-year because everything will be online, lol.

\----

Has anyone here gone to the States for their undergraduate (or even graduate) education and regretted it? Loved it? Should I just focus on studying debt-free and sticking it for 4 years if I don't like my school environment? Please be as blunt as possible; I need someone to slap some sense in me or just give any sound financial advice, thank you!!

**Edit:** Thanks for all the replies already! Just to clarify: I would like to go into UX and worst comes to worse, front-end as a back-up. The scholarship is **$60k per year, not for just first year.** I'm willing to study for 3-4 years in school because I have the time to right now (no career switch, work experience, etc) and I've been told aplenty that boot camps and self-learning aren't ideal with the influx of junior UX designers. I considered the US because of a very specific abusive situation. And uh, dunno if this helps, but the $25k (x4, so $100,000) scholarship I'm waiting around for is Adobe's UX scholarship. "

g82zdj,1,2020-04-25,USC vs WashU,nchopra55,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g82zdj/usc_vs_washu/,"I'm pre-law and will probably end up majoring in either economics or political science. I plan on living on the East Coast after I graduate, but I'm not set on that. I was accepted into the college of arts and sciences at both, but I am considering transferring into the business school.

**USC**

* Pros
   * I've heard the alumni network is fantastic.
   * I have a Presidential Scholarship which gives me half tuition- about 26k cheaper per year.
   * I get to stay in the McCarthy Dorms, which are supposed to be really nice
   * Things to do/opportunities in LA
   * I'm a big sports fan, and there is a great sports culture.
   * Weather
* Cons
   * I am not interested in Greek Life, and I have heard it is big on campus.
   * I have never really enjoyed LA
   * Higher living expenses in LA
   * Far from home (I live in OKC)
   * Much larger than Washu, worried about not getting classes.
   * In a neighborhood I've heard is sketchy (though I'd love to hear if anyone else has a different opinion)
   * The ""University of Spoiled Children"" moniker
   * Not really interested in the beach, surfing, etc.
   * Undergrad business not as prestigious

**WashU**

* Pros
   * Closer to home, but still different.
   * My twin brother is probably attending, which will be easier for my family.
   * Smaller, more intimate school.
   * Few classes taught by TAs, more interaction with professors
   * Generally more highly ranked.
   * I liked campus a lot when I visited.
   * Dorms/Food is top of the line.
   * Feel like I'll ""fit in"" a bit better.
   * Highly ranked undergrad business program, and I have heard it is relatively easy to transfer into it.
* Cons
   * Greek life is big on campus
   * Likely full price
   * May carry less cache than WashU if I end up in LA/west coast.
   * I've heard it is very pre-med focussed, wonder if there will be other pre-law kids.
   * Has some of the worst socio-economic diversity of any college.
   * St. Louis is not as exciting/harder to find internships and jobs.

Right now, I think I would prefer Washu, but USC giving me half off tuition is really making this a hard decision. I appreciate any insight anyone may have!

g849t3,12,2020-04-25,Help Me Choose a College,_TI84_,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g849t3/help_me_choose_a_college/,"Im tryna decide on a school so this post is pretty much making a list for myself. i dont expect too many of yll to read through all of it lmao...but jus read the first few lines and then comment what school yll think i should go to given the categories that I value.

Also, I am def undecided but I am considering a career in finance, comp sci, or medicine. I know that all of these are kinda unrelated (medicine is far away from the other two), but again, I'm indecisive asl.

Schools I am considering: **Berkeley, USC, Emory, UVA, Wash U, Michigan**

Categories that I will be considering: **Location, Grade Deflation/Inflation, Academic Flexibility, Pre-Med at the School, Business School, CS, Prestige, Student Life/Dorms/Food/Campus, Advising, Cost, ""gut feeling""**

**Location:**

|1. USC - weather + have lots of family in the area|
|:-|
|2. Berkeley - location in SF probably good for internships|
|3. UVA - only one driveable distance away, still a 5+ hour drive tho and in the south so ew|
|4. Emory - really like the city of Atlanta + direct flight from my local airport|
|5. UMich - kinda feel like it's in the middle of nowhere, I guess a plus is u can work on either coast?|
|6. WashU - I didn't even know where this was until i looked it up|

**Grade Delation/Inflation (important to me for grad school admissions):**

|1. UVA - surprisingly good avg. GPA|
|:-|
|2. Wash U - small private school..unsurprisingly has some inflation|
|3. Emory/USC/Mich - some say its hard to do well...other say its very manageable..idk tho|
|4. Berkeley - terrible, very difficult to do well from what I have heard|

**Academic Flexibility:**

|1/2/3) Mich/USC/UVA - very similar, seems manageable to switch into the engineering school if I need to...even tho I don't think I would do that|
|:-|
|4. Berkeley - everyone goes into L and S undecided, gotta take hard prereqs tho for some majors|
|5. Wash U - im sure its very flexible|
|6. Emory - im sure its very flexible, no engineering school tho|

**Pre-Med:**

|1. Wash U - far and away better than all other schools (76 percent matriculation rate)|
|:-|
|2. UMich - pre-med is very manageable at this school from what I have heard (60 percent matriculation), plus med school has great repuation|
|3. UVA - very similar to UMich, med school|
|4. Emory - surprisingly not as good as I thought it would, good med school tho + close to the CDC|
|5. USC - I have heard that pre-med is doable, but still very difficult with curved courses and not too much advising, they have a med school tho|
|6. Berkeley - terrible pre-med from what I have heard?, no advising or associated hospital close by,  lmk if yll know more about this and pm me|

**Business School/Econ/Finance:**

|1. Mich - 50% internal transfer rate into Ross, great reputation|
|:-|
|2. UVA - 55% transfer rate into the school of Commerce, ross just barely beats this on prestige tho|
|3. Berkeley - 33% transfer rate into Haas, i feel like a regular econ degree from Berkeley is pretty marketable to employers anyways tho|
|4. USC/Emory/Wash U - private business schools...all pretty reputable but not as good as my other options plus still difficult to transfer into business schools, USC probably edges out the other two|

**CS:**

|1. Berkeley - amazing CS, only downside is I would have to get above a 3.3 in prereqs to declare, which is hard cause i have lots of high-level math experience but very little CS experience + everyone at Berkeley declaring CS is def already very smart so it will be difficult to be in the top 50% of these courses |
|:-|
|2. USC - CS good just a step below berkeley, in California so lots of opportunities still|
|3. UMich - decent CS, only downside is I feel like location wise not really conducive to tech stuff|
|4. UVA - pretty much UMich but just a step below|
|5. Emory/WashU - not good CS|

**Overall Prestige:**

|1. Berkeley - much higher prestige than all other schools|
|:-|
|2/3) Emory/Wash U - smaller private schools that are kinda T20 level|
|4/5/6) UMich, UVA, USC - decent prestige especially within certain departments, but not really on the tier of the other schools|

**Student Life/Dorms/Food/Campus:**

|1. USC - honors housing (I think), the school looks fun asl, food decent, beautiful campus+SoCal weather|
|:-|
|3. UMich - very fun socially, dorms are alright, know some older kids there that could def help me out with planning and stuff, the downside is ann arbor|
|3. Berkeley - know lots of kids going, the biggest ethnic organization in the country for my demographic, SF looks amazing, dorms and food really shitty tho, the campus looks beautiful tho, |
|4. Wash U - dorms are AMAZING allegedly|
|5. Emory - idk too much jus seems like a typical college experience|
|6. UVA - some love the campus...idk tho plus tf is there to do in Charlottesville (no offense to anyone)|

**Advising:**

|1. Wash U - lots of advising|
|:-|
|2/3 - USC/Emory - good advising, private schools|
|4. Mich - lots of advising, good for public school, maybe even could be emory or USC caliber|
|5. UVA - step below mich|
|6. Berkeley - bad advising, a public school that kinda throws you out into the real world a few years earlier|

**Cost:** 

|1. USC - half-tuition so it is a lot cheaper than all other options|
|:-|
|2. Emory - 12k in scholarship money each year|
|3/4/5) Mich, UVA, Berkeley - paying out of state tuition for a big state school|
|6. Wash U - full expensive tuition, private school tho|

 **""gut feeling"":**

|1. Berkeley - always known about this school, after i got my acceptance letter on ivy day i was like if i don't get into any ivies imma go for sure (damn im really fulfilling the stereotype lmao), started researching it and idk but still feel like i could see myself there despite how badly it does in some of these categories|
|:-|
|2. USC - similar to Berkeley, plus half tuition|
|3/4) UMich, UVA - known about these schools, applied EA kinda more for match/safety reasons|
|5) Emory - idk what to say man, i guess i like ATL|
|6. Wash U - didnt even know this school existed i jus kinda applied|

If u made it through all that i love u, but anyways where do you think I should go to school?"

1. I have no idea if I qualify for first-gen because my mom got her degree in Vietnam and my dad got a 2 year degree from a local community college.
2. yes,,,,,i know i started doing extracurriculars late but i really thought i could save myself by going all out junior year. i am very lost and have no idea what to do now. my work ethic right now is crushed so i haven't been doing that much homework in my classes but i'll likely end this semester with a b in ap lang (bc fuck writing honestly) and all a's in the rest of my classes

Question 1:
I worked 8 months for an internship so I had $25k in total from 2018 and had 4 months of tuition to pay (I'm still in univeristy)

My older sibling was in grad school for probably 5-6 months in 2018 and didn't work at all/have no employment income in 2018. Her direct deposit amount was 10 times less than mine was which is confusing me, since I am the one who earned employment income so shouldn't I be getting less back in refund amount? Or does it have anything to do with the carryover tuition amount?

Question 2:

My sibling finished school in 2018, got laid off in 2019 after 2 months, so they were not in school or were working for pretty much all of 2019 (other than employment income from two months in 2019). Yet, their refund based on Simple Tax is way higher this year (compared to 2018), which might be due to the carryover tuition credit. Does this makes sense? Is there a way to not include the tuition credit refund amount or is that mandatory since she wasn't in school in 2019?"

The most complex program I have done is for my data structures class where we made a employee database off the console, it stores information about a employee and the store they work at using linked lists and stores in a binary tree.

But back to my  question, is it ok if a project has no UI? Like is console fine? Where you would enter in cin commands to use the program.

Do recruiters expect a project to be ok if in console, we use visual studio in classes, we have not gotten into having a GUI yet to make it fancy but I have a working knowledge of how the program for a employee database works, but it’s not fancy."

I go to a pretty standard state university, so I’m not expecting $100K out of college, maybe more like an optimistic $65K (I live in Texas). Patience and hard work are not an issue, I have no problem learning skill sets in my free time or having to get certain type of career experience to maximize my income. Consideration to cost of living should be included too - I know salaries are amazing in San Fran, but maybe Austin, TX might be better bc of similar salaries and lower cost of living?

I want to share an unpopular opinion about data science and need your suggestions.
The last three years I have seen students pursuing for Data Science (specifically Machine Learning) just because there is a craze for it in the industries. Even most of the freshers who need to focus more on their Data Structures and Algorithm skills go for Machine Learning just blindly following the herd. It's not like I don't want them to learn more but I want everyone at least to have the understanding about what it actually means to become a data scientist.
This huge crowd moving towards data science without going through the fundamentals first made me despise the student as well as the career. What I believe is that the students now regard the Computer Science course as a Data Science course instead. Being a Computer Science student I want to learn everything the course has to offer to us and not stick to a particular field, but anything related to data science was something I couldn't attach my mind to. Since there were so many topics to learn about in the field of Computer Science, I would ways prefer those which were not much related to Machine Learning or something.
Few months ago I was facing an interview for an internship where I was asked why I don't want to learn Machine Learning or Data Science. I answered with the reason same as above, to which they thought of me as someone who is trying to run away from the competition. Since then I want to learn more about data science not because I want to pursue a career in it but because I want to prove it's not the competition I am running from but the mindless students who are gonna be in the same track as me. What I believe is if I try to learn more about data science, I could become better than the average students who blindly follow the trend.
All I need is your help whether I should be learning more about data science first or proceed for various other options that are still unexplored on my part.
And if there's anything that I would have misjudged then please help me rectify it."

I got into UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, UCI, and CP SLO for electrical engineering but I don't know where to go. There are pros and cons to a lot of them, which is why I've been really confused about where to go for the past few months. Here's some of them

***UCLA***

Pros

* Great engineering program
* Great student life (love the athletics)
* Great food
* Cheap

Cons

* lol honestly it's because I need to take COMP SCI 32 and I don't remember anything from the COMP SCI 31 prerequisite equivalent that I took at my community college. My friend also carried me starting around the arrays chapter, so he literally carried me for 85% of the class lol. I'm scared that I'm going to get screwed over so :/. Not sure if its possible to retake that class at UCLA. 
* Kind of broad? Like USC and UCSD have specific course plans/routes that lets you specialize in a certain field.

***UCSD***

Pros

* Great engineering program
* Got into Sixth College and I heard everything is brand new since they moved it
* Have some friends that go there already
* Can enter specialized ""routes"" in their ECE program. For example, I can take specific classes for Electric Circuits and Systems or Computer Systems Design. 

Cons

* ""UC Socially Dead"" lol I kinda want a social life. Or rather, as much as I can get as an EE major.
* Heard its VERY theory heavy and that students shouldn't expect to actually be taught the material

***Cal Poly SLO***

Pros

* VERY good engineering program that employers like because of the learn by doing motto they have
* Because of this, there's a lot of internship and job opportunities so its fairly easy to secure a job right after graduation, which is really APPEALING
* Unfortunately...

Cons

* Compared to the UCs, it's more expensive lol. I'll need to pay an estimated $16k after financial aid is applied at SLO while at the UCs, I only need to pay an estimated $10k. So Cal Poly is $6k more than the UCs. I also saved up enough money to pay off at least 1 year at the UCs while still having some spending money for myself. Assuming I'm at the schools for 2 years, I'll need to pay an estimated total of $22k ($32k-10k) at CSUs and $10k ($20k-10k) at the UCs for two years. That's a lot so I'm not sure if I can afford that unless I take a lot of loans...
* This is the main thing holding me back from Cal Poly. My family is pretty poor and I don't really want to put a financial burden on my parents. 
* more than 50% of the school is white lol i want some diversity

***UCI and UCSB***

* I dunno, I mean I guess they're good but not \*as\* good as the schools I listed above?
* A pro is that student life is pretty good at both of these schools but that's it lol

So yeah, those are the pros and cons of the schools. I really don't know where to go. If anyone can help make my decision easier, that would be great.

Thank you!"

He has been my best friend for quite a while and we have helped each other quite a bit and have always tried to return each others favour.

Backstory:

Last year, my longtime gf broke up with me. And as I was quite close to her, it led to quite a rough period in my life. I started to feel very lonely and would end up crying and not doing anything for days. I needed someone to talk to and wasn't comfortable sharing it others. He consoled me during this phase and tried to talk to me on phone whenever possible. This happened for about a week to 10 days after which I was able to take control of my life.

Just after this, I figured out that he had a pending python project from college which was due in a week's time. And he hadn't started it at that point. He along with his project mates didn't have the basic understanding of python at that point. I spent the next 5-6 days working days and night on his project and somehow was able to finish it. I told him that it was the last time and I will always guide him but not complete his entire project.

Current Scenario:

He again wants me to do his project (web development) again. I have been trying to guide him to complete his project since the second week of March. I told him to learn python and other related technologies in the next 2 weeks and then go ahead with the project even if he had finished learning. Because I feel you can always learn will doing especially programming and you can never learn everything. I have been reminding him every week twice to work on the project and keeping in touch with what's going on. He delayed starting the project and to help him I designed (on abstract level, not code) how different parts of project would interact. Last week, he had barely started and I  reminded him that he needs to work on this without waste time. And he assured me that he would do it. But last week he spent on watching Game of thrones from start to finish. And now, he doesn't want my help rather he wants me to complete his project from scratch. At the same time, I am doing internship at a company and I am busy during the day and there is no guarantee that if I work on his project for the remaining time that I will be able to complete it. I feel like I am being used and he hasn't tried hard enough.

What should I do in this situation?
Thanks, in advance, for the help."

I recently received a call-back to return to work, and since then I've been uncomfortable with the thought of returning.  Part of it is having immunocompromised family that could be put at risk.  The far larger part I can't deny anymore.  I hate my job.  I hate the complete lack of direction, organization, or even goals beyond ""it gets done eventually.""  I hate the long commute, the 8 hours with 1 hour unpaid lunch, the lack of natural light in my office, the horrible sick time and vacation time policy (for what I'm told is industry standard anyhow), the almost nonexistent management and potential for promotion.  I hate that the work is completely without challenge or feeling like I'm improving my skills.  I hate the subject of the work being that it's completely uninteresting to me on every level.


For a bit of background, I am a recent college grad with a BS in CS, and applied for around 5-10 jobs before this one offered a position in software engineering.  Reviews on glassdoor had warnings about the lack of organization or movement up the ladder but I figured I would ignore it, work the job for a year or two, and build experience for a new one.  But I don't know if I can make it that long and the slow burn of realizing I could be stuck doing things like this for twice as long as I've been alive or more has been...demoralizing at the very least.  I love programming and problem solving but at this job I've been nothing more than a UI developer redesigning open source software to fit the needs of the end user.  All the heavy lifting is done by the hardware and libraries provided by the vendor and when I was working, most of my time was spent trying to find anything I could do to appear busy as there was precious little to be done in the first place.  I had taken an unpaid internship for 9 weeks as part of the curriculum to get my degree and that work felt miles more rewarding than what I do now.


Am I being unreasonable and entitled for thinking this way?  Is it normal to wake up to do something you don't enjoy to build a better life for yourself later on?  Is it too soon into a new job to feel this way?  I have thought of quitting and beginning my job search anew (and have already applied a few places though I doubt much will be happening these next few weeks) as the student loan freeze and interest removal until October has removed my financial burden for work.


I've been unable to sleep thinking about this and I could use any advice from anyone who's felt this way or seen someone feeling this way... thanks in advance."

I can choose IoT, data engineering, and mixed media, or just nothing and pick 3 electives on my own.

My question is: is it worth getting a specialization from the point of view of looking for a job ? Mixed media seems like a good thing to put on a cv, but some of the electives that get locked out are really useful. 

What I'm thinking of getting is: linear algebra, mixed reality (vr and ar in unity), and interactive design or computer learning.

Sorry if this has been asked a lot, but I couldn't find a clear answer for my situation.I live in an European country, and I'm thinking about apply for jobs in Silicon Valley for 2 reasons:

* I believe that working at a large tech company for a few years would look very good on my resume, and give me a lot of experience.
* I want to travel a bit. I don't want to spend all of my life in the same country, so why not apply abroad?

I'm still young (turning 21 this year), debt-free, a good amount of savings, I'm graduating soon (bachelor's degree) and I have a pretty good resume overall (multiple internships and personal projects).

I've often been told that my chances of getting hired at a large tech company (Apple/Google/MS) should be pretty good, so I want to give it a shot. What's the worse that can happen, right?

However, as an European, I don't know too much about Silicon Valley (or life in the US in general - I hear a lot of things from the TV and stuff, but I try to not listen too much because I believe it's heavily biased), but I think it's a challenging environment, and also very expensive to live there. I mean, I don't even know if I'd be able to reasonably rend a 1 bed apartment not too far from work with my salary ?

In short,  I guess my question is: Do you think it's worth it to work there for a while, or is working for large companies overhyped? Would I be able to live comfortably there in my current situation?

I am a soon-to-be CS new grad in May 2021 in Northeastern and I am kinda skeptical on getting a full-time web development position after I graduated even if I am willing to relocate and is not selective about salary but only for the experience due to my crappy internship and grade. So I have some backup plans and I wish to ask for any comments.

1. I currently accepted a QA intern at a financial company doing automation test in java TestNG. I also have a previous internship at another investment company doing small react work. I am currently learning react and spring boot now and I wonder if I can use what I learn now to ""superficial"" my experience a little bit? Ex: If I can somehow vaguely remember how the DB for the company was built, maybe I can learn and come up with a SQL database design and API for it and claimed that I build it for the company, I can look at developer code at my QA position and claim I assisted in building some of it. I know this is desperate lying and my hopelessness just not justify it........
2. I also will be interviewing at another company for an unpaid SDE intern job, but it is a startup hosted by several high school students....... I am kinda suspicious if it is really of any help to me
3. My GPA is around 3.0. I don't know if I should be doing a master degree in my current school can be an option, so i can delay my graduation and shoot for another co op/ internship. But I will not be getting any financial aid but loans (the cost is about 50k for 2 yr) and my family is not very good financially, my parent earn like 40K per year combined.
4. I have several personal project and a senior capstone web project in React, Go, MEAN stack, AWS ect, I will continue leetcoding and add to these project

Any comment or ideas on what path should I take now would be appreciated. Thanks"

g8fzfu,1,2020-04-26,RESP - change type of redemption,IOwnAndPwnU,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/g8fzfu/resp_change_type_of_redemption/,"My parents withdrew $10k from the family RESP account in March 2019 during my last year of school. I am now doing an internship (effectively being paid minimum wage), and had \~$30k in income in 2019. It looks like the RESP withdrawal was made as a total of $10k without designating a portion as educational assistance payment (EAP) and the remainder from the capital. Unfortunately, this has left me with a significant tax bill for the total $10k amount (yes, I do have tuition credits, but this is still an extra $10k in taxable money).

My understanding is that the capital is non-taxable as it was already taxed going into the RESP. The EAP, however, is taxable because this is the ""growth"" of the RESP (from grants and interest). If the $10k was divided between the capital and EAP, then I would only be taxed on the EAP component. However, it looks like the entire $10k was drawn as a net amount, and thus the whole $10k is being taxed per my T4A slip (and tax return). Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I am hoping to get this fixed. We have contacted our RESP agent but he said he cannot fix it. As such, I was planning on escalating it to the RESP firm and ask them to help address it. Potential solutions I was thinking of were:

(a) change $10k ""net"" amount to capital only (therefore no tax)

(b) change $10k ""net"" amount to combination of capital and EAP (therefore tax on EAP portion, which would be &lt;$10k)

(c) take the $10k back, i.e. undo the redemption (I have the funds to do this, and it would help my siblings more than me)

&amp;#x200B;

Appreciate any insights or other strategies to help reduce the tax bill, as I don't think the intention of RESPs was to be taxed. Unfortunately I wasn't around when the paperwork was being signed, but I would have expected that the RESP agent know that, a student in his last year of school that is starting a job, will be taxed on the amount - but this doesn't appear to have been the case."

I’m extremely grateful for the options, but a final choice is proving to be very hard. All three school will be full pay so the cost isn’t a matter Im taking into account 

I absolutely love NYUs location. Being completely immersed in the NYC experience is really unparalleled. Columbia’s is also great, but it’s farther apart from lower Manhattan. As for New Haven, it’s close enough to make weekend trips to NYC, but that doesn’t come close to living there.

I really like the prestige that comes from Yale and Columbia. My problem with Columbia is the core. If I could choose an ideal curriculum, it would like NYUs or Wharton’s where it is very finance specific. As for Yale, I think it’s a good balance of liberal art requirements along with the freedom to chart my own specialized course of study. I just think the core is a little too much in terms of restriction. 

My main question is in regard to career opportunities. Will I have better internship or networking opportunities at Yale as opposed to NYU. Right now, I’m leaning towards Yale, but I just can’t get over the NYC location. I absolutely love the NYC!

For reference, at Yale I would major in Econ and applied math (w/ stats &amp; data science concentration). At Columbia, I would either do financial economics at CC or try and transfer to SEAS (although I REALLY don’t like the engineering core) for IO (maybe financial engineering if I can’t get into to the concentration). At NYU, it would me business with a finance core concentration. For Yale, although I won’t be doing finance per se like at Columbia or NYU, the electives I can take would make for a curriculum which is quite close to finance. I would like to have a background in the quant side, but I definitely want to work in soft finance (IB, PE, HF, etc.) and ultimately try and get into the big-side as soon as possible.

At the time, I did not have the luxury of time to search for other positions to be able to negotiate the salary because they only gave me three weeks to decide. As the year progressed I interviewed in other places and managed to get another offer for 90k plus a small signing bonus. I want to use this offer to renegotiate my base salary for the first offer I accepted. Ideally, I would want them to match it.. I understand that this may not look well, but the 15k difference will significantly affect my quality of life. The reason I am still interested in the first offer is because of the project and tech stack I will be working with. The second company has an older tech stack with technologies I am not that interested in. My question is: should I even try to re-negotiate after accepting the offer? How bad will it look on me?

Is this a horrible plan / am I gonna die?

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously this is flexible but I roughed out a plan for my second bachelor's. My first was in a liberal arts major so I have to do basically all of the math and science pre-reqs. I've always worked in fairly intellectually demanding jobs, so I'm not afraid of hard mental labor. I just haven't done much with math, really.

I'm looking to move forward into HCI/HCC research after completion of the degree. I will be working part-time as a developer as well; currently have about a year of experience as a software engineer, two years of experience as a game designer. 

My thought is, I can apply for PhDs in Spring 2023 to start Fall 2023 and just continue the last semester of the Psych classes and try again while working/potentially continuing research the year after if I don't get admitted to schools I'm passionate about.

Does this look viable as far as difficulty of courseload? Am I going to want to die a lot at any point in this plan, extenuating circumstances aside? Any suggestions for moving stuff, psych electives, or anything else?

I was never allowed to go outside to engage in sports, except in my backyard. My parents never really invested in art, music or any type of lessons as they thought it was useless. I never got to hang out with my friends, unless they were from our own Bengali community. The only time I got to go outside was school or monitored by my parents, even then it was only grocery shopping trips or running errands.

This obviously made socializing and engaging in clubs super difficult as no one wouldn’t accept my excuse that my parents were just super authoritative. 

This is now big issue in high school, especially since I moved to America. In American high schools they really emphasize community involvement and this is super difficult if you’re not allowed to leave your house. 


But now with the pandemic shutting everything down and things moving towards online platforms, I can finally engage in community activities. I was able to received offers from a mayoral campaign, a political organization and a non profit to pursue remote internships! Instead of canvassing outside, I could just email and phone bank now. Instead of meetings in person, we can do online zoom chats. My friends are no longer  mad at me for not being able to hang out with outside of school! I can just FaceTime and text them and it’s perfectly fine. 

I thought the pandemic would be the worst thing that happened to me as I assumed I’d be more isolated than ever. But I was wrong. It has given me a valid and believable excuse for me to be housebound all day. I have gained more opportunities than I ever could have otherwise. 

I feel absolutely horrible to say I have benefited from COVID-19 :("

**Demographics**: East Asian Female, pretty competitive public IB magnet school on East Coast, upper middle class, income 150k+

**Hooks**: None

**Stats**: 1550 (770R, 780M), 800 SAT Math 2 and Bio-M, 4.0 UW, 4.73 W GPA, school doesn't do rank

**Coursework**: all IB/AP (except some mandatory art + PE electives)

* 9th: AP CSP, AP Gov
* 10th: AP Bio (self studied), AP Spanish, APUSH, AP CSA
* 11th (current): AP Phys C Mech and E&amp;M, AP Lit, AP Calc BC, AP Psych

All 5s, but this year probably one or two 4s.

**Intended Major(s)**: CS, Bioinformatics, something CS and Bio related idk but mainly CS, very slim chance of pre-med

**ECs**:

* Science Olympiad (3 years): our team consistently places top 3 at regionals and states (rip states 2020), I do bio related events (Disease Detectives, Protein Modeling, etc.)
* Independent Coding: I make websites/apps in my free time, learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and C# on my own, participate in hackathons, practice competitive programming
* Biology Club (3 years) - VP: teach members bio, compete in bio competitions (rip USABO)
* Dance Club (3 years) - Pres: teach members dance for performances inside and outside of school
* Chinese Folk Dance (12 years): won regional awards, nothing special
* Swim (12 years - Varsity (3 years), Club (8 years), Summer (10 years)): lettered all three years in HS, I quit club freshman year :/, our community summer swim league is big part of my summer, spend time practicing, competing, and volunteering (helping at meets, coaching pre-team)
* Volleyball (3 years): started playing bc of Haikyuu and I really liked it LOL, Varsity Coed (2 yrs), JV and Varsity girls (lettered one year)
* Computer Team (Freshman): had to quit bc of time conflicts :( idk if I should put it on the Common App
* Remote internship @ NASA this summer to develop software!!!!
* Math Honor Society, Science Honor Society 

**Awards**: USACO Silver (trying to get gold idk), placed 1st at SciOly States in my event + multiple awards in regional and invitational tournaments, National Spanish Exam Level 4 Bronze, AP Scholar

**College Preferences**

*Financial:* Merit scholarships,, My family can afford private schools but it'd be a strain :/. 

*Size:* I'm fine with anything, except I would prefer to not have to fight over resources in a large class size because I'm not the strongest CS applicant (if I have to I will though, just would rather not). 

*Location:* Not in the middle of the city like NYU or in the middle of nowhere, but it can be isolated if it's close to a city. 

*Geography/Weather:* Fine with anything as long as it's not cold all the time.  

*vIbEs:* School spirit would be great! A work hard play hard atmosphere, just not too wild on the play side. I'm not planning on joining a sorority so it'd be nice if Greek life wasn't a huge presence. I prefer a collaborative environment where everyone isn't super competitive/trying to step over each other. Also if it has good food that is a BIG plus. 

I feel like I have a lot more bio related ECs and my CS ECs are pretty weak, but I want to do CS, so I honestly don't know what to do. Any thoughts? Also, are there any top CS schools that wouldn't fit my criteria (except financials bc ik I probably won't be getting any)? Would there be any LACs good for CS that would match? My safeties are UMD (in-state) and Purdue rn. Two matches I have in mind are UCSD and Northeastern. Would you recommend I try shotgunning for T20s? What other targets/matches are a good fit? I know prestige isn't everything for CS, so I'd love to find more schools that would fit me. Thanks!"

Yes, I did pay rent to live away from home during an internship I had in a different city. However, it wasn't specifically a student home. It was a house I found on kijiji that was renting rooms out to students. So technically, it was a student resident, but it was a family that was renting out rooms to students. Do I still include it and the family's address under ""rent paid for principal residence"" for the four months?

If yes, does it count as 1) Total rent paid for your principal residence or 2) student residence?

EDIT: based on the definition of principal residence, ""A principal residence is a housing unit in Ontario that you usually occupy during the year. For example, it can be a house, apartment, condominium, hotel or motel room, mobile home, or rooming house."" therefore, since i lived away and paid rent, it counts as rent paid for principal residence?

EDIT2: on simpletax, it asks: ""Total property tax paid for your principal residence"" but everytime, even in the past, when I've had to move and rent, the contract never had property tax amount written on it. The contract I have doesn't include it either. Do I leave it blank?"

I know that Yale has the best prestige overall but may not have the best Computer Science program. The financial aid includes no federal loans and are asking me to pay 12k a year. NYU has a strong Computer Science program but I would need work study and federal loans, and would still need to pay 17k a year. Northeastern has another strong Computer Science program but is a little more lacking in overall prestige. After federal loans and work study, I have to pay 14k a year. Stony Brook is the honors program, but I don't know how the CS program stacks up with those two. Their FA is very similar to Northeastern's. They are all in the Northeast, so it's not the biggest problem. Campuses are also not the biggest issue.

What would provide me with the most opportunities for extracurriculars, internships, and future jobs? How would you rank the CS programs of these four schools? Which would be the hardest in terms of academics and social life? 

Thanks for any suggestions!

g8mrbk,0,2020-04-26,Profile Review— considering early MBA programs!!,plainbread11,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/g8mrbk/profile_review_considering_early_mba_programs/,"Hi all! I am a current Junior but like to plan ahead for my future a lot. I recently found out about early/deferred MBA programs like HBS 2+2 etc. and wanted to ask about my chances at the programs I’ve taken a look at thus far. 

Currently looking at: HBS 2+2, Chicago Booth, MIT Sloan, UVA Darden, Emory Goizueta (current undergrad here), Yale silver scholars, Stanford GBS, Columbia Deferred Admission

Background:
-Asian Indian/M/Not a first gen


Academics
-I have a 3.5-3.6 GPA at Emory GBS
- I’m majoring in marketing and finance 

Extracurriculars
- I was one of the top 5 teams for a case competition to present a marketing strategy to SurveyMonkey’s CMO, sales directors, etc. 
- I am on the executive board for a non-profit club on campus to help empower women in developing countries through education 
- I am an equity research analyst for a college investment group 
- Other stuff: participate in feminist/social activism on campus and in the community, I wrote some articles for the campus political review, etc. 

Work experience: (chronological order)
- Sophomore Fall: needed work experience so I interned as a business development/strategy analyst for an e-commerce fashion startup. Not sure if I’ll put this on the resume. 

- Sophomore Summer: interviewed and landed a position as the sole corporate Development summer analyst at Johnson &amp; Johnson, aiding in inorganic/M&amp;A initiatives for consumer healthcare. Specifically helped on some divestiture projects and also introduced a potential acquisition in the digital therapeutics space to the team (last part is relevant). 

- Junior Fall: Interned at a small private equity shop to just improve my own finance knowledge and modeling skills. probably my least relevant experience to my overall story and I’ll leave it off the resume. 

- Junior Spring (right now): remotely working as a product management intern for two tech startups. Teaching myself python as well. 

- Junior Summer: as of now, I’m supposed to be interning at Abbott Nutrition working in sales strategy &amp; analytics. Hope it doesn’t get cancelled (it just got shortened to 9 weeks). 

Scores: 
I am planning to take the GMAT. I took a diagnostic test and scored a 640, hoping to improve to maybe 710.

Essays: 
I am a good writer. I am sure I can write any essays well, and make sure that my passion comes through. 

Why an MBA now: feel like this is the key question because I’m applying to deferred programs as an undergrad. From my internship at J&amp;J, I realized that healthcare is the next big industry to face significant disruption over the next few decades— it is actually already underway. Specifically, I believe business will lead the way in leveraging technology to deliver healthcare insights for patients and general consumers as well. I have started preparing for such a disruption by educating myself on more technical aspects through product management work while simultaneously continuing to work in consumer healthcare. An MBA, especially when concentrating in something like healthcare management/consulting, would help round out my undergraduate business education and work experience by giving me a specific, tailored skillset to confront modern day healthcare problems and position me as a leader capable of tackling these issues. For me, it’s a matter of facing a significant industry change— and I need to be there right now. Goals post MBA would be to either guide corporate strategy in digital health ventures or start my own digital health company. 

****

Anyway, would love to hear what people on r/MBA have to say about my profile, things to improve, etc."

I'd like some targets/fits!

**Demographics**: East Asian Female, pretty competitive public IB magnet school on East Coast, upper middle class, income 150k+

**Hooks**: None

**Stats**: 1550 (770R, 780M), 800 SAT Math 2 and Bio-M, 4.0 UW, 4.73 W GPA, school doesn't do rank

**Coursework**: all IB/AP (except some mandatory art + PE electives)

* 9th: AP CSP, AP Gov
* 10th: AP Bio (self studied), AP Spanish, APUSH, AP CSA
* 11th (current): AP Phys C Mech and E&amp;M, AP Lit, AP Calc BC, AP Psych

All 5s, but this year probably one or two 4s.

**Intended Major(s)**: CS, Bioinformatics, something CS and Bio related idk but mainly CS, very slim chance of pre-med

**ECs**:

* Science Olympiad (3 years): our team consistently places top 3 at regionals and states (rip states 2020), I do bio related events (Disease Detectives, Protein Modeling, etc.)
* Independent Coding: I make websites/apps in my free time, learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and C# on my own, participate in hackathons, practice competitive programming
* Remote internship @ NASA this summer to develop software!!!!
* Biology Club (3 years) - VP: teach members bio, compete in bio competitions (rip USABO)
* Dance Club (3 years) - Pres: teach members dance for performances inside and outside of school
* Chinese Folk Dance (12 years): won regional awards, nothing special
* Swim (12 years - Varsity (3 years), Club (8 years), Summer (10 years)): lettered all three years in HS, I quit club freshman year :/, our community summer swim league is big part of my summer, spend time practicing, competing, and volunteering (helping at meets, coaching pre-team)
* Volleyball (3 years): started playing bc of Haikyuu and I really liked it LOL, Varsity Coed (2 yrs), JV and Varsity girls (lettered one year)
* Computer Team (Freshman): had to quit bc of time conflicts :( idk if I should put it on the Common App
* Math Honor Society, Science Honor Society

**Awards**: USACO Silver (trying to get gold idk), placed 1st at SciOly States in my event + multiple awards in regional and invitational tournaments, National Spanish Exam Level 4 Bronze, AP Scholar

**College Preferences**

*Financial:* Merit scholarships,, It doesn't matter too much as my family can afford private schools but it'd be a strain :/.

*Size:* I'm fine with anything, except I would prefer to not have to fight over resources in a large class size because I'm not the strongest CS applicant (if I have to I will though, just would rather not).

*Location:* Not in the middle of the city like NYU or in the middle of nowhere, but it can be isolated if it's close to a city.

*Geography/Weather:* Fine with anything as long as it's not cold all the time.

*vIbEs:* School spirit would be great! A work hard play hard atmosphere, just not too wild on the play side. I'm not planning on joining a sorority so it'd be nice if Greek life wasn't a huge presence. I prefer a collaborative environment where everyone isn't super competitive/trying to step over each other. Also if it has good food that is a BIG plus.

I feel like I have a lot more bio related ECs and my CS ECs are pretty weak, but I want to do CS, so I honestly don't know what to do. Any thoughts? Also, are there any top CS schools that wouldn't fit my criteria (except financials bc ik I probably won't be getting any)? Would there be any LACs good for CS that would match? My safeties are UMD (in-state) and Purdue rn. Two matches I have in mind are UCSD and Northeastern. Would you recommend I try shotgunning for T20s? What other targets/matches are a good fit? I know prestige isn't everything for CS, so I'd love to find more schools that would fit me. Thanks!"

I plan to use my EEE degree for the biomedical device field and I want to choose the school with the best academic rigor, internship opportunities, research, and most respected engineering program.

I basically got a full ride to UCI with my Fin Aid + Scholarships-- UCSD I have to take out loans each year &lt;$10,000. Is UCSD worth the loans? What kind of internships do UCSD Engineering students get? What jobs are available once graduated?

UCSD

**Pros**:

* Rankings/Prestige (US News)  

   * Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs Ranking: 20 (tied)
   * 2021 Best Engineering Schools (graduate) ranking: 9
   * Best Undergraduate Computer Engineering Programs: not ranked
   * Very research focused
* Personal/Social  

   * Within California
   * Warm Weather (good vibes)
   * Very Beautiful Campus
* Academics/College  

   * Strong engineering program and I got into a capped major  

      * This means I have priority enrollment in classes &amp; it's easier for me to switch majors
   * Good array of student orgs &amp; project teams
   * HAS A F\*N SUPERCOMPUTER
   * Known for their research in various areas
* Career/Recruitment  

   * Heavy recruitment from near SD area
   * Not a lot of recruitment from bay area/silicon valley

**Cons:**

* Stigma for being socially dead - though has been refuted by some students
* Nothing to really do at UCSD: not a college town and lacks culture

UCI

**Pros:**

* UC, research focused
* Full ride
* I know Dean of Engineering and a lot of the faculty and administrative staff since I am in a bridge program
* Would get resources first since I know the top people
* I know the area, I have been going to school Irvine for 8 years
* Ranked #39 for best Engineering Schools
* Graduates seem to make more after 20 years than UCSD students

**Cons:**

* Not as prestigious
* Ranked lower in every way (Does that mean anything?)
* Campus is kind of dry and boring
* Not really a well known school outside of California, doesn't have any big research projects I feel that are really known"

I have taken the basic courses regarding it like computer architecture and intro to embedded systems etc. I wish to learn more about the field and eventually pursue a career in it. I’m currently facing a few challenges doing so. First, there are not a lot embedded systems jobs/internships in hk, it not being a tech hub(like the valley or something similar). How should I find internships elsewhere (also where places and companies)? Second, I’m not sure if I should go for a masters degree after graduating, If you say I should then, are there special programs for embedded systems, or any universities that are specifically good for this field? Also, I wanted some idea on how well are you compensated at these jobs compared to mainstream big tech software development roles?

**Solar printer** \- This device uses concentrated sunlight to etch design patterns into wood. Although the print functionality is largely driven by Gcode, it tracks the sun via 4 photoresistors nested in the corner of a shadow caster (not pictured), which then provides instructions to stepper motors to move the printer's rotation and tilt accordingly.

**Programmable space heater** \- I lived in a camper and wanted to more efficiently use my space-heater. So using an LCD display, an IR remote, a thermistor, and a servo motor hot-glued to a space heater, I replicated your basic thermostat to be able to set 4 periods throughout the day (wake, leave, return, sleep) and their respective temperatures on-the-fly with the IR remote.  [https://github.com/JoshRuchty/Project-Spartan](https://github.com/JoshRuchty/Project-Spartan) 

**RFID keyless entry** \- A servo mounted to a deadbolt allowed me to enter/exit my camper without retrieving my keys (I used an RFID sticker on my phone). Used a MOSFET to cut power to the servo except when being repositioned so I could still use a key to override the system if it failed. Other versions of this project utilized bluetooth access.

He's applied to all sorts of jobs since graduating, and even went back to community college to take web development courses.

Well the advance classes keep getting cancelled due to low enrollment so he cannot finish anytime soon. So at this point he doesn't have enough deep skills to call himself a developer and he's still not considered for any paid roles as an animator. With the pandemic going on, it'll be even more difficult to get a job and we just don't have the funds for him to go back to university again.

g8tgvw,3,2020-04-27,TO THE CAPRICIOUS FOOLS AT SPOTIFY,DudeWheresMyCare,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/g8tgvw/to_the_capricious_fools_at_spotify/,"WHY. Why in the ever loving fck did you replace the “add to playlist” button with “hide this song”. 

This is the FIRST BUTTON. If we are going by what will be used more often I’d wager far more people are looking to ADD songs to their playlists (because that is the main feature of Spotify after all.... PLAYLISTS) not HIDING SONGS. If I wanted to hide a song I would simply SKIP IT or DELETE IT. 

Thanks to this revolutionary sack of shit update I have now successfully hidden nearly ever new song I come across while TRYING to add them to a PLAYLIST. DAMN YOU. I can’t help but fantasize about Apple Music now even though I was more than content with your platform prior to this technical disgrace. I have fluctuated between being immensely pissed off to almost succumbing to embodying a fully raged Karen and writing strongly worded emails to some scraggly intern at your company. 

Spotify is one of the only good things left in this desolate pandemic world and you have all but ruined it."

Back in January, I applied to over 200 companies and failed about 5 coding challenges and didn't get a single interview. I was frustrated and really hoped I could find a company that doesn't have coding challenges in their interview process.

I was able to get a phone interview with Accenture and was able to get to the final round interview but declined the offer since it was a starting date where I couldn't start since it was out of state and I am in college. (It was supposed to start In April, but I still had classes then)

In February, I met the CTO of a startup in LA and I didn't get an interview at all but we just talked about tech in general and I asked if he was looking for any interns. Fast forward a few weeks, we went to meet up over some coffee and talk a bit more about the company, and he said he would get me an internship with the company. This really relieved me since I'm terrible with data structures &amp; algorithms and can't leetcode so it made me happy that he would've taken me in without any coding interview.

Then in March, Coronavirus happened, and alot of internships were canceled. I emailed the CTO and he reassured me that my internship was still happening, but 3 weeks ago he emailed me saying I should have my offer letter soon by someone in HR in 2 weeks. Since its already the 3rd week I decided to email him about 3 times in the past week asking for an update (I know, really impatient). 

He's been reading my emails but hasn't responded at all (I use a tracker to see when emails are open) so I'm assuming the internship is canceled.

Also, one of my aunts who knows alot of people in the industry was supposed to help me find an internship in January because I helped her find a cheap car (everyone in the family goes to me for car advice) and for the past 4 months she just keeps saying she's busy. 

It frustrates me because my mom protects her saying she's busy when it's like I'm also busy... I'm a student taking Calc 3, Discrete Math, and Computer Architecture (very low level class), and I have straight A's because I spend all my free time either studying or trying to learn how to develop something. And so I broke down and started crying tonight since my aunt asked me for help loading some stuff into her car when she still hasn't helped me at all  and when I asked her if she knew of any companies looking for software interns she just said nah no one's hiring right now... And it feels so unfair to help her when she won't help me.


I don't know what to do and I'm literally crying because I feel like my whole world is crashing down on me, I'm not the best student in the past, I have a 2.9 gpa at my local community college, and I don't have any relevant experience in the field. But this semester I really turned around and have straight A's in the hardest classes I've ever taken and worked really hard, but feel like it's getting me no where and I just feel like crap and want to give up. 

Tldr; cried over canceled internship don't know what to do, feeling like dropping out and giving up on becoming a software engineer because I can't even get any interviews and the one shot I had at one got taken away"
g8uudh,0,2020-04-27,Whether or not to take a pass/fail grade vs letter grade,JohnsonJohnston,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/g8uudh/whether_or_not_to_take_a_passfail_grade_vs_letter/,"I am currently stuck in a dilemma with regards to whether or not I should be opting to take certain courses pass fail or whether I should take the letter grade.

Right now, my GPA is about a 3.7 if you round up. Although my life has been turbulent since the COVID pandemic began, I have been trying with everything I have to keep my grades high. At the end of the semester, I predict some A's and some AB's (equivalent of A-/B+ mix).  

I have the option to choose whether or not I take a course pass fail after my letter grade is released, and if I take a ""pass"" grade, my GPA is not affected by that course.

Now, an AB would theoretically lower my GPA, swaying it towards 3.5 as that is how much an AB contributes. If I get an AB, should I choose to take it and lower my GPA? 

Pro's to taking the grade:
* A Pass could be anything from a C up, an AB is an AB showcasing my efforts
* Provides stability against GPA fluctuations in future, ""anchoring"" GPA at 3.5
* 3.50 is not a bad GPA to be weighted towards, even if lowered
* Not taking a course pass/fail makes me eligible for the Dean's List  

Pro's to taking the Pass grade:
* Maintains high GPA, especially important for finding junior year internship

For what it is worth, I am currently a sophomore and hope to go right into industry after graduation. I do not see myself likely to pursue gradschool. Something to consider is also the relevance of the course to my major. I will of course take any A's I can, but an AB in Physics is not the same as an AB in my Computer Science course, with regards to relevance anyways. Should my calculus differ with regards to the relevance of the course?

There is a lot to consider, but I guess it comes down to: which is more important, marginal GPA differences or transcript completeness. I am sure other students are in similar positions, so I'm wondering what you all are doing and have been thinking."

Is this a thing in software engineering? If so, is it common? Are these kinds of internships more competitive than full-time summer internships?

I ask because I'm trying to decide where to go to college. Option A is in a big tech hub while Option B is in a small city with limited software engineering opportunities. If this is a possibility, it will be a significant factor in my decision.

g8vlna,4,2020-04-27,Resume Building Under Quarantine?,AhhhYasComrade,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/g8vlna/resume_building_under_quarantine/,"Hey guys, freshly accepted CE student here. Today I heard that the summer job that I had lined up at a summer camp has probably been axed by COVID-19. Although I'm a little annoyed because I'd have loved the job, it would admittedly have added nothing new to my resume. I'm hoping to try and take it as a sign and move towards doing something that will actually strengthen my co-op opportunities in the coming year. My question is though: what's the best way to go about doing this? A couple of my notable points:

- Decently advanced C++ experience
- Passable Python knowledge
- Summer volunteering over the past two years
- Slight leadership experience

My weakest area is that I have not held a job in the traditional sense. If I were trying to work my butt off to make sure I land a co-op position, what kind of job should I be looking for? I could get work at a grocery store pretty easily. I know they say that some work experience is better then none, but is that ""good enough""? Should I try and find a more targeted job or a more formal summer student internship?

People talk a lot about side projects as well. What kinds of things are you guys doing? Open source contributions? Are you leading your own projects? Is it worth my time looking into for a first term coop placement? 

C++ is certainly my language of choice since that's what I've been taking classes in at school. Should I be trying to brush up on Python? I've heard finding C++ positions can be challenging. Are there any certifications I can chase?

If any of these questions are redundant or there's somewhere else you can point me to, that I haven't seen then please let me know. Thanks!"

I'm currently taking an Intro to Java Programming course and will be taking *Discrete Structures and Modern Techniques* in the Summer. In the fall semester I'll be taking *Data Structures and Architecture*. 

My questions are: 

1. What should I have learned and what skills do I need to acquire in order to apply for an internship? 
2. What languages should I learn? 
3. And ultimately how do I know when I'm ready for an internship? 

So far in my intro to Java course we've covered loops, methods, arrays, dealt with input/output files, String methods, and other basics. I want to intern before I graduate in May of 2022.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, many thanks in advance!

g8y99f,2,2020-04-27,i don't know what to do about my parents.,bethnalandgreen,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g8y99f/i_dont_know_what_to_do_about_my_parents/,"I am an 18 year old girl who is currently living with my parents due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout my whole life I've felt neglected by my parents, but whenever I bring it up, my parents would (mostly my mom) compare my life to hers when she was a child in Vietnam. I'm aware of the struggles my parents faced, but I cannot accept that I should live like her when she came to the US for a better life... bare with me as this is probably going to be a really long post because there is a lot I need to let out...

Growing up my mom worked out of state so I didn't really interact with her until I was like 11. Because my dad primarily raised me I wasn't really girly or anything and I wasn't really told to act ""lady like"" which really angered my mom. I wasn't like a tomboy or anything, I just didn't particularly care to dress up nice or make my hair super cute when I was young, yknow? My mom moved back in with us once I got into middle school and she basically changed everything in my household. She constantly disciplined me when I did anything she disapproved of and would also get mad at my dad if he ever was against her punishments. For example, sometimes my Vietnamese is a bit more ""casual"" because I would say things in Viet the same way I would say them in English if that makes sense... It would make sense to me because i just thought up my sentences the same way I would if I were to say it in English, but my mom would accuse me of being disrespectful when it genuinely wasn't my intention. My dad would tell my mom that I'm speaking Viet in a way that I understand and she would yell at him for spoiling me and taking my side.. it's gotten to a point that he would stay out of my mom and I's fights because he doesn't want to be yelled at either. Middle school was one of the worst periods of my life... my mom would always comment on my appearance, how I had ugly hair, and how I've gained weight. Looking back I wasn't overweight at all, in fact I was actually pretty skinny just not skinny enough I guess.. her comments and my lack of self confidence caused me to deal with anorexia at a really young age, and I still deal with it today... It just always felt like my mom would like me more if I were prettier or something. My dad noticed that I became way too skinny but he didn't really do anything about it. What makes me mad nowadays is that my parents knew I wasn't eating and they didn't do anything about it.. it's one of the few things that makes me angry at my father who, usually, actually treats me like a person. My mom confronted me with the fact that I was purposely throwing away food, but she didn't punish me or anything. There were times where my mom encouraged me to stop eating too because she felt like I wasn't skinny enough. When I was in high school many of my friends became aware of my ED, and they took care of me more than my parents did to be honest. My friends would buy me food, pay for my lunch at school when I was unable to, and one of my closest friend would bring me meals from her home. There were also times where my parents would take care of my dog more than me. I'm aware that dogs need care and what not, but my parents would cook meat for my dog and then forget to make something for me.. sometimes they don't even leave things for me to use to possibly make a meal.... I know this sounds a bit privileged but sometimes i just want to come home from school and have something to eat..

Somehow high school made everything worse.. I was in as many AP classes and I could handle, but there were some semesters were my grades were lower. They weren't even bad like I had 3 A's and 3 B's, but my mom literally made me feel like I was a fucking failure in life. I was apart of clubs, I was in a sport, I had an internship at Boeing, I worked two jobs, and maintained a (weighted lol) 4.0 gpa but my mom was still so disappointed. She would always bring up how her coworkers daughter was valedictorian and there was no way I could compete with that... I may have not been the smartest kid at my school, but I definitely wasn't doing bad. What makes me mad is that the time where my grades slipped is when my mom was sick after dealing with uterine fibrosis... I would take my time to take care of her and sometimes I would forget about my school work. I know this is my fault, but she made me feel like I had bad grades because I didn't care or because I was stupid.. but that literally wasn't the case. Throughout my life my parents drank a lot, not like alcoholics but every weekend they drink as a way to relieve stress. Sometimes my mom would get really drunk and start yelling at me. It got progressively worse during senior year because it was the first time she ever hit me (she slapped me). I've always gotten into spats with my mom and at a certain point I would get over it... but her hitting me drove me to my breaking point. I ended up running away that night because I couldn't take it anymore. I came home the next day because I love my dad a lot and when he called me I could feel the pain in his voice, but sometimes I feel like I should've never gone back. My mom always tip toes around apologies and would act like she feels bad but I know she doesn't. She would buy me things or make me my favorite food as if that would be enough to make me feel better about things... Towards the end of senior year there was one event that really hurt me. One of my mom's friends came over and he got drunk with my parents. Towards the end of the night my mom started talking shit about me, how I'm stupid, how I'm fat, how I'm useless... and he agreed to all of it. I barely know this man. He started cursing me out because I didn't say hi to him nicely, and because I got scared of him. (my parents and I shared a room up until this point and he was in our bathroom.. I wasn't expecting him to be in there so I became startled but it wasn't anything malicious I quite literally just did not expect him there). He made my dad shit talk me.. and despite all the things my dad has done to me before.. I know it was because of my mom's influence... my dad used to stand up for me. He used to be proud of me, but my mom made him fear confrontation, so he would just step aside when she yelled at me. It's gotten to a point where he tells me not to provoke her because he's too ""tired"" of getting involved when I literally don't do anything... This man literally has the audacity to come into my home and then shit talk me when he doesn't even know me... and he turned my dad against me too. This situation caused me to run away again, but my grandma came out and begged me to stay. I haven't included my grandma that much in this story, but she has always been the only one who cared about me despite my flaws... She was moving back to Vietnam this year so she begged me to stay so I could be with her for her last few months.. My parents promised to change after this, but of course they never did. My mom would keep up this charade for a couple of weeks and then find some reason to yell at me again. 

Fast forward to college (sorry that this post is all over the place) and for the most part things are fine.. Now that I've felt a sense of freedom from my parents I realized how toxic it was for me at home. It was one of the few times where I felt super free and happy. My mom would always call me though, asking if I went to the gym (lol) and always reminding me that I need good grades so I can take care of her when she's old. I want to take of my parents I really do, but I don't want to live with them anymore.. I want to be able to move in with my husband and live my life without them under the same roof as me, but my mom doesn't want that. Any money I make in the future, she expects me to share with her and my dad... and I would want to if they had taken care of me in the same way. Never in my life have I felt super cared for by my mom and now I have this huge burden on me where I'm expected to take care of her for the rest of my life.. I constantly get anxiety because living in CA is so expensive and I don't know if I can care for her in the way she wants me to (she wants me to get a huge house, give her an allowance, pay for her vacations, etc.) Sadly because of the COVID-19 pandemic I had to come home and live with them again for the last month and it's easily been one of the worst months of my life. Not more than a week in my mom is screaming at me for being useless... this time I recorded it though and sent it to my friends who were begging me to call the police but I was afraid to. She kept saying she would kill herself and I didn't know what to do. She wasn't saying it in like a sad or melancholic way.. she was like screaming at me that she would kill herself because she didn't want to see me anymore... a few days later she would scream at me for how I do certain chores around the house.. but then also yell at me for not doing chores at all.. she would say I spend my time doing nothing when I'm still doing online school atm so I stay in my room almost all day watching lectures.. but she thinks I'm just wasting away. On top of all this.. she constantly invites the man that I mentioned earlier to drink with my parents. This man makes me extremely uncomfortable.. and after what happened with him and my parents I have said so many times that I don't want him here anymore. his influences on my parents disgust me and I hate that I have to be nice to him while he's here despite how rude he was to me without even knowing me.. he was here tonight (which is why I'm writing this.) Whenever he is here he eats all of our food.. he leaves our bathroom all messy, and he genuinely just has no respect for my home. My parent's don't care though, and they make me feel bad for feeling uncomfortable....

I'm sorry that I wrote so much and probably a lot of what I wrote is super messy and poorly written (its 3 am sorry) but I needed to write it all.... I don't know what to do with my parents anymore like if I try to talk to them my mom would just make me feel bad... like if I say you're being rude she would be like ""my dad used to hit me.. you're spoiled"" and it totally diminishes how I feel.. I just... I really need advice on how to deal with all of this because I feel so overwhelmed with everything.. especially during this pandemic where I'm literally trapped in my small apartment with my mother.... there is no week where she doesn't yell at me for something as small as ""slamming the door"".. please give me advice"

Hello everyone,

So, I’ve been thinking about writing something like this for a long time. I’ve hesitated a lot because, well, it does feel weird to ask for advice on the Internet. Also because I’m not even sure if I’m asking for career advice, advice on mental health or a bit of both. But I’m getting desperate, so here it goes

In 2018, at 27, I obtained a MSc in a STEM field. Between 2016 and 2018 I did an internship in a research lab at the same University where I obtained this degree. This two-year long internship was a requirement for obtaining said MSc degree, and I acquired a lot of interesting skills thanks to this first experience. Unfortunately, during this time my mental health also declined terribly. It was mainly for this reason that I decided not to pursue a PhD – well, for this and also because I didn’t see the point in sacrificing three to four years of my life to end up with a title that doesn’t necessarily improves my chances of landing a job. On the contrary, most young PhD in my field are chronically unemployed, and only the luckier ones are sometimes able to land post-docs which are unstable and low paying by nature. Anyway, after getting my degree in 2018 I moved to another country for personal reasons. I immediately started looking for a job in my field but would always run into the same problem: too qualified to work as a lab technician (which would be my preferred choice); not qualified/experienced enough to work as a researcher. 

After a full year of looking for a job I decided to go back to school to obtain a second MSc degree in a more applied field. This would allow me to have a degree from this country where I’m living now (foreign diplomas are really frowned upon here). I would also be able to apply for an internship contract – which is strictly reserved for students enrolled in higher education and meant that I would have to work a normal 40h/week workload for half a minimum wage (yes, really). This may seem like an awful deal, but I was desperate to just get out of the house and do something with my life. I was also worried about the time gap that was forming in my CV since my last work experience in 2018. I mean, how would I be able to justify doing nothing with my life for such a long period? It wouldn’t sit well with my potential future employers. At least the internship would be a chance to acquire some job experience in the field and maybe I would be able to sell it in future job interviews.

So I went back to school in 2019, which was a huge financial investment. Since moving here my husband has been the sole provider. He’s really cool about this, never pressures me about money, but being financially dependent on him for so long has put a huge dent on my self-esteem and has not done wonders for our relationship. It has also prevented us from having a baby, as it would be financially irresponsible. I also reckon that having a baby now would be the last nail on the coffin of my non-existent career. This is also something that depresses me deeply, as I would love nothing more than to start a family with the love of my life. 

On January of this year I finally started this internship after many months of attending boring classes and passing exams. Everything was OK, the company wasn’t great (bad work environment), but I was happy to have a “job”. The routine and the prospect of finally starting off my career was doing wonders for my mental health. I felt like I finally had a goal and was a real “adult”, even though I was treated as a mere student by the rest of the team. Then… Coronavirus came. 

I was instantly laid off from my internship because of course I wasn’t essential to the company and my contract didn’t assure me any kind of security. The whole thing was really badly managed by the company’s CEO who was very very cruel, even going as far as sending an email to the University saying that I “behaved badly” and “would have great difficulties finding a job later on”. Which is not true at all – I worked well and got along with the whole team. I really do not understand why this person was so mean to me in such a delicate moment. I eventually found out that the company is probably going to close by the end of the year for several reasons. This is probably the real reason they laid me and a couple of other employees off. 

So quarantine came by and I am in a nasty state of mind. Slipped back into depression and anxiety. I feel like no matter how much effort I put into it, I will never be able to have a real job. I will remain financially dependent on my husband. We will never be able to afford having a family. Nobody takes me seriously as a professional or even as a person. I know it’s silly, but the CEO’s words keep swirling in my head and I just want to cry.

I am really, really thinking about abandoning my field and venturing into anything else. Selling shoes, serving tables, telemarketing. Anything that doesn’t require me getting back to school once again. I just don’t even know where to start: science is the only thing I’ve known since I was 17.

 **Tl;dr: spent my youth studying hard science, unable to find a job, declining mental health due to lack of stability and professional perspective. Need advice about where to turn to.**"

He’s really cool about this, never pressures me about money, but being financially dependent on him for so long has put a huge dent on my self-esteem and has not done wonders for our relationship. It has also prevented us from having a baby, as it would be financially irresponsible. I also reckon that having a baby now would be the last nail on the coffin of my non-existent career. This is also something that depresses me deeply, as I would love nothing more than to start a family with the love of my life. 

On January of this year I finally started this internship after many months of attending boring classes and passing exams. Everything was OK, the company wasn’t great (bad work environment), but I was happy to have a “job”. The routine and the prospect of finally starting off my career was doing wonders for my mental health. I felt like I finally had a goal and was a real “adult”, even though I was treated as a mere student by the rest of the team. Then… Coronavirus came. 

I was instantly laid off from my internship because of course I wasn’t essential to the company and my contract didn’t assure me any kind of security. The whole thing was really badly managed by the company’s CEO who was very very cruel, even going as far as sending an email to the University saying that I “behaved badly” and “would have great difficulties finding a job later on”. Which is not true at all – I worked well and got along with the whole team. I really do not understand why this person was so mean to me in such a delicate moment. I eventually found out that the company is probably going to close by the end of the year for several reasons. This is probably the real reason they laid me and a couple of other employees off. 

So quarantine came by and I am in a nasty state of mind. Slipped back into depression and anxiety. I feel like no matter how much effort I put into it, I will never be able to have a real job. I will remain financially dependent on my husband. We will never be able to afford having a family. Nobody takes me seriously as a professional or even as a person. I know it’s silly, but the CEO’s words keep swirling in my head and I just want to cry.

I am really, really thinking about abandoning my field and venturing into anything else. Selling shoes, serving tables, telemarketing. Anything that doesn’t require me getting back to school once again. I just don’t even know where to start: science is the only thing I’ve known since I was 17.

**\* Tl;dr: spent my youth studying hard science, unable to find a job, declining mental health due to lack of stability and professional perspective. Need advice about where to turn to.  \***"

I have two right now and have been thinking of quitting the one but only because of this subs hate. I get it two internships at different companies, but mine is more 1 internship and one research side job. But I definitely don’t want to send the wrong message to an employer. 

My one internship requires all of my time, I do my schoolwork all on Sat/Sundays but M-F it’s all my one internship. It’s directly related to my field and fun/challenging so I enjoy it. 
My second one a teacher reached out to comp sci students via email asking if someone who already knew how to do something could help her (web scraping some data). I started this one a month before my other. I let the professor know I will not be able to do much more until the semester concludes, but I don’t see a reason for quitting other than the fact than an employer might judge. It’s slow paced, it’s a little challenging but not too bad, and there’s no strict deadlines. It’s still good experience and interesting work so why should I quit?"

Please help me to evaluate my chances,Ni2021,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/g9230a/profile_evaluation_for_2021fall_biobioe_phd/,"Thank you for checking my post!

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated with Bachelor degree in 2019 summer internationally, after that I am doing RA in labs in US and I am going to apply for bio phd for 2021fall in US.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I have pretty low gpa in college, but relatively not bad research experience. So I feel pessimistic about my application for phd position in US, especially under such a competitive condition because of the virus, but still a little hope. I know I can not make any changes to my low scores, so I work really hard on my research experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Could you please give me some advice on choosing schools, how to find opportunities for my special case(any school who weigh more on experience and less on scores), and evaluate my chances of getting any offer?

&amp;#x200B;

1.Scores:

GPA 3.03, GRE 325, Toefl 108

&amp;#x200B;

2.Research experience:

2020.1-2021 summer: postgraduate associate in a lab in Yale University. The PI is HHMI investigator and chair of our department. I have a relatively independent project here, which is a piece among the work of a fifth yr postdoc.

2019 summer-end of 2019: free intern in a lab in University of Washington.

2018 summer: four-months summer intern with fellowship in Oxford University. The PI is the head of the department.

Also, before graduation, I had experience in three different labs in my college.

&amp;#x200B;

3.  Recommendation:

Strong recommendation from the PI in Oxford Univ and one or two professors from my college.

Probably good recommendation from the PI in Yale Univ. The PI I am working with is very nice, and I am trying to work hard. I have not talked about the recommendation with him yet.

&amp;#x200B;

4.Publication

In college, one first-author review paper in a journal with impact factor above 4, and one third author paper in some small journal.

Acknowledgement in the paper in Oxford University.

There's going to be a paper in my current lab in Yale Univ, but I don't think it can be published when I apply in Sep.

&amp;#x200B;

5.Poster and award

2017 iGEM gold medal, speaker in the final.

I scored a nice internship in a downtown metropolitan area for the summer (Fort Worth, TX), but due to COVID-19 my assignment has been changed to virtual.

Trying to be ahead of the game, I nabbed an apartment back in February (well ahead of the lockdowns). It’s a sublease, but I made sure to go through a legit property management company to ensure I sign a lease and everything.

I’m keeping this post up because these conversations are important. Everyone’s view and experience has meaning, with that being said please be respectful to everyone responding. 

I’m a biracial woman in mechanical engineering. I took down a post I made about being kind of let down about with internship because of the type of work and I happened to mention that the company isn’t diverse and I didn’t feel like I fit it in. And man I got shit on. People were upset that I brought up race at all and I thought I should just shut up and be grateful for a job right now. 

I value diversity and I want to work for a company that does as well. 

I think these conversations are very important (even in times of crisis), so after all of this I want to know what’s been the good and bad part about your experiences so far. 

I’m used to being the only girl, or the only black person, or sometimes the only poc, but dang sometimes I really wish there were more people around that shared my cultures. I’ve had female friends be told just awful things about being a woman in this field, one of my friends was even touched inappropriately! 

But one of the best things that comes from being a minority in engineering is the sense community from my minority peers, I’m close with SHPE and NSBE and SWE. I know (at least at my giant university) that there’s kind of an unspoken code where colored kids and women can always sit by each other if they don’t know anyone. There’s always good and bad but I’d like to know your experiences!"

g95pqs,2,2020-04-27,Possible Gap Year...,Blackkirby72,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/g95pqs/possible_gap_year/,"So back in the fall, I thought I really wanted to go into the programming side of game design, but in the past few months, that has changed quite a bit. Along with that, I only applied to a couple schools with pretty good Computer Science/Game Design programs. As of now, I am accepted and planning to attend one of these colleges.

University of Wisconsin (accepted): The college is out-of-state, but I qualify for reciprocity so I would be paying in-state tuition. After all is said and done, my net cost of attendance is about $10,450 (after deducting $6,450 in federal grants and a $3,000 merit-based scholarship). My second year would cost roughly the same, but during my 3rd and 4th years, I would not have the merit-based scholarship. Overall, my total student debt for attending this college would be around $50,000, which is quite high in my opinion, but this is the only school I could attend without taking a gap year.

University of Minnesota: I recently found out that a college in the University system offers a $6,000 scholarship renewable for 4 years to valedictorians and superlatorians (I am the superlatorian of my class as of now), but in order to receive this I would have to enroll as a first year student (meaning I haven't completed any college coursework after graduating high school). The overall CoA of UMD is about $26,000 before any deductions. I would for sure qualify for the $6,000 merit-based scholarship, but aside from that, everything becomes iffy. This year, I qualified for $6,450 in federal grants and $6,000 in state grants (which I can't use if I go to UW since it's out of state). I'd assume that during my possible gap year, I wouldn't make any more than $20k. If I were to receive the same amount in federal and state grants next year as I did this year, my net CoA for this university would be less than $10k per year; their cost of attendance calculator actually estimates it would be as low as $3,500.

The only thing I'm highly unsure of is how my income during my gap year would affect my financial aid eligibility.

I guess my question is this: Should I take a gap year and apply to UMD which has a potential overall CoA of $14k? Or should I suck it up and go to UW for $50k with no gap year?

If I should take a gap year, what are some things I could do to keep my skills sharp in regards to a Computer Science major? Is there anything that would be a full use (aka show off many different skills)? Is there any type of project that would bolster my future applications/portfolio? These can even be things like learning math, writing, etc. Pretty much anything that can help me gain either experience or a competitive advantage.

Important things to note: 
- My parents likely would not affect my FAFSA next year. 
- From what I have heard, both schools have pretty good computer science programs, though I believe UMD may have some kind of research facility. 
- Many people I know from elementary, middle, and high school plan to go to UMD. 
- The closest city (about 30 miles away) has a population of 194,000, but I'm not sure if there would be many internship opportunities for non-college students with little experience."

I am an international with a 1490 SAT(superscore1510) with high GPA, good leadership roles, president of some clubs, and a decent CV(2 internships, 3 websites, 2 apps, multiple online courses, a few hackathons, good community service profile-run an NGO, good at public speaking and stuff, student body) applying for CS major.

So, I am in my senior year and would be applying next year so I have been shortlisting universities with my counselor. So, I happen to be really ambitious and I know practically everyone dreams of Stanford and stuff, but I  perhaps have this thinking that if I get in, and do go to a school, that is high rated, but not as much as HYP or any other ivy(specially in the int'l community), I won't be satisfied(I know a dumb notion to have, but I can't really get it out). My counselor recommended me to apply to roughly 15 colleges and basically told me to include 5 or 7 targets which I really want and that too a bit more 'realistic'. Now I think, if I would be spending so much money of my parents, which I would feel a bit guilty about, I need to do it on a uni that really would satisfy me. Now, I know I have to be realistic and actually have a very strong chance that I might not get into unis which are the ones I dream about, but again, I would be more than happy to drop a year and work for it even more. At the end of the day, I do not want to have the regret that I did not even try to take a chance, but settled for something less than what I dream. And the thing about gap year, what's the hearm?

So, I need to ask you all. Is this thinking of mine appropriate or should I be more realistic?"

The thing is, I'm not missing any of those but am I expected to use my own stuff on the job? It says that I'll be connecting to their on-site PC remotely so I wouldn't necessarily be downloading/having work related stuff on my PC.

Although, having a laptop would be convenient so I can move/change places if needed. If I ask for a laptop though then I'd probably need a keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc because I wouldn't want to keep switching peripherals from my home PC to my work laptop?

**Background**

* **Work experience:** Undergraduate research experience (3 months), internship at google, facebook, and amazon (over 2 years)
* **Extra curricular:** Led initiative (club) to tutor underprivileged students (in courses + admissions to top schools) -- have worked with over 500 students 
* TA and mentor for students
* Leadership role in cultural club (we do fundraising/charity too) 
* Part of business club (difficult to get into)
* **Undergrad school/major:** MIT undergrad and will be going on to complete a masters in the upcoming fall (5 year program) -- Major: Computer Science
* **Other education/coursework:** 
* **Race/nationality:** Asian
* **Sex:** Male

**Stats**

* **GMAT Score (include breakdown!):** based on diagnostics, 760
* **Undergrad GPA:** 4.4/5

**MBA Info**

* **Goal of MBA:** I think I'll be able to think of a more concrete reason as my application time comes closer, but for now: I want to transition onto a management position in a tech company. Having a leader who's exposed to both fields is really crucial for a department to work well. Also, tech companies are having an increasing amount of impact on everyday life, so being in a leadership position, I can help take actions that tend to benefit people. 
* **Target schools:** HBS 2+2

**Other information:** First generation from low income family 

My GPA seems to be a bit low when compared with the average admit, but MIT is known to be rigorous -- so hopefully there can be some leeway there?"
g9bj5z,1,2020-04-27,Staying and extra semester to fit another internship and get second major,Wavytide,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g9bj5z/staying_and_extra_semester_to_fit_another/,"So I've been in college for about 5 years now. I used to study something else and switched my major to Computer Engineering. I'm in my junior is and am doing pretty good in school (3.7 GPA). I also have coding experience from my current part time job and have a coding internship lined up for the summer.

However I found out recently that if I stay an extra semester (6.5 yrs in college) I can also finish a B.S in Computer Science. If I do this, I can potentially fit in another internship next summer too. 

I really want to get into one of the big four. Would it be unethical/weird for me to apply as a double major for internships while applying full time with my Computer Engineering major at the same time next year? Depending on my offers I would decide whether I want to stay longer or not. 

Would staying an extra semester for the major and internship increase my chances of getting in? 

TLDR: Should I graduate and go into industry or stay an extra semester for the internship and major."
g9bpqe,3,2020-04-27,Brown vs. USC?,ts6282,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g9bpqe/brown_vs_usc/,"Hi everyone! I am looking for some suggestions on what college to attend because I am faced with a very hard decision between Brown University and USC (uni of southern cali). I'm interested in one day going into some form of the music/entertainment industry and will probably end up working in LA or NYC. The most important factor in determining my school is whatever will give me better options in my future (more job ops, internships, better degree, more impressive) . I will be paying close to the same price for both schools so that is not a factor, although I am focused on getting the most out of what I am paying for.

Here are the pros and cons:

**Brown University -**

Pros:

\- great school (ivy league) with incredible education

\- open curriculum where I can take classes in what I like and explore my passions (take business/entrepreneurship/econ classes for my major along with music/media classes)

\- room to explore/grow/decide/figure out my future

\- impressive to future recruiters/employers, could make grad school admissions easier

\- positive environment with intellectual and kind people

\- great activities and groups

\- nice city with fun things to do

Cons:

\- cold in winter :(

\- Providence is not an entertainment capital like LA or NYC (although it is close to NYC and Boston) so possibly not as much access to the same types of internships?)

\- does the Brown name carry any weight on the west coast? I am currently from NY but I might want to move/work in LA after college.

\- not in a specific program for music/entertainment business - will I be as qualified if I definitely decide to go into this field or will I be at a disadvantage from other students?

**USC -**

Pros:

\- good education and great program specifically for music industry in the Thornton School of Music

\- location in LA - I love the warm weather and the city will have many opportunities for not only fun times but also internships and future jobs

\- social life/fun times in california

\- many internships and learning industry specific skills rather than a broader ""business/entrepreneurship/organizations"" degree

\- good alumni network specifically for music industry program

Cons:

\- not ranked as high - is it as respected and will it provide me with the same opportunities that a Brown education will?

\- educational value is important to me - will a USC degree in a specific music major be as useful as a Brown degree in the more general concentration?

\- not as much room to change my mind since I am in the music industry major (might want to explore other aspects of the entertainment industry)

*Thank you so much for reading! I am hoping some of you can provide some insight into what would be a good idea for me. Again, I am trying to make a decision that will provide me with the best opportunities for whatever my future holds. :)*"

Firstly, I am on track to receive a first in my BA degree, and have work experience as a research assistant in two projects (which is rare as far as I know for an undergraduate). Whilst my work experience is limited outside this, I did actually spend a year being a mentor at a local college (which is basically like being an unpaid cover teacher or supply teacher). I have skills in using statistics, analysing both quantitive and qualitative data, knowledge of Office and SPSS, writing reports, as well as skills in public speaking and disseminating information. I have laid out these skills and more to prospective employers, mostly at government jobs, spending hours researching and applying for jobs that fit my experience and degree. However, I seem to be having no luck getting a graduate job at all! 


I have had my CV checked by family members, friends, my university career service, a recruiter and even an academic. I've used websites to structure STAR responses to job applications, read books on job applications, done online judgement tests, and had people read my personal statements. Despite my efforts to both make myself employable and make my CV reflect this, I have had only 1 interview and been turned down for 20 jobs so far.  


For an example of some of the roles I have applied for here's a list:
Market researcher 
User Researcher internship
HMRC caseworker
Product Manager Intern 
Fundraising in Further Education Graduate role 
Policy Intern 

Any advice?"

g9f7yi,1,2020-04-27,Canadian College Comparison: UofT vs UBC,Azamat2001,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g9f7yi/canadian_college_comparison_uoft_vs_ubc/,"**University of British Columbia (UBC) vs University of Toronto (at St. George and Mississauga)**

Intended Major: Computer Science.

Note: I plan on graduating in 3 years (not including potential internships/coops) due to my IB credits, so the tuition cost/difference in costs is over 3 academic years. Also, all the costs are in US dollars, not Canadian $.

**UofT Mississauga (second campus):**

*Pros:*

* Gave me the most scholarship out of all three – 80k over 4 years (will be 60k if I graduate in 3), making the annual cost of attendance \~33k (tuition, room &amp; board.)
* Will receive a UofT degree (the degrees don't mention the campus) which is very prestigious and recognized worldwide.
* Very beautiful and modern buildings/campus.
* Will have access to resources at the main campus (St. George) and can even take some classes there.
* Smaller student population (not necessarily a pro because I fit in both small and large unis) allowing a better student-to-professor relationship.
* Professional Experience Year (PEY) available\* — 12-16 months of paid internship.

*Cons:*

* Due to being the second campus, not as many resources available compared to St. George campus (the main one). Would require more effort from me to seek them.
* Student life lacks compared to the main UofT campus and UBC (partially due to the smaller student population?).
* The campus doesn't have *that* much to offer and is 30 mins away from downtown Toronto.

\* I am an international student and PEY is usually not available to us at the second campus. However, after talking to the international admissions officer, I was told that they're planning to offer it to intl starting from fall 2020; however, it is not official yet and there is a (small yet exists) chance I might end up with no internships.

**UBC:**

*Pros:*

* Vancouver is becoming more and more popular for tech industry.
* An amazingly beautiful campus, just in love with it.
* Milder weather compared to Toronto/west coast-best coast?
* Offers a co-op program — 3-4x 4month paid internships (12-16 months in total). Also, a higher chance of landing a good internship because large companies prefer 4-month interns compared to UofT's PEY where employers are more reluctant to hire interns for a long-term (12-16 months at once).
* Good social life/collaborative and supportive community (mostly)/less cutthroat environment compared to UofT.

*Cons:*

* Not as prestigious as UofT (and prestige kinda matters as I want to stay in North America to start my career before going back to my country).

*Cost:* Received a one-time scholarship worth $10,500. This makes the average annual cost of attendance \~37k.

**UofT St. George (main campus):**

*Pros:*

* Got the name/prestige. Almost guarantees a permanent residence in Canada. Easier to find a job (in and outside of Canada) due to network and opportunities offered.
* Downtown location — a kinda hectic, vibrant, and dynamic location where I usually tend to work better/become motivated to work.
* Beautiful campus (really campus shouldn't make a difference since it's good at all three choices).
* Professional Experience Year available for international students (and it is official, unlike Mississauga campus).

*Cons:*

* Expensive relative to other options and didn't get any scholarships. Average annual cost of attendance would be $53k.
* Known to have a cutthroat/overly competitive environment. (not a huge con because it helps me do better...?)

Total cost over 3 years of study (i.e to receive a degree/diploma):

UofT Mississauga = 100k

UBC = 112k

UofT St. George = 160k

Even though my family is okay with me going to any of the aforementioned universities and can afford them, I still consider the cost because I don't want to pay more when the return is not worth it. For that reason, I decided that it is unreasonable to pay 60% more for the main campus UofT than the second campus, especially when the diploma doesn't even mention the campus. However, if you think otherwise and think that UofT St. George is worth the extra bucks, please let me know.

I have been mostly trying to decide between UofT Mississauga and UBC. I feel like they both would put me at a similar starting point career-wise and at this point, it depends more on how well I take advantage of the opportunities offered. I really like UBC because of its more balanced academics and social life; however, I can also see myself doing really well at UofT Mississauga. The only thing that is making committing to UBC difficult is the thought of whether it's dumb to pass up on an opportunity to get a diploma from UofT for **cheaper** compared to UBC.

I would really really appreciate any input as we are approaching the May 1st deadline and I am stuck between these options (mainly between UBC and UofT Mississauga). Thank you all and stay safe!"

In your experience would a MSEE with a concentration in VLSI not be enough? I would really like to work for Intel or Nvidia

Also, has anyone done any work with VLSI from internships, or fresh out of your undergrad?

Discrete System Design Using VHDL

Advanced Digital Design Using Verilog HDL

After her test, hoping she makes it through with as mild of a case as me, I then have to worry about my dad getting tested. I beat myself up everyday because I was positive first from working with patients and gave it to them; even though they asked me to take off (which I did but it was too late)

I had a plan this year to improve my mental and physical health, it was gonna be the year I tried to work up my grad school application. I got an internship that has now been delayed, I can’t build up my shadowing hours now since it’s at a healthcare clinic. I was gonna turn my life around and I feel like I’ve been slapped in the face. everything I looked forward to is gone, (I’m a social person) I can’t even imagine being out with my friends or out in GENERAL because of what’s happened to me in the past few months.

I call my gf having panic attacks and she told me I should go talk to a therapist. I thought it would help, turns out therapists are expensive as hell + not taking many new patients during this time. My mom works in tourism and I don’t think she’ll be able to get a job if she recovers for another year at least. She works at a casino and no one will come for a while. 

granted, I’m still grateful right now because I know we haven’t been hit as hard as other families. I’m just so uncertain about their health and blame myself because I gave it to them. I enjoyed going to concerts and festivals and that will not happen until a year or two. I’m tired of the uncertainty in my life right now. I take anxiety meds due to corona. I can’t even get out and exercise because I’m still positive technically."

On my second day we had to start working from home (wfh) and it’s been 3 months since I started my internship now, but I still feel so unsure of everything. 

I feel like my learning curve and potential have been greatly affected by this. It’s so hard to be productive at home and make myself do my work even though I know I need to complete them. I feel so bad because I know this is not the best that I can perform. 

I know everyone says that there’s a pandemic going on and we can’t expect ourselves to be productive all the time. But I just feel so upset that this is happening and now I feel so much dread going to work. I feel like an imposter. I feel like they made the wrong choice hiring me. 

I have the opportunity of staying in this company even after my internship ends, but now I am so unsure. I don’t know if I truly enjoy this job or not because wfh has messed things up so much. 

I feel isolated from my colleagues, I feel like I’m not doing a good job and I feel sorry for who I could have been if this didn’t happen:( I think I thrive a lot on social interactions at work and they keep me going and on track, so wfh is really really tough...... 

I wish I could get my work done on time and properly so I don’t have to feel like such a loser. What’s the point of being kind to myself if I can’t get the things that my colleagues wants me to get done on time........"

I know some people who got internships at companies just because they know the CEO and they can’t code at all. There are people in my CS classes who completely don’t do shit and expect that they are guaranteed jobs in software engineering just because they have a degree in CS. All they do is just cheat off of others and copy code on projects. If all companies required algorithms and data structure interviews, these types of people will not get jobs and lazy people won’t go into CS just because their parents told them to. I know there are a lot of good people who do a lot of side projects and know good software engineering but suck at leetcode and I know leetcode doesn’t reflect software engineering. But those guys can definitely brush up on their algo/data structures. If you can make a full stack web app with front end and back end database, you definitely can improve algorithms/data structure skills. It just takes time and effort grinding."

I graduated college two years ago. I did everything fucking right. I got internships in my field, I ran the student radio station for a year (an actual full time job!), got a professional job right out of college. I had it made!

Well turns out I wasn't a good fit for that job, so I moved back home and got a part time gig on a local campaign. It was awesome! For a month. Election Day came and went, and I've been trying to network and get into the game.

I've met all the right people, done all the right trainings. People keep saying ""Oh yes you're very qualified! I'll float your resume around my office and see if anyone knows anyone else."" One guy I worked with called, said he wanted me to run his bosses campaign for congress. He was an incumbent, 100% chance of victory. Awesome, right? Well he just had to talk to the guy to OK it. I check in every few days and each time I get a lame fucking excuse. A month passes and he still never finds five minutes in the dudes fucking schedule (so he claims) to ask a simple question.

The next time I do get an interview, it's for an entry level position (field organizer) where the boss is FIVE years younger than me. Not even out of college. This person has the fucking gall to tell me I'm not qualified, despite 5 years of experience and training, for an ENTRY LEVEL POSITION.

Just fuck this shit. I've been all over the job boards. No calls. No emails. Nothing.

My resume is impeccable, I'm not the BEST interviewee, but I do well enough and my qualifications speak for themselves. I don't have troublesome social media (I go a little hard on the folks I want to kick out of office, but so is everyone else on my side of the isle). I've tried campaign stuff too. Government jobs, private companies relating to my field, etc. I've had even less luck with that shit.

Worst yet, nobody will tell me I'm doing anything wrong. I ask ALL THE TIME. What am I doing wrong? ""Well I dunno, you look great on paper and you seem like a great fit for anyone!"" Well fucking thanks. You're either blowing sunshine up my skirt or someone out there really has it out for me.

The masters of computational data science (MCDS) program at CMU is one I am definitely interested in, but schools such as Berkeley and Stanford also seem to have great programs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Undergrad: University of Maryland - College Park, graduating in Spring '21

Majors: Computer Science, Mathematics - Statistics Track

GPA: Overall: 3.59 | CS: 3.77 | Math: 3.63

(An aside, not sure whether there is a significant difference between a double degree and a double major. Do grad schools or potential employers prefer one over the other?)

Have not taken the GRE yet, but I think my quant scores will be within the 165-170 range based on my practice exams. 

&amp;#x200B;

Experience: 

I have had CS related internships for the past two summers, however this summer I don't really know what's going to happen. My previous internship was focused on NLP research, so I'm hoping that will be of relevance somehow. I started doing some research in data visualisation with a professor this semester, and am hoping to continue this till the end of my undergrad. 

With regard to letters of recommendation, I never spoke to professors in my classes since I never felt the need to. I will get a strong one with the professor I am currently working with, and will likely ask my supervisor from my previous internship to write me one too. 

I am somewhat stuck for my third LOR. I am taking a graduate level class on the design and analysis of learning models in the Fall, and am hoping to be more interactive with that professor, but I do not know if it will be too late for me to ask them for a letter. I may have to resort to my academic advisor or talk to one of my previous professors and hope they are willing to write me something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I feel like my application is weak compared to other students applying to top programs in the US. I don't have much research experience, a bad sum of LORs, and my GPA is far below the top 10% in my college. 

I appreciate any feedback regarding my chances at top programs! If anyone has suggestions on what I could do to try and better my profile, I'm all ears :)

Thanks for reading through this!"

To clarify, I have always dreamt of working technological fields especially things that involve IT, coding, software development. 

Long story short, I chose to study computer engineering and the course that I chose was really broad, ranging from hardware, electrical/electronic to software (mostly hardware related). I understand that to become a computer engineer, one should have a broad knowledge of all the listed things above. Even though I study software subjects, all of them don't really cover data structures and algorithms. I study coding mostly online.

So now I have a dilemma, I don't know what career to choose from the things that I've learned during Uni. To be honest, I am not that good with hardware and electrical stuff, I mean I can pass it with good grades but I almost forgot everything after the exams except for the fundamental concept. Software, on the other hand, is what I am really interested in, all projects I've done at Uni I always volunteer to be the software developer lead and so far all of the projects I've worked in completed successfully. This leads me to apply for software development jobs, I got to round 2 (which is the coding round) most of the time but always failed to get to the third round, this is where the ""imposter syndrome"" kicks in. Now that I am in my fourth and final year with no internships yet, I am really lost on where to go with my future.

Any advice would be really appreciated.

P/s: sorry for my English and expressions since it is my second language. If you feel like I need to explain my current situation in more detail please let me know. Thank you in advance."

**Tl;dr**   
Last week a flurry of complaints were filed against news anchor Arnab Goswami for, amongst other things, “inciting communal hatred” under various provisions of the IPC and also included, was a charge under the now defunct  Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act). S. 66A  of the IT act has been struck down, by the Supreme Court, as unconstitutional in 2015. However, despite [**repeated directions**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-directs-states-to-sensitise-cops-about-scrapping-of-section-66a-of-it-act/articleshow/68011762.cms) by the SC, that all pending cases under S. 66A be closed and also that no fresh charges may be registered, the provision continues to be invoked across the country.   


***#IndiaVSSection66A***   
Last week, [**at least 16 complaints were made**](https://www.barandbench.com/news/16-complaints-so-far-in-congress-ruled-states-for-fir-against-arnab-goswami-for-defaming-sonia-gandhi-read-complaints) at various police stations all over India, against news anchor Arnab Goswami. The complaints were filed in respect of comments made on his news show,  on 21st April 2020, for, amongst other things, “inciting communal hatred”. On the basis of these complaints, [**FIRs were filed under multiple provisions** ](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/derogatory-remarks-against-sonia-gandhi-hp-cong-leaders-file-fir-against-arnab-goswami/story-SCRtOHkeG6yRjhp32hGD2M.html)against Arnab Goswami in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Jammu &amp; Kashmir. The complaints  mention offences under Sections 117, 120B, 153, 153A, 153B, 295A, 298, 500, 504, 505, 506 etc of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000(IT Act) .  


S. 66A of the IT act, introduced by amendment in 2008, penalized sending ""offensive messages"" via online communication. The wide powers of the section were frequently used to stifle political dissent. For example, in May 2014,[ **five students were temporarily detained in Bangalore for allegedly sharing a message on the mobile application “WhatsApp” that was critical of newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi**](https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/05/24/stifling-dissent/criminalization-peaceful-expression-india).  To combat this a case was filed before the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that Section 66A of the IT Act, 2000 was unconstitutional.   


In March 2015, S.66A was declared unconstitutional by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in *Shreya Singhal v. Union Of India* as it violated the right to freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. The Court found that S. 66A was vague and could be arbitrarily interpreted to penalize even innocent speech. Significantly, the Court found that the provision was not ‘severable’ i.e., no part of the section could be saved and the provision as a whole was declared unconstitutional. This would have meant that the provision was void ab initio i.e was deemed to never have existed on the statute books. The effect of this would be that all pending cases would be dismissed and no fresh cases would be instituted under S. 66A.  


***#UnconstitutionalProsecutionsExposed***   
In light of the provision being declared unconstitutional, the story should have ended there. However, a 2018 study, ‘[**Section 66A and Other Legal Zombies**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3275893)’, highlighted the continued use of S. 66A, including cases registered after the Shreya Singhal decision.   


Taking note of the above-mentioned study, People's Union for Civil Liberties (‘PUCL’), one of the original petitioners in the Shreya Singhal Case approached the court in January, 2019 highlighting the study and applying for directions to ensure implementation of the Court's decision. Prior to the hearing, in a [**counter-affidavit,**](https://internetfreedom.in/section-66a-bites-the-zombie-dust-righttomeme-section66a/) the Union of India detailed steps it had taken to generate awareness on S. 66A. This included a letter the Government wrote on 11th January, 2019 and then a reminder on 14th January, 2019 to various state governments asking them to furnish data on S. 66A cases and also asking them to close them. Some states responded. For instance, [**Kerala stated that there were 19 cases that were filed after S. 66A was held to be unconstitutional**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/section-66a-information-technology-act-supreme-court-shreya-singhal-judgment-5599263/) and they would be closing all of them. The Court by judgement dated February 15, 2019, [**not only directed that all pending cases under S. 66A be closed but also that no fresh charges may be registered**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-directs-states-to-sensitise-cops-about-scrapping-of-section-66a-of-it-act/articleshow/68011762.cms). The SC further directed that  the Shreya Singhal judgement be sent to all courts in the country, to senior administrative officers and director generals of police.   


Inspite of the above, fresh claims were still instituted, as recently as last week, under the now unconstitutional provision. In January 2020, the [**Karnataka High Court imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 each on two police officers for registering an FIR under Section 66 A of the Information Technology Act**](https://thewire.in/law/karnataka-hc-section-66a-it-act). As recent as February 2020,[ **a guest lecturer at a college in Assam, was charged under S.66A of the IT Act**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-lecturer-held-for-facebook-post-on-delhi-violence/article30949145.ece), arrested and later sent to judicial custody for posting derogatory remarks against the BJP, the RSS, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and ‘Sanatan dharma’. In March 2020, [**the Patna High Court granted bail to two petitioners accused of offences, amongst others, under S.66A of the IT Act**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/159506330/). They had been in custody for 6 months. These instances highlight the continued invocation of S. 66A, 5 years after it was declared unconstitutional, despite further directions by the Supreme Court in 2019. This points to a systematic failure by the judiciary and law enforcement system.   


***#IFFBatsForDigitalRights***  
This is not about Arnab Goswami, but about the use of an unconstitutional provision of law. Even today people, ordinary smartphone users all across India are being prosecuted across the breadth of India. A casual search through the [**IndianKanoon database**](https://indiankanoon.org/search/?formInput=%22section+66a%22+sortby%3Amostrecent) (like Pintoo Kumar) shows cases of FIRs being actively prosecuted as recently as March, 2020. This is more than 5 years after a Supreme Court judgement and is a stain on our criminal justice system.   


We are committed to erasing Section 66A from every FIR and criminal case all across India, irrespective of the person who is being prosecuted. The journey of S. 66A highlights the importance and challenges of monitoring and ensuring compliance with the final decisions of the Supreme Court. To meet this challenge we have come up with a data driven, evidence based solution in partnership with [**CivicData Labs**](https://www.civicdatalab.in/). We will be working in partnership with CDL to build a tool to track cases under S. 66A at the district level between 1st January 2008 till 15th February 2020. We intend to analyse the data to identify and highlight the gaps in the system, put forth recommendations and advocate for a stronger, more accountable and transparent system. S. 66A must die a complete constitutional death.

g9mvw7,1,2020-04-28,Switching from accounting to computer science. What advice do you have for me?,Mystik-Palace,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g9mvw7/switching_from_accounting_to_computer_science/,"Hi there, I'm a senior accounting student who after MUCH thought has decided to finish my degree but leave accounting and go into a programming/developing role. I've already decided that I do not want to go the traditional route and get a master's and my CPA. I'm more interested in software development and wouldn't mind leveraging my undergraduate accounting degree, but wouldn't want to be limited by it either. I'm much more made for programming. I remember my first class in HS. I loved it and the complexity of it. I then have fiddled with FCC and other coding resources. I love math, I love to code, and I even love foreign languages like Arabic and Spanish. Decoding something and understanding it is a HUGE passion of mine. I can express my creativity in this field much more so than I can in accounting. Anyways, with that said, I'd like some advice.

What advice would you have for somebody like me ""starting out"" in programming?

What career advice do you have for me? I'm looking to break 100k eventually (that's always been my shallow goal no matter what career I go into. I'm happy with breaking that number, no matter if it's right on the dot.)

I'm considering applying for master's programs like UPENN's MCIT online which is tailored specifically for people in my situation. However, if I don't get in this cycle, my next step would be to take more MOOC's and perhaps go back to school for some college courses (online) and eventually keep applying to either UPENN or to Georgia Tech's OMSCS program.

Another option I'm considering is Launch School (this one is really a HUGE consideration for me because I love the concept of mastery-based learning; my only is the price tag. I know it's worth $200 a month, but I personally could not imagine shelling it out over the time span it would take to masters in programming. I might do it on the side if I secure a really high paying job eventually though.

Random things about me that may help you give me advice? IDK, not sure, but here they are:

\* I'm 28, I'm a family man (married, with a child)

\* I love bodybuilding

\* I love foreign language learning (Spanish, Arabic, Persian, all that jazz).

\* I love reading books.

\* I love the thought of moving somewhere OUT of Texas (where I currently live).

\* I love the thought of being able to work on my own website and do some charity work on the side for different organizations.

\* I want to be creative and solve problems.

\* At the end of the day, I just want to be happy, and I feel happier in programming than in accounting.

\* I have a public accounting internship lined up next spring and don't know whether or not I should take it.

\* Currently enrolled in UPENN's MOOC ""computational thinking"" so that I can get ready for the spring 2021 cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't know what to do in the meantime, programming-wise.

Blast me with your words of wisdom and advice!"

g9nupd,7,2020-04-28,TIFU by playing Chubby Bunny at work,bedazzledfingernails,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/g9nupd/tifu_by_playing_chubby_bunny_at_work/,"Warning: This got long, sorry.

This fuck-up happened ten or eleven years ago at my first ""real"" job after college.

I was working for a small start-up company that had the typical features of start-ups: close-knit team, casual dress code, work hard/play hard mentality. We set aside some time on Friday afternoons to eat snacks, drink beer together, and generally hang out.

I had the great idea to play a game called Chubby Bunny at one of these gatherings. In Chubby Bunny, a circle of players puts a marshmallow in each of their mouths one after another and says ""chubby bunny,"" and on each turn you add one more marshmallow to your mouth. The goal of the game is to get as many marshmallows as you can in your mouth, and whoever says ""chubby bunny"" the most articulately with the most marshmallows wins. You can probably see where this is going.

On Friday I bring in bags of marshmallows and explain the game. We're having a great time, laughing hysterically as people try to stuff yet another marshmallow in their mouths, trying to get their lips closed to get out the ""b"" sounds and drooling all over the place.

I'm at my maximum marshmallow limit, not even able to produce sound due to the marshmallows completely filling all empty space in my mouth. Total hamster cheeks; it's time for me to bow out. I didn't want to spit out the mass of slimy marshmallows in front of all my colleagues (including several of the owners). Here's the fuckup.

I stand up to go into the copy room, where the nearest trash can was located. Somehow the motion of standing up caused a marshmallow in the back of my mouth to slide into my throat. *Oh shit. Don't panic, I'll cough it up.* I spit out the rest of the marshmallows, now stuck together in a mass coated with saliva and partially-dissolved marshmallow goo. The offending marshmallow remains stuck, and I can't hold my breath much longer. I try to cough to dislodge it, but in doing so I inhale slightly, with just enough air making it past the marshmallow to suction it into my esophagus. *Now* I'm panicking.

I urgently tap the closest person sitting by the copy room, who's an intern and possibly the least capable of dealing with this situation. I motion to my mouth and throat and try to make some noise. And I *did* make some noise, because with every attempted inhale and exhale, the tiniest bit of air slides through the slime on the edges of the goddamn marshmallow, just enough for it to move back and forth a bit, and the sound it makes is truly terrible. It's worse than being completely vacuum-sealed with no sound, and obviously my coworker is horrified so he calls over to the group, ""She's choking!""

Cue everyone crowding the door to the copy room. This is the last thing I wanted, and since I realize that my esophagus isn't wholly obstructed, I try to give myself space as I'm coming up with an idea. Too late: another coworker comes to perform the Heimlich maneuver on me. I'm dying inside. Heimlich doesn't work, so one of the owners attempts too. No dice this time either. I'm mortified. Now my plan has coalesced and I motion to make everyone back away. I stick two fingers down my throat to trigger my gag reflex, and sure enough, that fucker comes up and I spit it into the trash. 

So much for maintaining dignity during Operation Marshmallow Disposal.

After the incident, HR instituted a policy that games had to be approved before playing them at our Friday hangouts. Dying by marshmallow asphyxiation was preferable to the utter humiliation.

**Tl;dr**: Choked on a marshmallow in front of most of my colleagues, got unsuccessfully Heimliched, bulimia'd the marshmallow out myself, and ruined everyone's fun."

I was able to get into my dream school in my dream major out of high school, but since I’ve been here and things are nothing close to the dream. I struggled with depression and debilitating anxiety freshman year and was almost kicked out but was able to stay after I sought help. Even still, things are still a huge challenge for me. Im on my third go-around of Calc 1 and I’ve had to take 2 classes in my major each twice because I didn’t pass the first time. Is it even worth it to keep pushing on when things aren’t working well? I love my school but it’s so discouraging seeing everyone else in my class move ahead and get internships at top companies while I’m in classes with freshmen , and I can’t put together a solid semester (overall GPA is a 2.1). This semester was looking amazing to start, but after the shift to online, my grades have went into free fall and I’m worried I’m only going to pass 1 of my 4 classes this term. 

Plus, the financial situation for my family currently isn’t great. Both my folks are immigrants who work in labor type jobs and have been losing hours and $ because of coronavirus. My school is really expensive and while I got a full ride out of high school, every time I retake a class a chunk of money is taken out. This semester was the first where I had to pay to cover the difference, and even though it was not a lot relatively ($4000), I had to ask to borrow from several people, which I don’t want to have to keep doing

I don’t know what to do but I feel like I’m at an impasse and a decision should be made soon since I’m finishing up sophomore year and am firmly at a halfway point"

I am a freshman Intended CS major. Having no prior experience with linear algebra, is it feasible to take CS70 and EE16A together in the Fall? So far, I have only taken Math 1A and 1B, I am curious if I would have enough mathematical maturity to take CS70.

I am currently taking 61A and will either take 61BL or EE16A over the summer. I am concerned that leaving 61B to Fall will put me in a hard situation regarding SWE internships / Fall recruitment. In addition, as an international student, I expect to take a gap semester in case school is online again for financial reasons which complicates my situation even further.

If I end up taking CS61BL over the summer, I am also considering taking CS61C and EE16A, that's if school is not online, leaving CS70 to Spring 2021, hoping to have enough mathematical maturity for the class by then. I am not necessarily sure if this is a good idea for major declaration though. 

I am a bit confused and would really appreciate some thoughts to help me figure this out. Thanks "

g9q3pi,0,2020-04-28,Why do companies care more about diversity as you go up the tech stack?,AdministrativeDot8,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g9q3pi/why_do_companies_care_more_about_diversity_as_you/,"As someone in CS but is interested in more low-level stuff, I've realized I see this trend a lot.

The companies that care the most about ""equity"" and ""inclusion"" are by far and away the web ones with basically no enterprise software or hardware businesses. Facebook comes to mind, as well as web-based startups. Facebook has murals about how diversity is good. They have specific intern programs for diversity. They publish an annual diversity report. Google is also primarily a web company (their enterprise and hardware ventures kinda suck) and does a lot of the same stuff.

Then you have more traditional tech companies like Microsoft/Apple/Oracle, who have to sell their compute largely as a service and design a significant amount of hardware. These companies seem to care a lot less about equity and diversity. I know Apple and Microsoft make little targeted attempts at diversity, although they don't shun it. Oracle's been slammed for diversity before.

Finally, on the opposite extreme, we have chip manufacturers, which are shamelessly corporate. Samsung basically own the Korean government and bully it into submission. TSMC and Intel fight decades long patent battles that are highly publicized. These companies are probably doing the bare minimum to not get hit by the government for a discrimination suit. In fact, Intel got hit with a $5 million discrimination suit last year. In terms of attitude, you can tell these companies don't care about diversity and will make any attempts possible to save a dime.

I've heard the usual reasons for diversity, but was wondering why they seem to have some kind of correlation to where you are on the tech stack. Why does it make no sense for Intel to have an inclusive workforce but it makes sense for Facebook? Both companies are publicly traded, so ultimately both only seek to make money."

I’m graduating in about two weeks and am pretty stuck now. Didn’t think I’d be directly impacted by the pandemic until this happened  sadly

My story goes like this: I added a computer science minor my junior year and forced it into my schedule (my uni has a flat rate for tuition and allows up to 20 credits). With no internships or major side projects I really had to network my way into just a couple of interviews despite my school being a hotbed of cs recruiting and studied a lot and got the job. 

I did have another job offer at one of those large IT staffing companies that mainly do outsourcing or implementation work (think Wipro, TCS, Infosys) but I’m thinking about whether or not to start there at the end of the summer, or if I should build up my skills, perhaps this app I’ve been thinking about making, some online courses in AI/Web development, so that I can apply to the more sought after CS jobs when they come back to recruit at my school. My concern is having a stain on my resume and a slower start to my career by starting at a place with a poor reputation in the US.

I’m a college grad with a BS in Psychology and currently hold a job related to that field. After two years of working in it, I’ve come to the conclusion that this is not what I want to do. The burnout for working with children with Autism is REAL, I’m SEVERELY underpaid (29k a year), and after having dove into data analytics and machine learning, realized that CS is a much better fit for me both financially and mentally.

Here’s the choices I currently have and would love some opinions:

1. I got reaccepted to my alma mater for Computer Science where I should only need about 2.5 years for a CS degree BUT I’ll have to pay out of pocket for that which will require loans (I am debt free right now so I don’t entirely mind).
PROS: An actual CS degree from a reputable university
CONS: paying out of pocket, won’t have time for internship, will not have on the job experience. 

2. I’ve been looking into Revature. I’ll get through the 10-14 minimum wage training and plan to land clients for the 2 year contract. I know I’ve heard bad things about Revature, but they all center around this 20K training contract that I don’t intend on breaking. I don’t mind staying two years with them. 
PROS: paid training (even if it’s minimum wage), nearly guaranteed 45-50K right out the gate (considerably more than my current salary), on the job experience. 
CONS: no actual degree (will my experience be enough to hiring managers at the end of the 2 years?)

So those of you with experience in both, feedback? Thank you!"

**SJSU cons:** too close to home, area is kinda sus and unsafe, known to be a commuter school with a not-so-good social life, I wanna get outta the bay area and explore, not so prestigious, LOW GRADUATION RATE THAT STRESSES ME OUT, hard to get classes

**CPP pros:** Hands on, i like my major a lot, between LA and SD so nice location, a bit more prestigious than SJSU, I get to be independent when I live a bit far away, higher graduation rate

**CPP cons:** never toured campus, idk if I will vibe w the people there, i've seen a few pics and the campus doesn't look that amazing, doesn't have a great student life + clubs + activities etc

so overall, I'm leaning towards SJSU since my parents want me to stay close by during the pandemic, but there's a small part of me who still wants to go to CPP since I feel like I might enjoy it a bit more and get to be a bit more independent. Any advice?"

I have created a very simple mobile app, in swift, with the help of a professional software developer. I have created a website by myself using Python as a back-end, I handled my own API call to Google to get google sheets working with the software. Basically, it is a interscholastic data visualization tool that, when granted access to the google sheet file, allows you to update the data available to the graphs dynamically. I have a theoretical background in linear algebra and differential equations in Matlab. I am currently attempting to create an image analysis tool for my research, which tracks bubble sizes in a video and outputs an excel document with the area of each bubble over time. I have concrete future plans to further my coding skills. I am being offered two internships basically, and these are the tasks for the one I am considering:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Move from Ionic 3 to Ionic 5

\- Upgrade the existing code

\- Make it cloud-based.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Map integration

Integrate Google / Airport maps so that at any given time, users can slide up the screen and see on a map where they are located (neighborhood map if they’re in town, airport map if they’re in the airport area, continental map if they’re flying).

&amp;#x200B;

3) Crowdsourcing

Implement the crowdsourcing screens that enable us to know when a passenger enters a waiting line (check-in, security, passport control…).

&amp;#x200B;

4) Motion analysis algorithm

In case the user doesn’t crowdsource the information, analyze the specific movements of passengers in waiting lines (serpentine shape, sequences of Stop for a short time / Walk a few steps) to determine a posteriori when exactly a user entered the line.

&amp;#x200B;

5) Geofencing

Use beacons to determine when a passenger enters or exits specific airport areas (check-in, security, customs…).

&amp;#x200B;

6) Go-to-gate reminder

The go-to-gate reminder feature gives an alert to passengers in the terminal area to go back to the boarding gate.

\- Measure and store the average walking speed of passengers from the moment they enter the airport area.

\- Based on the actual passenger location, calculate time needed to go back to gate

\- Fetch boarding time (updated in real time)

\- Implement slider to take into consideration user preference.

May 1 is coming up soon and I am really confused. I need to make a decision quick and I need help. 


UCSD (Computer Engineering):-
Pros:
1. Location
San Diego is great for Internships and Jobs. 

2. Prestige
UCSD has a great prestige for Computer Engineering and has a great name worldwide.

3. My parent's first choice.
When I got into UCSD, my parents were thrilled. They really want me to attend UCSD as I am one of the fewest in my school's history to ever get into a UC.

Cons:
1. Veryyyyy expensive (60K/per year)
Although my parents have said that they are willing to pay the fees, I don't want to be a burden, especially at this point of time when the conditions are very uncertain. 

2. Competition
My stats aren't great (SAT: 1380 and moderate ECs.. lol) and I really don't know how I got in XD. I'm worried that UCSD would be filled with extremely smart people and I may not survive.

3. Food
I have heard that food at UCSD isn't great. There is no variety and is very expensive. I have heard that there are cheaper restaurants at least 15 mins away.


Purdue (FYE)

1. High number of Asian Indians
I'm an Asian Indian myself and I feel like I would fit in. I have also heard that we get Indian food at Purdue.

2. Food
I tend to eat a lot and the buffet system at Purdue seems to be a great option.

3. The Climate
I live in a very hot region and I have started to hate the heat. I have never really experienced cold, but I think it would be a great experience.

4. Cheap and yet amazing 
The tuition at Purdue is just around 45K, which is actually affordable as compared to the 60K of UCSD. I also have plans for grad school and I really wanna stand by my own feet after finishing undergrad and pay for my grad school.

Cons:

1. Haven't gotten my major Computer Engineering. Just got into the college of engineering. I'm not really sure if I will get Computer engineering for sure although I have heard that it is easy to get your major.

2. Location
The nearest airport is almost 70 miles away and my parents are really concerned about how safe it would be to travel alone (I'm a girl). Safety is my parents primary concern and it is also the main reason why my parents are hesitating to send me to Purdue.

3. Grade Deflation 
Purdue is well known for its grade deflation which may make it hard for me to get into a good grad school.


OSU- Columbus (Computer Engineering)
 
Pros:

1. Accessibility 
There is an international airport at Columbus which is less than 10 miles away. 

2. Cheap
It is much more cheaper than UCSD.

Cons:

1. Prestige
It is not as prestigious as UCSD or Purdue for Computer Engineering.

2. Location
Ohio is not really great for my major. 


Please help me out guys! Your help will be really appreciated! :) Also note that I'm not currently residing in the US but I'm not an International student.

Thus, here are some attributes of a good project:

* It's **deployed** \- you can send someone the URL and they can check it out
* It's a **web app** \- the vast majority of companies build for the web (or mobile w/API). You should do the same. You want to build your own programming language? Sorry, unless you're trying to work on Rust at Mozilla or do syntax highlighting or build Prettier v2 or the next IntelliJ, working on a programming language will have a low ROI (but if you have true passion, don't let me stop you!)
* It **has users** \- most projects have 0 active users. Not even the creator uses them. It's okay if you end up with 0 users, but you should be *trying* to avoid that outcome.
* It's **built in public** \- you WANT people to see your progress. Bring your project out into the light, the feedback and suggestions will make it stronger. Communicate your progress, this is a crucial skill you'll need at work.

Don't have an idea? Here's where you can start:

* Build your **personal website**.
* **Clone a simplified version of a popular app**. Bonus points for putting a spin on it. Imagine building Twitter where you can only use emojis - no text. If a recruiter reads that, they might be slightly intrigued by this project. I know I would.
* **Build tools for people building this summer.** I have lots of ideas for what is needed this summer, but maybe you'll have better ideas. We should talk.
* Anyone have other ideas? Comment down below!

# How to Succeed

To succeed, you need to ""not quit"". If you quit on your project, then this summer will be a waste. Here are some tactics to help you not quit:

**1) Keep the project small!**

One of the biggest killers of projects is that the project is bigger than you imagined. Big projects will zap your morale when you realize you've bit off way too much. And if that happens - it's gg. (This happens all the time, even among professionals)

The best way to avoid bad outcomes is to start with the smallest, cheapest, unit of deployable work that you can share with people. And if this is successful, then you add to it.

Bad: ""Oh, we should build a Shopify alternative!""

Good: ""Let's build a dumb website where you can only click 'click me' - and there's a global counter.""

**2) Don't have just 1 big project**

If you have a mentality that ""my project has to succeed"", then you're putting all your eggs in one basket. It's much better to have 4 small projects than 1 big project. If you have the mentality of ""I'm going to build lots of projects"", then not all of them have to go well for you to have a good project by the end of summer.

**3) Tracer Bullets**

This is a concept from the Pragmatic Programmer - where you essentially build the scaffolding for your project first. Let's say you're building a Twitter clone. You've specified that you want the following:

* A React frontend
* A Node.js/Express backend
* An authentication system
* A MySQL Database
* A Redis Cache (this is premature optimization, but in this example, we'll add it)

Then the tracer bullet approach would be:

* Build the tiniest React component that communicates from the frontend, sends a message to the backend, authenticates it against the auth system, saves something in the DB, and update the Redis cache.

There is risk in each part, and if you build a SIMPLE end to end feature, then you can remove risk. Deploy this stupidly simple version of your app to production. You should celebrate because you've proved that you can build a functional app. Next, expand functionality.

**4) Don't try to learn too much**

Before you start a project, you might feel like you're at the buffet and can learn everything you want. You'll load up your plate with 9,000 tutorials and books. No. Bad idea.

Focus. Keep it simple and take it slow. Build and ship small things.

# Next Steps

This is a long ass post - much longer than I expected, but I wanted to make it useful for people embarking on summer projects in lieu of an internship.

To take this further, I've started a Zoom group/meetup (working name is ""CSCQ Builds"") to offer a space for teaching and mentorship. I'll provide office hours and occasional [code reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g7rybw/what_should_i_do_this_summer/fok4h16?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Once a week, we'll share progress (demos) and give presentations on things people learned (i.e. spinning up a GraphQL API with Hasura and Firebase Auth). In fact, there's already a small group of builders from this sub (about 10) who are gathering for a Zoom kickoff this Thursday at 5PM Pacific. If you're interested in joining or mentoring, sign up here and you'll be sent a calendar invite: [https://forms.gle/3N3CfqbH6YkM1DF67](https://forms.gle/3N3CfqbH6YkM1DF67)

If you have already started a project and want someone to give you a second opinion on your work, this is perfect for you. This will supplement your progress.

If you haven't started with a project, but want to build, then I'm sure you'll find lots of like-minded folks. In addition to networking, I can help with ideation and project planning as well.

In any case, seize the summer. Whether you have an internship - or not! Godspeed

Please give a read and provide with feedback.

I am a pre final year undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science. I want to share an unpopular opinion about data science and need your suggestions. The last three years I have seen students pursuing for Data Science (specifically Machine Learning) just because there is a craze for it in the industries. Even most of the freshers who need to focus more on their Data Structures and Algorithm skills go for Machine Learning just blindly following the herd. It's not like I don't want them to learn more but I want everyone at least to have the understanding about what it actually means to become a data scientist. This huge crowd moving towards data science without going through the fundamentals first made me despise the student as well as the career. What I believe is that the students now regard the Computer Science course as a Data Science course instead. Being a Computer Science student I want to learn everything the course has to offer to us and not stick to a particular field, but anything related to data science was something I couldn't attach my mind to. Since there were so many topics to learn about in the field of Computer Science, I would ways prefer those which were not much related to Machine Learning or something. Few months ago I was facing an interview for an internship where I was asked why I don't want to learn Machine Learning or Data Science. I answered with the reason same as above, to which they thought of me as someone who is trying to run away from the competition. Since then I want to learn more about data science not because I want to pursue a career in it but because I want to prove it's not the competition I am running from but the mindless students who are gonna be in the same track as me. What I believe is if I try to learn more about data science, I could become better than the average students who blindly follow the trend. All I need is your help whether I should be learning more about data science first or proceed for various other options that are still unexplored on my part. And if there's anything that I would have misjudged then please help me rectify it."

I am a college student who will graduate in mid-May. During fall 2019, I interviewed with a company and ultimately signed two contracts with them:

1. A three-month internship with an established end date in May 2020

2. A full-time offer beginning in September 2020

I had originally planned to use that time off between May and September to travel and visit family, but that's obviously not possible now. Since I am nearing the end of my internship and will still be living in CA (with a high cost of living), I think it would be prudent to seek unemployment benefits. However, I am also supposed to return to this company in the fall - but many of my friends have had job offers rescinded and I feel that the same has a chance of happening to me.

So, two questions:

1. Will a UI claim be denied on the fact that I have a contract signed to begin working for the company full-time in September this year?

2. Would this potentially jeopardize my future with the company?"

Pros - In a very favorable part of Cleveland by two major hospitals, one being Cleveland Clinic and the other being University Hospitals. It is a much smaller school with a more intimate class size.

Cons - It is not as highly ranked as UMich. Further, sports aren't really that big so I might miss out on things such as football games.

UMich

Pros - Is very highly ranked and is very well known. There is a big sports scene and I've heard people are very happy there. I haven't gotten the chance to visit, but from what I have seen  Ann Arbor is great and the campus is really pretty!

Cons - UMich is so big, and I am worried that I won't be able to find as many internships and research placements (I am not sure this is true but since it is bigger I am not sure). I am also worried about academics as I have heard that classes are pretty tough, and GPA is a factor in terms of med school admissions.

Both schools are around the same price so that isn't really a factor in the decision. Any opinions on the decision are welcome :)

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: UMich is around 60k while CWRU is 50k

When we signed the lease and our parents met with the landlord he told us the place was ours for the summer for 300 dollars and we told him that sounded great. fast forward to now he recently contacted us and told us we need to be out by Saturday  May 2nd as he has leased it to someone else over the summer. We were expecting our new lease for the summer at the end of this week as that is what he said he would do when we signed our first lease. I reached out to my new landlord for the next college term since we are renting a new place and asked when we could move in and explained our situation. He told us we could move in May 8th. The problem is that our current landlord wants us out by Saturday May 2nd. I asked my current landlord if we could stay at least till May 8th so we can move in to our new place and move our stuff into there but he said absolutely not.  He also said if we are still there on Saturday May 2nd that he would contact the police for trespassing and I quote ""throw our shit out onto the curb"". What are my options here? I have read online that after the lease is over he can file an eviction notice and we have 15 days to leave after that. That would be fine cause we would be able to move into our new place in that 15 day period. I just wanted to double check on here. Thank you guys very much!

I also stopped feeling passionate about what I used to do, don’t feel like going out nor looking for opportunities, I feel scared about my future and sometimes even feel like I’m not capable of doing a decent job. 
I would love to have my life back, to wake up and feel like I wanna make a change, like I wanna find a job or do something to improve as a person and as a professional.
I blame and at the same time I’m thankful because my parents always gave me what I wanted. 
Sometimes I just even like the idea of staying home and not doing anything, but don’t really wanna si k in this idea. I’m scared all the time when I see someone who’s better than me at what I do and it definitely frustrates me.

* Some kind of small project. One idea I had was to make some kind of room sensor system that would track temperature, when the lights are on, and movement and store that info. I have an Arduino that my parents got me for my birthday, so I'm planning on using that somehow. 
* Learn more about how different kinds of memory work (discussed this a little bit in class, but it seems interesting)

im pretty worried given the fact ive messed up and shouldve been a lot more focused. i dont think its too late for me because i know im competent having been given a hefty scholarship.

that was just background info, my question is this. **im considering not taking any classes this summer to dedicate those three months to learning a ton of stuff on my own. doing a ton of projects, and going through cracking the coding interview book. currently working on a puzzle game using html javascript aws and sql. i regret rushing my degree and want to sort of make up for it by slowly myself down if that makes any sense to give myself enough time to prepare for getting a job. is this a good idea or should i just continue as normal, finish super early, and do my best to learn stuff while taking classes and get a job.**

it just scares me knowing people have graduated without getting an offer for like 6-18 months. i feel like if that were to be me, i might as well have that off time in the middle of my college career than after graduation.

Prior to joining the course, I was under the impression that it was fairly prestigious and rigorous, however, I underestimated the damage a lack of specialization has on future prospects (i.e. it's useless unless you pursue further study in one of the three fields). More importantly, I'm starting to feel an itch to return to tech/stem as I miss creating things and I miss the 'practical' aspect of learning that comes with it (yes I know CS is also very theoretical). I'm also at a significant disadvantage since it is likely I will graduate without an internship or *any* sort of work experience under my belt. Undertaking a second Bsc will hopefully give me more time to get the relevant work experience. So all this considered, I have been seriously contemplating a second Bsc in Computer Science as I have always loved technology/computers and more recently, programming. So my question is, should I pursue this second bachelors (considering all of the above, and the fact that I'm international), or should I go for a Msc CS conversion (e.g. Imperial/UCL/Bath). I have considered the latter, however, I feel that the tradeoffs seem to put a Bsc over a Msc.

That is:

Second Bachelors CS

\+ more depth and (presumably) less intensive  
\+ can buy time for internships/work experience  
\+ often more respected by employers compared to conversion Msc  
\+ more time to develop interest in *specific* field (in my case ML/data)  
\- much more expensive long term (esp. for internationals)  
\- might signal unreliability/lack of confidence  
\- will graduate when I'm 24  
\- potentially disastrous decision if I fall out of love *yet again (*not likely but should still consider)  


Masters CS

\+ less expensive overall  
\+ gets me into the job market quicker  
\+ not as disastrous if I decide to part ways again  
\- less depth and much more intensive (esp. Imperial)  
\- not the complete experience (i.e. lacks full engineering/mathematical foundations)  
\- may or may not be respected by employers

I have gotten into Purdue's FYE. But I have I few doubts about it.


1. How hard is it to choose CompE? Since I haven't gotten CompE and I don't intend to choose any other major, this is my major concern. And if you could, please also mention the cutoff GPA for CompE. 


2. (FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS) How do you travel from the airport to the campus? How safe is it to travel as a girl?


3. I have seen several memes about how random Indiana weather is. Is it manageable? I'm an Indian living in extremely hot conditions and although a change would be great, I'm concerned about how I would survive the cold. 


4. How are the opportunities for internships and jobs. I intend to live and work in California since it would be the best for Computer Majors. Do students from Purdue get opportunities from California? I have also gotten into UCSD for CompE. Will studying and UCSD have an advantage over Purdue?


5. How is the grade deflation? I plan to attend grad school too after undergrad and I have heard that many great universities expect a high GPA.


Although there are too many questions, I would be extremely grateful if you all could give me an insight on these questions. Thank you in advance! :D"

Just finished high school. For personal reasons, I will be having to take a gap year. I have no background in coding but have been very excellent in Math in high school (aced AP and IB exams).

Right now, I am trying my way through competitive programming and have a rating of 1800 on codeforces (about three weeks of practice).

Clearly, taking the gap year is not ideal. I would be much better off going to uni, but that is something that I cannot really do anything about right now.

If I am aiming for a career in cs, is doing progressively harder competitive programming problems the way to go? Or am I better off learning some online course? Maybe personal project? And is it realistic to start thinking about internships at this point or is it too soon?

Since then, my passion for political science has waned, while my interest in coding has grown.

I was originally planning to go to a standard bootcamp, but I recently discovered that most UK universities offer postgraduate computer science degree conversion programs for people with non computer science undergraduate degrees. The programs seem to generally be intensive, and last for 1-2 years, after which you would graduate with an msc. This seems to be a huge step up from a 12 week bootcamp. Has anyone ever had an experience doing one of these Masters conversion degrees? They seem very common in the UK, but I don't think we have an equivalent in the states.

Here is the ninth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).

All the best,

\--Nick

I am a computer science undergrad.

I have already applied to 30+ internships with no response, and I think it is highly unlikely I am going to land as much as an interview.

What other jobs can I apply to for the summer that could be useful? I am trying to get creative, like working at the Apple retail store to try and help my resume because at the moment I am currently invisible to recruiters.

gad4hy,1,2020-04-29,Get in the field asap vs. going back to get my masters (stats),markdf1992,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gad4hy/get_in_the_field_asap_vs_going_back_to_get_my/,"Hi All!

I was wondering if I could get some advice:

So I am 27 years old. Majored in Business Finance from a top U.S. university. Over the past 3-5 years since graduating (after leaving the finance/i-banking world), I've tried a bunch of different things and have finally come upon data science/ml. I have decided that this is the route that I am going to commit to and pursue for my career. 

Now here's the thing. I've been programming for the past 6 months or so, taking some courses. Built a few small things in the courses. And the plan has been to work another 6 months- 1 year and continue in courses and build a bigger project or two for my portfolio. Then to hopefully land a data science or ml internship. 

But here's the thing. I can't stand not knowing exactly what's going on ""under the hood"". I want to get to the source. AKA...Mathematics. Not only that I want to know (what's going on under the hood), but frankly, it seems that ALL data science jobs have a pre-req of a masters (or more) in a quant field. 

If I were to pursue the route that I'm on now and go straight into the field, I presume it would be more of a data analyst type of role. 

Now here's the thing. I don't see a clear route to move into data science from a data analyst role (I mean, sure, you could take some programming and other classes on the side and build projects on the side to eventually have something to show, but that would take a lot...I'm not sure I would have the energy to have a full time job and then to spend so many hours on top of that taking very difficult classes and building projects). Again, I think it would come down to going back to school and getting that masters. 

I have a family friend who is a professor of statistics at Stanford, and he seems to recommend that I just go straight into the field and start working because he says that it would be like a 5 year journey to lean the maths (which it would because I would have to take a year or two of pre-reqs before I could even apply for my masters in stats!). 

Here's the thing though: I don't mind a 5 year journey into maths. Meanwhile, I could meet really smart people and work on side-projects and apply what I'm learning and TRULY understand what's going on with the whole ML thing. 

Hopefully this rant makes some sense at all.

What do you guys think??? Any input is appreciated. Thanks so much for taking the time to read."
gadc8l,1,2020-04-29,Quant Job - Possible Job Insecurity?,wizard_of_ozzies,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/gadc8l/quant_job_possible_job_insecurity/,"Hey Reddit,

Needed a bit of advice with regards to a job offer. I'm brand new to the industry, just coming out of a master's in computational finance from a pretty decent Uni with a background in ML and computer science.

While I was messing about with algo trading, I got headhunted at a hackathon and a few weeks later I was contacted and told he position was for my dream job: Quantitative Analyst. 

It would be a software-focused role intially, but I could transition across into the modelling and research given time, aptitude and training. It's at a major investment bank in London in the equities division, but here's the catch: It's an off-cycle internship (6-months long), but that leaves me with a seed of doubt as to whether or not the job after that (straight to associate) would be there at the end of the year. The conversion rate as I've been told by the team's manager is usually close to 100%, but this year is not in any way a normal year as I'm sure most of you are feeling it.

On the other hand, I have already secured a job (Analyst - graduate program - 2 years) in the slightly less shiny world of software engineering. The salary is also quite high, but nowhere near as much as the quant job, and nowhere near as exciting as the field. However, it's at another large bank and there's the potential of pulling of out of the grad program being a bridge burned with another major bank. I enjoyed the atmosphere there, but architecture and software aren't a thing I'd stay in for more than the 2 years.

So here's my question and my decision so far: I'm going to accept the offer, but what does everyone here think of my decision? Would a data-science focused quant be affected by the crisis? Should I just accept a less exciting job with decent pay over the possibility of a much better one? Is the manager just telling me what I want to hear to get me into the role?

In year 12, qualified to be 1 of 3 representatives for the UK at Intel ISEF, which was done through competing against 2000+ students from all over the UK. It happened so that Intel ISEF finished EXACTLY the day before my Physics A-Level exam and I ended up with a C in Physics.

So far the course has been incredibly underwhelming and unhelpful for any of the job applications I have made, and many never asked for my grades when I applied. With COVID-19 lockdowns still in place, universities are likely considering being online for at least the first part of next year and I do not think it would be worth my time or money to continue especially if it increases my chances of doing worse next year.

Ultimately, I am wondering whether to drop out and get a SWE job instead of pursue my final year to which I could come out with a mediocre degree that could hinder me more.

I have just been admitted to the MS Robotics program at the University of Michigan. However, I am finding it difficult to decide whether or not to attend the program in the Fall mainly because of the significant cost.

For background, I am just finishing up my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from a smaller university in Canada. Prices for out of state tuition in the US seem so crazy to me, so I was wondering if anyone had done the same thing, if they would do it/not do it again. I do believe MS in robotics at Michigan is beyond anything we have here in Canada and would open up a lot more opportunity in the US, but I am just trying to figure out if the money is worth it.

I plan on completing robotics masters at Michigan in the 3 semester minimum which will cost about $75000 USD (25000 per semester). But not only the tuition cost, I have been also trying to consider the opportunity cost of not working for that year, which will probably be closer to $125000 (75000 tuition + 50000 working for a year maybe?) There are opportunities in the second year to get paid research positions, so I may stay longer than 3 semesters if I receive that funding for tuition. However, I have received mixed responses from past students about availability of funding so it’s seems like a 50/50 shot at getting that financial help.

I see an MS as simply a path to a better career in robotics, and do not plan on doing a PHD at this point. I really do love robotics and working on robotics projects, and have specific interests in computer vision, perception. I have spent almost 2 years now through multiple internships during my undergraduate degree working on robotics related projects and really don’t doubt my interest in the field.

I have started looking at some jobs over the last couple months that I have been interested in and most of them would like or require a masters of some kind. However, there are also plenty of general software/elec jobs for robotics companies/projects that I think would also like. My undergraduate degree has not given me much experience in the robotics field and I think Michigan would be a really big step up and would also provide and lot of connections in the field as well as sort of start my transition to the US where there is a lot more opportunity.

I was hoping I would be able to decide if I was doing my masters after weighting the current job market but it turns out I will have to make the decision of whether or not I am doing a masters long before I will be able to start applying for jobs starting September this year. I have also considered maybe working for a bit beforehand but also don’t want to throw out my acceptance to the program when there is no guarantee I will get in next year.

For anyone who may have an opinion or extra information on this subject, maybe gone through something similar, think it is/ is not worth the investment, or any other advice you may have and can share that, that would be great.

Appreciate the help!"

I was hoping anyone could give me so advice on whether or not to pursue this program. I recently graduated with a degree in chemical engineering from a pretty good school and am staring a job in Houston this summer. During this last semester I’ve rediscovered my childhood love for programming due to the quarantine. 

I’ve been doing the OSSU self-taught courses and am really enjoying it. However for me, I feel that I am most efficient in learning when I have a more structured and driven experience. Thats not to say that I wouldn’t be able to learn from self-learning. 

That’s why I have been looking into this program as well as considering boot camps. The thing that turns me off of boot camps is that I feel that getting an internship would be very difficult since I believe internships are mainly given to university students. I know how important internships are, especially for engineering, and want to get that experience to hopefully work for large tech companies.

I however get stuck in the loop of watching youtube videos on the stuff I'm learning and you know how good the Youtube Algo is with bringing up suggestions so I keep on clicking and clicking lol

Also, do you think the stuff I mentioned above is too much to learn right now? I kind of have this notion that not knowing one thing can hinder me from getting that internship so it's like I'm trying to cram everything lol

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on this is appreciated (I'm only a freshman so I'm open to any advice thanks!)"

I go to a large, mediocre public school with surprisingly good teachers. No hooks. I’m lucky enough to be able to pay full tuition.

Intended Major: Double major with Integrated Science Program (ISP) and Mechanical Engineering.

ISP is an accelerated science-focused three year program, which requires a separate application after admittance to Northwestern. ISP “requires” AP Chem, AP Physics, as well as the Physics, Chemistry, and Math II subject tests. My fourth year would be spent obtaining a second major in Mech Engineering. 

Act: E - 36, M - 35, R - 36, S - 35 —&gt; 36 composite. Only took it one time.

Sat II: Planning on taking Math II, Chemistry, and Physics, but I was sabotaged by Corona this spring. The ISP ED app is due in Jan so I’ll have time to take these.

UW GPA: 3.97/4
W GPA: 4.17/5 (My school went pass/fail so this was hit hard)

Rank: My school doesn’t rank kids, but they give percentiles. I’m definitely top 10%.

Coursework:
W = weighted class

Freshman year- Adv Biology, AS English I, World studies, Geometry Enriched, Latin I, PE

Sophomore year- AS Chem (W), AS English II, Latin II, AS Algebra II, Modern Euro, Marine Biology

Summer after Sophomore year- Precalculus online, US History online (I did this to free up space in my Junior year schedule for AS Physics and to advance into a more interesting math class)

Junior year- AP Biology (W), AS Physics (W), AP Calculus AB (W), AS English III (W), Latin III, Photography

Senior year (planned)- Multivariable Calculus, AP Physics (W), AP Chem (W), AP Lit (W), Gov and Econ, and Latin IV or Astronomy (this last one depends on if Latin IV conflicts with multi, as the school is 90% sure it will, in which case I’ll take astronomy instead)

I don’t have a ludicrous amount of APs because my school doesn’t offer too many. I’m self studying Calculus BC right now, which is allowing me to take the BC exam and place into multi, a class I’m extremely interested in. I’m also enrolled in online CS-50 from Harvard.

Extracurriculars:

- Will be 4 years Varsity Cross Country this fall. I won outstanding runner Sophomore year and MVP Junior year.

-  Will be 4 years Varsity Track next spring. This year’s season was shut down due to Corona.

I’m not interested in playing either of these sports at Northwestern.

- One of 12 students selected out of 150 who applied for a Stanford research internship this summer. The program is still happening, but it will be online. We will be studying paleobiology and geology and learning to code in R.

- Certified SCUBA diver for 5 years with over 50 logged dives. Went to a dive camp summer after Freshman year where I was taught marine science and some environmental science. I also gained a few additional dive certifications.

LOR (all secured):

- AP Bio teacher writes a really good one, as it got me into the Stanford research program.

- AS English III teacher very likely writes a good one, as she only writes to about 7 kids, who she can say something positive and specific about.

- My Counselor knows me very well, and she can explain the Latin IV conflict as well as provide my quarter three letter grades for this year (All A’s)

Essays:

I believe I’m at least decent at writing application essays, as a few I wrote got me into the Stanford program. I’m very good at describing my passion for science in these essays.

Schools:

- Northwestern ED (~26% acceptance rate). I’m not entirely sure how competitive the Integrated Science Program is to get into, as it’s a separate application. It’d be great if anyone has insight into that. 

If you have time to spare...

- Caltech EA
- MIT EA
- UChicago EA and ED II"

3. As I move up in this feild, will I eventually need some kind of maser’s degree for data science?

1. How much support is provided to you with regards to classes? Like do the professors offer help, TAs, etc?

2. How easy is it to get recommendations from professors with large science classes?

3. If you wanted to do a research internship summer after freshman year that needs recommendations, would you say it would be difficult to get those recommendations?

4. Do most people utilize a personal advisor?

5. Would emailing enough PIs eventually get me a research position?"

Some background: studied neuroscience in undergrad and have been working in biomedical engineering field for a while, wanted a career change so applied to some MS programs and was accepted to Tufts, Cal State Long Beach, and UT San Antonio. Currently my goal is to get my MS in CS, which will be my gateway into the field of computer science, and I would like to work on AI projects in the industry after graduation. PhD is not completely out of question but is not my main goal at this point. As I do not have a formal background in CS, I would need to take a semester for a bridge/post-bacc program, then 2 years of masters.

1. My top priorities are academics and internship opportunities/job prospects, but according to some people I've talked to, they're all kind of the same academics-wise and it's more up to how much effort and time I put into it, and that school name value doesn't really mean much in the field of computer science. The courses offered are indeed more or less the same in the schools I'm considering. Is this true? If so, will the student-faculty ratio be a big issue in my being able to get more advising/learning opportunities from the faculty? For reference, CSULB has 26:1 faculty-student ratio and Tufts has 9:1. There's also the prospect of networking. Would any of the schools be more advantageous in this regard?
2. Second priority would be the financial issue. Assuming 5 semesters overall, the costs to complete the MS programs would be $67,234(Tufts), $43,723(UTSA), and $36,154(CSULB). However, I think 30k difference in tuition overall is a worthwhile investment if there is a significant difference in job/salary prospect in graduating from these schools. Cost of living seem equivalent between Tufts(greater Boston area) and CSULB(greater LA area) but San Antonio is considerably cheaper. Again, I am willing to spend extra if I see it a worthwhile investment.
3. Living conditions I don't really mind one way or the other, I love snow and didn't mind the Boston and Pittsburgh winters. This is a non-factor for me.

Additionally, I am also considering the option of transferring to a better school after completing 2-3 semesters to one of the top schools. Would this be possible/advisable if I have a sub-par undergrad GPA(3.0) but great GRE(99th percentile on all sections) and a flawless bridge/masters GPA?"

I am 28 years old. Just graduated in 2018 with a bachelors in Computer science. Initially I enjoyed coding a lot and did well for the first two years of university. Then came electronics courses (initially my major was Computer Engineering) along with a lot theoretical portion of the degree and I saw myself struggling and losing interest which also lead to a delayed graduation (switching to computer  science + a year of internship).

Long story short by the time I graduated I had lost all confidence in my coding ability. Part of this is due to my poor GPA as well. I was so lost that for the first year after graduation that I couldn't muster the courage to apply for jobs which is the stupidest decision of my life. Later I talked to a couple of friends who had graduated on time(they are now senior developer and team leads), felt even more miserable but decided to work hard and give it my all. I brushed up my basics, did CTCI twice then some leetcode and also posted projects on GitHub. (These were some basic projects, I am overwhelmed by vast growth in development world like cloud, web services, AI etc. I am at the stage where I am still a basic algorithm level of coder.) I got a couple of interviews but didn't get the job even after clearing multiple levels of interviews.

Now it has been two years since I graduated and I don't know what to do with my life. Should I pursue a different degree which could possibly be another 4 years with no guarantee of job or Is there a way that I can possibly jump start my career as a programmer.

I come from a system in Singapore that is called polytechnic. It sounds like polytechnic in the US which are really, just colleges, but poly here means it's a pre-university route right after high school that actually exposes you to a college-lite experience. 

We learn equal parts theory, equal parts coursework, and are invovled in alot of industry experience like internships and hands-on lessons. Lessons are taught just lke in college - tutorials, lectures, small classrooms. What you graduate with in a local setting already can grant you great jobs, but more people have been moving to university in recent years - I would say the equivalence of my 3-year poly diploma is like an associate's degree.

ECU

Campbell University 
- small
- close knit
- religion oriented 
- got a lot of scholarship money; costs about the same as uncc for me
- a lot of free tshirts
- potential honors college

All of these are within my price range and is not a huge issue. However, I worry about getting a job after graduation, like we all are. UNCC seems to be the best fit but so are the other schools.

gaojno,1,2020-04-29,[IWantOut] 20M Prospective Student SG -&gt; UK/EU,ColloquiallyFormal,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/gaojno/iwantout_20m_prospective_student_sg_ukeu/,"Hi all,

I'm from Singapore, and am interested in working overseas after graduation, preferably in the UK. I'm leaning towards the UK, mainly because that's were I was offered an spot for university. The EU is another option I'm considering due to their proximity (notwithstanding Brexit), but it's not a place I'm actively looking at. What I'm mainly concerned with right now is where I should go for my education. Currently, I have an offer from ICL to study Chemical Engineering and an offer from a Singaporean university, NUS, for the same course.

 NUS offers opportunities to head overseas for exchange programmes, but my main concern is that they won't offer the same level of exposure and connection. My line of thinking is that I can find internships in UK (though I don't know how easy that would be) since I would be staying there for 4 years, vis-a-vis staying in Singapore, where I would only have the opportunity to go overseas for only a year.

My goal is to gain the experience of living and working overseas, so I'm fine with staying in my local university *if it makes it easier to head overseas to work*. From what I heard from my parents and friends, it's always an option to work for an MNC and get posted overseas, but I'm not sure how common that is. Another option is heading overseas to study for a Masters, where I save on costs, but the concern also lies in the short duration I'm staying overseas.

**Main Concerns:**

1. What are the internship opportunities like in the UK for international students? As a follow-up, what are the likelihoods of being offered a job after the internship ends?
2. How easy is it for an international student to get a job after graduation in the UK? Should I instead focus on building a career in Singapore before considering moving overseas?
3. Are the odds of finding work at an MNC and waiting for an opportunity to be posted overseas better than studying overseas and finding job opportunities?

Ideally, I don't intend on coming back to Singapore after graduation to find a job/find opportunities to work overseas, as I believe I can do that in a local university."

Country I'm in, interns are paid zilch so I'm currently working in a place where there are about 10 interns per paid employee. Interns help each other out a lot and I'm used to figuring stuff out on my own, so I am learning, but I feel used. I'm also mostly doing front end stuff which I am sure I like less than back end. I started looking for work but my CV looks like a front end web dev now and I don't want that.

There is a lot of pressure to finish tasks within certain deadlines, even though we're all new and we're not necessarily getting tons of help. With the whole corona situation my mental health isn't the best, and once my hours are done I'm unable to code more. Other interns don't seem to complain about this as much though, so it could be me.

I don't know whether I should stay for the 2 months I've got left, so at least that bridge isn't burnt, or leave and take the time to build some github backend projects and hunt for work."

Will be done after junior year, Spring 2021. Could have possibly been done this semester if I threw away the DS, but I’m nowhere ready to leave yet.  Like many others, lost my SWE internship (more of a Data Scientist position actually) for the summer thanks to Covid-19.  Instead I’m going to TA a CS class and take another CS class to keep busy.  I could still intern as a SWE at my dad’s work place I guess, but it would be logistically hard (4 hours drive away and I doubt if I could work remote) and it’s a no-name place.

How difficult is it to find a good SWE position without an internship?  If I listened to my faculty advisor (we’ll call him Daddy), Daddy would say to go for a 4th year.  But I’m not sure what to really do in the 4th year, I’ll have pretty much taken every class I’d ever want thanks to being a double major.  I don’t think it’s worth $35K, but I’m open to the idea if there’s a good payback.  An MS is not in the cards, I doubt if my GPA nowadays would let me in.  On the other hand I really do enjoy the teaching aspect of being a CSM and TA. I also do feel like I’ve been robbed of my university experience for this semester and most likely for Fall, which essentially would be 1/3 of my time here.

I know, post this in cscareerquestions, but surely there must be other 3-year graduates at Berkeley that was/is in my position?"

JV sport one year, Var for same sport one year, most likely going to be on var next year as well

Essays and LOR: I can write an above average essay and I can get pretty good letters of recs from some teachers I am close to.

If you can, please recommend some college you think would be a good for me to apply to/have a look at. I know my stats and ECs aren’t all that special or especially great compared to everyone else but I’ll work on it. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated!

However I've pretty annoyed with the stupidity of this for reasons that are obvious if you look at ""real psych models"" and not the crap employers use in that cultural fit is a big deal. I've very good reasons for why that's really an illusion or does not work with other things like diversity e.t.c. However the problem I'm running into is that due to being a very unusual person in a lot of key areas its very hard for people to put me in a normal group of people, and when I mean odd, I mean really odd. The last thing I saw a clinical psychologist to ask about this stated he had only seen 15 or so cases of similar personality types and other things in his 18 years of public/private practice working with lots of different people. So the question rests how do you ""sell"" your personality when being such an odd person, its not that I can't work with people but trying to explain myself normally leads to the wrong assumption.  Maybe just creating a work personality is best."

I come from a system in Singapore that is called polytechnic. It sounds like polytechnic in the US which are really, just colleges, but poly here means it's a pre-university route right after high school that actually exposes you to a college-lite experience. 

We learn equal parts theory, equal parts coursework, and are invovled in alot of industry experience like internships and hands-on lessons. Lessons are taught just lke in college - tutorials, lectures, small classrooms. What you graduate with in a local setting already can grant you great jobs, but more people have been moving to university in recent years - I would say the equivalence of my 3-year poly diploma is like an associate's degree.

gav27b,1,2020-04-30,How to improve a small restaurant business with Data Analytics and ML,rLoper,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/gav27b/how_to_improve_a_small_restaurant_business_with/,"I was making my plans on where could I do an internship (my first) during the summer period and I remembered that my uncle has a Chinese restaurant (given that I eat there every other week, it was dumb from me that I didn't come up with that earlier). What is even more interesting is that he does the data collection (logging) and accounting and I know for a fact that he is not very fond of it and even slacking from time to time. 

This sounds like an awesome opportunity that I could use to jump in. I spent a good half an hour brainstorming some ideas (I planned to plan something more discrete later in the day) but then it came to me. Sure, I can do the analysis, set up an infrastructure for data, maybe even do some ML (it is a small business so I am not hoping on much ML), but what do I do once I get the insights?

I know that he is going to have some kind of idea but I was wondering what can I do about it, just so I complete my Data Science pipeline with a solution/s. Maybe some of you had some experience regarding a situation like this one.

I plan on calling him later in the day to discuss the idea, explain to him what DS is (most of my fam doesn't even know I do this lol) and of course, I am going to ask him for his spreadsheets so I can start forming concrete ideas and goals based on the provided data.

TL;DR So, how can data insights help a small restaurant business, and what improvements could be made? (e.g. most of the traffic happens at 8 o'clock Saturday knight, what could I do to boost the business)

Thank in advance!"

It’s been tough because we cannot use the company high power PCs so we run all our models on google GPU, which is nothing compared to running them on our computers. Because of these barriers, it takes everyone including me a lot longer to do stuff and I did get something up and running but I haven’t developed anything great yet. Despite this, I have gained a lot of experience with the software and coding. Do I still have a chance at a job from learning all this stuff or should I wait a few weeks to apply to jobs until I actually make a notable contribution?"

So ever since I was a kid, I have had weird dreams. Not the type where you wake up laughing or semi confused, but the kind that comes true. You see, at the end of every dream, I would see a small clip of something happening. Whatever I saw in that clip would happen. The things I saw were simple, like a stranger saying hi or getting a new puppy. It freaked me out at first but I got used to it. At least, until 6th grade. In this dream I was about 20 years old, I owned a black Honda Civic and I lived in New York. It was dark when I got out of work but the warm summer air was comforting. I got off the subway and started walking down the street towards my car. There were no people around but I got that strange feeling that someone was watching me. You know, that feeling of dread that makes the hairs on your neck stand up and your gut twist, I got that feeling. My head started to hurt. About 20 feet from my car, I noticed the odd silence. No crickets, cars, ambient noises, just silence. The air turned cold, ICE cold despite it being a summer night. The streetlights up ahead shut off with a *clap*. One by one the street lights turned off. Closer…. And closer until I was engulfed in darkness. That same, sickening sense of dread came over me. The intense silence was broken by the sound of footsteps, coming closer, and closer until I felt an ice-cold, skeletal hand on my shoulder. I turned around suddenly to see tall, faceless humanoid creatures who were like shadows against the night sky. Their necks were broken and their limbs deformed and mangled. Blood red eyes that stared into your soul and wide, too wide smiles with sharp teeth and blood-drenched lips. They kept twitching and jerking into more unnatural positions. I froze, I could not move no matter how hard I tried. They came closer and closer. 10 feet… 5 feet… I can feel the cold radiating off their body… 3 feet, I still can't move, 1 foot away. I Broke from their gaze and ran towards the car, my heart pounding in my ears. I tried opening it but the door wouldn't budge. I screamed but my voice was swallowed by the darkness. The figures came closer and closer, each step- no each *movement* it made instilled a new stage of fear in panic within me. My body was frozen and cold. I was going to die here. *This is just a dream,* I thought, *JUST A DREAM!* I frantically tried to wake myself up. They came closer until one puts its hand on my shoulder and opened its mouth to reveal, not teeth anymore, but avoid, a deep, dark void, the droning and screams of something ancient bouncing around inside it. Just then I woke up in a cold sweat breathing heavily. This dream continued for seven days, each time becoming more and more terrifying. But on the last day, I didn't see those *things*. I got to the car, opened the door, and got in. That's when it came, that same feeling of dread, that worm at the back of my mind digging into my brain. I looked in the backseat and screamed. There they were, grinning wider than ever before. I didn't sleep that night. I wrote that stuff down in a journal and Years passed and completely forgot about those nightmares I had. Soon enough, my weird future-telling dreams had stopped and about 12 years later I moved to New York to go to college. About a month into my fifth year I got a call from my job that I was an intern at. I was hired. I was ecstatic. Everything was going great... at least until tonight. I was coming off the train I was looking at some old journals to get some nostalgia. As I flipped through the pages I saw it, my entry from 6th grade.  I was terrified as I read the words, “25 years old, worked in New York… Black Honda Civic” Everything, *everything* lined up. Now before I get off this train I am typing this, frantically typing, trying to write down everything. I know I can't stay on, it's the last stop. I have to get off. I see the car now, that stupid black honda civic. How could this be happening? I know I’m just paranoid, delusional even, everything will be alright. It's probably the heat of summer that is getting to me. Shoot, I feel something now. I can't put my finger on it. That sense of dread, that pain. They're coming back and this time, I know its not a dream."
gaymcd,1,2020-04-30,Potential effects of delaying graduation?,Alvaroszi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gaymcd/potential_effects_of_delaying_graduation/,"Good morning/afternoon everyone, I am finishing my third year in a well-renowned public university in the US.

I used to be a Computer Engineering major but god, I hate circuits and anything related to Electrical Engineering, so I decided to switch to Computer Science. This will delay my graduation one semester so I will end up graduating in the Fall of 2021, as a result this left me asking the following questions to myself that I hope somebody here can clarify:

Is it still possible for me to get a FAANG internship next summer or do these companies specifically target juniors? Do people graduating in non-standard semesters face any sort of discrimination when obtaining internships and/or entry level jobs?

As a result, there's an EXTREME saturation at the entry and mid levels in this field.

It wasn't long ago that the only thing you needed to become an engineer was graduating with a CS degree. It seems like the bare minimum now is a degree + 2 or 3 engineering internships.

What do you think the minimum requirements will be in a few years from now? Also how will this effect self taught engineers, who are competing with hordes of CS graduates who all have internships?"

\- 4-5 years industry experience as a SWE (have worked at FAANG, a startup, and a big bank)

\- Going to law school this fall (still a bit up in the air, but will be Texas, Berkeley, or Northwestern)

Happy to answer any questions about the CSE program, the math program, working as a SWE, internships, or the law school application process.

Some semi-relevant facts:

\- I transferred to UW from community college as a sophomore. Was a math major soph. year -- was accepted to CSE for my junior year. CC grades were a non-factor there.

I tend to take two/three tries to pass classes and it's set me back a ton. I'm a CS major that started in the fall of 2014.

Right now I'm at a point where I have 7 classes left, but I have had no internships and I have no idea what I actually want to do. This semester I had to drop one of my classes and I'm failing another because I cannot focus. I've considered switching majors, but I feel like I'm way too far along to do that. However, I just have a complete lack of motivation now. I just feel completely lost.

I was diagnosed with ASD (well, Asperger's due to when I was diagnosed), but I'm thinking I have ADHD instead of or in addition to that. I also have had to work during the shutdown. Part of me feels like I'm just dumb, but I know (or at least hope) that's not the case. I'm just unsure of what to do."

I graduated with a CS degree 3 years ago. As dumb as this will sound, I took the first job I interviewed for right away with a Defense company. This is without actually thinking about what industry I wanted to be in. I simply wanted to find a job as fast as possible so I can move out. 

This will prove to be a major regret, and a huge thorn on my mental health. In my 3 years with this small Defense company, I dug myself into huge, bad habits. This place had 0 management and accountability, incorporating 0 software engineering practices. No weekly scrums, no code reviews, no mentoring, and no guidance. My software lead was never in the office, and I never heard from him. In my first year, I had coding assignments and it was rewarding, but by years 2 and 3, due to no management, the coding assignments stopped and I stopped coding. 

As I have been young and naive, I thought it was great. I was being paid to do nothing. I was living in a bubble as I went to work and either did nothing all day, or did small tasks here and there. This bubble finally popped when I realized my classmates and friends have since moved up in their respective careers. That's when I realized I dug myself into this hole, and I realized I needed to improve as a Software Engineer.

In the past 3 years, since I had 0 guidance and 0 mentorship, I did not realize what it took to advance in my career. I never coded on the side, I didn't follow with software or coding news- I was as far removed from software engineering as possible. As soon as I realized my failures, I began to make changes.

For the past couple of months, I have been learning HTML, CSS, JS, React, and Node.js as a way to break off the rust I've accumulated by not coding at work. I decided I want to get into web development and get out of the Defense industry ASAP. I've developed a basic social network site with the MERN stack so I can learn the basics of React, Redux, and creating a server with API routes that interact with a MongoDB. For my next project, I've been working on a new project using a 3rd party API so I can learn how to use 3rd party APIs.

Although it has been fun developing my personal projects, I've also begun re-learning Data Structures and Algorithms. Unlike my personal projects, every time I've tried to do DSA, it's like pulling teeth. 

I need advice and mentorship, something I should have sought a long time ago.
1. What are my next steps to get a job as a Full Stack Developer?
2. How important is knowing DSA if I want to apply for Web development positions?
3. Should I be applying for entry level positions despite having 3 years of experience on my resume? I think the answer to this is obvious, but I'd like to hear (or take a wake up slap to the face) from other developers.
4. Any and ALL advice is appreciated as my mental health has been taking a huge beating the past couple of months. I feel like an idiot for wasting my time for the past 2 years. I feel like an idiot struggling with DSA so much. I feel incredibly overwhelmed having to understand DSA and covering more web technologies like .NET, Java, C#, Python, etc. 

Thanks to all who took the time to read this."

I graduated with a CS degree 3 years ago. As dumb as this will sound, I took the first job I interviewed for right away with a Defense company. This is without actually thinking about what industry I wanted to be in. I simply wanted to find a job as fast as possible so I can move out.

This will prove to be a major regret, and a huge thorn on my mental health. In my 3 years with this small Defense company, I dug myself into huge, bad habits. This place had 0 management and accountability, incorporating 0 software engineering practices. No weekly scrums, no code reviews, no mentoring, and no guidance. My software lead was never in the office, and I never heard from him. In my first year, I had coding assignments and it was rewarding, but by years 2 and 3, due to no management, the coding assignments stopped and I stopped coding.

As I have been young and naive, I thought it was great. I was being paid to do nothing. I was living in a bubble as I went to work and either did nothing all day, or did small tasks here and there. This bubble finally popped when I realized my classmates and friends have since moved up in their respective careers. That's when I realized I dug myself into this hole, and I realized I needed to improve as a Software Engineer.

In the past 3 years, since I had 0 guidance and 0 mentorship, I did not realize what it took to advance in my career. I never coded on the side, I didn't follow with software or coding news- I was as far removed from software engineering as possible. As soon as I realized my failures, I began to make changes.

Please can we skip the ""there's no wrong choice"" because, while I know that, it does not make this choice any easier. Also I can see myself thriving at any of these schools.

About me: I love computers and political science. I love MIT for the quantitative poli sci they have and how well that blends into public policy. Their economics is so fun. Boston is IMO the best location out of any of these. I love the high energy environment, and I would definitely take advantage of the cross-registration at Harvard. MIT also has lots of classes in security studies, a topic I think I would enjoy. 

I love Stanford's interdisciplinary vibe. I could get the technical education I want and the political science debates and environment. The internships in non-quant roles for poli sci are much better than at MIT. It still has amazing technical majors. It also has great security studies classes. I like that i would be able to take classes at the law school. Though it seems to fit my academics really well, the biggest roadblock is that it is in CA. I have lived in Cali all my life and I am no excited by spending another 4 years here. I love international vibes and energy.

Yale: It is East Coast with great poli sci ofc. It does not have as easy of a way to take technical classes. For example, there is not really a cybersecurity class. There are amazing political internships and networking opportunities, but I feel a general lack of substantive research opportunities. I like quantitative political science and numbers and computers.

I originally posted my resume for some feedback on [r/EngineeringResumes](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/), but I wanted to get some more perspective, possibly from people with the same degree/industry experience.

Here's some background: graduated in Dec. 2019 with a biomedical engineering degree with two internships and project/research experience. I've been applying to position/companies since around mid-September and did get interviews but no offers. After my most recent internship ended, I really started picking up the amount of applications, with \~130.

Just wanted to get some perspective on what else I could be doing considering the current situation. I've been trying to network and a few connections actually helped me get interviews but again no offers. In the meantime I've been studying for the FE Mechanical and also trying to learn more programming.

Not sure if this is the right flair or even the right community but I’ve been here quite a while and I really like the advice given on this subreddit.

So I will get $2500 sign-on bonus and on top of that I’m expecting to get around $5000 from a shortened (6 week) internship. 

I’ve never had this much money especially within a short window. 
I haven’t received any money yet as the internship still has not started but I want to know the best way I can use the money I receive. 
There is still possibility that this company will cancel their internship but I haven’t heard too many financial services companies cancel their program as of yet. 

Currently: 

I’m a 3rd year student at a good school and I have around $13,000 in student loans 
$1300 in savings (emergency fund) 
$150 in stock market 
$600 in checking. 

Should I put money towards a Roth IRA? Max it out and wait for next year to max it out again? 

Should I build my emergency fund to 5 months ($6000 total? So $4800 to this) 

Or should I pay off my student loans?

Just wanted to compare these options because I’m having a hard time deciding! UT would allow me to graduate without debt but CMC would put a lot of strain on me and my parents (probably $50k or more in loans over 4 years), but I recognize how great of a school it is. I am considering getting a doctorate and would like to work as either a college professor or somewhere in diplomacy/foreign service. 

My academic interests: International relations, history, economics, and philosophy

Wants: Engaged student body, strong academics, access to resources and internships, laid-back but still present social scene (not into parties/hookup culture), good food, strong political and ethnic diversity, freedom of speech on campus

Dislikes: Pretentious or overwhelmingly wealthy/elite student body, dominant party/Greek culture, toxic academic competition

Here are the pros/cons:

*UT AUSTIN*

Pros:

- Much more affordable

- Not too far from home (I’m in-state)

- Admitted to honors program, which gives good bonus resources

- Location in Austin is great

- Enjoy the vibe; party culture seems present and strong, but only if you want it to be

Cons:

- Not as connected and well-regarded, though this is nit-picky since UT is a good school with considerable prestige

- Large student body — don’t mind it but it makes getting research opportunities more difficult, even in the honors program 

- Academics are strong, but not nearly as strong as CMC

- Weather isn’t the best, though it’s bearable

*Claremont McKenna*

Pros:

- Fantastic academics and research opportunities

- Fairly strong connections, well-regarded for social sciences

- Diverse, engaged student body

- Unique resources (Athenaeum, research institutes, etc.)

- SoCal weather is great

Cons:

- Much more expensive; nearly 2x the cost of UT

- Never visited before! (I don’t know what the vibe is like, so could someone speak to this?)

- Location is not as good, though LA is still very reachable

Please give some insights about why you voted the way you did if you can, especially about the atmosphere at CMC! Thanks in advance.

I am not sure if this is the right sub for this question, so please tell me if it is the case! And sorry in advance for any mistake I may make.

So, I applied for a digital marketing/content creation position on monday and I got an e-mail response by tuesday from the company asking me to tell them when I would be free for an interview by phone (us being on lockdown and whatnot). I answered the e-mail with my free times and not having an answer by wednesday I decided to call. I then had a 40-minute conversation with the recruiter, during which some things struck me as weird or suspicious:

* He started the interview by asking and insisting for about 10 minutes on why my previous job was not in line with what I had studied. Now, I majored in digital marketing and my previous job was in sales in a shop (during which I still did some community management). I started by answering in the usual way, with the fact that the company is one I appreciate and that I still did some community management. After about 10 minutes of this, I flat-out told him I also needed the money at the time, as I live alone far away from any family who might help me financially.
* After this, he explained the different campaigns and strategies they are pursuing. After each point he had something to say in the likes of ""Oh but that is not really working, so we have to rethink that"", which is weird for an agency which sole purpose are those campaigns.
* He seemed to be thrilled I was unemployed as that potentially gives some financial incentives (grants from the government, for example) to the company.
* He told me they work with a lot of interns (even though they are only 3 employees) to carry out their digital campaigns (again, weird, as a majority of their strategies rely on digital)

After the interview he asked me for my portfolio and told me he would send me a document with a series of ""tests"" to test out my capabilities in content creation. Fine, that is pretty standard here. So, I sent him my portfolio and he answered back with said document. I opened the document and fair enough those are pretty standard demands, such as creating a facebook post, creating an article, a newsletter, etc. I told them I could get it back to them by monday in the afternoon.

Now, after all this I felt weird about the company and the vibe it gave off during the interview. So I did a little more digging into the company. I found their financial statements and... they have been in the red for the 5 last years. Plus, a majority of their followers on social media (again: a big part of their work)  seem to be bought, which is not very common or honest for a company of that size and in that particular field...On the one hand it is a job I appreciate and would like to pursue, it is my specialisation. Plus, it is a job, and even if it fails, I will still have the experience.But on the other hand, I don't want to deal with complications like that, and I don't feel good about all this. My gut tells me it is a scam, just to steal my work without getting paid.

I guess my question now is ""What do I do?"" Do I follow my gut and tell them thank you for the opportunity but that I will not pursue it or do I still do the testing and go through with it?

Thank you for having read all this and I would appreciate any advice on the matter."

So I am a junior heading into my senior year. I don't have a ton of CS courses under my belt (only finishing data structures now) but I have personal experience and landed a top 5 bank to work as a software engineer internship this Summer. Prior to COVID I had my heart set on taking a year off college to do internships, thus narrowing what I am actually passionate about before my final year of studies. 

Obviously COVID has turned the world upside down. I am lucky to be doing a virtual version of the internship this Summer, but now am really unsure what the fall will look like. My questions are: do you think Fall software engineering internships still will be running (either online or in person - just operating) ? Would Spring internships? 

I had applied to Google's fall internship and I read many others received a blank we are not looking anymore email the same day as I so I wonder if some companies are starting to halt intern hiring for the fall already? (I could've easily just been not chosen - but many receiving same day is cause for suspicion)

If I cannot get a fall internship and it is hopeless pursuit I should try to plan this so I have something else going on.

TLDR: Will there be CS fall internships for undergraduate student wanting to plan ahead? Do you have any leads on these? (Or year-long program)"

I worked concurrently in full stack while obtaining my CS degree for about 2 years. In this new job market we have walked into I guess this becomes the new entry level...

Anyway, at the moment I work for a large utility company doing largely data engineering/science that is actually providing insight on the current crisis to our leadership. No layoffs to existing staff so far, but some furloughs to temporary staffers and a hiring freeze and cancellation of all internships and co-ops through 2020. 

Earnings have us positioned ""decently"" to sustain ourselves moving forward but company culture is still shot to hell. Among engineers we are no longer co-workers, we are fierce competitors. Management is asking for so much more so much faster, no doubt because of the furloughs and inability to fill roles.

However, the main reason is the uptick in layoffs from more elite companies. A department close to mine's manager was bragging that ""he managed to score a senior dev from big tech for junior prices."" Once that spread, everyone immediately got nervous. What stops them from firing us and hiring someone more experienced for less money? Nothing, literally nothing.

Today I was at my desk buried in code from 9:00AM to 5:00PM with a case of water bottles at my feet and did not eat until literally the clock struck 5.

I was making $7 an hour from 2014-2017. I left to travel and pursue other opportunities. I was rehired in 2018 and accepted a decrease in my hourly wage from $7 to $5 an hour (not including tips). I have lost my job due to the virus.

Since I don’t make minimum wage, I was ineligible to receive UC benefits in PA because I only had 17 credit weeks when I needed 18 (a credit week is a week when you make at least  $116. I only make $5 an hour) 

After I was rejected benefits, I called and asked what I could do. I was told that New Jersey reported wages from an internship I worked in 2016. A friend told me this is common for states to report wages after 2 years. I was told that I would be approved for benefits. A few days later, i receive my notice of financial determination. It stated that I now had enough credit weeks(30) , but I made too much in one quarter (the quarter New Jersey reported my wages). I appealed this decision and sent a document from my company including my entire wages and the dates. 

New Jersey reported my wages as making $8,840 in one quarter. The company’s document stated that I only made $6,630 between both Q2 and Q3. 

I had my hearing for my appeal. Brought all of my evidence. The hearing lasted 13 minutes. I have received the results of my appeal and I was denied. 

How is this possible? They stated that since I worked in New Jersey in 2016, that this cannot be considered despite NJ reporting my wages in 2019. If I applied for UC benefits in 2016, I wouldn’t have been able to use my NJ wages. Same with 2017 and 2018..

I am struggling financially and I hope someone can give me advice on how to proceed. Thank you for your time!"

I am posting on an alt account because my main account contains personally identifiable information. Thank you in advance for reading and sharing your opinion.

I'm providing the following information for context. I am graduating this semester with a 4+1 Masters in CS (AI/ML) from an Ivy with a reputable CS department with an undergrad GPA of 3.7 and a master's GPA of 4.0.

My original plan was to go immediately to a Ph.D. program after graduating from undergrad, but I was rejected from all programs. I re-applied last winter, but was rejected once again. This was a major blow for me, since I have done only research internships throughout undergrad, and a Ph.D. has always been in my plans. I attribute this to my relatively low GPA, lack of major publications, and lack of one-on-one relationships with the advisors I applied for (mostly the latter). Unfortunately, my 4.0 masters GPA and my recently accepted first-author publication in a journal with JIF &gt;3.0 came too late and were not included in the application.

I now have a job offer from two institutions. One is a ML Data Scientist role at FAANG. The other is a ML Data Scientist role at a national research institution that I've interned at. As you can imagine, the former's compensation is higher (although not *overwhelmingly* so; a \~$20k base salary difference).

My questions are as follows:

1. How big of a disadvantage would I be at if applying for a Ph.D. after three years at FAANG compared to three years at a research institution, if any? I won't be publishing any papers at FAANG.
2. After being rejected for two rounds, should I even continue pursuing a Ph.D.? While I love research, I also think I'll be comfortable/successful in an industry implementation-focused role.
3. If I do go for the research institution but decide to continue in industry, I can always re-recruit for FAANG with my credentials and additional work experience, right?

Apologies if my questions seem naive, I have practically zero experience in industry. I also realize that these questions have no right answer; still, I'd appreciate any perspectives and questions I can ask myself.

Thank you very much."
