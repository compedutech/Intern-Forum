Right now I'm one year away from graduating with my bachelor's CS degree with emphasis in IT, along with an associate's degree in Information Systems (have some CompTIA certifications and CCNA). My fiancee just got a job at the college I attend, and because of this, when we get married I will be able to get all my classes through PhD for $20 a class plus $5 per credit in every public college in the state.

My main career goal is to be in networking or network security, but I don't really know how to go about getting there. So far for my employment history I have done a 1.5 year internship as helpdesk (which ended) along with being a tutor (Info systems, math, web dev, and CS mainly) for 4 years at my college.

So here's my dilemma: Should I finish out my BS through distance learning and try to get a full time IT job or would I be better off getting a random (or related if I can find one) part time job while I finish my BS degree? Either way I'll continue on to get my Master's degree in CS with emphasis in networking/network security, but if I get a full time job the Master's degree will be at a slower pace. My fiancee said that she doesn't have an issue being the main breadwinner if I choose to do all in-class work, if that makes any difference."
j5itn,2,2011-08-01,"men and women of reddit, what are your views on marriage in todays age of such a high divorce rate?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j5itn/men_and_women_of_reddit_what_are_your_views_on/,"i grew up with the image of eventually finding someone i loved and getting married and settling down and having a family...  how young and naive i was back then... high school came around and i found out that although my parents were(and still are) happily married, the majority of my friends parents were either divorced, separated or not on speaking terms...  now i will tell you this: i grew up in orange county california, lotta rich people and bratty teenagers that expected their parents to give them everything.  and in that process they never realized that their parents were making money such an issue that it became a strain on their relationship and their marriage...  i began to question the actual concept of marriage then.  now i cant say im a child of poverty, nor was i ever in the lower class or even the middle class really... upper middle.  but i NEVER took handouts from my parents. NEVER.  i bought my own car and waited til 18 to get my drivers license... i worked from the day i turned 15 for 3 years to buy that car... never will forget it... 

when i got into college i began to see another side of the relationship story.  all my dates expected me to drive, pay, and cater to their needs.  and for a little bit i did exactly that...until i realized that the only  thing those girls saw in me was money. not my charming personality or my intelligence or my ambitions. so i stopped dating for a while.   during this time i wasnt doing as well in college as i would have imagined... too much inapplicable bullshit courses that had no reason to be in the program i was taking.  i saw this as a waste of the money that my parents had been putting aside for my college tuition since before i was born...  i saw the big picture and was ashamed of myself horribly. also seeing the strain it was putting on my parents i said enough was enough... and dropped out of college after the 2nd year.   never told my parents my reasons, but almost immediately i noticed their marriage become easier.  

so i worked for another 4 years doing work that i saw going nowhere, and gaining life experience and relationship experience, meeting some pretty amazing women in the process.  took a trip abroad and met one absolutely amazing individual that we shall name natalie for sake of anonymity.   stunningly gorgeous, smart and funny... lived close to me and had similar interests.  when we got back from the trip, i had a newfound perspective on service to country... so i did what i probably should have done when i graduated high school and joined the military... now in the interim time between me signing up and shipping out, me and natalie lived together and grew ever closer... she supported me joining the military and i supported her progress thru law school.  as time came for me to ship out she promised she would not only write me at boot camp, but she would fly out to my graduation from boot.  

boot was tough, but not terrible,  as it is meant to be.  quite a few of my fellow recruits were married or had  loyal partners waiting back home for them. most wrote to their SO and pictures and stories were compared... i personally think i had one of the better ones... mine sent me a carepackage with cookies. the commanders had intense fun making me do pushups for that one whilst they munched the cookies(i later found out that that was her intentions all along as she had written a note hidden in the cookies telling my commanders that the cookies were for them and to whip me in shape)  a few dear john letters came for other members of my squad, and a ring was returned.  i felt bad for them ever so slightly.  graduation was just around the corner, and i received a letter from natalie saying she wouldnt be able to make it to my graduation because she was taking her LSATS on the day of my graduation.  oh well she would be there when i was on leave from boot...  so for the next 7 days(leave) i spent time with her again catching up and telling her about boot...  those 7 days passed and i had to report to my specialty school up in norcal for 6 months.  she said that she was getting an internship that would allow her to travel to norcal on a regular basis.  good deal.  

spec school was cool i guess  learning stuff directly relevant to my rate and specific job i would be doing later.  same thing with the whole relationship thing... some friends made new relationships, a few were broken... i didnt think too much about it, mine was great... every 4 weeks natalie would fly up and wed spend the weekend off base doing whatever we wanted. wine tours in napa and sonoma, san fran, bed and breakfasts...  i was in love with her...  so i planned on springing the question right after i graduated.  got the ring, and made the call 3 months before graduation.  she said that in a week she would be taking the BAR exam and shed make a trip up to visit.   she passed the BAR and then called me saying that she would be making an impromptu celebration trip to europe with a few of her fellow BAR graduates.   first making a stop in norcal before flying over...   

so here comes the ugly part... i got a phone call one day from natalie, saying that she needed to talk about her coming to my graduation, but she disconnected.  i then received an email explaining how she met a guy over in italy that owned an art gallery, and that she didnt know how it happened but she fell madly and deeply in love in a course of 1 week...   she wouldnt be coming to my graduation, she wouldnt be speaking to me again, and she was sorry... i couldnt believe what just happened...   world stopped turning for a few days... performance suffered in classes and i had to be relieved as class leader.   worse, i had to return the ring.  just kinda numb for a week or so...   graduation rolled around and my family came, and i kinda had a moment where i almost lost it...  but pulled thru because i was going to my next station which was on the other side of the country and i wouldnt have to worry about interaction with natalie.

flew out here to miami to start a new life, and enjoy my newfound bachelor life.  been here almost 2 years.  lots of fellow military men and women that i know have met future spouses, fallen in love, gotten married and or gotten divorced, and i look at the dynamic of marriage as outdated.  i havent found someone that i can honestly say i would bind myself to for the rest of my life.  i can see myself as someone who lives with someone, and love them without seeing the need for marriage, but still have the dynamic without the legal mess of who gets what in case we split or it doesnt work out.   i dunno  maybe ive just been hit with such a shock that my way of thinking just needs an amazing woman to get me back on the right track...


if you read this wall of text that describes my adult life then thank you.

if not

TL;DR: do you believe that in todays age of infidelity, greed and immaturity, a marriage is necessary for a healthy long term(or life term) relationship? "

My girlfriend's uncle got me a position as an internship for a branch of the company he works for. They only hire hourly positions through a temp agency so after they decided they liked me and interviewed me they sent me to the temp agency. I am making $10 an hour and my wage and maximum hours are up to the company not the temp agency.

(the sister company I work for only has about 10 ppl working)
I have worked here for 3 months now and talked with my boss about moving from the temp agency to the company. He said it was a great idea and when my supervisor gets back from vacation we can hammer out the details. He also asked about school I told him I was full time and am taking night classes and an online class. Getting my bachelors in Computer Information Systems with an emphasis in Programming.

So what can I expect in the hammering out of details? What pay should I press for? How much less should I expect without a degree? If anyone has any advice or similar situations plz share!"

I want things to get better.  I've waited 9 years for things to get better and they haven't.

I don't even know where to start in explaining what's wrong with me.  It's all blurred together.  Nine years is a lot of recapping, so I'll start with when I lost my job in December 2008.  It was the lowest point in my life, and I lost my car and I had nowhere to live except for my emotionally abusive grandmother and it was a miracle I survived the situation.

Then one day, in early 2009, I realized I had let my family control me for my entire life and that wasn't working out for me.  I was going to do things the way I wanted for once.  I went back to school as a film major because it was something I cared about, and most jobs just require a bachelor's degree with no specification in what it is.  I have plenty of work experience, except I was fired for a bullshit reason that's really hard to work around in interviews, I just never got my bachelor's.  Nobody cares about my AA in Liberal Arts.

Anyway, I went back to school and things were great at first.  I was stressed because my rent was late more often than not, but I was doing well in my classes, I was making new friends, I got a great internship almost immediately, and I was happy.

But I was unemployed.  I gave up many internships because of my search for a real job as my unemployment was about to run out.  I still had financial aid, but it barely covered my bills.  Then tuition kept going up.

I like being a film major.  I find work within my field easily, except that none of it pays because I'm so new.  I was going to make my own film in September.  But I still don't have a job.  I'm pretty sure I'll never have one.

I never can pay my bills.  It's stressful.  My relatives don't help.  The ones who would can't, and the ones who can always wait until it's too late to say ""Why didn't you ask for help?""  Part of why I've put off killing myself is because I didn't want to hear that question when I inevitably failed at something else.

I'm going to be homeless, which I honestly don't have the strength to do.  I don't eat anymore.  All my bills are late and I'm still in debt from losing my job nearly 3 years ago.  I just can't do this anymore.

I try to be happy.  I love school.  I enjoy working on film sets.  If only I could even get a job at McDonald's I could survive.  I haven't even had a job interview in a year.  My own school won't interview me for any on campus jobs.

But I really can't do this anymore.  I have a bottle of whiskey and two bottles of sleeping pills with my name on it.

TL;DR I'm going to kill myself on Saturday because I'm in self-destruct mode."

   here is my situation, from the very beginning of my college career, i was a enthusiastic kid, having been granted to go to a great out of state engineering college.  i decided i wanted to major in bme, and going in, it was a great idea because it was what i wanted, to be a physics major, and what my parents and grand parents wanted, to be a medical student.  The first year I maintained alright grades, I'd say around a 2.8-3 GPA, but coming around my second year of college I messed up big.  At the time I was trying to find myself and my own niche of society, somewhere I could always be comfortable, because honestly as a kid I grew very timid, and staying within status quo.   The second semester of my sophomore year, I decided that i didn't care about what I did.  I felt sick at studying, I just wanted to be free of deadlines, free of tasks, I wanted to take a break...and the end result is I flunked that semester, miserably, I was instantly put on probation, which basically meant that if the next semester I did terribly I would dropout.  I knew I was spiraling towards problems and I knew my lack of effort would kill me, yet I didn't care.  The next semester, I dropped out of college, told my parents that I simply didn't care or didn't want to try, but I knew my mistake and would make it up to them.  That summer i took classes, got all As, got a internship somehow in the fall, and came back in the spring looking bright.  Of course when you come back you get placed on probation and a contract, the contract states that you need to get back on track, don't do terribly and get back to a good gpa, at that point i was sitting on maybe a 1.8 and needed to get back to a 2.  However problems arised, that semester I always did things last minute, I always wanted to play, and sadly that semester i got around a 2.3, which meant I could stay in school, but I needed to keep doing better to be on good standing.  The summer, the same happened, i procrastinated, did things last minute, and when it came down to it, i ended up with around a 2.2, and was still on probation.  Finally that junior fall came around, one of my best friends died, i suffered hard from this, and for a couple weeks just didn't feel good, but I realized i needed to do well, what kind of life would i be living if i didn't try my best, and live life for the both of us.  However, when it came around to the end of the semester, I realized I had dug too deep of a hole, yet somehow, at the end I pulled out a great grade and passed, and in the end I was able to get on good standing, finally in my junior spring.  That spring, I decided, I am okay, I can do well I'll take hard classes.  But then I started to repeat my patterns, I would try really hard in the beginning, then start to slack off, always thinking tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow, this eventually lead to me thinking to myself, oh its just one bad semester next semester I'll make it up.  That semester I did terribly got a 1.8 and was put back on warning.  Which basically meant if i did bad, i'd be put on probation, but if i did good, i'd go back to good standing and be okay.  THen that summer came around, I tried my butt off in 2/3 classes, and that third class I practically failed, putting me back onto probation.  Then that fall came around, and I did the same thing, always thinking I can bail out last minute, and basically escaped dropping out that semester because one of my teachers changed my grade, and i came back.  Last spring, I did well on two classes, but did poorly on the other two, because agian, i pushed things back and did things last minute.  Fortunately for me I was given a chance when one of my teachers decided that he would change my grade so that I can stay in school... And all this, winds down to summer.

This summer I need decent grades, I'm taking two hard classes.  I am borderline C, and to be honest this summer I worked hard to begin with, then slacked again.  Well 1/2, one class is a lab and i tried my butt off but in the end I did poorly because our group was shorthanded than other classes, and one of our guys ended up missing half the semester because he broke his nose when he got mugged.  Now I'm stuck in a predicament where I have to ace both my finals to get Cs or I maybe on the verge of dropping out.   


Note:  all of the 100k+ that i am in debt in, is being paid by my grandparents, which I am very much indebted too..yet i feel no remorse when I do poorly, which is something I am very concerned about.

this is also a problem, because my grandparents think that I am doing well, when in reality I am doing terribly, and I don't know how to break it to them.  My grandparents love me extremely much, and disappointing them is heartbreaking.

Another issue is that I don't wanna hurt my mom again, she stresses more than I do, and to be honest, I want to make her proud.

I love the people i live around now, they have inspired me to become a much better person, and in that regard a more knowledgeable person about the future, my life.  The only problem is I absolutely hate my work ethic, its something I have been trying to get around, it's like a endless procrastination habit that I can't kick, which I would want to blame my friends, but I know it's my own responsibility, that I don't do work when I should.  

TL:DR
    I did poorly in school, because i have a procrastination habit, and find hard motivating myself to work.

my question for you reddit is what do i do if i drop out again...  

i have pondered what my options and i don't really know.

i want to stay here where i am and maybe start working a job with a highschool degree...yet I know i am capable of much more than this.  I am smart, just bad at managing my time.

i go home and take community college at a place i don't like, feel out of place, because i personally think that I'll be associated around people who aren't as intelligent as i am and hate it because i'll have no friends, but I know i'll do well, because I am pretty much stuck to doing only that.

i have also contemplated suicide...many times...the dishonor and problems of it all bother me, and knowing i can't live up to my reputation when all my friends are succeeding hurts me a lot. and probably the most.

the thing holding me back is that i love my family, and knowing how my best friend lost his life and how his family grieved, i can't allow my family to suffer a loss of happiness and debt.  :(

what options do i have?

P.S. i hope i don't sound like a douchebag, i'm really not, i just have lots of problems with my pride and mentality right now, and feel that i may have lost it all.

edit: i also want to say that I feel like i abused the emotions of my teachers, always begging them to give me special consideration at the end of the semester.  i hate it.  i am embarassed of it, and would rather be emailing them about actual help."

Finally, after a couple of dates she seemed to be interested and we had the fabled first kis.  College kids did what college kids things do best, and things were happy. Eventually brought up the idea of being exclsuive to her, she seemed interested, I knew she had never had a serious boyfriend, so I was trying to do the ""right thing"" and take things nice and slow.  She agreed, ""facebook official"" and everything.  A couple days after this, she freaked out, said she wasn't ready for this, not enough time, too busy studying for a graduate school test etc.  I said that's fine, we can just get rid of that last part and not officially date.

Next day, go to a college party with my friend Cougar, at a university she went to for her undergrad.  Cougar introduced me to her best friend Zebra.  Cougar told me that Zebra had recently broken up with her serious boyfriend of a couple years, and needed to start hooking up with cute guys.  We all started drinking, had a good time.  Being college kids, we did what college kids do best.  Woke up the next morning at six, and drove us all home.  Talked to Zebra every now and then, but she lived hours away so nothing came of it.  I thought things with Koala were done, but it turns out they weren't exactly...she took her test and we spent a lot of time together and it was great.  School finished, she went back home.  Still not explicityly exclusive or officially together...

Cougar has been dating the same guy, Chimp, for about 4 years. While he was away on an internship, he got drunk, did what college students did best, and slept with some one he shouldn't have.  I ended up spending time with Cougar to comfort her/be there for her etc.  Go there the first night, she is looking mighty fine in a little grey dress, and ready to go.  I tell her no, recluctantly, but still cuddle with her, which I would do with any friend in need.  Talk to Zebra on the phone, Cougar wants to fuck me apparently to get revenge, and have some fun on the side.  I tell her this isn't happening, she is too good of a friend, and i just recently had relations with her best friend.  We spend a week together of going out with mutual friends, nothing happens.  Fast forward two weeks.  Zebra is at home doing her think, still sorta half with Koala, Cougar still with boyfriend.

Cougar's little sister, Ant, came into town, and all my friends were out of town, so I ended up spending a lot of time with the three.  Drinking happened, college students did what they do best, I hooked up with Ant the first night she was in town, while Cougfar was busy sleeping on the couch.  Talked to Cougar in the morning, and she was fine with this, we had talked about it ahead of time.  Cougar has been dating the same guy for four years, and we've been good friends for about one.  A week after the first hook up, us three are at my house again, drunk.  They don't want to drive home, so we decide to all stay.  I have a queen, so we all pile in.  I sleep in the middle.  Cougar falls asleep.  Ant and I do what college students do best, quietly of course.  Fall asleep.  I wake up and Cougar is cuddling up to me, wrapped aroudn my arm/hand.  I am confused by this, but stroke her face and go back to sleep.  Wake up again and she is nibbling my hands, instant male reaction.  Confused, end up kissing her, and fall asleep, with a sister on each arm.  Hook up with the little sister a couple of times, she goes back to home.  Zebra and Koala are still doing their own thing at home, Cougar still with the boyfriend.

Don't really talk with Cougar about that night, we are talking in Cougar's bed one night after a good bike ride, end up giving each other a back rub, natural male reaction, end up making up, manage to stop before going any farther.  Say it won't happen again.  hanging out another night, find out that she actually aksed her boyfriend Chimp, to have permission to have sex wtih me.  He said no. Chimp + Cougar are still together, Zebra is doing her own thing, Ant is busy doing summer school, and I still am half with Koala.

I have already done what a college idiot does, and now want to do what an adult does, what do I do?  My end goal: stay friends with Cougar, and stay with Koala.  **Also, I know at least two of the girls read reddit...**


**TLDR: I sorta have a girlfriend, I drunkenly fucked my friend's best friend, then her little sister, cuddled with the two sisters at once, and then made out with the older sister...am I going to hell?**"

* **Plan A :**


Around June 23 : We get legally married in Austin (me under J1 visa)

Around July 28 : We go to France (me under J1 visa)

Around August 7 : We come back to the USA (me under J1 visa)

The problem with that would be on the way back to the USA. J1 is a non-immigrant visa. If the US customs see that I am married to a US citizen, then they would very much doubt that I don't want to stay in the USA permanently and possibly won't allow me to re-enter in the USA.


* **Plan B :**


Around August 2011 : We get legally married in Austin (under current J1 visa)

Around September 1 (back to France) : We apply for a visa CR1 -&gt; 8 to 12 months

Around March 2012 : We hope very much that I get the visa...

If I get it on time, I can do my internship and am almost a permanent resident, able to travel in and out of the USA. If not, I'm stuck, cannot complete my master degree (internship), and very possibly can't start my phD.


* **Plan C :**


Around September 2 : We apply for a visa K1 (fiancé)

Around March 2012 : We hope very much that I get the visa... -&gt; 5 to 9 months

Around March 2012 : If I get the visa, I land in the USA.

Around March 2012 : We get married legally

Around March 2012 : We file for an Advance Parole (allows me to leave the USA and come back) -&gt; 2 to 4 months

Around July 25 : We hope very, very much that I get the Advance Parole

If not, we can still go to France, but I cannot come back.


* **Plan D :**


Around June 23 2012 : We do not get married legally, thus no Church.

Around July 25 2012 : We do not get married legally, thus no Church.

Around August 7 2012 : We can come back to the USA and get legally married

Around August 7 2012 : I am a permanent resident, if i fill a change of status form, etc








I'm not subject to the 2 years home residency after J1 visa. I will have a functionning J1 visa when I go back to France with my then wife to celebrate with my family.
Being married at a church is important for us, at least traditionnaly.



I know it looks like a boring post, and it probably is, can't compete with kittens with visa stuff. But if one of you has experienced that, or has any helpful advice, we will be glad ! I just want to live with my wife.

Please excuse my poor english, I'm not really in the mood for being careful with my writing."

I've done engineering-related internships for the past 4 summers (3 at a National Lab, one at a top 10 software engineering company), and they've been interesting - but not something I can see myself doing for the rest of my life.

jafrg,3,2011-08-05,The woes of my internship,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/jafrg/the_woes_of_my_internship/,"So I just so happened upon the Engineering subreddit today and it perked me to ask about one of the issues I've been struggling with recently. 


First, a bit of lengthy backstory.. (don't worry I'll provide TL;DRs you lazy asses!) 

I've had this internship for a little more than a year now and got in after my freshman year thanks to some beneficial networking. For the first six months, I did mostly what I would expect interns to do which was mostly technician-type work to build understanding of equipment (I'm an EE Intern in the RF industry so Oscilloscopes, Network Analyzers, BERTscopes, etc. for some background), SOPs, etc. It was a pretty good gig for 12 dollars an hour as a not-yet sophomore in college. 

**TL;DR #1: My internship was going well**

Between the time of the initial 6 months and my anniversary, I began to inherit some pretty big projects. I was tasked with redesigning a half million dollar tester and at the time it started it was relatively low priority. It was my first major coding project and my manager expected it to take longer than it did. Since automation is still in relative youth in my industry, I also became responsible for writing the core generic classes that would be used by the other engineers, so it was a relatively large undertaking for one person. 

**TL;DR #2: I took on big projects and lots of responsibility while in school.**

This is when things start becoming a little hairy. From start to finish, I've become the sole EE on the project on top of the other work (statistical analysis, product tracking across our multinational plants, dealing with customers and vendors alike, etc.) I began to take on as I garnered more experience. I've trained technicians, engineers, and foreign nationals on many of our processes and routines (some of which I've helped to create) as well as expedited lab testing and other areas the EEs tend to stay in. After my year anniversary, I was given a quite shocking 3 dolllar raise and everything seemed to stay at business as usual. I was personally too excited with the fact that I was a student making this much money to realize what else was happening. 

As summer comes to a close and the school year gets ready to start back up, I can't help but feel a little fearful at how much I've actually taken on, and that I'm getting shafted in terms of payment and benefits. In addition I have been working close to 55-60 hours a week for the entirety of the summer since I've had to deal with mission critical issues. Is this normal for engineering interns or am I an exception? I can't help but feel like I should be agitated and expecting much more than I am handed. Hell, my manager was out on business in one of our production facilities and I ended up filling in for him during a conference call with one of our biggest customers. 

I've put myself in a position where I'm perceiving that I'm less expendable than many of the other engineers in the facility. Currently, I'm less worried about the rest of my academia (I'm on full scholarship with a relatively high GPA, so losing it isn't my worry) and more worried about the pressure I'm about to receive from work. Any advice on any of this?

**TL;DR ALL: What started as an internship feels like its prematurely developed into me being a full engineer. I'm afraid I'm being taken advantage of and that expectations are going to be high of me during the school year.**

Anyway, I have a question about engineering jobs and was hoping for some advice.
My wife recently graduated with a 4 year degree in Mechanical Engineering. She can't find a job. Now I now the economy is crap, so that might be the main reason. She's applied for probably 40 jobs or so, and has not even gotten an interview. Most companies seem to want lots of experience and ignore her because she hasn't worked in the industry (even the ""new graduate"" postings ask for 3 years exp. MESSED UP!).
She had great grades, had an internship, impressive senior project etc.
Also I should note that she just about got a job at an Air Force base right out of college, but government cutbacks prevented her from getting that. 
Thanks for reading, and any advice would be great! I am just trying to do anything I can to make sure she works as an engineer and stop working at a grocery store at minimum wage.
Oh almost forgot; her desire is to eventually work in aerospace engineering, but we can't afford to pay for more schooling at the moment (we can barely pay for groceries and rent). We are also located on the west coast. Thanks!!!

tl;dr wife engineer can't get a job, any ideas?

EDIT:
Thanks for the advice so far! I know part of this is going to be patience; it's just one of those things where we're barely scraping by, and in a couple of months we gotta start paying student loans off (I already did a forbearance). If we don't get better paying jobs by then, oh boy. "

I've never been so willing to learn (this summer I couldn't get an internship so I spent my time working towards learning Java, C, and VHDL). I came into college not knowing at all what I'd like (started EE) and found what I love!

So anyway, aside from my romance, I've now got a major scheduling mixup because I switched into CE one quarter after everyone else. I am pretty far ahead in math and physics, but behind in computer science courses. To fix this and get myself back on track, I'm planning on taking Spring quarter off (once I'm caught up with CS) and going on co-op. I'm looking for something pretty new. In other words, I live on the East Coast and I'd like to get out to the West Coast. If at all possible I'd like to be working for a giant at some point in the next couple years (MS, Google, Apple, NVidia, Intel, Qualcomm, etc.).

Does anyone have a recommendation for West Coast internships for someone with these courses? [Read only the first page of this](http://www.ce.rit.edu/academics/RIT_CE_BS_flowchart.pdf). As I'm ahead of my peers, I'll still have to take a Summer co-op even if I don't go in the Spring, but in that case I'll have taken the first column of courses [from this list](http://www.ce.rit.edu/academics/RIT_CE_BSMS_flowchart.pdf).

I figured learnprogramming would be the best place to put this since I am learning how to program anyways.

Few recommendations were given: sysadmin, PC repair technician, intern, or any part time job.

Apparently, sysadmin pays well, even without a BSc in computer science. Though I always thought sysadmin positions were full time and not part time.

A couple of my friends recommended that I get CompTIA A+ certified and just work as a PC repair technician for the time being. On average, A+ certified technicians get $16/hr, which is pretty good IMO considering that I used to work at Fry's service department for computer repair services at $12/hr.

Many people recommend that I become an intern, but there are a few problems with that. 1.) I dont' know enough programming to be of any use to any companies out there. 2.) Most internships don't pay for work. Those that do are very difficult to find. I need some sort of income to help pay for the rent, school, and other expenses.

And then finally, someone I know who already works as a programmer in the real world told me that work experience in general is still a good thing. In my mind, I thought that computer-related jobs would help make my resume look better.

Any suggestions, comments, and thoughts are more than welcome. I recently moved into a new area (Raleigh, NC) and am deciding on what kind of part time job I should get."

I did an internship this summer in comp sci, and while it was ok, I didn't get the same feel out of it that I do out of acting.

For years, the voices in my head keep telling me to drop everything and run to Hollywood to pursue a career that I love and I know I'm good at. I'm graduating this fall, and I'm not going to run off before then, but I honestly don't know what I should do. When I graduate college, I'm 99% sure I'll have a job that pays at least $55k a year. My plan was always to save as much money as I possibly could, and if I haven't settled down in 5 years, to move across the country to Los Angeles and try to make something of myself as a professional actor.

I really want this, and am willing to wait as long as I need to be ready. What are some things I can do right now to prepare myself?"
jewrs,0,2011-08-10,Need some guidance.,ImposterChild02,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jewrs/need_some_guidance/,"Hey there guys. I'm a recent graduate with a degree in Finance, and I have a few questions about how I should go about finding a job.

A little background:
* I have no prior experience working with my major (no internships, etc.)

* I know how cliche this sounds, but I get along well with many types of people, and I'm trying to say that with as little arrogance as possible while still conveying the truth

* I do have job experience, however it's been in hospitality industries (I worked at a ball park concession stand/worked as a Residential Advisor in the dorms of my campus)

* I feel as if I would have good references from these past jobs.

I know this sounds really pathetic, but I'm wondering how I go out and look for a career-type job. All of my other past employments have been practically handed to me with minimal effort on my part, and I'm not experienced enough in job searching, so I'm extremely overwhelmed. 

* Are there online agencies for Financial job listings (for people with little experience)? 

* If it turns out I need an internship, how do I look for that instead?

I know I have more questions, but I just can't seem to formulate them in my embarrassment. Thank you."

jeddh,4,2011-08-10,How does one pick up the pieces of their life after a breakup?,solidsnake106,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jeddh/how_does_one_pick_up_the_pieces_of_their_life/,"Hey Reddit,

So, I was with this girl since high school (2006). She was my last minute prom date which turned out to be the love of my life for the past five years. When we were together we had some of the happiest moments I have had in my life. We met each others families and to everyone it looked like we were going to marry each other and live happily ever after. She was the one to motivate me to get out of retail and get a job in my field of study (computer science), I got a pretty good paid internship with a company doing database work; and I was saving that money up to by a ring and ask her to marry me. I guess I should tell you that we have been in a long ditance relationship almost the entire five years. She went to college 2 hrs away and we would see each other on the weekends. Then last year she went to grad school up near San Francisco when I'm near LA. We saw each other as much as we could and talked on the phone everyday.

It all went wrong last December, when for no apparent reason she just broke up with me. She told me to move on and stop calling her. Two months later she calls begging me to take her back, saying she will do anything to make things right again. I took her back and we were happy, for a while. Then I found out two weeks after we had broken up she had started dating her roommate and co worker. I didn't know what to think, and she assured me that she didn't sleep with him (go ahead say it, everyone else I tell does). When I found out, I didn't talk to her for a week. When we talked again she said she would do whatever it took for us to get back to normal and for a while I was able to put that aside and love her again. I told her to kick the guy out  of the apartment and find a new roommate, and to never talk to him again. And she did everything I asked.

Fast forward to end of July. We were still together, but we argued a lot. Mostly about her wanting to be able to go out to bars in clubs whenever and with whoever she wanted. She didn't feel like she had to tell me that she would be out till 3am clubbing. She locked her cell phone when I was around and before we used to openly allow each other to go on each others facebook, she refused to let me go on hers. I felt that she was hiding something and the paranoia caused me to be more on top of what she was doing up there.

Last week she called it quits, said that she didn't want to be with me anymore because it just wasn't working out. I wanted to try to fix it, I wanted to give it a shot, but I feel she just gave up. I have been thinking about her non stop this past week hoping that she was thinking of me too, and that she would call or text, but nothing. I asked my sister to check up on her on FB since she was still friends with her on there. I found out that she's perfectly fine, going about her days like nothing had even happened. Better yet, she unblocked her ex-roommate that I had told her to not talk to anymore and they're talking on FB again like the day after we broke up. Makes me think she locked her phone and FB because she didn't want me to know they were still talking.

So right now Reddit, I feel empty. I feel like the last 5 years were a waste, fake, they meant nothing to her. I don't know where to go from here. How do you just move on when you had your whole life invested in this one person that you thought was going to be your future? I loved her unconditionally, I devoted my life to her, but I realize now that I didn't mean as much to her as she did to me. I know I'm young (23), I know there are other fish in the sea. I tried to get back up on the horse as they say by checking out my other options, but what do you think? Should I just take a time out from relationships and just be me? What do you suggest?

Questions, comments, funny pictures to make me feel better. Anything you got please share, it'll help me to get through this.

****TLDR** Although you're missing out on a tale of unrequited love, betrayal and misery. I was with a girl for 5 years, a girl I though I was going to marry. Last week she broke up with me saying it wasn't working out. Realized from FB she was probably cheating on me and my heart is ultimately broken. Where do I go from here?**"

Long story short I have heard many different accounts. I basically want to know what kind of differences the job market has for these two majors. I want a valid opinion  so I came here.

I am not wanting to know because of the typical ""WHICH WUN MAKES MOAR MONEYZ??!"". I am worried that one or the other is going to limit what I am really interested in (Robotics).

jfeno,2,2011-08-11,"Having gotten the shit end of the stick growing up, I feel crippled by loneliness and depression. Has anyone gone through similar circumstances and can share some wisdom?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jfeno/having_gotten_the_shit_end_of_the_stick_growing/,"I grew up in extreme poverty (having been homeless on multiple occasions since age 10), and through hard work I was accepted to a decent University to study engineering on a scholarship. 

I am depressed because of all the troubles in my past, and find it difficult to connect with people at this school, most of whom have had stabler upbringings. I am fit and have hobbies, but since opening my heart to people would burdening them with my troubles, I only end up with a few close friends. Many people think that i'm narcissistic and choose to ignore me. I understand, I appear distant and stoic. I bury my head in books, and tell myself that it will all pay off in the end, although it really sucks sometimes. I am very lonely. How can I ever be friends with someone if I have to hide myself? Most people at least have family who can provide sympathy and support, but I don't even  have anyone like that.

My more outstanding classmates all seem to know what they are doing. They have family connections that help them in class and give them internships that lead to better opportunities. I am stuck working at retail jobs because that is all the experience I have and I am not outstanding enough to earn top internships based on grades. I cannot do unpaid internships because I need to bring home a check. 

I tell myself that we play the best we can with the cards that we are dealt. I tell myself that hard work will solve my problems. But the world isn't as simple as that. In high school, bullies undermined my diligence by calling me a tool, robot and such. Maybe people still do behind my back. The worse part is, they have a point. Do people like me ever get a break? Does all the character and strength I built ever actually help me get farther in life? 

So there, I got it out there if anyone cares enough to read a lonely soul's plea for help. If you feel you have something to say that can make me feel better, please do share :)"

I'm taking the GRE in September and the GMAT in November.

I have the following options, and I'd really appreciate any input on which are crap, which would help me get into finance, investments, the business aspect of finance, etc.

1. Apply (and hopefully get into) Berkeley's MFE program through Haas, then try to get a job. Also, I only know as much about the program as is on the website, so any insight would help.

2. Get an MBA, try to get a job. I'll shoot for the more prestigious schools, but obviously there's no guarantee I'll get in. 

3. Get an advanced degree in math or a hard science, and then try to get a job.

4. Go into industry after I graduate and just hope to land a job in the area I want, work my ass off, etc.

I have always liked embedded systems, many of the internships and projects that I have done have included them extensively from design of the board to the software on the MCU's (albeit very small MCU's and simply systems). 

I would like to get into the medical device industry mainly in the software field (still close to the hardware). Doing something that directly benefits others is what interest me about it. I imagine that it would be hard for me to break into this industry with my current background. 

It seems like this option, even if jobs are available is going to be relatively more limited in opportunities for me than other similar non medical device positions. Would I be doing a disservice to myself by looking to break into the industry later when I have more experience(in a related non medical field) or should I try to start in the industry? Or, am I completely off base with my approach?

Have any of you guys had to cope with this? Howso?",seracera,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jgi47/ive_now_been_dumped_by_3_different_guys_because/,"So, tonight I was gently 'let go' by another sweet, charming guy after being supportive of his career and helping him cope with the stress, talking him through things. He claims his promotion will no longer give him time for a relationship, and that he feels bad that he has to choose between his career and his relationship.
This is not the first time this has happened to me.
The first time, I helped this adorable guy get a paid internship at an architecture firm. He's Korean and was concerned about his English, so I helped him frequently when we were together, editing his emails, resume and other correspondence with the firms, and yes, it was a lot of work. He was offered and accepted an internship in Manhattan. He didn't maintain contact with me after he went.
The second was a really lovely man, older than I am, whose work took him back and forth overseas. I listened to him and helped him figure things out for his promotion. We got along so well, his personality's great, we had good humour, but the story is the same.

I don't know how to feel now... Even though it's ended amicably every time, having this occur three times is finally getting to me. I know I am a reasonable, understanding person, I'm humourous, I look good (though I'm not perfect), I'm well-endowed, I keep myself clean and groomed. I know I'm a decent package, but apparently it's not enough. I hate that I was there for each of them, but the moment they achieved their goal and excelled, they no longer returned the favour.
I'm angry, but I can't really fault them for wanting to be successful in their careers. I just am saddened because they didn't value me enough to fit me into their plans. I'm not sure how to deal with my emotions now.

Any of you who've had this happen, how did you deal? Does getting angry or telling them off have any effect?

I think I have a decent skeleton but I could really use some input. I am not currently trying to get a job but would love to apply for a handful of different internships in my area in a summer or two. These internships would be for a zoo and some nature centers in the area.

I have included a club I am not yet a member of but will be joining as soon as I can sign up to join. I will not be sending this resume to anyone until after I have joined the club I'm just working on it because I think it is a good idea.

I'm not sure how to include some of the things I have done outside or work and class. I do a lot of reading on dog behavior and I'm not sure if that is something I should put. So far it has been where I have learned the most about behavior. I also help out friends and family sometimes with their dogs but I haven't helped anyone one-on-one yet. I do plan on doing so eventually but I am not sure where I would put that.

Also I'm not a fan of my computer skills section. It seems like something I should have but it doesn't seem to fit in my resume.

Thanks for any help."

I have always liked embedded systems, many of the internships and projects that I have done have included them extensively from design of the board to the software on the MCU's (albeit very small MCU's and simply systems).


I would like to get into the medical device industry mainly in the software field (still close to the hardware). Doing something that directly benefits others is what interest me about it. I imagine that it would be hard for me to break into this industry with my current background.


It seems like this option, even if jobs are available is going to be relatively more limited in opportunities for me than other similar non medical device positions. Would I be doing a disservice to myself by looking to break into the industry later when I have more experience(in a related non medical field) or should I try to start in the industry?

S had been dating a guy, broke up with him, and they started dating on the down low about 2 years ago.  I found out after the summer had ended and was shocked, but got over it.  The three of us were good friends, but I'm obviously closer to C, who I've known most of my life.  

C and S were working together at the same camp this summer, I didn't come back this year because I had an internship.  A few weeks into the summer (they've been dating for almost 2 years at this point), S says she's kind of into this other counselor and just needs some time ALONE to think about their relationship, etc.  So they go on a ""brea.""  C is crushed, but goes with it.  They get a weekend off, and S comes back with hickies all over her, and it comes out that she's been hooking up with this other girl.  

So I hear about all this and it just hits me really hard.  I'm shocked at first because I can't believe S would do something like that, then freakin pissed at S for hurting C so terribly.  I almost called S and cussed her out, but stopped myself.  I visited camp for a night the day after I found out.  I got the whole story from C, and S had the balls to come up and say hello to me like nothing was wrong.  I was relatively friendly considering the situation, but underneath I was still pretty livid.  

As some time passed, I was less angry and more sad because I had lost a good friend in S and never really got a chance to hear her side of the story.  But now I don't feel like I can talk to her without betraying C.

So I'm really at a loss of what to do.

TL;DR: Friends dating each other, one cheats and they break up, don't know what to do about the friend I lost."

I know it may be strange to try to go from Lit to CS, but I've heard of it being done before.

So my question is, what skills should I have already going into an application for a Masters program in CS?  What are skills that I can develop over the next few years so as not to be a liability for a class' momentum?

Secondly, what of these, if any, would you recommend learning in a formal environment rather than by self-tutelage?  I'm certainly not opposed to pursuing an A.S. in CS or accumulating certifications if that's what's needed first.

Thirdly, I suppose-- School: Is it necessary?  If I can land an internship along the line and develop a personal portfolio of good work, could that be enough to enter the field?  Is the degree more powerful than experience when it comes to job security?

And I suppose I must ask this: Is my question pointless?  Would no self-respecting CS program ever accept a bookworm like me?

joif2,1,2011-08-19,Lawyer/friend is reluctant to pay for technical consulting,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/joif2/lawyerfriend_is_reluctant_to_pay_for_technical/,"A friend of mine who has been employed as a lawyer for about a year asked me to take a look at some documents regarding one of his firm's clients. His client was involved in something with computers, and no one at the firm knew much about technology. Being one of my best friends and being myself an IT professional I took a look at some of his documents. I actually met with him a few times and discussed things I thought might be useful to their case. My friend then said his boss would like to hire me as a kind of consultant and my friend said that I'd get ""like $1000."" I agreed to that (not in writing!) and stopped at their office after work a few times to get updates on the case and give input on any new evidence. I found out that the firm actually had another hired computer expert (apparently with about 30 years experience), so I fed the firm's intern some ideas and had him pass along it to the expert (I've never met the computer expert they hired).

When the trial was approaching, my friend asked if I would be able to sit in on some of it. I was hesitant to agree, but he said I would be there with the computer expert, and he sounded like they were desperate to have as many tech-savvy people in court as they could get. I agreed to sit in for one day.

I ended up having to take a personal day off from work (the day after my new boss started!) to sit in on the trial, which was a decision I did not take lightly. I told my friend this and he said he would tell his boss about it so I would be well paid.

On the day I sat in on court trial, the computer expert never showed up. The only people with any computer knowledge on our side was me and one of their young interns. And the intern kept trying to get me to confirm these ""findings"" he made that day. For example, he found that there was a shared folder on a computer, and that it meant that a server had control of this guy's computer! Something which I knew wasn't true but even if I did, it would be crazy to be agree to it being that the evidence was shown to me DURING A 15-MINUTE RECESS FROM TRIAL.

Despite that craziness, the trial that day seemed to go OK. My friend's boss presented his case with confidence (they didn't use any crazy arguments like the shared folder thing). That day was the end of my participation.

A couple days after the trial ended I asked my friend when I could get paid. He said he'd talk to his boss about it, and that I could probably get ""like $500"". Awesome, a pay cut and I missed a day from my main job. A week after that I asked him again, and he said he'd talk to his boss about it, but that ""the firm isn't doing so good financially.""  

The weekend after that I caught up with my lawyer friend and some of our other friends and we watched a ball game together. I couldn't believe it when he actually started a conversation with the other guys about how he was probably going to get a raise at the firm! I said ""where's my money!?"" And then he said he was working on that. I didn't make a scene because my other friends were there but I was mad.

A few days ago I had dinner with my lawyer friend (along with our other friends) and again I asked him when I was getting paid. He said ""yeah...you're probably going to have to make us an invoice."" Someone at our table then said ""like he hasn't done enough for you already?""

So.....one of my best friend's is sounding like a slimy lawyer. Besides public humiliation and sending an invoice, is there anything else I can do to 
1) get paid and 
2) not totally alienate someone who has actually been a really good friend in the past

I know I was naive and I should never have agreed to anything for money without first signing a contract. It's not like I'm hurting for cash, but I feel like I've been taken advantage of and personally insulted from a good friend."
joi07,52,2011-08-19,I never open the shades any more.,irisea,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/joi07/i_never_open_the_shades_any_more/,"Three months ago, my boyfriend Seth and I moved to a small, nice area in Maryland to be closer to my summer internship. Neither of us are from the area. It was hard finding a place to stay for so short a time, and we didn't have an opportunity to check out places before moving in. We managed to lease a small studio apartment and were surprised at how new it looked, how nice everything was. We counted ourselves lucky. The only problem was the windows. 

An entire wall of the apartment is just a series of large glass windows. Our apartment is down the hall and off on a corner, so our windows look across into the hallway, and when you walk down that hallway, you can see straight into our apartment. It was unnerving to realize that. They are the only windows in the apartment though, so if we want any sun at all we have to open the shades.

The first month and a half were fine. As I said before, everything was really nice. The only time I felt uncomfortable was when the shades were up and I could see someone walking by. I wrote myself off as paranoid, but still kept the shades closed for the most part. That the shades were difficult to pull back down because they often became stuck only added to the list of reasons not to open them.

Then one night, I sat in view of the window eating strawberry ice cream and watching The Princess Bride with Seth. The shades were up that night; I had watched a particularly nice sunset from the window sill earlier, and was too lazy to pull them down again. I was enjoying myself until I heard two loud thuds on glass. Shocked, I looked up immediately in time to see a man's silhouette lean back from the window in the hallway and run off. Heart racing, I turned to Seth and asked if he saw or heard that. He had no idea what I was talking about, but closed the shades when he saw how frightened I was. 

This is about when the weird stuff started happening.

Again, our apartment is a studio, so we don't have a bedroom area. Instead we set up a small bed against the wall in the back of the living space. We face the door when we go to sleep. The hallway outside is always lit, so when we turn the lights out the door is outlined with a thin golden line in the darkness, and the peephole is represented as a little yellow circle.

At night, every so often, I can hear foot steps dragging across the carpet in the hallway, and the peephole disappears to black. It feels like forever before it returns to its golden yellow state. And when it happens, I'm frozen. I don't know who's on the other side, and I really don't want to know either. Sometimes the door handle starts to turn before stopping. Sometimes I can hear the scraping of fingernails slowly descending the wood of the door.

It always seems to happen when Seth is already asleep, since it happens when he takes naps, too. I don't bother waking him up for it anymore. I don't think he believes me.

Things have also been weird on the inside of the apartment. When we come home from work, doors are closed that we left open. One time, all the shades were pulled up.

I never open the shades any more."

So this year I'm going to start applying for internships to some of the higher-tier companies (google, microsoft, amazon, etc.) and I'm pretty frightened.  I'm not really sure what to expect and how to prepare for these.

In hear algorithms and operating systems are often talked about often in these and unfortunately I haven't taken these classes, I will be during the school year but I'm afraid most of these interviews will take place either before or during these classes.

I've got an internship now but the interview process was very informal and not very difficult (just some questions on databases and web programming).  I figured I've got a decent shot at landing these interviews but I feel like a lack the specific knowledge that most of the companies are wanting.  So I'm asking what should I know?

There is the ocw algorithm lectures but I heard you should take discrete mathematics before an algorithm class, how true is this?  And if it is necessary are there any good resources online that for discrete?  I have Discrete Mathematics by Richard Johnsonbaugh and I've been going through that a bit but I would like to follow a course outline if at all possible.  Also what algorithm resources would you recommend other than the ocw lectures? I've seen a lot of people with [Introduction to Algorithms](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313802674&amp;sr=8-1), is it any good?

And lastly what about operating systems?  Is this absolutely necessary or should I focus most of my efforts into algorithms? I have copy of the free OS textbook posted on r/programming, is that worth sinking time into? Thanks!"

I specialized in healthcare law, basically gearing my curriculum to train me as a compliance attorney for a hospital, and also did a couple of internships working directly under attorneys in that very role. I'm fairly confident in my resume for those purposes, but I'm afraid that the spartan design law resumes are expected to have is going to work against me when some random person in HR is the first in line to see it (which is going to happen at any major hospital).

I'm currently focusing my search on legal and non-legal jobs with employers in the healthcare industry here in Houston (the medical center is the biggest in the world, so it's a pretty decent pool), so I think all the experience in hospital environments will be relevant even to non-legal positions in healthcare.

Although it was a rather premature relationship, it was definitely pretty serious. We were staying for days on end at each others' houses and he introduced me to his family and showed PDA in front of his family/friends (which, I came to find out, he never even did with his exgirlfriend of 6 years). We would spend weekend nights in the city, go out to the expensive bars and clubs, and overall just really enjoy each others' company. He is very sweet, passionate, caring, and very intelligent. He also is about 6 years older than I am... which is a little different for both of us but we connect fairly well. In all honesty, if I were to pursue this relationship, I could see it going very well. 

Well, I left early June to Mexico for a 6 week study abroad program and right before I left, he had me promise him that if anything happened with any guys while I was abroad that I would tell him. I promised. I never expected anything to happen and I don't think he did either, but it was precautionary since we weren't anything official. Just dating/seeing each other. Very casual.

Everything in Mexico was great. About the 2 1/2-3rd week in, I found out that one of the guys (we're gonna call him Bryan) in the program has this huge crush on me. So, being the awful partying young adult that I've become, I took advantage of this knowledge when we were drunk and I made out with him... very intensely. Being single, young, abroad, and every other excuse I can imagine, it was all innocent for me. Well... just before this incident, Bryan and his friend (Tom) had met these Mexican guys (they're brothers) while at a bar and I was introduced to them. So later that week I ended up drunkenly making out with one of the brothers (let's call him Pedro -- and for the record, I had never had a drunken hook up like this before Bryan. I'd only kissed people I had any serious interest in.) and both Pedro and Bryan had hickies on their necks from me... Pedro knew about me via Bryan and Tom and knew that Bryan had this huge crush on me so he knew everything that had happened already and was fine with us hooking up. Well, Bryan wasn't too keen on it. But that's not too important. So after the first hook up with Pedro, we start hanging out a lot. Like everyday after classes/comida and we're going out together with our friends and just enjoying life. Neither one of us had any intentions of anything serious, we both knew it was just drunken hooking up. Well, the school program ended but I stayed for a week and a half longer because I wanted to travel some more/spend more time in Mexico. During that time we hung out even more than before... it was all day every day. He would come over at like 7:30am before his college courses just to say hi and wish me a good rest of the day. So, naturally, feelings start to develop. Both of us were a mess the first few days after I'd left Mexico. He has some really serious feelings for me and I feel as if I just have some puppy love crush... but I'm just not sure?

So... I never got around to telling Eric what happened because the only means of communication I had while abroad was sending him messages online, like e-mail. And I figured that telling him via the internet was a really shallow thing to do. So I decided I would tell him once I got back to the States. Well... I arrived... and still haven't told him. I 100% plan on telling him but I have yet to figure out HOW to tell him and how many details to offer up. I'm not sure if I should wait until I move into my college apartment and he visits me... or if I should call him... or what. I really like Eric and am excited to be back home so we can resume our relationship but at the same time, with Pedro, we talk absolutely everyday via skype and although I try to pull back on the affection, he is very open with it and talks about how when he visits me and the friends he made (like Bryan and Tom, because we all go to the same college) that he's going to sleep in my bed with me (nothing sexual, just cuddle and cute stuff like that) but I have firmly told him many times that he's to sleep in my second bedroom on the futon. Pedro and I have discussed multiple times the boundaries of our relationship and we've agreed to just go about our own lives as usual until we meet up again and then we'll see how it goes. He is very much still hooked on me and my friends who are still in Mexico tell me how he always talks about me, smiles when he talks about me, etc.

So I'm really confused about many things:
1. Most importantly, how do I tell Eric and how much should I tell?
2. I still feel really cloudy on how my emotions and mine and Pedro's ""strictly friendship"" boundary mix.
3. I realize it would be really foolish, but I feel almost like abandoning something great with Eric to hope for something in the future (nearly impossible, I realize -- but I've been planning on an internship in Mexico for months now) with Pedro.
4. WHY AM I SO MUCH MORE INTO PEDRO THAN ERIC RIGHT NOW?!?!!?



TL;DR: Was seeing a guy in the States before leaving for Study abroad. Made brief commitment that I'd inform him if I hooked up with anybody. Hooked up with two guys abroad- failed to inform Eric. Many complications.

",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jsg89/brother_is_always_saying_im_starting_arguments/,"Hello /r/askreddit,

I'm hoping you can help me out. I want to maintain a good relationship with my younger brother but he is so stubborn. We are 8 years apart (I'm older) and our parents are deceased. That is why I want to be in good terms with him because he's all I've got.

Well, I feel I am walking on thin ice when I talk to him. Whenever we talk, I have to be so careful with what I say or else he'll shut off because he thinks I'm starting an argument. Yes, we've had quarrels in the past but we're brother and sister and we were younger. I'm trying to change that.

An example was when I was asking him for his school schedule. He just started college where I used to go so I wanted to see his teachers names so I can give him some handy tips. Something so simple. Well, I asked him weeks before school started and he has yet to show me it. I text him a few times and he says he will share it with me but never gets around to doing it. I text about other matters but he doesn't really respond. So I ask him:

""How busy can you be for you to consistently leave my messages unanswered? :/"" 

""Its cool that you want to argue."" and he replies. I'd reply back: 

""Since before you started school, all I wanted was to see your schedule but you have yet been able to do this. I babysit all day and I am also an intern. I cook and clean yet I'm still able to respond to my messages and calls because I care. Now, I'm not implying that you don't care, I'm just wondering what in the world are you doing over there? :/""  

And he'll shut down again; no replies.


... Wat. And it's always like this! He always assumes I want to fight him. It is driving me nuts and sometimes makes me want to cry. We once spent half a year not talking to each other because of this, and I don't want to do this again. He always finds some reason to think I'm trying to fight him or finds some reason to not talk to me. What gives? I just want to be his sister...

Any advice?

I am a 3rd year Software Engineering student at a well respected Engineering College with a 3.8 GPA. At first my fellow students and I were a bit frustrated that everything was in Java, but it seemed like no big deal, and that we would learn the fundamentals. However, as college progresses it seems like I barely learned any of that. Last semester I went through a basic Data Structures class where every single student that went through the college program got completely screwed because weren't prepared in the programming aspect from our 3 previous classes. We had talked about recursion for a total of 1 class and I could barely work with objects. Of course, people who had worked on their own or even in high school found the class simple.

I just got into an Operating Systems class that expects me to know C and UNIX yet we have no classes that even teach C, and we have just touched on UNIX. I looked through the curriculum and all of the basic database and library knowledge I am expected to have even for a fucking internship will never be taught to me in any of my college life. So that means I should be learning libraries, databases, new languages, php, and all of that in my spare time. Every single kid enrolled in the CS program is going to have a hard time getting a job if they only go through the college program. I would have started in High School but it was not something that was even offered.

My question is, if I'm paying these people 10,000 dollars a year and putting my whole self into getting good grades in these classes is it wrong that I should expect that to be enough training to get a good job? "

While i've been in the US i've been renting a room in this guys apartment.

When i first moved in, he was okay nice to me. We talked some, but not alot 'cause if it hadn't been for me renting his room, i would never have been friends with him. But we got along fine.

At some point, something went wrong. I don't know what 'cause as i said, we really didn't talk that much.
All of the sudden he was really arrogant towards me. He would Talk down to me when i asked him something, sometimes he wouldn't even answer me and and all in all he was just really mean. 
He would do stuff like doing the dishes EVERY time i took a shower, so i wouldn't have any warm water. He would even hold dinner partys where he would invite all of my friends but not me. (Of course my friends wouldn't go!).

I never mentioned anything about this to him, as i really didn't care. I would just keep to my own room when he was home and avoid him as much as possible.

But now, that i'm going home in a short while, i've been asking him to give me back my deposit for the room.

I haven't broken anything in the apartment, and the room is cleaner now than when i moved in.

But here is the problem: He won't give me back my deposit for the room. Even though we had an agreement that i would get them back when i moved out.
His argument is that he, according to the law, can keep the money until 30 days after i move out.

When i ask him if he is gonna give me the money back 30 days after i have moved he's answer is: ""Maybe. If you haven't ruined anything.""

We have had really big arguments over this, and i am now pretty sure that he is screwing me over and i'm never seeing that money again.

I am so pissed about this and is seriously thinking about trashing the room before i leave. I mean really trashing it! So it would cost way more than the deposit to fix it. So he wouldn't even be able to rent it out to a new roommate. 

I have to be at the airport really early. So i could trash the room while he is asleep. If i do it without making any noise he won't even notice anything until he wakes up the next day. At that time i will be sitting in an airplane on my way to another country. I know it is illegal, but i just really wanna get back at him.

jv8fo,4,2011-08-26,How to get over the hump and get more interviews?,Skunkwerks1949,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jv8fo/how_to_get_over_the_hump_and_get_more_interviews/,"Reddit, I need some advice.  How can I get more interviews?

First, some background information. I graduated in May with my B.S. in Public Health along with a minor in Business from a Big 10 school. My grades were solid, with a 3.0 something GPA, but also not stellar enough to be recruited into a position. So I have moved back home and have been job hunting ever since.

I have read a good number of posts on /jobs about marketing yourself, networking, and other opinions on how to get your name out there. I like to think that I am doing those things. So I figured I would post what I am doing, and perhaps get some critiques or advice on how to better my job search. Hopefully this post will also serve as help for the rest of us college grads having the same problems I am having as well.

My Process:

My specific area of interest is in healthcare administration, but I assume it is the same for most professions. My previous work experience is very minimal, being an internship last summer. Therefore my resume is rather bleak. Rather than sitting around being useless, I have been volunteering with the American Red Cross, which I have listed on my resume as well. I like to think that my resume is clean, organized, and easy to read. My cover letter is well written and to the point; highlighting my educational skills, my strengths, and expressing my desire and enthusiasm to work hard and learn.

So what do I do? Well, I have been scouring the Internet for hours a day for job postings. I know sites like Careerbuilder and Monster are practically advertisement engines, but it’s a quick way to look for anything of interest. Past that, I have been looking at all local hospitals, long term care facilities, rehab centers, and anything else in the medical field that has open positions in the business (non clerical) side. I will fill out an application, submit my resume, and wait a day. The following day, I will make a follow up call to the company.

Here is where I have been finding my problems, the call. I will call the HR department, introduce myself, and state that I am calling about XYZ position. 90% of the time the HR person on the other end is dumbfounded as to what to say. So I usually just get the standard, “we will review your application and give you a call if you meet our needs”. If I delve deeper, and ask if the hiring manager for the position is available, that I would like to at least introduce myself and express my interest, I am either told they are not available, refuse my request, or promise to pass along my interest. Great……

In the past 3 months, after I would guess 250+ applications, I have had 1 interview. This was with a large health insurance company for an entry level support position. Unfortunately the interview went rather poorly. The interviewers were incredibly stiff, reading questions directly out of their packet. Most of the questions were of the “describe a time at your previous job that” or “tell me about a time when you had to” sort. I was rather creative in my answers despite my limited work experience, citing examples from school projects, a few experiences from my internship, and even some social experiences. I felt that I was quite collected and on the ball. Needless to say, I didn’t get the position, I was told they wanted someone with more experience….for an entry level position.

In summation: I search out positions (including positions through friends and family), apply, make a follow up interest call, and have been getting nowhere. I receive plenty of auto-generated emails a week later with the generic “we are pursuing other candidates”. I am volunteering, studying for some certifications to strengthen my resume, and planning on going back from my MBA in the spring (which is still useless without work experience).

I’m not trying to complain and act like the world is out to get me, but it is hard to not be frustrated and disillusioned after a while. Reddit professionals, what changes should I make? How can I start getting more interviews? I am open for changes in my strategy, but I am at a loss in what should be changed.

jv5ju,2,2011-08-26,"Reddit, please help me cope with my huge fear of making new friends",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jv5ju/reddit_please_help_me_cope_with_my_huge_fear_of/,"A little background information: 23/female American living abroad


I'm no stranger to making new friends. In fact, I'm quite the socialite and had no prior fear in making friends. However, within the past year have left me a little bit traumatized. 


I moved to Finland two years ago (on the 31st of this month) and I made really great friends - the best friends I could ask for. I've had no problems going places by myself: camps for uni, parties where I know no one, etc. However, last autumn came a group of about of 70 exchange students. I became very close with about 20 of them. As they were exchange students, they left after one semester, leaving me completely heartbroken and depressed for about a month. 


This was the first part. During the spring, I was so put off that I avoided the following group of exchange students in the spring. My boyfriend has mentioned that this already worries him that I'm limiting myself. But I, instead, focused more on strengthening my friendships I already had. Now, my degree programme requires one semester of study abroad as well as an internship period, totaling in 10+ months abroad. This week, my closest group of friends has left me. 


Again, I'm left completely heartbroken. It wouldn't be so bad if I were also leaving to go abroad because everything would be new and exciting. But the fact that I've been left alone here while all of my friends means that I have to carry on my normal life with a huge gap. 

Therein lies the problem. I've been left two times in the past year, and it has only increased the anxiety of making new friends now. I have the option of making new friends this year, but they will also be exchange students who will leave in December. And I really don't know if I can take the heartbreak again. 

I don't know what to do. And I really don't know how to cope with being alone like this, with all of my close friends being abroad. So I'm asking for suggestions on what to do, or just some advice. 


Thanks for reading. 


**TL;DR  I've been left by a close group of friends twice within the past year and have now developed a fear of making new friends in fear that I will be left in heartbreak again.**"
juw4f,0,2011-08-26,Need advice for a 21 year old (me) at a crossroads in his life,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/juw4f/need_advice_for_a_21_year_old_me_at_a_crossroads/,"Sorry for the long post!! I'm pouring everything into this one giant post.

**Background**
I live in Central, NJ (yea I know) and am an Accounting student currently attending a ""target""-4 year university in Central, NJ for Accounting students. About 3-4 months before I was scheduled to graduate in May 2011 (with 122 credits, not the 150 required to earn the CPA license), the idea of studying a health profession (doctor or pharmacy) popped into my head. (I haven't taken one pre-health class: Gen Chem, Gen Bio etc)

At first I just brushed it off hoping the idea would leave, because I assumed almost every college student goes through the period of ""do I want to do this for the rest of my life"" phase. However, the idea didn't leave. It stayed and ultimately influenced me into cancelling my graduation in order to try both science summer classes (at the same time) this past summer of 2011.

You can assume what happens next. I had to drop both Gen Chem 1 and Gen Bio 1 classes (don't laugh please) because I was inadequately prepared for 8 credits in one summer session and refused to earn a C in intro classes such as Gen Bio/Chem.


**Modern Dilemma**
After 4 years of studying Accounting, I'm torn apart as to whether or not to work towards becoming a doctor (requiring the science classes at a 4 year University) which carries with it the hard work and satisfaction of curing sick people, or studying pharmacy (option at a 2 year college) which allows me to study the material which I enjoy. Medical school prereqs can be done in one year (difficult but not impossible) plus the MCAT.  Pharmacy prereqs requires 2 years no matter what plus most schools require the PCAT.



**FAQ + Answers**
""If you truly do not like Accounting, do whatever you enjoy because it's your life, not your parents'.""
I am literally 50/50 torn apart, and feeling the pressure from my parents to get a job to earn $ after 4 years. I would like to use my Accounting degree to earn some money.


""Don't switch careers just for the money""
I won't lie and say money had nothing to do with it, but I am looking more for the next-best enjoyable career, that comes with a financial peace of mind resulting from the unstable stock market (no I do not own stock).


""Businesses always need Accountants no matter how bad the economy gets*
That may be true to some extent, but it seems that those accountants that are ""always in demand"", are those with years and years of experience or those recent graduates with Cum Laude+ GPA's (recruiters know how they earned those GPA's and choose to ignore it). Not as much for those trying to obtain entry-level employment into the ""Big 4"" firms with no responses.


*The Opportunity costs are Enormous! Are you sure you're willing to give up your Accounting education to go 180 degrees into a completely field?*
Trust me, I'm aware of the amount of pressure I've received for even mentioning this idea in the first place.


*What if it doesn't work out? Will you go back to your Accounting degree with years of lost experience?*
Maybe I'm being pessimistic, but with my 122 credits, and no job offers after 4 years, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Everyone else seems to be getting job offers with almost relative ease.


*Once you pass the CPA exam, you'll be getting offers no problem*
Under current rules, a candidate, in addition to 150 credits, must have one year of experience working with a CPA firm to earn the license. That cannot be achieved without a job.


*Everyone's struggling right now. You're just not trying hard enough*
I'm aware my assertiveness may not be as strong as I should've been, but even in today's economy most students that learn a ""skills"" major such as accounting, engineering, pharmacy etc., seem to be getting offers without great difficulty. Even internships were extremely difficult to obtain.


*You've been influenced by someone/something or have been hanging out with the wrong group of people*
This actually holds merit because within my nationality, a lot of people are pre-med/dental, pharmacy, engineering etc. I only pray that there's no discrimination from firms against an accountant who doesn't fit the norm. If I were to switch majors, I would most likely receive support of people within my nationality, because that's what people do in the real world.


Hopefully I've covered everything and am eager to read everyone's response! =)"

Is there anything I can do to have her actions deemed unjustified?,skyylineddrive,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jwb4s/my_emotionally_unstable_roommate_is_trying_to/,"This situation all started on Facebook two days ago when she mistook a joke I made during [this conversation](http://i.imgur.com/H44JH.jpg). I wasn't trying to start a fight, I was simply trying to play around with her. I started a new 60 hour+/week job on Monday which means I get up at 2am every day, so I've been getting less sleep. She works a few hours a day doing internship work in grad school, though her workload isn't intensive whatsoever, she just tends to stay up all night watching Netflix.

After this conversation transpired, she sent me a dozen texts that were insulting and condemning, ending them in that as the master tenant, she can kick me out. She refuses to talk to me in person, only through text, and is absolutely unreasonable and immature. At this point, she keeps saying I have to get out in 30 days after giving her a letter stating I'm leaving, or go to mediation through the rent board, which seems extreme for something so petty.

She regularly goes to anger management (which apparently isn't helping), and she admitted to me after I moved in that in the past she has done drastic things while she was enraged. She's already gone off on me once, and after that it was a few days before I even began talking to her again and she acted as if nothing had happened. One instance of her unstable temper involved chopping off her hair when her on-again/off-again boyfriend broke up with her.


Do I want to stay living with her? Not in the slightest, since she's proven just how batshit crazy she really is. Still, I feel like this situation leaves me on the crap end and I honestly just want to find out if there is any legal way of proving her actions unjustified. I only moved in a few months ago, and never even signed a lease or rental agreement because she ""never got around to it"". Our last argument involved her trying to disallow my boyfriend to spend the night with me  while hers stays over a few times a week, as well as her friends who drink in the living room until late night every other day. Upon moving in, I was supposed to receive a parking spot, which never happened.

As the master tenant, does she have any justification for kicking me out when she is the hostile one just trying to throw her power around in a fit of rage? This is all happening in San Francisco, by the way, which I'm sure matters when it comes to legalities.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

**Background**
I live in Central, NJ (yea I know) and am an Accounting student currently attending a ""target""-4 year university in Central, NJ for Accounting students. About 3-4 months before I was scheduled to graduate in May 2011 (with 122 credits, not the 150 required to earn the CPA license), the idea of studying a health profession (doctor or pharmacy) popped into my head. (I haven't taken one pre-health class: Gen Chem, Gen Bio etc)

At first I just brushed it off hoping the idea would leave, because I assumed almost every college student goes through the period of ""do I want to do this for the rest of my life"" phase. However, the idea didn't leave. It stayed and ultimately influenced me into cancelling my graduation in order to try both science summer classes (at the same time) this past summer of 2011.

You can assume what happens next. I had to drop both Gen Chem 1 and Gen Bio 1 classes (don't laugh please) because I was inadequately prepared for 8 credits in one summer session and refused to earn a C in intro classes such as Gen Bio/Chem.


**Modern Dilemma**
After 4 years of studying Accounting, I'm torn apart as to whether or not to work towards becoming a doctor (requiring the science classes at a 4 year University) which carries with it the hard work and satisfaction of curing sick people, or studying pharmacy (option at a 2 year college) which allows me to study the material which I enjoy. Medical school prereqs can be done in one year (difficult but not impossible) plus the MCAT.  Pharmacy prereqs requires 2 years no matter what plus most schools require the PCAT.



**FAQ + Answers**
""If you truly do not like Accounting, do whatever you enjoy because it's your life, not your parents'.""
I am literally 50/50 torn apart, and feeling the pressure from my parents to get a job to earn $ after 4 years. I would like to use my Accounting degree to earn some money.


""Don't switch careers just for the money""
I won't lie and say money had nothing to do with it, but I am looking more for the next-best enjoyable career, that comes with a financial peace of mind resulting from the unstable stock market (no I do not own stock).


""Businesses always need Accountants no matter how bad the economy gets*
That may be true to some extent, but it seems that those accountants that are ""always in demand"", are those with years and years of experience or those recent graduates with Cum Laude+ GPA's (recruiters know how they earned those GPA's and choose to ignore it). Not as much for those trying to obtain entry-level employment into the ""Big 4"" firms with no responses.


*The Opportunity costs are Enormous! Are you sure you're willing to give up your Accounting education to go 180 degrees into a completely field?*
Trust me, I'm aware of the amount of pressure I've received for even mentioning this idea in the first place.


*What if it doesn't work out? Will you go back to your Accounting degree with years of lost experience?*
Maybe I'm being pessimistic, but with my 122 credits, and no job offers after 4 years, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Everyone else seems to be getting job offers with almost relative ease.


*Once you pass the CPA exam, you'll be getting offers no problem*
Under current rules, a candidate, in addition to 150 credits, must have one year of experience working with a CPA firm to earn the license. That cannot be achieved without a job.


*Everyone's struggling right now. You're just not trying hard enough*
I'm aware my assertiveness may not be as strong as I should've been, but even in today's economy most students that learn a ""skills"" major such as accounting, engineering, pharmacy etc., seem to be getting offers without great difficulty. Even internships were extremely difficult to obtain.


*You've been influenced by someone/something or have been hanging out with the wrong group of people*
This actually holds merit because within my nationality, a lot of people are pre-med/dental, pharmacy, engineering etc. I only pray that there's no discrimination from firms against an accountant who doesn't fit the norm. If I were to switch majors, I would most likely receive support of people within my nationality, because that's what people do in the real world.


Hopefully I've covered everything and am eager to read everyone's response! =)"
jxwvf,14,2011-08-29,What is the one decision you regret the most in life?,cheemo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jxwvf/what_is_the_one_decision_you_regret_the_most_in/,"I'll Start. Ouufff. 

A couple of years ago I was employed by a large industrial steelmaking company where I was paid very well and unionized. I had medical, dental and a pension and made more than enough money to pay for my meager existence.

I ended up getting laid off during the economic downturn, and subsequently looked into options for education. The Ontario government had a program that would pay for a couple of years' worth of education while also paying for your living expenses - effectively giving you a free ride through college (if you were laid off). 

I decided to take advantage of that and go back to school to take a computer mapping course. Eventually, I was called back to work shortly before school started and was given the option of either A) quitting my steelmaking job and going to school; or B) NOT going to school and returning to my steelmaking job.

I decided to quit my **safe** job and go back to school, since I didn't like shiftwork at the time and I also sincerely had an interest in computer mapping.

I graduated as an honour student and worked a 1-year internship shortly thereafter. I've been on comparatively low-paying contracts since then and I'm definitely going to have to be laid off in December again, without the option of contract renewal.

I have no backup plan and I live in a city where steelmaking is really the only way to make a living.

I regret every single decision I've made since that day (2.5years ago) and have little to no hope for the future. I'm 31. Anyways, what's your biggest regret?

I spent about $1600 and was very happy with it.  I recently shipped it home (since I couldn't take it with me on the plane home) and insured it with UPS. My parents left it in the box until I arrived home today.  I am now packing to move back to school and figured it would be a good idea to make sure it worked before i went.


Much to my dismay, it refused to work upon powering up.  After opening the case i discovered that the red CPU Led was on.  I carefully removed the heat sink to get to the processor.  I don't know how, but a good number of the pins were completely bent out of shape.  I am planning on filing a claim, but I'm afraid that UPS will simply say that they had no way of verifying my computer was functional before they shipped it (it was on and working about a half hour before it got boxed) or that the current malfunction is not their fault.


Has anybody here had to claim something from UPS.  How bad was it and did you succeed?  Does anybody have any thoughts before i proceed any further?"

What should I be doing as I search for my first programming job?

The Long,
I spent 5 years doing my BS in EE, and graduated in May.  I focused on circuits.  Now that the dust has settled, I know that I want to be a programmer.  But I feel like I seriously lack experience.  I was always in the top of my class for my CS courses and I took all the lower division ones available to me, but *only* lower division.  I have what feels like several years of one year experiences.
I'm normal smart and capable, but a little unfocused.  I really want to work as a programmer and I want to become great at it... I just can't get my foot in the door.  I don't even know which door I should be trying to putting my foot in.  Should I be looking for an internship?  An entry level position?  I took the summer off to travel and be with family and I'm only beginning a concentrated career search now.  I'm worried I'm late to the game and didn't pick the right engineering discipline to study.
What I'm doing now: Project euler and other programming challenges.  Reviewing data structures / algorithms coursework.  Trying to find an open source project to get involved with.
I'm also worried about wasting time on projects that aren't well designed.  I feel like I can make things work, but I wan't to learn how to make things work, be clean, efficient and effective.  Are there medium sized projects that are the holy grail of demonstrating particular design principles?

I could ramble on and on and I have a million questions and concerns, but in the interest of getting this posted I'll leave it to the comments."
jylxc,29,2011-08-29,What should I do about my crazy roommate telling people I have raped her although nothing even resembling sexual contact has happened?,HereComesTheRape,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jylxc/what_should_i_do_about_my_crazy_roommate_telling/,"In June, I moved into a new house closer to campus with four other people. A couple dudes who I have known forever (they shall be known as ""The Two Friends"") and two chicks.  One of the girls I met upon moving in (though she was dating a friend of mine) and we clicked easily and she's just fucking adorable. She shall be known as ""Adorable Roommate"".  The other roommate is a girl who I had met and gotten to know for a short period of time beforehand along with her (now ex-) fiance.  They were both really nice people and I didn't really sense anything strange at the time.  Turns out, she's batshit crazy and I'm kind of stuck with what to do about it. We will just stick with calling her ""Crazy"".

Some back-story to the situation:  I had met Crazy and her fiance through The Two Friends and other mutual buddies of mine over the last school year. We all hit it off, they seemed cool and normal.  The school year was winding down and our leases were all ending close together. We all wanted a house close to campus and we found one and went for it. So at this point, it was The Two Friends, Crazy, her fiance and myself all set to move into a house.  

Before we move in, the fiance decides to go back home for work, and shortly afterwards, Crazy breaks it off with him. So she tells Adorable Roommate that we have an extra spot and she is in.  The table is set for the destruction that follows.

We move-in.  At first, the only three people in the house are the two girls and I because The Two Friends had internships in other states.  So, we settle in.  Everything is all fun and games at first. Getting drunk, meeting the neighbors, and just getting to know each other.  The Adorable Roommate and I become friends quickly and soon we are all seemingly friends.  

Well, turns out Crazy likes to drink herself into a state of mind where everything and anything is acceptable.  She starts sleeping around with MANY of the neighbors and leads them all on. I'm sure she broke some hearts there.  She also likes to break shit when she's drunk. Not just her stuff either. She has zero respect for anyone else's property.

So that's where I started to worry about her.  You're probably thinking, ""So, she gets drunk alot. She's in college.""  That's where my thoughts were for awhile. She just craves the attention so she will cross so many boundaries while drunk to acquire said attention. This all leads up to my first big WTF moment with her.

She comes home plastered one night.  I'm getting ready for bed because I had summer class early in the morning.  I'm in the kitchen, getting something, when she runs in, goes to my room and locks herself in.  I go over to the door and tell her to get out so I can sleep. She unlocks it and comes out and proceeds to tell me how she doesn't want to sleep alone upstairs because she is scared. Now, I have slept in the same bed with Adorable Roommate numerous times and NOTHING sexual has ever happened.  She was freaked out a couple nights so she hopped in the bed with me. No big deal. So, I tell Crazy at this point that she can sleep in the bed with me and she accepts.  She says she'll be right back, goes into her room and closes the door.  I figure she would pass out in her bed, so I retire to my quarters.  She never came back in and that was that.  

Next night, I come home from a friend's place to find the girls next door at a party.  As I'm coming in my front door, Adorable Roommate greets me and we go inside our place. She says she needs to talk to me.  We sit down and she proceeds to explain that Crazy had told her that I have tried numerous times to force myself onto her and she was afraid of me.  I'm a bit drunk and this causes me to get really upset. So, in a stupid rage, I march to the party next door and yell in Crazy's face.  I call her a cunt, which I truly felt she deserved and slammed a door in her face before heading home.  Went to bed, pissed off.  Don't talk to her for a few days.  I find out she's waiting for an apology from me after yelling at her.  So, I man up and just do it. Tell her I'm sorry for yelling at her and that I don't think she should be saying shit to people I don't know about my ""forced sexual encounters"". She says that she never said anything like that to anybody. Whatever, we let it go.

I start talking to some of the neighbors and they only prove that she had been telling them the same thing. The nice thing is that they don't believe her because they have seen her all summer in many drunken states.  So, now I just kind of put up her shit but I do not trust her at all.  Summer ends and The Two Friends move into the house.

Crazy soon gets back with her ex-fiance but still (according to Adorable Roommate) finds time for other boys when drunk.  I have basically stopped acknowledging her at all, only communicating when bills need to be paid. She stopped talking to me. She will, however, tell any new friend I bring around that she is scared of me. One memorable moment involved her lending out my Xbox controller to a frat boy, not telling me about it, telling my new buddy about it and then saying she was afraid I would hit her if I found out. She got it back eventually and never apologized for it. We have a mutual hatred for one another, though I feel mine is justifiable.  I thought that if I stopped communicating with her, this would all blow over and end.  Nope. Wrong.

This past weekend, I bike to our mutual friend's house late in the night.  Crazy and The Two Friends are on his porch. Drinks had been consumed.  I pull up and one of The Two Friends (being his classy self and knowing that I don't like Crazy and she feels the same) shouts ""Hey HereComesTheRape! Crazy wants to suck your dick!""  I laugh it off and jump in the house as quickly as possible.  She proceeds to tell him to never put her name and mine in the same sentence.  Telling everyone on the porch that I had RAPED HER and that I was a fucker. The Classy Roommate proceeds to give her a good yelling about how that's bullshit and I would never do that sort of thing. She leaves and they all come inside and relay what happened on the porch to me.

So this is the point I'm at now.  So far, people have seemed to believe that I haven't done anything like this to anybody (which, for fuck's sake, I will never do).  What I'm afraid of is what she has told her parents, boyfriend, coworkers, etc.  I am the least violent person and this shit scares me.  This is not something to joke about and it could potentially damage my life.  If I talk to her about it, she'll say she never said it or refuse to admit she was wrong.  She may even take it further. I don't know. I'm kind of just hoping that this'll end and that she hasn't told everyone she knows this bullshit. I plan on just waiting it out, but what would you do Reddit? If anyone has any ideas, chime in.  I don't expect much and I doubt it will be seen but any tips or relate-able stories may help.

**Crazy Long Story Short: Crazy Roommate is possibly convinced I raped her and is telling people I know of such activity when nothing even resembling penis on vagina action has occurred. Afraid of who she might tell next and how this may damage my rep. Help?**"

What would be the best way for me to get a job with good career opportunities in a first world country like USA, Canada, Australia or specifically - UK?

I want to move as I would get paid a much higher salary for the same job. This would let me save more money and send to my family as well.

Maybe any specific advice? Looking forward to hearing from people living and working in UK.

Maybe someone has a vacancy which would suit my skill set and education? I'm quick to learn, am ambitious and am willing to take risks.

So I'm applying for this IT Internship. They've asked me to submit a copy of my academic transcript. 

I've been getting good marks on my computer science (all As, except one B+), but the economics papers I did last year I got all C/C+s.
Now this is a bit disapointing, because economics *is* a genuine passion of mine, the reason I've got bad marks, is simply a bad work ethic at the time. (I'd like to think that I'm a bit more onto it now).

Now, I guess I could play it off as, 'Well I must be just good at comp sci'. 
Anyway... if it were to come up why I've got all these Cs, how should I  approach it? Just tell the truth? ('I didn't put enough effort into studying, I found the material interesting, but I did go over the specific details enough'). 

Also, that b+ is for an algorithms paper, algorithms being pretty important to this company I want the internship with. The reason for the b+ is because I bombed the assignment, rather than a lack of understanding algorithms. There is a genuine lesson learned there (time management, get the assignment started straight away). Would it be appropriate, if they ask me about the  b+, to admit it was because I bombed the assignment, and have learnt a valuable leasson?
